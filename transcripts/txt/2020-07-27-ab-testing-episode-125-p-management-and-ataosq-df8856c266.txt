Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show Hey, Brent, how's it going? It's going super Alan. I think So there's so much going on one we're still in the middle of a pandemic to first ever live stream of an a B testing podcast something I think we should do much more often Yeah Thank you Alan and the three for for the spontaneous change There was a suggestion less than 10 minutes ago on you guys or something like some other podcasts live streams and edits And I thought and in that 10 minutes, I thought oh There's an idea. We're gonna try this so yeah, we're doing it and pandemic and oh I was thinking just a minute ago that I like I'd like to think that there are people who discover our podcast and just binge our episodes one after the other and Are going to be sad that we don't have a guest this time We've had guests like the last three to know for for no, I think it's I think it's just fine But because we're live streaming everyone's our guest be our guest be See normally I edit the singing out but now it's all here for free So well, right So is this is this part of it is this now like a new form strategy to to edit out nothing? I mean, thank God. I actually wore clothes today. I I'm not wearing pants. But so here's Also something interesting because we've had guests we haven't had to come up with our agendas for a while and Because we don't have a guest and we're not used to this and we don't have a whiteboard I don't know that we have an agenda. So this should be fun You know, well, yeah, I think I mean the guest thing Certainly reduced the tax on us right? Now we now we were able to be more efficient. We don't have to You know, it's agile, right? As the principal say we we favored communication over Documentation. So there's one, you know, five minutes of documentation work now eliminated I'm lying here a little bit because I did post a couple things in our one of the three slack that I thought we could Talk about today. No. No, I want to talk about I think the same one that you're thinking of It's how to take over the world via the PM org Well, it's not really a PM org, but I should talk about None of this is official and I don't know who at Unity listens to my podcast But I can talk about this abstractly and say that due to some org changes. I Am going to end up. Well, I should probably talk about background So many of you know me as the hardcore software tester Alan Page the person who wrote how we test software at Microsoft You do know me as that but you know I have since moved on from that because unlike some people in the testing world I do not live in the past. I try and live in the present moment and look towards the future That is a passive of a dig as I can make on some folks, but Yeah, oh no the three got it for sure so One thing and let me just say this when I began running Infrastructure in DevOps orgs. I thought wow I have never had so much more control over quality as I do running a DevOps Org and helping the team accelerate the achievement shipable quality. So that's all good and then When I started doing air quote, I can do we're live I can do air quotes Yeah, I can like do show and tell Yeah, like hey, here's a cool book I got no Also, the cool thing is we're gonna have to make a live stream Channel if we keep this because then people could ask us questions during The podcast I should look at the live stream and see if there are questions there Oh my gosh, so many things to do I was in the middle of a story So I DevOps lots control over quality When I joined this role in my current org I began doing program management Well, I can't say I've ever done program management When I took the role when I was talking to my current boss about the role he asked hey, can you do program management and Every time in my career when I've been asked if I can do something Alan, can you code an assembly Alan? Can you do whatever? My answer is always yes. Why yes, I can and then I figure it out as I go There's a sorry, I was gonna do tangent inception, but I'm gonna stop myself so I spent the first chunk of my time Figuring out what not what program management was because I could read things about that but what my flavor on it was and finally after Eight or nine months in the role. I Told my boss I said I don't really know anything about program management. I'm I'm coming clean They said oh no problem, you know how to run systems and you're doing it and you do that well I go. Oh, yes, that's a that's a very lean and modern testing thing I love systems thinking and that's what I do. I figure out how all the pieces fit together. So now I Say I have never had so much control over quality and QA testing s deading for years I have so much control over what we deliver predictability and quality and velocity running both DevOps and Running systems the the program management part of my job So what the change coming up for me is I'm on paper a director of program management We're gonna change that to director of engineering because I do more engineering work than program management But I'm still in charge of running all of our systems and making sure that pieces all fit together of all of our different services and and projects in flight Going back. This is like the longest intro ever People and you can't watch a live stream on one and a half speed. Sorry folks so Short story is with all that context in mind. I Will be adding a few real like I've talked to them and they're kind of textbook program managers to my org not Microsoft program managers, but people who manage programs of projects Help the team as far as I can tell accelerate the achievement of book quality if any of you I don't know if you've read this Brent. Do you I didn't know reason to it's probably not Johanna Rothman who just writes Book after good book after good book wrote a book called agile and lean project management, which I read So I could understand what I was supposed to do and then pick the parts of it that I liked and did those But if I read that book and look at what the program managers who will be working for me are doing it's textbook right there I think they're gonna fill in the gaps that I know I have They're going to learn to do things in the modern testing way But the one of the topics for today and Brent is like what it's Alan ever gonna shut up So I can talk is what I want to have a discussion about is how Our mission remains the same how What advice what ideas etc should we have for? These folks in my org, how do I take the most advantage of them blah blah blah, etc. Okay. I'm done with the preamble Brent What are your thoughts? Well, the first thing I was thinking well actually a Tangent we'll have to figure out how we do Q&A Because the stream does seem to be lagging not by seconds, but like by minutes Again thankful I work close today The fun part also is going to see and and probably nothing here so far is going to be edited But for those that watch this and listen to the podcast they're gonna go Wow the podcast is way better than the live stream Yeah Alright back to the topic at hand like the first thing come on this is a be testing We don't get back to the topic at hand. Just keep going. Oh, okay on that front Have you noticed anything new about my background today? You're in your way you're that's that's not a virtual background you are in your office at Microsoft. I am Dude, you are so gonna get COVID. I am Though much at a point where I don't care as as I think I mentioned It is having it has been having a not a non trivial and extremely negative impact on my mental health and Right now Have you ever gone on taking vacation time? Just so that everyone would leave you alone so that you could get stuff done Nope. Nope. Oh, well I have Actually, I have taken like we had a four-day weekend for July 4th and Because we get every time unity there's a Monday off we get the Friday off also I worked both Friday and Monday for I did I just don't take the days off I'm given in order to catch up on stuff The it's not even on catch up from me So survey here and we'll get back to program management in a second they did a survey at Microsoft Maybe we would they did a survey here at Microsoft and around impact on COVID and turns out 60 percent of the ICS individual contributors that responded to that said oh, yeah They are having a satisfactory work-life balance Forty four percent of the managers said the same thing and I was recently in a one-on-one with with my VP and I'm like, yeah, I am so far from that 44% I can't even see them from where I stand and I invented a turned in that conversation And I said work-life balance. Yeah, that's That's actually relatively easy to manage What is completely out of whack for me is the talk doing balance? Too much talking not enough doing I think the way you put that about four or five Episodes was too much talky not enough Dewey. Oh, yeah, and yeah I am now In a in a in a broader space This is a recent change from my team where we're going into more and more higher scope customer oriented investigations and work and I don't know dude. I Am having meetings with program managers. I have never met before from teams. I didn't even know existed Just right after the other. So anyway, one thing that's very nice is right now temporarily in this entire building I Am the only one here. So I guess I guess you can't catch kovat if but when that second person shows up you're screwed Well, no, so then the other thing that's nice is the fact that I have an office if I were in open space Then I would probably still be at home If I leave my office, I got to put on my Darth Vader mask But other than that I'm safe here Tangent after tangent. I won't talk about program managers distrism reminder, but I'm going to the office on Monday I'm just going for five minutes to grab all my stuff off my desk and then I'm never returning. But yes Yeah, I actually I Actually last week I went home to get stuff to bring to my office No, it's It this is net better. All right, so segue back to your prior topic right your manager said hey, do you know how to manage a Program management. Well, he didn't ask me that he asked me I mean, he just assumes I can manage program managers, but well and the reason why is of course You can Of course, I mean there's also I mean my team is Is glue and is glue? Well, that's I mean it's between Program management and DevOps and my quality coaches and even docks It's like I provide the matrix org for all of the rest of the organization Everybody else works on shipping stuff. I helped them ship stuff safely and successfully Okay Yeah, I was gonna say something snarky about program management, but I've again I was my mind based on my experience with the bastardization of the role of Microsoft be very much welcomed What snarkiness? Yeah. Yeah because what program managers do at Microsoft is different than It's not program management. It's just the it's a name They've given a bunch of people doing random stuff That sometimes is program management very often is not Yeah, no a lot of the times right, it's The snarky comment I was gonna say is is essentially of course you can write a brain dead monkey could manage some program management work Oh, absolutely, right and and I have been compared have compared I have been compared to a brain dead monkey before so that's My target by me on the podcast I'm certain of it So let me let me share with you what I'm about to do and Well, we'll see what happens in terms of the podcast Actually, this is fascinating So one of these buttons right if I hit share screen, I would theoretically be sharing screen and that would show up. Oh Yeah, so I'm over the whole surprise of hey, it's a video cast now Now I'm all about Oh what new toys You you have seen We're primary a podcast. So I don't know how much I should focus on this is special I'm people gonna listen to this on next week when it comes out Who am I kidding everyone to everyone who downloads the podcast is already watching the livecast But someone somewhere is going to listen to the some point going man. I'm missing out Yeah, no, actually we should look at the stats on the podcast download and see and see if we took a hit cuz if everyone's All of our listeners are watching right now. Why would they download it's gonna go from three to two Oddly, there are 13 of the three watching. I think some people are logged in on multiple machines You've seen this right a Million times. Well, what we are actually trying to do now is push this Further I would say right now my organization I don't know if my mouse is coming across but we're somewhere in between data affirmed and data driven Let me just help take a moment here to pause and help the people who are Actually listening to the podcast and not one of the three on the on the lately announced livestream So this is the data maturity model that Brent I think Steve Rowe came up with this, right? No, this was primarily mine, but Steve Rowe did add data affirmed So the four levels of data oblivious when you just you're oblivious to data data affirmed Decisions made mostly by intuition, but you you believe this is where a lot of teams I work with are they only believe the data if it confirms intuition Data driven where decisions are made by intuition and data and then data centric where data analysis is core to most decisions So we've talked about this before on the podcast drink Yeah, but it's a very nice graphic with with Colors and things it's very pretty so now Brent on to your Remembering this is a podcast that happens to have a live stream and not a video cast. Please continue. Yeah That's that's so much of an ask for me. And I know you're aware of that Now we think about what is the well, I'm thinking about what is the problem we're facing here. Okay, so first and foremost, there's a common thing within the the PM org where They won't go after The whales right and this is because they're trying to scale right you have you have In a lot of businesses you have, you know, just a handful of customers that are bringing in The the most of rather revenue and now that most amount of revenue is not something that you can that your business would survive on if You lost everybody else Typically if you pull together a histogram it'll come up and it'll show as a as a head tail curve and this is a situation where it in order to scale the focus on the head and More often than not you'll find that between three to five to seven times The thingies whatever you're measuring with that histogram are in the body and the tail Then in the head so you you you really Cannot ignore that tail But when you have so much manual work as As a requirement for moving needles forward You really can't scale to go in and you know Talk to every one of those customers you have you end up focusing on the head So here's it's around. How do we scale? Okay, the the second problem? that we're we're working through is Essentially confirmation bias or or It's closer to what what is known as the Texas sharpshooter bias Which is essentially we see a behavior with PM's that have an intuition And it might even be a variant of data affirmed, right? They have an intuition and then they go and scan the data for the subset of Of data that proves their intuition Right. Are you familiar with the Texas sharpshooter bias? I am now though. Yes. Yes It's you think of it. They call it that way you think of it as you know A Texan shooting at a barn and he's got his eyes closed and hey, I could do this bang bang bang bang He he shoots shoots at the bar. Okay, and then once all of his ammunition is gone he goes and looks at the barn and then draws the target and And explains to everybody how look how awesome of a shot he is that that behavior is happening Where we're at is trying to figure out how to use the data and Convert it to benefits of customer. I mean that's rather generic I think everyone's trying to do that to some degree Here is a single most interesting problem that I will be facing the next six months Microsoft Azure for example has a lot of And again, just as a quick reminder for everyone. Azure is like AWS or GCP. Anyway, go on Yeah Except Azure continuously threatens to take over AWS and no one actually talks about GCP And as a side note IBM has one as well That just came out of nowhere. Oh, and there's a lot of smaller ones out there too But anyway, I'm I don't want to go into a tangent because I'm unsure where this story is going now. So it's essentially my mission is essentially to guide the PM's on effective usage of data to drive better more valuable backlogs The thing is mine after I got get that rolling and I've already talked with my VP Like one of the things that's gonna happen as a result is it's gonna force a requirement on the engineering teams to be significantly more adaptable And that will probably create a few headaches We in Azure we we have we operate a service We are fairly Agile given our size right there's there's easily 10,000 people working on Azure The the next thing then is going to figure out. Okay, how can I remove the remove or significantly cut back the PM role, right if if PM's get talented at using the data to to evaluate the The next steps and as well as more efficiently evaluate the opportunity of those next steps That's the biggest problem is The other behavior we see is they go talk to a single customer and that customer is Is a member of what you would call the vocal minority? you'll see them executing a huge amount of engineering resources and Then at the end of the day not see the big the big business needles move significantly, right? It's because yeah, you just spent half of your engineering team working on a one-off for three customers anyway, so let me you know that Saturday Night Live skit where Someone's talking about something but not really the thing they think they're talking about So let me do that with you slightly. So that's so the problem is is the Taintedness of Microsoft a little bit here. Let me explain why so we have You know PM is an overloaded term program managers at Microsoft typically are some hybrid combination of typical program management product management and project management and those are all you know project management is Jira shepherding I Call it that because we don't have we just don't have project managers in our org our dev leads are perfectly capable of doing that themselves But we do have product managers who are responsible for Talking to the customer defining the product figured out what we need to do for customers And we could definitely help make them more data driven and then engineering deliver on the the development work for that what program management does in most of the real world and in my org is One is to help the organization to understand progress as a whole This is where you helped me with some stats a while back to help me get a better idea on how to The big insight there was I was trying to track velocity But I had like hundreds of projects and Brent just without thinking about it says well We'll just use the week started as the as the cohort and it's like oh now it's easy I just couldn't figure out where to start. So thank you again for that to figure out what systemic problems the organization is encountering also to make sure and in that making sure that product managers those who talk to the customers to find the product and delivery owners the engineering leadership across the org are working together cohesively and then Once we identify those any problems or obstacles or agile word impediments in the way product and then during our working By or my soon to be had program small program management team Will dive in on on those given that lens of Program management the way I'm running it and I think it's more typical than the than the hybrid role at Microsoft I intend to use my program managers much like I use my quality coaches as agile coaches Helping teams figure out. I have another tangent to go in in there helping teams figure out What is blocking them like like I can't scale enough to attend team retros But I'm hoping my program managers and quality coaches for example can Can attend those retros help people figure out how to find their? Problems and obstacles and impediments and then make sure they have ideas and how to improve those Yeah, actually as I'm thinking about it. I haven't thought about it until right now, but I will Program managers on my team. Of course, I'll probably stick them on some of the larger hairy projects that I I don't get enough time They'll help me scale because often for that part of my role It's just a lot of coaching some tracking some some metrics on things that I care about But mostly a lot of coaching and helping people figure things out That'll help me scale that quite a bit. So I there's gonna be a lot of overlap in Mission between them and the people who are in sort of a quality coach consultant role on my team So that's one way. I think I can use them one quick tangent I'm gonna shut up for a minute is I just did It was stupidly easy to do We had some questions on like how do we get teams to not get better estimates? That's a fool's errand but to understand Actually, it was how do we get teams to do better planning? Because for me, I don't care about the estimate. I care that you actually did the right planning to to reduce risk and I did an experiment where I got six different teams to begin using story points for about six weeks check some data on capacity and plan to work etc and as expected things were better and and the and the feedback from the team on How things went and change was like over the top good But all that happened was because they had to do story points and the team had to agree on assigning a number is they got better at planning and I couldn't say I'm gonna do an experiment where I track how well teams are doing on improving planning because They that would be BS But if I call it story points and then teams are super happy and they feel like they're doing better planning and the work shows that then all of a sudden people are excited about it, but Doing more things like that to help teams become more I don't want to say predictable though to come out of it, but just help them, you know Give them more tools to stumble towards success So anyway that reframing relensing and an example there curious on your thoughts on that So a big portion of what you said to me seems They again an exact match to To what I'm working through Right. I heard you mentioned that you work you're gonna put them on sort of sticky problems right and and and smoke jumping Yeah, I don't have enough coffee to follow that metaphor So so they're gonna go in and put out a fire somewhere. So we have an org of three It's not Azure 10,000 which I could look over at the listeners over here a little ridiculous, right? So 350 engineers and at any one time there are Right now 70 probably go into about 80 different projects in flight at once Some of those are bigger than others and some need a little bit more corralling than I have time to scale to do So I would love to say hey person a it looks like Team be delivering these five projects that all work together could use a little help Making sure they're doing the right planning and delivery I want to understand what their obstacles are see if there's systemic problems we can fix things like that I can put them on projects that I just don't have time. I just don't have the time to scale what to right now so you're the the The org you're inheriting are are they closer to sort of DevOps live site type problems Not a not a feature owners, it's how No, so, of course, I will continue to run DevOps and my and docs and other stuff other matrix orgs but program management again going back to what I want our organization to do is is help the team understand progress find obstacles that to progress and then velocity slash predictability and quality and Find solutions for those over time. Some of those are just measuring things broadly across the org Sometimes it's diving deep into part of the org to help them solve something To help them solve a problem local to a smaller part of the org Okay, but it's about it's about software. It's software delivery everything from services that we update multiple times a day to websites and SDKs So the the reason why I asked that question is because what I didn't hear you say is anything I want the lines of searching for better more valuable opportunities. So what I hear you say is problem searching for problems and putting out the fire which is a bit reactive. Yeah, actually that's a good call out so something you're saying I Think I interrupted before you finish saying what you're saying to say there should be a more proactive Aspect to this role and I think you're right. Please continue. Oh so I'm not gonna load up the slide but Again, but the the message that I try to get across there is that the power Really comes from intuition plus data Unfortunately as with the tech that stands today data AI doesn't have the ability to to tell you Doesn't have the ability to construct game changers. I Can't come up with a great example At the moment there have been times in the past and maybe it'll slowly page load as I tell the story But in times in the past we look at the telemetry and the scenario we targeted and the people who are active users Don't align. I Shift something out and I have a particular customer segment in mind and I see that none of those customer segments are Using the product, but there's this whole other customer segment that is you know, sending positive feedback actively using it and we're like, oh wait a minute we actually we failed at building a solution for segment a but we accidentally succeeded in building a solution for segment B and Actually Given that I I've been in one conversation. We're like, wait a minute. Are we in are we targeting the completely wrong business? In turns out that in that scenario, I guess we were we repivoted and it's thriving Anyway, so yeah, I again, I do think that we're on the the same page So for in a lot of regards, I'm just coming at it from a data science aspect. I Am partnering with throughout Azure. I am partnering with It's probably closer to ten versions of your future role Alan But at times it feels like thousands because they send their ICPMs to me too and we're all on the same page. I That team brings sort of a wealth of history around customer problems customer engagements customer feedback it's the Here's the great way of saying it EQ and IQ Right. How how do we get EQ and IQ? Working together towards common goals and I will say the the program management org is often chock full of EQ Yes Right. The the other problem is they're also often chock full of ego and I'm sure not actually your employees Well again, you need to take your Microsoft skewed lens off there So if you go back to the Weinberg quote eventually, it's always a people problem Horribly paraphrased but that's what they when I wear the program management hat. That's what I do it's about figuring out getting people to reflect and Discover what it is. They're missing and make changes. I So to push back on your pushback I don't think I'm in a bubble when I say it's a common phenomenon in the program management org that Several of those folks believe themselves to be the second coming of Steve Jobs Again, those people exist in product management not in program management Okay. So one of the problems is yeah, no, no Microsoft doesn't have a product management role Right. So you're taking over product management. No, no, that's a whole other org Oh So they work and my job is to make sure that and actually the big biggest part of my job as a program manager Hat is to make sure product and engineering are aligned and in sync So I make sure they work together actually, it's I mean it could be luckily it's not it's just nudging them towards the proper reflection and figuring out the right ways to work together the right ways to recognize dependencies the right way to plan their work another example is I help them and everybody uses the word MVP and Most of them mean different things. I one of the things Manager hat is I help I remind them what an MVP is and what it's for Which in what is it for? It's to learn it's to give every feature you can to to match your competitor because if you don't have all of your competitors features It's not an MVP Well, yeah What is the minimum thing we have to do in order to learn if we're heading in the right direction or not or to Or to validate or invalidate our smallest hypothesis Smallest In general. Yes, the smallest amount of work we have to do to validate or invalidate our hypothesis Well, it's not a matter of work We have to do to learn what we need to learn to pivot or persevere, right? Is it that so and we've talked about the concierge MVP here before so sometimes it's like let's just munch this on the back And see if they like this. Let's put out the button We've we even got as far as like don't even do the button that says coming soon. Just let the button 404 That's less work. If if you put if I if I So I will freely admit I will probably continue to struggle on what is the distinction between a product and a program management Right. We have we call it all program management Here I have no doubt That the that the role is served here at Microsoft. It's just under the same mantra. So However the if if what you Do with your team is say look I'm gonna hold you accountable for the ROI of the engineering org Your job is to provide the most bit bit the the most business value using the least amount of engineering resources as possible and Validated value. That's the print of the MVP like if if you ship something and I don't want to hear a bunch of pretty speeches around This is this is one negative thing that happens at Microsoft every year in May June is Is all the ship announcements come out in? In teams have no, you know managers often have to differentiate on BS things it's It's it's an old-school culture that's still to some degree persists here it is we celebrate shipping not Celebrate moving The needle and that's the big thing that can't you celebrate both? You can and you probably should But they in my mind Should not be weighted anywhere close to the same and we don't load everything because I actually one of the things I do to support My alignment of product and engineering is I have a 30 minute sync meeting each week Where I go over products at risk Talk about what why delays are in place. I offer a little bit of coaching in that meeting It's a way to celebrate our culture of transparency and what's going on And a way to accelerate learning. It's all it's really more about building the culture and celebrating the culture Than a status meeting, but I use it to help create alignment But I also send out notes every week and so at the top of that every week is projects completed So we celebrate completion Weekly and we ship between these are customer impacting things So between five and ten things a week across the org, so we celebrate that frequently But we also celebrate another means moving the needle in a variety of different ways Well, so it's it's an end versus a means right? One of the I have some the last couple of months I have doubled the size of my team and so I have a bunch of Brand new folks never worked at Microsoft before and one of them is is very high level and He's sort of struggling because I think he got hired into a level of a band too high and and I'm like look He put in his connect or his review as part of it. We communicate What we're gonna go after what is our personal mission in the unity context and what is our goal? And he's like, you know what? I am going to be really proud if at the end of the next six months I have built a tool and And It's generating insights like crazy. Okay, and I'm like, okay I get that However, I need you to understand in the band that you're in the business does not care What the care is that you're taking on and and moving the needle Anything else is just the means to an ends if you were a lower level. Yeah, we care because it's part of you Maturing and growing and being part of this Learning how to get things done in this particular culture, but at the band that he's in it's it's Yeah, a lot of those rules go out the window because it's already expected that you know how to do These things You know how to build tools, you know how to to produce software, you know how? I'm trying to get his bar set to the correct place Likewise, like if you take your program management team, like I said if your team it is sort of the The subjective voice of the customer and the qualitative feedback How do we close that loop? The the you need EQ and IQ to really master the scenario Says this man I don't know that there's science that validates what I just said, but it is certainly it is a Set of beliefs that have been baked into my experience. I think this will be a continued I want to move towards a wrap-up here. I think this will be a continued discussion I Again, I want to get it's we're about helping the team manage predictability velocity and quality and We do that by aligning product and engineering and finding problems and solving those So I want to be able to get you out of the Microsoft PM box and think about it's really much more of a agile coach and problem solver role so but I do want to talk about coming up is If we're responsible for delivery Predictability and quality the metrics we track the metrics I track Around that and see what you think about those because I do I did put some metrics in place and they make sense to me And they're not driving the wrong behavior. So I like them What metrics I said I talk about him another time. That's a teaser and speaking of teasers I had a meeting just before I tease this on the one of the three slack Group which you can join the short answer is I was trying to get someone to move someone to my org not a PM different different different role I managed and they I Did not agree they did not get them to agree to move them But I did get them to agree to let the employee make the choice which actually is better in my experience They're gonna they're gonna let the the person choose whether they want to stay in their current org or move to my org So I'm actually Even though we don't I don't have an answer. It's still up in the air. I'm I'm happy with that Outcome Yeah, one of the positive things that has changed here at Microsoft if you remember back in the day There was the no pooching role. Yeah, that was gone before I left you saw a pooching poaching Poaching yeah, and now it's yeah you can and I love and this is a you know, I rank on Microsoft a little bit because and Honestly JW's article on why he left. It's like the the old guard are slowing down Microsoft and And I was working for a lot of the old guard and just drove me freakin baddie towards the end but I love that HR had the kahanas to On their site about management said poaching was okay. They didn't call a poaching. So what happens if all my employees leave and And You're not a manager anymore, are you?
