Brent almost spoke first, but I dove in ahead on the microphone and the cool thing is is that even if you would have spoken first This morning. I would have edited you out Cuz I'm a dick and I'm Brent My Goodness. Oh my goodness. So we are here for episode 66 double sixes double sixes I guess sixes There's a friend of mine This is total non. Well, it's tangential. I'm not gonna call a total non sequitur His friend was in a band and the name of one of their albums was six six eight the neighbor of the beast On the same side of the street Hey So we're gonna say something I was okay cool any exciting adventures in your life this week Not so far week was pretty pretty straightforward. I'm heading to Helsinki today. Oh So not yet Not yet flying to Chicago shy town spending an hour and a half hour and a half there in the lovely airport and then flying from There to Helsinki shy town Chicago. Oh got chai town. Yeah. Yeah, whatever one thing speaking of so you're kicking off your kick-ass day of Travel yeah Travel I'm all packed, you know, I cannot invent self dry self propelling everything fast enough and Personal self propelling everything fast enough or teleportation after we record here I'm heading into the office just long enough to pack up my desk and move it about 20 feet away I'm giving my desk I have a new hire starting on my team The Monday when I get back and I'm giving my desk to him so he can sit closer to the rest of the team I'm sort of it's I'm overhead ish I can be moved anywhere. Yeah, that I completely understand I do the same thing. Hey, I don't know if I've mentioned this and I'm pretty sure I haven't to you even fairly close within a thousand miles proximity to Helsinki is Moscow and I am heading to the Heisenberg testing conference in Moscow this December Okay, are you gonna be hanging out in Helsinki until that time? No, I'm coming back But I forgot I'm giving a talk. I'm gonna give spin on my technical testing Talk as a keynote. I started editing that yesterday because I'm gonna do another spin on it I can't give the same exact same talk twice So I was gonna make some small tweaks because I'm actually giving a talk when I'm in Helsinki and a meetup there There are already like 50 people signed up at the Unity offices should be fun I'm going to do a spin on technical testing talk I gave for the online testing conference. I Started making some tweaks and ended up kind of redoing the whole presentation, which is good for me because it keeps it fresh I like to change it and I'll probably do the same thing for Heisenberg I'm also going to give a talk on the use and abuse of test automation Which is? Obviously related to part of my rant in that I'll make sure there's a good separation between the two for the talk Are you gonna throw in some over the top embellishments? for example The reason why I ask will make the example super clear to you. Anyway, I Think the testing community is is at a loss Now that Whitaker is focused on how AI is gonna change. Oh, that's right Nobody's being mad and with Bach kind of out of the picture to nobody's really out there causing controversy Even when I go try and cause controversy and say things like the role of test automator is going away I are I have people like Richard Bradshaw who make a living doing test automation going. Yeah, you're pretty much, right? Or the role of tests is as information providers is going away. Yeah like I mean You're gonna have to like there's it there's an there is a hole there I think you can fill it but you're gonna have to step up your game on there is Let me think about it may not be the right audience to do that but in my head, I just visit I just visualized a Normal distribution curve. Yeah, and with modern testing sort of being in the Towards the front end of that wave of the curve, but keeping in mind that a lot of testing is Back there right as I as I gesture Yeah, no, no, you're I mean you're you're in the You're in and from Mike's Knowledge of it you're near Outlier on the the normal distribution, but you're not there yet. You're still kind of in the oh, yes is normal But you know high on the normal range got a ways to go. Yeah, get a ways. I mean, it's fine much You just got to be more you know plus plus on drama. All right, I will work on the drama Hey, so I have something that was exciting this week. Oh, hey, Brent. Did you have anything exciting this week? Hey, yes I did. Thank you for asking Alan I'm a sucky co-host My mother-in-law is right You you're like you're like mom look there's a reason why the podcast starts with a Anyway, no There is speaking of Vacuous holes there is now a vacuous hole in one of the bedrooms in my house You mentioned your last in the last episode that you're approaching a Partial empty nest Hey, has it become the man cave yet? No, actually what we're gonna do is my a sewing room No, my my middle son. Mm-hmm Is gonna move into that in terms of like real estate And not the master. That's the best of the non master bedrooms. Ah So someone's getting an upgrade someone's getting an upgrade like yeah, that was an interesting experience It's kind of like when someone leaves like if someone leaves the team Like if it's a good office someone will immediately claim it versus let the new guy have it Yeah, so just a couple of nutshell things that I learned from the experience first and foremost he's going to school in wazoo and From where we're at that is a five and a half hour drive one way Yep, unless it's winter then it's 12. I took Wednesday off and I did that trip in one day there help them unpack back That was extremely unpleasant Yeah, because it's not all for those Even Washingtonians wouldn't know that necessarily but it's not even freeway the whole way a big chunk of the trip It's just on a two-lane road Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean There's a thing I found the most interesting. So my son while he was at at home the last few years he generally liked to spend most of his time in his room and I've been prepping for empty nest syndrome for like the last three years But when the day hits you no matter prep makes a difference Right, so you talked last time like hey, yeah, no, I've I've been since before the kids were born. I've been looking forward to when they leave and You know what when you're in the moment All of that stuff that you hold on to like I can't wait till they leave goes out the window It was it was and I'm generally Generally my EQ is quite low People go. Oh, thank you. Carry much about me and I'm like, yeah What is faking? But with him It was an interesting For me. I'm just I had like a 10-minute speech that I wanted to talk to him as sort of the final words of daddiness and That took me a good 40 minutes to get out I Print I've never known you to be long-winded. No, it wasn't was those long wind I was I kept on choking up Yeah and then going home I go home and It's still instinctive. I'm like, oh Alex's cars not here. I wonder where he is. Oh Anyway, yeah, that was Life changing moments in the gentle, you know minor rites of passage This is my first one through it and I'm like, oh, this is interesting I got a ways to go any prediction on what episode we're on when my soon to be eighth grader goes off to college So four years maybe two hundred two Can you imagine? Yeah. All right Like your youngest My youngest is going into seventh grade. Yeah, I'm actually thinking like when my youngest Goes goes off. We'll probably be done with the podcast cuz you'll have been dead by then probably yeah. Yeah. Yeah love the support Hey, you know, I'm just a couple years away from being all about ageism No, you ageist like I'll be joining your party. Yeah although I have to say and You can't tell on the podcast but I look much younger than Brad Yes, he does. All right. Yeah. Hey Once again, I would like to thank the fine folks at Techwell and star conferences for sponsoring this episode of a B testing That's it Kidding I'm kidding. I'm kidding. So I am excited to say that Star Canada is returning to Toronto. You've been to Toronto. I have not great city. They have a great soccer team I haven't even been to Canada in Probably 20 years. Oh really? Yeah, I gave a few talks at Star Canada in Vancouver Three years ago. It was just a fact. I love they take such good terror speakers. It's a great conference Always a big fan of the star conferences. So returning to downtown Toronto in October Which means that it's playoff time and Toronto FC are definitely making the playoffs Just in case those two coincide I will stop I will stop promoting Toronto FC who are not a sponsor of this podcast and get back To star so Toronto in October is star Canada If you've not yet attended a star conference, there has never been a better time to join the fun And I agree it will have over 50 testing sessions to choose from for a week packed with learning and networking Opportunities and I would like to emphasize that luck always lots of great information in the talks I think the networking and talking to people and spending time Talking to other testers talking to speakers is a huge part of the value you get from a conference conferring Talking is so important There will be keynotes from recognized thought leaders Dorothy Graham Graham who wrote a couple books on test automation been in testing for a while Very knowledgeable Jeffrey Payne Good. I've met Jeffrey a few times Knows a ton about agile. I'll just put it that way. I'm really really really respect him Isabel Evans and Janet Gregory Who is Lisa Christmas co-author on the agile testing books? Also for the first time at Star Canada, there will be a test lab where you can break software air quotes for a good cause In fact, the test lab is partnering with play-doh testing an organization truly making a social impact by helping the Aboriginal people of Canada Become experts in software testing Students from play-doh testing will be attending star Canada on scholarship and will be assisting other attendees while in the test lab That sounds fun. I love if you've been to a conference and they do like a test lab I love diving into this. I love getting an excuse to I'm still trying to figure out what play-doh testing is. Oh, it's right It's play-doh, it's P L A T. Oh, oh It's my annunciation my enunciations, which is failing Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry Sorry Students from play-doh testing will be attending star Canada on scholarship as I mentioned and assisting other attendees while in the test lab If you are thinking about attending star Canada, and why wouldn't you be? 20% off your conference fees when you register with the promo code A B testing all one word by September 15th This is the biggest star discount offer to date 20% off and star was actually our first promo code Yeah, and I will be I'll be doing a few star conferences coming up. I think I'm doing star West Next year. Oh, I'll be at some star conferences star. Oh, it's star West and a star East in 2018 I can't remember which one I'm doing first what the order is, but they're coming up To register or learn more about the full conference program. You can go to their website at Well dot TC whack go star Canada. I will post all of this information In the blog post which I will likely I'll likely edit this podcast on my flight Tonight interesting note remember to bring headphones. Okay? Mental note anyway star Canada a be testing earbuds on the plane. That's excellent. I kind of need I Guaranteed I'm sitting next to a screaming child or a very large person or Someone who hasn't showered in three months Yes, or all one person a screaming baby who hasn't showered Hey, so one of the things before you go too much further, right? So as we've talked about before We don't view ourselves as a professional podcast necessarily. I think we are ebbing on Professionalism, I don't know what you're talking about anyway continue. Okay, so we're half of this room We're an ebbing the a half one half may be more professional than the other but on the sponsors We would not be sponsoring them on the show if if it's not if it was something we didn't agree with Absolutely. We are we are not Anyway shape or form at a point where we're doing this For the money we're doing this because we're old geezers and we like to talk and we want to share absolutely and the star conferences They are keeping pace. I think well Certainly better than other conferences. I'm a perhaps There's one other that I could think of that that is on the same line, but because this one's sponsored by Techwell I'm not gonna mention that one, but if you're an avid listener to this podcast because you you value what we're saying because you think we're Taking a different point of view that isn't Out there. I'm gonna tell you if you want to get more information on this that is aligned with the content of what we talk about here Consider star I agree with everything Brent said which is weird Yeah, let's move on before you think too much about it Yeah, I do want to reemphasize We get spot as you can tell being a listener we get people asking if they can sponsor our show for a Nominal fee and I'm always happy to do that if the product is something That I think that I would want to use myself or I have used myself or something I believe our listeners or I think it's it's yeah, it's in line with like yeah This is this is I think beneficial happy to happy to pass on some savings opportunities. Yep Okay, so on with the Kanban board over here the Prioritized list and speaking of Kanban one thing I wanted to mention is For many many years. I've used personal Kanban to sort of track my work and I and I merge it It's it's work stuff. It's personal stuff everything from pay the bills to do these tasks Interestingly, I stopped using personal Kanban about a year ago quite a while And I did it because I had read JD Myers book. I don't know if you read his book call getting results the agile way and I was ready I'm always ready to experiment and try something new and he and the idea is you list out. I'm putting this I apologize JD for Totally paraphrasing your concepts down to nothing, but it's a good book three goals for the month That you set at the beginning of the month three goals for the week You set on Monday morning or Sunday night and then three goals every day. I did that for a while and What happened with that is I came I went in and out of it There's some good things I liked and I'll come back to that in a minute I used it for quite a while, but it ended up being more like a to-do list and A to-do list in my experience ends up being stuff you never do So I just I just did what needed to be done and didn't really track things that closely I still liked doing the three goals for the month. I always did that I Will probably continue to still do that But the reason I bring it up is I went back to personal Kanban two weeks ago but I'm gonna go back and give this a try and It's like coming back to a long-lost friend my my productivity and and throughput are just Thought that they were awful before but definitely accelerated It's just it's a it's a I just wanted to give a shout out to it for those that haven't Or haven't thought about doing it as a way to track the items that you work on but it's it's for me, I realized it definitely works and it's just something that it's it it's a way for me to get things done Oh Jim Benson. Yeah, Jim Benson wrote a book on personal Kanban. I got to go to a seminar. He gave once which was excellent and anyway, just want to give a shout out to the concept because it's No advertisement here But if but it's sort of this along the same lines of it's something I believe in something I think it would be beneficial beneficial to a B testing listeners So I wanted to give it a few moments to share now Brent's making a face or he's I'm making himself I'm making a face. Tell me why you're making a face. Mr. Brent getting things done the agile way and that's the implementation well WTF so I again I squished an entire book which is pretty good and filled with some great anecdotes and stories down to a nutshell It's an alternate prioritization scheme I do and again one thing I will you want to know when I learned that party prioritization scheme kindergarten, no, I once attended a seminar put on by Franklin Covey whose job was to sell taskbooks and This particular seminar was how to align the tasks of Microsoft Project Oh my like God, I'm like Wow, I wish you had talked to me about before you started executing that model and abandoning personal count-bound because I would have Mocked your waterfall. What what happened was and actually it worked at the task level It doesn't work for me. It's worked when I needed sort of meta level goals like I need to Something that I take care of this requires multiple things for me to do the personal bond addresses that I know personal compound is much better and so I Basically, I just fell away. I used it for I used personal compound for a long long time and I just for some reason I read this book wanted to try something new and I tried it for a while and it was okay But not good enough. I wanted to keep on using it So I fell into nothing for a while and then just recently came back to personal compound. So that's kind of my I don't know about how you feel about this. Like you mentioned you can't do the same presentation twice, right? I will say that my view the agile community isn't innovating fast enough for me at this moment in time because If I'm executing the same model over and over and over and over and over and over and over even though it's the in My view the best model there is I get bored with it And I'm like and this is why this is why I tried the new system because this is exactly why I don't give the same Presentation twice as I want to even if I give it the second time my attempt is to make it better and it's worse Now well, I changed it at least I tried something new Same thing here. I tried something new. I always want to tweak What I'm doing what I'm building Anything I want to tweak and see if I can make it better See if I can make it more interesting see if I can learn more from it So what I've done When I first learned personal Kanban, I I ran with it for a very long time and then I went and did the safe training and then I took some concepts from safe and tweaked how I did my personal Kanban, but now I'm at a point where There's no difference between my team board and my board. I just put it all on the one Right in as you know, I've I've done I still have to document this one day, but I've I've Made my own version of An agile process that in my view is a is It's probably context sensitive, but it's very effective for the world I live in and it takes bits and pieces from these different models But it's now on the same. It's all on the same board So Let's go into tangent bill a bit. Okay, did a little theme song for that Recently had a discussion and a Something I want to try discussion with one of my team members it led to something I want to try is I am in charge of More teams than I can count More features than I can count more feature teams and I can't count very high, but it's more than I'll fit on my fingers each has their own product backlog and of course because My team members are embedded on feature teams. Their work items are are part of the feature team boards I Was thinking it would be cool. I want to start And I'll get into this tangent in a minute I want to start finding ways for a few more cross team sort of projects and more sharing One of the things I think I'm going to do and actually one of the things I'm going to do is find a way to tag items effect I'm acting like this is difficult. I'm going to tag the The quality the QA items on the individual boards so that I can view a master board of all the anyway Actually, anyone can view a master board of all the QA items across the organization. Okay Hoping that if people view that they might inspire like oh, this is kind of like this We should talk about this as people are working on some more cross functional tools across team tools find some ways to connect on those and this leads into my team needs some My organization services organization needs a manager who can actually complete a sentence for one Definitely leadership to back to number one As I show my favorite finger Yep My team the organization needs some There's some tools we need across the services organization Okay What the engine team at unity add has is something they called a toolsmith org small number of people that kind of old miss Toolsmiths Oh Smith's okay who work on infrastructure and tools for the testing org Ideally, I would have a few people in the services org dedicated to that I don't have any head count for that I can start peeling some people toward that over the long term or I could do kind of what I did when I was on the Xbox team Where I had no one reporting to me but was in charge of building all of the Organizing the building of all of the testing tools for Xbox Okay, and I'm hoping that in building some visibility Towards what we need across the org that I can start building some cross Team hey, I don't want to call them a virtual team because you know, I'm allergic to that term cross team Initiatives to build some of those things and get people working together It's not open source, but generally the term I use under this is shared source Yeah, and shared initiative. This is this is my world of Warcraft guide to project management I will say that once you break the boundary and Between the organizations and you get people volunteering To do that shift magic really starts to happen. Yeah, and but it's so hard to get them to do that. I This is where I live. I I'm a as you know, I'm a more of a community builder than a manager I am confident and excited more excited than confident that I can get this to happen. I think I have never Never worked with the team more eager to learn and try new things Than this organization at Unity. So I'm it frightens me sometimes when I plant seeds and they grow so fast if I were in your shoes With what I understand of what you What powers you have in versus what you don't one of the things that I may consider is To bootstrap this bootstrap this along with sort of a long-term strategy, which you'll it's context sensitive I don't have enough information to guide you on it offer a one-off bonus program where Successfully completing and checking in work that belongs to another team You're gonna artificially reward that with a one-off sort of yeah, I do want to There is the idea of the spot bonus that I want to I want to be able to yes, I I'm gonna figure out a way to make that happen. Yeah, and The great thing is is unlike Microsoft that would be a pipe dream and ever get to do actually when I there's something I think I want to make happen It does it's not like automatically it happens But usually we can find a way there were times in my career where I had the ability to influence it But now that I'm in a front manager role the incentives have to be more Daniel pink related and not necessarily money Yeah, and ideally which are more powerful as we as we know, but they're harder to you can do getting it across Definitely do both Don't do money and not Have not and not praise you have to do both. Hey speaking of praising. Yeah, let's go on to the next topic. Oh Yeah, which has very little to do with praising In fact maybe the opposite yeah, so you wrote the item down I'll let you set this up and then I'll make a face and tear it apart Yeah, so it's it's I've agreed with you enough for one day. Just so you know Sorry Sorry, yeah, my How many times can Alan interrupt there is so at Microsoft we're at the we're out of the review process and This topic is something that Alan and I have been sort of talking about Outside of the podcast and given our last theme was really around management and leadership our last podcast. Yep. I remember I was there. Yep one of the things I realized that we really didn't talk about in terms of Management philosophy and One of the worst the most unpleasant things that managers have to do and that is communicating bad messages Now I'll start off basically saying at this one of the things that's a full philosophical foundation for me is Surprises and adjectives are criminal Surprise what do you mean by adjectives because I've said the first statement before but Adjectives I know what an adjective is but give me an example in the situation This person was awesome this person sucked The the well those are judgments which are also bad but adjectives best worst Adjectives are criminal when it comes to But it certainly when it comes to communicating bad message messages in my humble opinion. Yeah, and Good, I get that and the that first part of it is the most important. So a bad message should never be a surprise for sure, it's We had And I'll bring us up a couple times because I've had even as a non manager I took a lot of management training at Microsoft Just because I was in a leadership position because that's to go because I was in engineering excellence as part of what I did So I've had a few decades of different sorts of management training I had a leadership training at unity took two days and Of course knowing you knowing me I walked in very skeptical Then ah, yeah, it was the best Management training I've ever had Nice and not to say it was awesome from end to end. There are a few points where I did ask the BTF but it was great because I could ask the BTF and and Just unity culture of transparency and respect if I do it. I said I don't get how this it was great Yeah, great. Great. Um, and they there was a couple things that One of the bits of feedback I gave they asked us to sort of invent like not invent but think of some critical feedback you need to give someone in your team and Frame it in this framework, which I may talk about in a little bit if relevant and I did it But I said I told him this feels contrived because by the time The conversation that it would never get this far to this I would have mentioned this to them. We would have had discussions about this five ten times before we had this Air-quote fierce feedback conversation Okay, so which goes into the surprise it's like brit When you interrupt me on the podcast It causes me to feel blah blah blah or and and this little lot to happen And so what's up? So what should we what's your point? What should we do about it? Ignore your feedback and versus just ignoring him for having going bread. I hate you. I quit You want to bring up that critical feedback Wait, so as soon as you need it the the punch line to this is is To then shift to Socratic and say what should we do about it? No, I'm I'm uh Giving a very bad example of giving you to the point and critical feedback before it escalates to a point where it's a it's uh a job ending or a review diving feedback. Yes and As you know, and this is one of my beefs at Microsoft is I've had Almost every single one of my managers only gave me feedback during reviews Especially my last one. I had one manager who I was Maybe two months into a new job at Microsoft and I asked him. Hey, how am I doing? His response was? Oh, wow. I didn't know you're gonna put me on the spot Um Yeah, I know that one too and often you talk about review season while i'm on a little bit of a soapbox and rant Yep, as you know many Microsoft managers will customize your feedback based on How much of a raise or not raise they're able to give you well. Yeah, there's I mean We got to quote unquote own the message Yeah but the thing is is that and just going back to the original point is if you I'm My blood's boiling a little bit while I try and talk about this is that you have to give people that feedback All the time. So you I you have one-on-ones with your team frequently as do I as do most good managers That can't just be a status report meaning I Sometimes it is I try to explicitly ban I got I have a daily stand-up. I have a weekly retrospective um If i'm not aware of the status, there's something else really wrong Yeah, it's a little different for me. Well, i'll take a little bit of status just because i'm so spread out And it's mainly as a way for me to draw out ways that I can help help you You as my employee. Yeah So i'll say well, tell me more about that. Is that is there is that going as well as it could or something? I can do that those sorts of conversations. I think if I were in your role There's one technique an old manager of mine taught me if I were in your role I would for sure do this Uh, because you're you're trying to find those things where hey I'm a manager. I have resources Um, I know stuff I'm talking to your peers Let me help you and kind of goes to what I was talking about last time about My perspective that i'm a management service provider and not a manager Um, but the the technique is very simple I tell tell my reports Look, I don't care if you do it even literally two minutes before the meeting But I want you to send me an agenda for our 101 Now this sounds super managerial But what happens when you send the agenda and you also say I don't give a rat's ass about status reports It forces them to think through What the hell they need you for? Yeah, and I do that for yeah I don't do that consistently But for what I've found is when I find that that doesn't come out naturally in a one-on-one I begin to ask for that or it sort of comes out organically for having like these If we're not having good conversations, I definitely fall to that but I should do that for everyone on the team Send me send me one to one to n number of things you want to talk about Because I like then framing that is and it helps me figure out how I can help you I specifically frame it as look i'm your msp We're meeting There there's some value you're hoping to to get from me from your time invested. Mm-hmm Think about it about what? That might be Got it, right because so often You have these one-on-ones and it ends up being a defensive conversation along the lines of Why something hasn't been done? Right, and i'm like, I don't want to talk about that in one of ones Right, except for where actually I take that back except for where that does That is related to that individual's career growth Like as an example, I run a data science team, but as they've blogged about It's not a specialist team I have people who are comfortable with some things and they can integrate but they're developers that report to me And for the time period that we've been in Up until now that's great But it's not going to help them in the next couple of years And so i'm having conversations around. Okay. How do you go this even further? But i'm communicating bad messages Hey, someone stepped over the line Or it's just not working out. You're now at the 11th 11th time having the same conversation And you're realizing it's not a fit and you're firing them Or it's a review process and whatever your company's review process is Most people look at the numbers and that is ultimately the review they care about and How how do you communicate those things? now That that particular is where I think adjectives suck Yeah, and my my absolute least favorite one Oh, yeah, you're getting this because you weren't visible enough. Oh my god that adjective. I just these are my But there is a better way of doing it instead of adjectives for example communicate actions uh One of the things that I have found Extremely helpful in this one. I've actually so back in the day when you remember when we had these labels at microsoft Like underperform limited Yeah, that thing I've I've actually communicated a ul message and had the guy thank me afterwards Yeah I have any manager Managers don't like Giving harsh feedback. It's a difficult thing for anyone to do But it's it's if you need to be a machine build need to be able to do it I fired someone once I had to let someone go they weren't a fit and they thanked me as well um But the reason was surprising the reason was immediately. Thank you. Yes It was not a surprise. Oh, I see because we when there's a performance problem. You need to bring it up immediately and talk about the impact it's causing and then have Continued conversations about that if things aren't improving and when it got to the point it was not Just like surprises or criminal the firing was not a surprise He and I both knew it wasn't a fit uh, I said it's not about you personally just not it's not working out and He thanked me in in that that entire 15 minute conversation where I Was prepared for him to be defensive and and in my head i'm thinking now is not the time to be defensive We've talked about you know, we've talked about this before but it was Again, because I had had multiple conversations leading up to it the letting the person go Was pleasant on both sides. I was I was uh proud of the way he acted and And happy for both of it both of us. I just kind of worked out that way He will be successful and probably is successful in some other position now, but at the time uh, it just again, it worked out like it's supposed to I one of the things that I have So first and foremost it has actually been a very long time Since i've actually had to take the step of actually firing somebody because a microsoft is moving to another team, right? No, I don't Sorry dig dig Well, actually so in some cases I will if it's a if it's purely a fit problem, right for sure, right? Um, there's I I had to deal with that just in the last couple of years Where what they like to do and what they did well Was not something My organization was willing to pay them to do it I also believe this goes a little bit what talked about last time I'll let you get back on topic is our job as a manager is to find the net always be looking for the next best role for all of our employees and Ideally that role is something on our teams because if they're especially they're a top performer, but sometimes it's not No Sometimes that next big role i'm moving one of the people on my team at unity to a different team outside of services because that's Where their passions are where they're uh where they have a lot of excellence both demonstrated and past experience So it's this just the right thing to do. I I I completely agree. There's an emotional argument to that There's a there's a logical argument to as well for um, for example Uh, so I generally take the the more logical argument, right? I don't view firing as a negative thing Particularly with the strategy that I do where I I find surprises criminal Right. I well in advance like i'm pretty good at seeing at this point in time I'm pretty good at seeing patterns and seeing the future particular individuals and see when They're on a path that's going to diverge and and sort of the timeline when it's going to be Negative for them. Yeah And get them ahead and get them starting to act And I try to stay in the coaching realm as much as possible like the last individual I talked Was just in the last couple of years. I said look if if there isn't a change You're not going to be talking to coach brent anymore. You're going to be talking to manager brent And manager brent Has to worry about his business and has to worry about how his resources are applied And there are very specific things that he has to do when things are out of alignment So what and we don't want to have a conversation with manager brent So let's figure out how we solve this while it's still coach brent So what techniques or frameworks do you have for giving if any? For or maybe it's contextual for giving that critical feedback when needed. It's always contextual but there is I will say that if there is secret sauce to this is Your feedback cannot contain adjectives. They must instead contain actions So I think of it as a retrospective And then I go So people want to know how do they get in this space? Okay, so yeah, you're going to have to cover some sort of contextual You know what lettuce here? But what I then do in in my conversation is i'll go Hey You know looking back on this now It's very clear to me That if you had taken these sets of actions instead of the ones that you took That would have led you to a much better place And moving forward it is critical That you continue to take these type of actions, but that's not the stuff I love to do It's an often often thing because another thing that that happens Is people like but i'm awesome Why I why aren't I being rewarded for being awesome? and This a lot of times employees don't really understand this Fitness concept it sounds like management speak I'm like look I'll give you i'll give you an example. Uh, I had a guy A few years back was just a talented Uh build engineer one of the best But I was in an organization that gave a rat's ass And and i'm like it's so you know going back to what I talked about last time that's that That um venn diagram what you do Well what you like to do and what you can get paid to do and I said look Yeah, you know what what you're doing is valuable But it's never going to it's never going to be in this team and the problems that we have It's never going to stack high invaluable results It's just not I want to be clear on one thing which is that when you give the critical fee, it's not always about firing someone No, it's about more often than not. It's just about course corrections So i'm fully it's always about course. I I mentioned in the last podcast. It's more relevant now This book by I think it's kim scott I forget her name a book called radical candor which I read and now i'm rereading it's Some of it's Actually, it's it's very good. It's one of the best management books i've read and i'm not sure I but i'm not sure why yet I'm trying to figure that out It's maybe like when I sometimes I read sometimes I read a book it connects things I believe in and adds some more Background to them, but it's how to give that how Some of it it's like tying Some good frameworks for giving feedback in radical candor. It reminds me a little bit of the this Model we call fierce feedback at unity, which is uh Sort of what's the way I remember it is what so what now what what's next? And they get about the action. So I tell you you did this and it caused this action and then We discussed before I even tell i'm not going to going to tell you right away If I have ideas how to do that, i'm gonna say brent when you do this, it causes this problem And then i'm gonna let you talk I'm gonna let you lead the conversation from there. So yeah, maybe you realize it. Maybe you don't maybe have an excuse Maybe you don't but we're gonna have a discussion about it for a while and then when We feel like that discussion important thing on that one Actually is that you're discussing the employee's behavior Not the employee right when you do this what it causes when you don't get your work done on time It slows down the whole team from getting this getting this the this deliverable done every human being is awesome but in this in in the environmental context Their behaviors in one environment Maybe a winning success equation and but in another environment the exact opposite Yeah a big difference I know of for example between google and microsoft There's google's in the news a lot and and they're being framed as sort of a utopian Technology company and i'm like, yeah, you know what that's probably hyperbole, but I can see where they're coming from The google model sort of rewards similar thinking convergence consensus The microsoft model is significantly more competitive Definitely. No your idea is stupid. It's built around that it's it's too definitely to a fault. Yeah Well, I think they're both Dysfunctional to some degree. Let me finish with what so what now what what's next and tie that back to radical candor and maybe reasons It's overlapping. So you have this discussion about the behavior And then at some point you go so and this could be a five minute conversation could be an hour conversation uh So what do we do about it? And maybe maybe you have some ideas become some together. Okay, then what are the next steps? Maybe it's to sync in a week. Maybe it's to Let me give you an example. I'm gonna try this a radical candor and give an example One of the things you want to do in feedback is give feedback As close to the moment that it happened than necessary like the microsoft model is in the review When you're getting your crappy performance number you go. Yeah back in january you were a dick in that meeting And that really affected really affected the vp's view of you. So you're getting a poor score Well, yeah The other problem with that is of course a lot of the times The consequences aren't readily apparent. Yeah, so instead Uh, I can apply that and this is very much the radical candor model is give that feedback in the moment Say brent when you interrupt like after a meeting we walk out of hey brent when you interrupt in a meeting it Makes people feel like you don't care about what they have to say And this is all like in a two-minute conversation so Next time you're in a meeting and you have and maybe we can Depends on the people and context we can figure out a plan for that But in that moment give that and again, these are contrived examples But the moment you observe a behavior or an action that you want to correct give that correction and just Hopefully you've built a culture of trust this actually ties to the pat lynchioni work on trust Yep So I want to have that culture of trust and respect So that I can just give you that feedback and you don't take it personally go. We have good feedback and I don't have to put Pretty flowery words around it that that Lead you they don't the problem with some of these things like a lot of times managers Um will will do oh, yeah. No, I love you, but uh, my manager hates your guts. So, you know own the message, right? Um, no, but the thing is I I actually agree with that portion of owning the message because what you're saying You're telling your employee. Oh by the way you got victimized But it's okay. I did too Great. You know what? I don't want to be victimized. Give me some feedback that allows me to learn from my mistakes and and Gets me puts me in control of my own destiny and prevent this from happening again That's right the primary reason why I hate adjectives because when when when You are told that you are awesome Or you are told that you are that you suck You you're not being communicated What behaviors you have that are being rewarded or penalized? Absolutely. So you're just as in the dark except you either have more or less money And you don't always and this is a microsoft thing too, but uh, don't always tie feedback to rewards You think they don't always say no don't i'm i'm telling you don't Microsoft and you just in your example, you just said you do you just tied it to money again And it's it's reviewed season. So it's it's inevitable but Yeah, unfortunately microsoft's not Very good at that yet. It's still part of our life blood in our culture. Yeah, and right many many episodes ago. We talked about our ways to fix that but I don't care anymore No, no, so um an old manager of mine who has left Microsoft and gone to another big company In seattle that is not amazon. I like their review model what they do everybody Gets their bonus. There's no competing for bonus And then the manager has discretionary spot bonus money That he can reward throughout the entire year As that was kick ass. Here's a couple thousand so you have people On a continuous basis trying to deliver awesome versus Spend a whole year strategizing around. Okay. Yeah, this is how i'm gonna tear alan down to make sure and again microsoft is very competitive and a very Nepotistic the part. Is that can make that a word? Uh environment where if you Suck up to your manager you will be rewarded You can be yeah, that's right. You can be rewarded. Yeah in radical candor Talks about the google review promotion model where it's not the manager's choice at all to promote someone The manager can be involved of course, but you put together a packet. It's called a I forget what it's called a They call it a packet. Uh, it's a portfolio of your work Which is reviewed by? A peer group a level above the level you want to go to yep And they go yay nay and if that happens great if not, they get some feedback there and it's And I had heard about it all of the people that they're evaluating or none or any place in between Yeah, and so the quality bar I had heard about it before but reading the book reminded me of what a fair model that is It's fairer than what we're used to But there is an update I don't have all of the details But much like anything else that's written word And google contains smart people just like microsoft does It is not an ungameable system Every system is gameable. So with enough time and enough Um pattern matching Yeah, you could write your stack of things um that fulfills what is uh Unwritten but known criteria sure and back in the day like in 15 years ago if microsoft had done this I can guarantee you Like wrote test harness Would have been on the list in test. Yeah, one of the things uh, and i'm surprised Actually, if this existed 15 years ago the thing that you did where you typified everybody and created the test segments That would have been used for so much evil for sure for sure. And I think that I lost track of how many reviews this was microsoft had while I was there but Pretty much they last until they've been gamified by too many people and then they go to a new model Yeah, and my favorite part about how microsoft does it is they go to they go to the new model Literally two weeks after you've written the review You know A lot of times the whole surprise thing isn't something that uh, my company in my humble opinion Sort of agrees with up and down the stack and i'm pretty certain that actually executives would but it's um, it's it's Legal that's that that's putting these sort of constraints on there one of the ways to work through this I'll just go through it quickly. We'll talk about this in terms of like project but a lot of um, so safe has a model Alan was telling me earlier that my amazon has the model that before you start doing a chunk of work Write the press release announcing the completion of that work. It's an extension of bdd. Yeah, um In my team we we go through this we have it's acceptance criteria We have a process we call the definition of done and i'm like it's not done until A customer can do these four things. Yep. I I don't care how it's implemented similar thing It it it works in a in a nutshell. So if in the connect Or what we what micro connect is the microsoft review the name of the microsoft review process if in the review So if you have some of these It would work positive and negative It works better if you have an official review process that's frequent Because things in today's world change so fast But you can do the same thing I could say alan You know what? We're gonna you're gonna be writing another connect in a few months What I would like you to do After we're done with this one is I want you to go write that connect I want you to write up right now. Yeah What you did? in the next three months Yep, I get it that process As long as that person's continuously rereading it or revising it or rethinking it right, um That's going to help them Stay on the path towards the goal So it reminds me one of the things that when I was doing When I was doing mentoring at microsoft, one of the things that always have my serious mentees do is ones are like Obsessed with career growth or interested in career growth or wanted to do some sort of transformation Is I said write a paragraph? that That is written that someone is writing about you six months from now. How would they describe you? How is someone describing you six months from now? And I make him write that paragraph and that would be the framework of what we talked about Over the next n number of sessions. It's like, how are you moving toward that? How are you becoming? I want to be an accomplished author. Well, how much are you writing? So I I I That model is super helpful. Uh, I I love it It reminds me of my favorite lewis carroll quote if you don't know where you're going any road will get you there and a lot of the times with the mentees is They don't know where they're going And so you spend time and you say you you you get them to come up with their own way Right the the challenge is yeah, sure. I have a lot of experience. I could sit down I'm not your manager, but I could easily tell you where to go But that's not what's helpful what's helpful is for you to learn how to control your own destiny And how to align it with your business and your managers and all of those things if you don't Employees may not think about where they want to go Other than i'm just going to come to work every day and show up and do my thing Right, but then those are the people who go. Well, wait a minute. I'm awesome. How come I didn't get a good review Well, you know you decided to to track your career Uh, you know very similar to a butterfly flying at the whims of the wind Sometimes the wind goes in a positive direction and sometimes the wind goes straight into the volcano right if you If you don't like that model Quit being a butterfly. So one of the things this is probably waxing political now, but one of the things I grew up with a father that got paralyzed in the vietnam war Half of his body paralyzed he went in right handed came out left handed he does not agree with the ada and a lot of these sort of mentalities around protecting The disabled he his philosophy is much more along the lines of yep. You got delta crappy hand of cards It doesn't change what you need to do in terms of play that hand the best that you can always so us as humans We don't have any Control over whether or not we get victimized but being a victim is a choice Absolutely, and some people are happier with that and that's fine. That's a good choice if that makes you happy if it makes you feel better Having this as a label. That's fine. I'm not judging on that but but Those choices have consequences And a lot of times you can't have the cake and eat it too Anyway, I think we can end now. All right. Hey, I am Alan and i'm brent. We'll see you next time
