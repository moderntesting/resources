test the modern testing podcast join your hosts Alan and Brent I am mindless agile robot I must iterate as we talk about software engineering software quality leadership and whatever else comes to mind now on with the show hey Brent hey Alan how is it going super happy holidays to the three we are for the first time ever recording a podcast at Unity's office in Bellevue Washington if we sound like we're in a different place that's why and Brent is gonna take a commemorative photo of this event and now it is done and now that part is probably my fault you can fix that while I talk this is episode number 95 I guess we should catch up a little bit kind of keep the the pattern to a minimum if we can although we are incapable of that and then see if we can get into it sound good Brent it does anything new and exciting I should know about I do neither new nor exciting okay then yeah so let's get going so let's start with some reflections on 2018 do you have any of those Brent Brent is frantically staring at his phone I'm not sure if he is downloading inappropriate material or if he is just look actually looking for something to do is that your best two guesses yeah right trap and fire oh yeah favorite book you read in 2018 tensor flow using Python excellent excellent choice Wow favorite movie the one I watched the most often I would go with favorite and that would have to be Guardians of the Galaxy volume two a good choice a good choice which I think I actually liked better than Avengers infinity war I also loved I also loved I went and I saw the new spider-man movie this weekend very good my son and I are my middle son has been on me he is expecting to see that dad very soon is it's worth it excellent favorite a B testing podcast episodes of 2018 I have two on that one 77 what do we do in 77 we actually wrote down the principles oh is that that we've we've vetted though so 20 in reflection 2018 was the year of the modern testing principles because we came from sort of a outline of like how about these dude they're not quite right to vetting and editing and also standing our ground in a few places with the three until we came up with what we thought would continue to evolve but they've been locked solid for almost a year now yeah March there is a strong chance I was a strong chance that episode 100 might be the anniversary of the development of maybe I thought I showed the modern testing principles briefly at test bash in 2018 which is one of my highlights of 2018 which was February March and the end of February beginning in March they might have been done a little earlier than that we might have the pod I don't know what we'll figure it out we're not too good on 77 remembering things yep my other favorite episode is 86 and that's the one where we do the drill down and on the customer principle oh yeah which was when we came up with these I was surprised that that one ended up being controversial and we've talked about the controversy around that before drink so yeah that was a good drill down and people that don't get it should listen that listen to that episode and join the slack channel because the conversation still continues one of the three dot slack comm you can go to modern testing org and find a link there to sign yourself up auto magically I can't think of a good podcast a good favorite podcast of mine for the last year to answer my own question I already answered the movie question favorite book I read not as cool as TensorFlow with Python but I read what was the name of the book about the startup run by the really bad CEO in Silicon Valley they're they're a blood testing company they're trying to make hardware to test blood and they were cutting all kinds of corners doing all kinds of cheating reminded me of when I used to work at midi soft back in the early 90s bad blood it's called bad blood I thought it was pretty cool I felt like hey as bad as I thought it was when my CFO told me to start changing time on our network service so we get a few more sales into each quarter that was nothing that was like eating cotton candy compared to the stuff going on at the company whose name I can't remember who actually did go out of business finally just this year CEO was fired years back but there is a movie being made it was a great year for Marvel movies also a sad year in losing Stan Lee I grew up with Marvel Comics so I I see I love that the Marvel Universe is getting so much love in the cinema did you know there's a my kids are excited my daughter especially who just turned 13 is excited to go see Deadpool Deadpool 2 because there's a PG version coming out I'm kind of interested to seeing how much gets edited and what the heck happens why would you know it'd be that's funny because I could see Deadpool and I could see Reynolds coming out as Deadpool and then making some snarky jokes about bleeding the teenagers dry first off we didn't actually talk about Deadpool I have to say that I was disappointed with Deadpool really yeah I found it nowhere near as as funny although Deadpool forming up X Factor and then slowly but surely slaughtering them off accidentally that was amusing that was totally amazing and the invisible guy did you the invisible guy that you never do was really there until he died did you see who it was when he gets electrocuted you briefly see his face no it's Brad Pitt oh anyway one thing as I mentioned we do predictions every year so we should take some time and talk about our predictions from last year no one of the things we had a long conversation last year around which episode number this would be and it's funny because I in the conversation I was all about I think it's gonna be I did some math I think we'll do it be productive do this many last year probably around 95 and then so I said that in the conversation I relistened to the podcast one of the few times I've listened to a podcast other than editing and then in the then Brett says I think it'll be episode 90 and I said 92 so I'm closer but without going over I'm closer without going over but we had a fairly productive year we did how many episodes is that 23 23 episodes pretty good yeah that's almost ones are one every two weeks almost yeah we we we did between between travel and life we did pretty well all right well we'll get back to maybe a prediction around that later in the episode I also threw out a prediction which is which is contrary to you are wait so far Alan won Brent zero excellent excellent I'm gonna hit a home run here in a minute you threw out a prediction that maybe episode 100 would be on the anniversary of our modern testing principal principal reveal or according to your notes here it said Alan not me predicted that a hundred would be near the five-year anniversary yeah and we're on track for the brand but let me finish cuz these are two different things I was getting there you made a prediction a minute ago five minutes ago an hour a lifetime ago saying that the episode 100 would possibly be on the anniversary of modern testing principles and then I was gonna segue that in brilliantly until you screwed it up to say last year I predicted that episode 100 would be on our five year anniversary which is just after that in April I can make that both of those predictions come true I'm still taking applications for people with the first letter B in their name but another thing we said I think I said it we kind of agreed on it that that in 2018 by the way Breckner Bach there's plenty of people Oh God and and now you can figure out which one goes with which all right predicted that empty modern testing would become a thing and damn it if it didn't sort of no it's a thing still totally blown away that ministry of test and actually the reason I know that the principles were at test bash is shortly after they made that poster of the modern testing principles yeah which is kind of cool and there were actually it's way way more than kind of cool it's super cool there was lots of discussion around it we have seen meetups people have made it central to yeah it's it became a thing I don't know how because we it wasn't the first external talk I ever gave about modern testing was in late Feb at test bash Brighton Joe has has made it a key part of his lightning talks to OTCs in a row so cool thank you everyone out there who has reviewed and given us feedback on modern testing so hopefully it continues to be a thing until it doesn't need to be a thing anymore yeah I'm not certain when that's gonna be yeah predicting things is hard especially about the future I had a sub prediction with that which actually did not work out where I predicted that modern testing org would turn into something and it remains to be purely a redirect into the modern testing principles at some point we could make a website around that with some more information and we could host the podcast there versus being in a a sub domain of anger weasel calm which I did change hosts on anger weasel calm this year and reset everyone's RSS feed as a side effect of that I would probably would probably have it would have to happen again if we change web hosting which is one of the big reasons I haven't thought about that but I don't know if I will continue that prediction I think I can just keep doing what it's doing I've realized more and more that domain names don't matter because of search yeah that's true the thing is even I mean back then when we did this prediction that we saw a lot of momentum moving towards it in modern testing org being sort of a central place for people to get information base has as we've gone through this last year I'm not certain that that's really all that important right the Ministry of Testing has has con people don't seem to have an inability to to find it right right right and that's to me that's what's important yeah I like having the domain and the redirect because a lot easier than telling people to go to angry with the calm slash a be testing oh for sure in modern testing org and that gets you everything you need to know podcasts are on that page you are good to go Brent I want you to talk a little bit more about this prediction because I will dive in here a little bit you had a little diatribe small soapbox around how there would be a tipping point in the way test job titles are used do you remember this yeah I vaguely remember it I don't remember so what I've seen is it's a tough prediction to make because test job titles for testers are stupid silly they're all over the map they don't titles are still stupid one year later yeah this I'm gonna go ahead and and see in terms of your predictions like the scoreboard I think is Brent zero Allen two will go and with this one I think it's still Brent zero and but and by the way just jumping to the end it's Brent zero this is something that I think still is is very important but I no longer really have a sense that the momentum is in this direction right the I'm seeing a lot of in in what I'm visible to in the in the test community I'm seeing a lot of almost for lack of a better word a reinvigoration of traditional stuff right and I'm thinking thinking through like a recent tweet storm where yeah we were asked to sort of incorporate the defense of a test specialist into the modern testing principles yeah and let me let me just read that so it people who don't follow Twitter can have context someone found the Ministry of Test list of the modern testing principles and they sent a tweet to me saying can I suggest number eight we should articulate the value of having dedicated testing experts whose role is focused on critical thinking achieved by maintaining critical distance from the product yes that was that event occurred and that's and that proposal was rejected yeah by both of us in Allen in in the thread for those who don't want to read the thread Alan essentially said yeah we think this is covered sufficiently and then I piggybacked off of that and said you know what MT does not explicitly say one way or the other if a business decides that they need this great if the business doesn't decide also great right now that's empty my personal opinion which which may not necessarily align with with well it aligns with what I just said about MT but I will go back my rule of thumb is the term specialist is a bottleneck so yes I am unlikely to ever proactively in a written form defend the role of a specialist short-term sure I would defend it but it has to be it would be in my mind all right if I'm helping to make this decision my job is that going to be to alright I have a bigger problem to solve right now but I'm going to be creating a new problem by incorporating a specialist into the system and so it's going to be a cost-benefit analysis in my view I get it yeah more importantly is I don't know if we maybe it wasn't it wasn't conscious from my part but we've been talking about modern testing as the antidote or I've added that word is the antidote to traditional test last bottleneck testing and the principles as you know if you've if you've read them don't talk about testing they're about how to make quality software yeah so having one specifically about testing was weird but there always be people who want to and they see this a lot there is a faction and rightfully so of testers worried about job preservation and by pressing this idea that your special snowflake like I'm the only one that can apply critical thinking and critical distance to the product that it helps preserve that that role that specialization for a job I am about getting rid of bottlenecks and we'll actually talk more about that a little bit I'm about yeah getting rid of bottlenecks is certainly part of it the the thing I would really like to see and it's really hard to defend against but the the old story of the Emperor's new clothes right I think the test discipline has wrapped themselves up in the the Emperor's clothes and for a long time and I'm nodding my head trying to shine the light on this and in the way I internalize it is is getting some of these folks to open their eyes and re-look at the world they're in particularly the leaders like the the leaders in the test community who are open-minded and have a defense against the following phrase I have been in the industry for 20,000 years and I know everything and I'm exaggerating of course no you're not there's not too many people been here for 20,000 years but you get the point right that experience is valuable particularly with those leaders and what I would love to see a lot more of is those folks saying recognizing that what got us here may not necessarily get us where we need to go for sure right all right back to the list so on the tipping point the way test hot job titles are used I'm gonna take that back and matter of fact it's Brent zero Brent zero and I don't see I do think that the way this happens is we get enough in the leadership on this front but I'm definitely wrong on this one and and I actually don't see it's coming close it may not be a change is needed yeah what about the next one I have some thoughts on this but I'm gonna let you answer it you said that AI would become democratized that is still on track yeah it's happening at the house we might come it's happening it's not there it's not there yet but it is it is so that prediction I think is still very valid I'm just off by the timeline yeah that's cool I'm even now telling people and I mentioned this on the slack channel people going into college today I currently don't think data science is the way to go if you want to go into software industry I do think targeting a t-shaped role focused on CS but adding data science is the way to go I think the devs of the future need to have this in their back in their back pocket yes I agree so I had a prediction that and someone can I didn't go look at the websites to see if these things happen that I didn't know about them maybe they were going on and I was subconsciously do about them but we had a discussion a year ago I said that machine learning would creep its way into automation and that they'd apply ml to test automation to help solve some of the problems and where's my bell sound ding with the rise of things like Mabel and test him and a few others using ml to take care of the flaky test problem with web automation that happened that's out there that's done I don't know if I in hindsight these companies have had to have been around for more than a year so maybe I just didn't know about them I heard about them I was influenced but if I didn't I'm a genius yeah or very very lucky I'm realizing how how you nailed your prediction here because I think two things that you really say that really nailed this number one ml will creep its way right you know any sort of movement into automation with the word creep makes that a winner oh don't make fun of my weasel words the other one is tool vendors will apply ml oh my god right all that really means is will tool vendors to pass this flag tool vendors all they have to do is realize make fun all you want I'm not making fun of you actually I'm making fun of tool vendors say hi I'm a tool vendor for automation we have all the ml's and all the AI's yep yep okay ding point for me yep for sure and did you finally graduate no that was your prediction yeah Brent did you said you're gonna reboot blogging did you do that no and Brent last but not least for sure wrong Kylo Ren will be revealed as Darth Reven yeah matter of fact we didn't even talk about that Star Wars movie Last Jedi with a name like that you expect cool man we didn't talk about it but man was I disappointed about that whole thing like I don't get where where they're going with this franchise like the next Star Wars movie hopefully they'll be the last one because I will probably be thankful it one last thing on the reflections I wanted to mention before we go into prediction mode is I discovered many new blogs this year but I discovered my favorite blog that was new to me at least in the last year and I've tweeted a lot about it I don't know if we've ever talked about it on the air Jeff Niman you know do Jeff is no stories from a software tester very good writer much better than me he writes about a lot of topics that are I don't even know if he knows much about modern testing if that's on his radar but I think I do yeah it's a tester stories comm stories from a software tester he had a post about should be higher specialist testers of course he takes six pages to write about it well he probably needs to explain why yeah but he has he's he makes some good cases he writes well so that's my I wanted to give him a shout out just because that's it's one of the blogs of course I have a RSS feed of a gazillion blogs I look at most I don't read through his posts are ones that I stop and read so that's my new discovery any new discoveries on the web for you this year blogs websites no actually this year so the stories of the tester like the the thing that was interesting to me most of the the blog stuff that's relevant to our audience was a random listing of people and how they're using modern testing modern testing is is in a lot more discussions and they're just popping up everywhere so that's where I've either that or investigations into data science is where I've been spending my time okay I have not other than our own this last year I don't think I've actually listened to a single podcast oh I've been getting really into trivia podcasts oh you've always been into it I didn't know I added a few more to my my rep my list trivial warfare probably one of my favorites now gets a little obnoxious sometimes but it's fun I like trivia I like watching jeopardy I played jeopardy on my Amazon echo all the time I do pretty well I have to say yeah all right let's look forward to 2019 but before you and I look forward to 2019 let's we had a few members of the three look forward 2019 want to share what they had so we had one of our listeners Ryan Kuelhorst send in his thoughts about 2019 in an audio clip here it is hi Alan and Brent and the other two listeners of the A B testing podcast my name is Ryan and here are my predictions for 2019 I think first off teams will start to utilize JavaScript and node JS more in their test automation strategy I've been diving into node JS and the last year and I found a lot of really helpful libraries some of them include like Cypress IO and test cafe for UI testing really nice HTTP client I use axios JS and for machine learning I've been kind of diving into TensorFlow JS so I think there's really powerful to use JavaScript as a language for your automation strategy so I kind of see teams moving in that direction another thing I see DevOps DevOps DevOps like everyone is talking about DevOps and I know there I know you might be like come on Ryan DevOps that was like five years ago it wasn't the Phoenix project released five years ago big organizations are just now getting into looking into DevOps as kind of a way to run their organization so one of the like big tip offs was for me for this was a local QA conference conference just released their speaker talks and half of them were focused around DevOps so I think DevOps is definitely starting to build momentum and you'll just see like you'll just get hammered with DevOps DevOps DevOps in the last in the next year the last thing is there's a new Avengers movie Avengers Endgame the last movie Infinity Wars edit on such a hopeless note and it's really it kind of akin back to the Empire Strikes Back but I just hope Endgame doesn't have the same kind of lackluster conclusion as Return of the Jedi like make it better make Thanos I don't know better than than what like Vader turned into so kind of on that note I wish Alan and Brent and the other two listeners a happy 2019 cheers so thoughts on that I have my own but I'll let you start this time Wow no I'm actually thinking it's too bad Ryan's name doesn't start with a B Brian yeah maybe maybe he's comfortable changing it to Brian so I'm I'm gonna jump in because I use a lot of Node.js I'm doing Advent of Code this year although I get kind of stuck a couple days ago so I'm stopped because it's hard but I've done everything in JavaScript using node and we have a lot of node apps here and I play with a lot and he's right there is we're starting to see almost a tipping point of testing and analysis and quality tools built on top of JavaScript built with JavaScript built on top of the node package manager library you know NPM install all the good stuff and I see more and more test type tools showing up there so that's a good observation about yeah I think he could be right that we are ready for that to become even more of a thing I think it's gonna continue right and Brent got all squealy when he mentioned TensorFlow yeah that was that was fantastic good good job Ryan the first so the one thing that was interesting to me is that the his first prediction he might as well have been speaking Greek right these are I'm like what what are these things right it's like I listen to a foreign language you hear like one word you know it's like what what a lot TensorFlow yeah yeah no it's it's I've realized that I personally my investments in in sort of the the test space in a deep dive rather small a lot of these things I don't understand what they are anymore right I would I would not be able to go back to test if I wanted well think it from this perspective when you move to modern testing if you if say you get to principle number seven and you get to the point where you no longer need actually have to go that far as far as not needing a dedicated testing specialist one way to get developers to do better testing and write better quality code is make it easy for them to insert quality and testing tools into the workflows they already know node does that yeah and there's there is here's one one thing that I have observed and and I don't know about the specifics of Ryan's first prediction but one thing I observe is technical communities so here I'm talking about people's code getting together and sharing knowledge not necessarily people those are thriving the matter of fact actually just this last weekend I've been doing a lot of ML I'm on my holiday vacation starting last Friday I do a lot of one of the things that's generally been true first thing I do when I go on vacation is I work on the the AI stuff that I haven't been able to do at work because I'm a manager and people like are you my wife's like are you doing work I'm like well literally yes but no but for example your Taylor Swift ML thing that you sent out a while ago I read that and the approach that they do is very similar to a problem that I have so I've been working on sort of re-implementing that approach against my data set and it's it's that sort of humidity around code around even solutions and then blogs and stuff that's thriving DevOps DevOps DevOps oh yeah that so that was one of my predictions so Ryan's predictions right so I think as we get through playing through the three I'll have nothing so that way oh okay yeah so the DevOps thing I definitely think that that's I obviously I completely agree with with with Ryan on I think and we've talked about the three ways of DevOps all line a lot with modern testing principles so I think if our if as much as modern testing is becoming a thing DevOps people actually getting what it is not using it as a buzzword which thankfully they haven't done with modern testing yet is something yes I agree yeah I have a I have a relevant segue to that it's the last thing on our segue flash tangent yeah I don't want to take it yet but but I do think DevOps is DevOps is going to be a thriving thing and I also think it is part positive and part negative I think one of the big one of the major reasons for this is that it is to business leaders who do not understand the test role it is an obvious thing to take these trained experienced people and move them into yeah I'm kind of glad we didn't have a lot of these or more than one of these audio submissions because you're kind of turning them into full-on mailbag answers but they're just prediction fan so Avengers Endgame my notes here say there should be no ewoks in Avengers Endgame yeah we'll see I'm really looking forward to that movie I like a dark movie once in a while I liked Infinity War thought it was very well done yeah they've done a good job hyping up Chris Evans hopefully whatever the hell happens to Captain America meets up to the hype but of course it won't we will get there a couple other notes from the three to show you on Avengers one of the things so you've seen the trailer yes okay one of the things that I am extremely curious to find out is how the hell at man got out of the quantum room because the end of the the ended number two and he's stuck there and then suddenly he shows up and the remaining Avengers don't know how he did it so all right well we'll get there sure a few other notes from the three Patrick Peryll test Pappy has no predictions but does want to say thanks for the awesome episodes 2018 and looking forward to more interesting discussions in 2019 thank you Patrick we will try and do that Percy is jet-legged but he says his prediction is a growth on practical illustrative examples on how to employ MT well sure I hope that happens too and it is and and an increase in attacks against MT which I think I think that's a valid and probably going to come true prediction as well I think I'm okay with that I think both of those will come true I mean the first one's easy we just had to have one and then it you know we have an increase growth so are you ready for our own predictions that you haven't already shared you ready yeah you have any so what do you think what what's gonna be new in 2019 one or two things it has to be a lot of things but fire something out that as we know from last year it's probably not gonna happen so one thing I will say is that I will finally decide this year whether or not I will actually graduate matter of fact I got to do that within days all right yeah that one's still a tortured decision for me I kind of wish my personality type was a little bit if I were closer to Alan's personality type I'm pretty sure this would be easy what what personality type is that fabulous in this particular case it's an I think actually you if you were in my shoes right you have one class left to take on the degree I think that would be all you would need for a decision yeah yeah I'm a I'm a I'm a deep analyzer and so yes it's still a struggle so well I'll discover what what I'll decide I don't know if I mentioned this on the air but there's two things I want to mention on the air before we go on one is one more reflection my favorite author Steven Johnson came out with a new book this year it's called Far Sight it's about how to make how people make decisions and not in the blink or the decisive blink with Malcolm Webwell decisive the Heath brothers he looking at decisions to take a bunch of factors that have that have outcomes that last years or decades or more so more of the big decision-making kind of things very fat as usual fascinating read but your thing on decisions reminded me of that the other thing I want to mention is we haven't done a sponsor in a long time and we don't have this isn't a sponsor but I do want to give a big shout out to the folks at hey taco we use this this bot called hey taco in our in our slack group to it's a free currency to give other people when they do things you like they pass out a taco you can give away five tacos a day I love gamification of of promoting like helping each other and sharing I think it's a great idea their cost after the free trial was a little more than we could afford on our non our what's what's not only nonprofit but operate at a loss podcast effort so they gave us a sweet deal on continuing to use hey taco and so huge thanks to them it's really cool if you got if you use slack in a professional setting that makes money you I can't recommend it enough it's very cool stuff okay all that all that said I wanted to give him a shout out I should have done earlier but I'll probably mention them a lot throughout the year because they're awesome and just really great experience talking to them and and using the product so very excited I was quite saddened when I read your statement around hey they want us to want us to pay for it because uh yeah once you once you get the taco yeah tacos are great so tacos are around for a long time that's good okay so and I even spent some amount of time looking through right how we could set up the rewards on the tacos all right we'll get back to the world then what are your predictions is we'll figure out something interesting to do with tacos in 2019 sure that is marked all right what other predictions do you have as it stands right now for me on the on the test front you know it's really hard for for me to make a prediction on that one what I'm seeing in terms of momentum is is sort of a polarization happening which I guess is standard I'll call it the well we already have it the traditionalist and the modern testing is right um will that conclude next year probably not but yeah so in terms of Percy's prediction on more attacks yeah I agree on that one okay do you have any predictions of your own yeah okay those would be good to get to so well I guess there are more predictions I want to read but I'm afraid you'll comment at length about them no let me just say in terms of in terms of data science stuff I do think the democratization will absolutely continue and I do think we're gonna see in the next year I think we're gonna see comments from the three around actually using it to achieve test goals here what we see a listener basis you I see a lot of people commenting on it and a lot of it's very theoretical I'll see I think we'll see them actively using it and actively being successful okay anything else no all right I want to throw out two quick predictions from Patrick Prel that just came in moments ago and then I'll go on with mine the first one is probably they're both very unlikely number one Trump will not do something extraneous extraordinarily stupid for two days in a row I can't see that happening but you know you never know and number two is you'll love this one ISTQB will come up with a certificate for the modern testing practitioner imprints making a face so don't comment I don't I think probably that one is more likely to happen than the first one can they do that with our license we don't have yeah I guess I really know it's license we the principles are creative common pay it forward that you have to attribute but yeah they could if they want to they won't I think principle number seven is in would they'd have a hard time with that one because they're a for-profit business on creating testing specialists so yeah yeah be interesting if they did it okay so my predictions I know I would work hard to make sure that doesn't happen so I got got got I have talked a lot about moving my org towards modern testing and how I am slowly but surely working myself out of a role but hopefully not a job I think I'm on track in 2019 to actually work myself out of a role so I will have a new role same job new role I don't know what that is yet DevOps DevOps DevOps DevOps one thing to mention about DevOps is one of my former test leads is now a DevOps lead and there are it was a no-brainer striking similarities it is in this DevOps is of course a culture not a role but you may be in a DevOps role to help move the team towards a DevOps culture which is what he's doing and I think we've said a very very very similar thing about QA or test roles yeah unless you finish your predictions but there's a lot of similarity there yeah so that will happen the other one was test pappies number one prediction is not coming true that won't happen I vowed took a I made a statement that I would not speak at conferences in 2019 and I will say that will not be true but will be true is I will not speak at any testing conferences in 2019 any even OTC test bash I'm not gonna speak at test conferences in 2019 that's my prediction we'll see how what will we'll come back and watch me do like 10 I'm kind of burned out on test conferences I love test bash I'm burned out on many of the other ones and some I will just there's some I just will not go back to it's too much of a world I don't want to live in I am I could see you not going but especially when we do test bash Seattle I'll have to go to that but that probably won't be in 2019 I may given the right opportunity speak at a non testing conference but we'll see I may it may just be there I speak at no conferences but if I do speak at a conference it will not be a testing conference I guess is the actual prediction yeah it's interesting that Lisa Crisp and I don't know if you've been following this she's trying to speak at DevOps conferences no oh good she's wondering how to how to break in because it's it's uh she's been rejected apparently interesting but right I I do think that's gonna be a big mover I think it's actually rather brilliant of Lisa to realize that that's where she needs to go yeah for sure I don't know I haven't heard any statement around her saying she's gonna stop doing test conferences but it does seem like it's a thought process it's in her mind cool I also predict that Avengers Endgame will be my favorite movie of 2019 I predict that the Seattle Sounders not Royal Salt Lake salty gunner is a real Salt Lake fan Seattle Saddles will return to the MLS Cup and win it in 20 between 19 yep and what else what are the random predictions can I give to kind of screw things up I'll do one last one last prediction for bread we will create a principle number eight holy crap okay I may reject one out of spite okay that's it that's a bold prediction because I could see I will be as much as I like you to get zero points in your predictions if there's a valid number eight of course no I I'm interesting I will not bring it up I'll leave it as a cliffhanger yes but I believe I have found a key flaw that I think MT needs to address that is cool all right I'm not even gonna ask you what that is on the air to find that out you're going to have to listen to episode number 96 which will come out sometime in January of 2019 all right I am Alan and he is Brent I took it from you huh happy holidays everyone we'll see you next year bye guys
