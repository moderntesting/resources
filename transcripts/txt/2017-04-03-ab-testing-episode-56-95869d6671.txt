Hey everybody, I'm Alan and Brad and we're here for episode number 56 56 that's way older than either of us Yelling counting down to episode 100 only 44 to go almost there. We should hit I don't wait took us three years to get here. Oh Happy three-year anniversary Happy three-year anniversary brand Hug hug kiss kiss So you haven't made a comment yet, but and listeners you can't see this because the video stream is not working today as far as I know No, it's offline. I'm wearing a you wearing a unity sweatshirt. Oh, look at you and you're in all like fancy pants Oh, I'm up with that. I They're not really fancy pants. You just joined the company. Are you interviewing already? They're not I am NOT wearing jeans. I'm wearing a pair of blue pants. So They're really soft. I would have you feel them but then We might often the podcast would be over probably. Yeah, we have to change our rating We get all weird and stuff There's a story behind this particular sweatshirt one cool thing We're gonna need a you know, we drink when we say this before yes when Alan talks about how cool it is I work at unity. We'll have to do something else. I'm not sure what it is. But One of the things that's kind of fun about unity is each of their offices around the world They have unique swag for that office. Oh and People in the Seattle office look at my kind of purple unity sweatshirt. They go. Oh my god I want that sweatshirt. You can only get this sweatshirt from the Helsinki office I have a gray unity hoodie for it from the Seattle office and I eventually I hope to collect a rainbow so So the sweatshirt model at unity is gives managers the ability to lord over their their travel budget just Being stupid so it's not just swag about I spot identity. So it's not just about It's about swag. It's not just about sweatshirts. I also got a unity beanie Only available there black one. They have socks there too. They didn't have any left Anyway, it's kind of cool. I haven't really been in the swag rooms as much They have different swag at different locations different colors and just kind of a fun way to you can kind of spot where someone's from. Oh Like there's like a conference you go. Oh, you're from Unite. Um, it's Copenhagen unity Which which location has the coolest color? I don't know yet What what color is Seattle gray gray of course match the sky, right? Copenhagen I Wasn't in Copenhagen long enough to inspect their swag I was in the office for a half a day and then the next day I was there at a full day off-site So, how does the swag thing work you just show up and like hey, I'm here No, I had to do a little finagling and sweet-talking So it isn't like you show it isn't like a scavenger hunt where you I'm here give me my box of stuff Is it more like so I don't like at the Olympics like the Athletes they trade something. I'm trying to remember what it is Well at the end of a soccer match often players will trade their jerseys, right? That's right If it's all over yeah, in fact, I've I did that I walked into the office and I pointed at someone took my shirt off And offered it to him expecting me to give me theirs, but they just kind of freaked out and walked away Yeah, that might be a little understandable Okay, so what do we have for our three listeners today? For the three today We've already mentioned episode 56. We wanted to elaborate a little bit on the comments we discussed before around the role of quality and How those have played out at least in my work over the last Couple weeks. Okay, it's been a pony a month since we recorded last I have been channeling Brent a lot recently in that I've been saying I've been stealing his line on The role of test or quality arc whatever I call it is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality Yep, and the reason I nailed that right is because I actually I've really channeled Brent a lot and Used that line because I think it encompasses a lot of what I want a quality team to do. So thank you, Brent. Yeah, you're welcome So I was particularly proud when I finally connected those dots So what happened was I was at an off-site and I won't go into all the details but one of our engineering leaders Came up with the point He said that perhaps it wasn't even like seeing this as an absolute says Perhaps we should consider that all development work should create value or Right. That what I said in the thing. Yeah, I just what all dev work should create value and then Brett Brent Brett's our engineering leader Brett Brent a blue. Are you referring to me or someone else? I'm referring to you. Okay You had a reaction to that around ROI. Can you recap that? The actually my reaction around ROI was Was to a comment of what test role because right that comment is around what devs work should be So my comment was What test should be doing this? Mm-hmm, right? Cuz that if all dev work I can actually connect this these two I thought you had maybe I just did in my head I didn't it so it was a different thread, but I can connect it here, right if all dev work is to create value One might be able to use that as an argument for for example unit test moving to test to a test org Right unit tests on create value only product could I would argue they do they create the value that of course you would argue that But what we're trying to do is talk about like I've had the argument With dev on multiple occasions like it's all along with the theme of well if we dev are picking up unit tests What does the test team do I've heard that It's been a long long time. I've heard the exact same line I would certainly and I don't think this is the point that we want to get into but certainly I want to be careful with with absolutist statements like all dev work should create value Because our create customer value Because it's pretty clear. It doesn't take much sort of Psychological analysis to come to the conclusion then that means dev should only be working on product code Because that's what creates customer value. You could definitely spin it that way and Any developer who is on Marching on the the side of all I want to do is write code That's something that they're gonna use as a Yeah, I could I could see how it could fall down that trap and and I could see why in our org why it would be safe to make that statement because All of our devs consider writing tests part of writing code But definitely you definitely have a culture in place for you to say an absolute this is not and to be clear This is a statement. I wanted to capture out of context To have this conversation. Okay, it's not a statement on like how unity does development and how People are rewarded or anything like that. It was a statement. I thought oh, I think this now this is interesting I want to bring this up in the context of what Brent and I were talking about Accelerating the Brent and I I'm taking half credit now Accelerating I'm taking all credit Accelerating the achievement of simple quality So just I just want to be clear on that that it's not like this is the way unity does stuff I want to capture this statement because I thought it would kick off a discussion. No, it sounds like you you were in a Off-site with leadership. This is what it sounded like to me and Your executive is doing what he's should be doing which is trying to understand and communicate the principles in which He was he was digging he wants to come up with guiding principles. This is well This is my vision or my not vision but the vision My understanding of it inception vision. He's he's trying to create principles You've already expressed that that unity is classally less of a command and control structure than here at Microsoft and And the way you you do that at an executive level as you you create these rallying cry type principles that guide behavior and guide decision-making at the lower levels so many tangents in my head Trying to control that your face suddenly just turned really red Oh many so many so I'm gonna start do a couple of them All right One is you mentioned that I just have to say I had no I knew my previous manager Microsoft was a bit of a micromanager in reflection. Oh my god over the top massive Micromanager it is relative, isn't it? Justice we cast some conversations around some Personnel things and I made some gut calls that this is what I think and I'm good about taking one of the things I have really worked on being able to do is being able to make a decision giving either a lot of data or a small amount of data and then but it's so weird to Make that decision or offer the decision. Here's what I think I'm gonna do or here's what I want to do and Not have it completely picked apart and second-guessed and it's like wait that sounds right. I trust your decision instead It's weird. It's good But yeah, the other tangent before you go on is you mentioned rallying cry Yeah, as I've mentioned many times I'm a big fan of Pat lunchioni's business fables around leadership and and growth He probably the most famous one is the five dysfunctions of a team, but probably not even in the top five of his books One of the things he mentions in one of the books and I forget which one is the need for a rallying cry and a lot of companies will develop a rallying cry as a reaction to a crisis and Brent and I will remember in 2000 when Microsoft was just full of viruses with code red and slammer how the whole company basically went offline for a while a few months month to just study security and learn how to write secure software and Build a security culture. We had a rallying cry around security. Yes And and to this day now Microsoft I believe is Knows more about writing secure software than most companies in the world because it's really beat into the culture But the challenge is and what we're potentially even Overdoing it perhaps but what I'll tell you like every third action on my desktop right now I have to take out my badge and Do a FA. Yeah, the internal security is great. I don't miss that I don't miss I have a normal password on my phone. I miss type the password. My phone doesn't get wiped I told some of my teammates My boss and some and a colleague About the fact that if I type my password wrong three times my phone to get wiped out and their jaws just dropped and they Freaked out they couldn't believe that could ever actually happen anywhere. That was a tangent on top of a tangent. So rewinding one tangent What's important for a company to do an organization is have a rallying cry even when there isn't a crisis Have have this this ties in a little bit maybe to in lean analytics. Yeah. Yeah, the one true metric What's the one thing we care about? right, so a And it can be context sensitive. I find that it's helpful if you have for example a An executive that has different sorts of teams right, I think it's okay that he gives a different sort of rallying cry or a sub rallying cry for that team, right He may be focused on reducing cycle time Right. Yeah, and that's gonna be something that's gonna be really important for The whole business unit that may be his master rallying cry, but he may go to the engineering systems team and Create a more actionable one. That's like hey, I want 15-minute builds Yeah, right. All right. Let's put a pin in that because actually I have some Principles for my team at Unity, but I want to hit those a little bit later You want to pop the stack a little bit and come back to I wanted to set context on The comment about all dev works should create value. Let's say that was that's not a principle or a rallying cry of unity that was a Statement made to start another discussion which I captured in order for us to have this discussion which we are having now and Well, this is this is the first time I think we've ever like Decomposed our tangential route I Had to remember in order for me to remember what we were Back I had to pop the stack and remember how the hell we got there Which is really just skip over it. There's this awesome thing. We write up for the episodes every time Just go straight to it. Yeah, you know, what would be good. I wonder if you played a This podcast over Over With the sound muted the movie inception if our conversations would line up with the dream within a dream within a dream I'm sure it does It's be like when you play dark side of the moon with Wizard of Oz and there's another one of those Okay. Yeah. All right, then so so anyway You were talking. So do you want me to well, where do you want to go? Do you want to get to the ROI discussion the nuance? I want to discuss was you talked about ROI in the sense you can I'm gonna paraphrase it while you're looking it up on Your phone and then you can talk about it the point you got to that if the goal of test is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality Then blah blah blah the goal of test is to reduce I Reduce the investment make it easier to achieve result. So what I said in this context Right. This was on the slack channel and One of the three dot slack calm Several of the three were sort of chatting back and forth It started off with a question Around us mentioning that there should be an emphasis on only working on stuff that provably increases customer value And then there was a question. What would you do when you get into a company? where the codebase is horrible without any automated tests and or we're running a Linter linter a static analysis tool. Okay or some other Similar tool. I don't have my reading glasses on I apologize Finds all kinds of bugs or potential bugs Would you invest any time in improving the codebase and or writing automated tests or do you expect? Approved the direct relation of this to customer value how etc. And then there was a bunch of discussion Amongst the three well, you're scrolling down I'll say the first thing I do in a company like that is by a bunch of copies of Michael feathers working with legacy code Fantastic ideas in that book for how to deal with that sort of mess Yeah, and I would also bring in them Martin Fowler's refactor. I find that book is fantastic. Yeah There's a pair then what the hell might as well bring in his continuous Delivery book I forget the name of it is a continuous deployment Martin Part is Martin and Fowler combined and in a fortunate way Martin Fowler is just a fantastic author for these type of things. Alright, so my comment was All features should be done to provably Proveably create customer value, but they should be done in ROI order and then I state testing in this light serves one goal and one goal only to reduce I That and that's what I want to discuss because but when I was saying in this light it was on the conversation of Fixing devs crappy architecture. Yeah, so I for now you put that in context the discussion is less relevant. So I looked at that I thought yeah and The first time I saw that statement I thought I said that's actually Gets to the crux of your initial statements. It's a reduction of Accelerate the achievable quality right then that made me think Inception inception inception. It made me think that well if the goal of test is to reduce I Then is the role of test merely a cost reduction rule I And and then I have tried to abstract that out and I don't think it is And it could be in a way, but I never wanted to be counted that way No but if you so even my even my mantra that you've talked about here like the That our role is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality Right. I picked the word acceleration on purpose right because it acceleration is the the act of Taking an existing speed and speeding it up right, so it's an auxiliary role if you think of it from a from a into in business type of thing it is It it implies that there is another element that is a working to achieve shippable quality and Test roles in this is to take that element understand the processes of the missing tooling and speed it up and Now ROI can be framed in terms of costs like it normally is But as you're aware Normally nowadays when I think of these sorts of things The biggest cost I'm concerned with is calendar time. Mm-hmm. Right, but it might I I have mentioned this before But my number one concern is are we producing business value? My number two concern is how do we shrink calendar time? My number three concern is how do we shrink the number of engineering hours required? Mm-hmm. Yeah I Think my very first blog on this topic Was on what is the ROI of test? in another light one that I think is more for Might be more helpful or more lightning or more useful to the audience is is around risk reduction But one of the things that I do see tests like what was communicated on the on the channel is we see a lot of Tests saying hey this code base sucks. So we should create a bunch of automation to To what make it easier to Determine when you screwed up the code base. Is that not enablement to some degree? right at the it's We tests in my humble opinion, right Really wants to construct the practices that enables This acceleration on a regular basis right Creating a multi-million dollar test suite upon a crappy code base doesn't really do that That can be a little bit of the if all you have is a hammer. Everything's a nail. Yeah, automation I'm gonna do this what I have I'm curious to your thoughts on this now is When I elaborate on the context of your statement, which I've stolen as stated before I talk about it's now public domain I talk about my love and admiration of the theory of constraints quite a bit. Yes in that Figure out not what sucks, but what's the biggest bottleneck? to our Process here. What's the biggest bottleneck and not solve it completely Mitigate it until it's not the biggest bottleneck anymore and then take on the next I will say so I like that approach I just don't like the word mitigate So what would you use instead? I would say Solve enough of it. I think it's is that what it means it does now mitigate to me means You know, hey the the buildings on fire We're gonna mitigate the pain by just removing everybody from the building Let the building burn. I will look for a better word, but you get it. It's like the conversation I had With someone just last week is like our devs really want some end-to-end tests as part of their Chicken suite and we're gonna help them get started on that. But I also have this I Also want to make sure we get this other multi-machine thing running for That going in the details. Okay, and In order prioritization, you know, it's maybe even goes to ROI from the acceleration side, right? Which one solves the bigger bottleneck? So well the devs already have a bunch of check-in tests. But one thing we can't do is we have we're totally blind over here Okay, do that. So we're not blind anymore. Maybe don't get all the way done But get rid of blind spots goes through the crap out of me big ROI there Yep, and then if the devs getting some more end-to-end tests as part of their suite is the next biggest bottleneck for our Accelerating the achievement of shippable quality then do that but otherwise but reevaluated every step. It's a constant reprioritization right and to your point around Solve enough of it so that it's not the biggest bottleneck like one thing I might consider if I were in your shoes like so you this This end-to-end suite right? So let's theorize. Hey, there isn't There isn't the test hooks necessary, right? So the from my experience It sounds like an age-old ask of hey I want you to build me and end-to-end test suites for my check-in tests and And I might go well I have this huge major thing that we're completely blind to that it that is bothering me more. But what I will do is I will take one guy offline and Make it make a library such that you can build that in the end test suite That's exactly it's what we do is we bootstrap. It's it's really they have a bunch of Unit level tests and they wanted to have some selenium tests running there as well And but they don't know how to write selenium tests very well. It's a basically they want to be bootstrapped They don't want they don't want please write all of our tests for us It's like please make it so we can write selenium tests that run and then and then we can jump in and do that yeah, and and again, if if that if Breaking down The workload in the smaller tasks and you determine the smaller tasks captures 70% of the ROI for the whole thing And it's cheap do that first if it's not then do what's next first So on the slack channel you mentioned That there was some nuance have we covered this then I think we have covered the nuance I just wanted to talk about the eye a little bit and see if I think we're in large agreement So it wasn't as exciting. Okay Tangent and I'll figure how to edit this to its less Penis smacking so the the one thing though they still Do have a problem with on a just from a dev centric point of view is the statement around all dev work should create customer value Right and the other we don't need to go into it but the other thing that I do see as a problem with that is that potentially a argument For the complete elimination of architectural improvements And you could and there's plenty of ways to blow holes in that statement. Yes, it's absolutely not true all the time It's absolutely true some of the time and let me tell you a case where it is. I Believe in I culture of experimentation. Yep getting to a stage where everything you ship is an experiment and in order to Determine the success of that experiment. You have to have some Criteria for determining that and that's and what you want to determine is what is the business or customer value of this experiment and Then find a way to measure that and determine very quickly if that experiment was a success or a failure My my success or failure did it do that it improved business value as I thought or it didn't and When you're in experimentation Experimentation culture you do this so often that you don't care that Seven out of ten experiments fail or eight out of ten because you're doing it quickly enough and often enough that those two or three That do increase value Over time add up to massive improvements for customer happiness and love etc You you there's another reason why you don't care about them failing is because you've crafted the experiment and that every failure is still a win It it's a learning experience. Yes But so that's an example of why if all I'm doing is experiments Then of course, but then of course everything provides value, but you're right. There's architectural improvements There's building that safety net of a good unit test suite all those things you could say they Supply Indirect customer value they make it so we can give you new features more quickly because our stuff can't break But but in the end the statement falls apart under analysis and that's okay Which is why I want to get the caveat early on this is not a statement of how to make software not a suggestion It is a Often in debate or discussion. It's great to make a statement That's partially but not entirely true and the learning comes from picking it apart. Yeah the So like my favorite these type of rallying cry type principles Well number one I generally Despise absolutist statements Right and even things like the agile manifesto like you know very well. I hate the thing and it's it's Because it creates a sort of absolutism that is When it's read wrong, which it's read wrong. I know I know it says given this or this we value both we prefer this one more right But people therefore we should go all in on this one thing people don't read it that way and I saw a Rex black tweet This morning. I was gonna reply. I thought I'm not gonna bother but he went off on Basically he He went off on is the process the software talking about all the love for agile scrum XP and As you and I and the three know those are a means to an end They're a way of doing things that may help you Get customer about get better customer value to customers sooner But if you just follow the process blindly I think it's gonna make you make great software. You're stupid blind faith is always stupid It is a system like this is something that just drives me batty producing software is a system and No, if you follow if you follow the process Just you're perfect your golden all you have to do is follow the process very carefully what process you define it except for the First process the process Rex Rex's process I'm being Right because following process blindly in anything in software in school in whatever is dumb improving the system Always relies on understanding the technology base that we have the people that we're working with and the Processes that combine all three and if you just focus on the process You're gonna screw up the people a three. Guess what Brent sounds like he's context-driven Again it's redundant just because I use the C word All right Anyway, it's healthy go on to the mail. I guess I'll back off the edge of the cliff here. Oh All right good to be back recording again, you know cue that up male Alright, so one of our listeners posted a question I'm gonna read the whole thing. I will sit back in my chair and relax All right in the in the most recent episode there was it was a month ago. I'm sorry. Oh wait That's not the right one anyway All right. I'm it in the last podcast you stated. This is to Alan in the last podcast you stated that your Mission or part of it is to create some sort of a unified testing culture across the organization question is How to do such a thing where I work we have a much simpler situation Four teams in the same building all part of some sort of scrum teams And the difference is the difference in approach and skill set are painful How would the first steps to creating it a common culture? would look like bonus How to do that without being a manager and bonus number two? How do you intend to do that in your organization? Where you have to gap multiple cultures and time zones all right? Let's just take all those in no particular order at the same time intermingled Okay in this session brand-new session we call Alan's life at Unity oh I'm totally That was unlike mailbag, I don't think you could do that Totally improvised I'm not sure if that's gonna make the cut or not, but we'll see what happens It's good to be in control of the editing sometimes So really I'm gonna answer that by telling you what how I'm approaching that at Unity And I've been there just about two months exactly now if you can believe it I can so I think the first step in doing any sort of organizational change is Take some time to learn what's going on Figure out There's noise in the background it's freaking us out You need to get a good assessment of the current state When I think about organizational change to think about current state and desired state And then you can worry about the steps in between, but you need to be able to find where you are so I did that I have Now met in person most of my team and we'll have met all of them in person face to face Probably by the end of May and that's helped out a lot. I'm gonna do a Interjection. Yep this is this is a Very simple insight that I see a lot of people when they're knee-deep into it, but they forget They either know where they are or where they want to be right and and then they start taking action they don't Spend the time to figure out that other part of We'll call it the line like if if and I use will use a metaphor like if you're in, California and you like oh this sucks, I got to keep moving and You start driving and realize you need to go to Hawaii right, it's Not gonna help you right you didn't properly plan out that you can't drive there right another similar situation Right I've used this metaphor It's so we're in Washington State which is north of California, and there's many times where I observe that people are Driving to California by heading north yeah theoretically you'll eventually get there But it's not the efficient route right so in that case like they know where they want to go But they're not taking the direction that gets there so understand not only where you want to be but where you are now and Then build a plan to bridge sure sure and it sounds obvious But I see people forget this all of the time and the other thing is it's not There isn't a teleportation chamber that takes you from Washington to California not yet not yet so Part of it. I'll go this a little bit deeper you understand where you are where you're going You want to take a baby step that direction and then by the time you take a couple baby steps your destination may change We may start getting down the road. We're south We're like get on our way to Portland, and we realize that you know what we actually need to go to Vegas So things can change so Taking this from the abstract to the concrete a little bit I have a pretty good idea of where we are and in learning where we are there's What I'm finding is parts of my organization are farther along that road towards where I want to go Which is a data-driven data-centric culture for for services Parts of the org are actually part way down that road and some are well that sounds really interesting I actually found one of our our teams You'll be happy to hear this brand they're talking about how they're approaching this one sort of testing said and they said so what we do Is we just? I guess don't need to give any context about this So what we do is we just run a bunch of tests, and then we detect errors by analyzing the log files Which is what you talked about I said that's a good approach really say yeah, that's actually a very good approach Yeah, no I love that approach I thought you'd be happy about yeah, yeah, we can do more of that So anyway, I have an idea who my allies are and make sure do they do the do they use their How do they analyze these log files and are they using the same tooling on prod? it says One thing I didn't want to go deep dive into context the thing about my you just say yes or no It's not applicable and okay. It's NA all right because although I Am the director for all of quality for all of Unity services I also air quote own Wherever those services touch clients or editors so basically anything that is connected to a back end I own whether that Code actually runs on a client device or a computer or in the cloud, so I do have some client testing as well Like we have a feet so so you own the client the service integration as well. Yes So I own how the service connects to the editor the Unity editor as well as how? if the service Like we have an SDK for example for doing ads on mobile devices So I own how that SDK works on the mobile devices as well Okay, okay, so anyway. I've learned Where my allies are which is important to do if you're gonna make change and also It would be stupid of me, and I'm sure I've mentioned before to go in there and go I have ideas Here's what we're doing. Let's go One of the things I said to the team both publicly and privately to people is I Have a direction where I think we should go But I want to do it in a way that by all means does not screw up any of the good things already happening here Which I I I just think it would be stupid of me to take a company that Full of smart people full of people working in really good ways and then tell them they're doing it wrong like you're doing it wrong So I wanted to share I sent some just this week. I said I did some bouncing. I've My team structure just you know is I have three leads reporting to me with various sized teams plus like nine ICs nine individual contributors so I have a combination of Areas, I'm directly in charge of plus some leads take care of some areas, and they're spread out throughout the world So probably worth as I loop back into trying to answer this question the next five minutes or so is I Have these people all over the world and One thing I've told the team is that they all report to me or up through me But their work is almost entirely dictated by the feature teams. They work on they are everyone is a member of a feature team a scrum team Many of them use calm bottom instead of scrum to make bread But they remember that feature team they I suggest and most of them do already have one-on-ones with that feature team lead In addition to me or their other lead who has one-on-ones The the test folks the QA folks they don't already know I make sure they have one-on-ones with their feature As well as me I I have one-on-ones with my whoever serves as PO for right because that's that's where their work comes from They're gonna get better feedback on their day-to-day work So I tell them I don't I'm not in charge of the QA organization as much as I'm in charge of a QA community Okay, and the value of community and I wrote that up and then I said well am I thinking of community the right way? So Q tech comes back replanted to unity gosh No Probably maybe maybe but I didn't type the definition up here, but community is a group of people who share common Knowledge with each other and and and I think it's a good way to describe it And for the listeners Q tech because I out whenever I mentioned an acronym I always get slammed on slack channel Q tech was the name of a community that Alan ran here at my quality and testing experts community. Yes many years ago Basically, I shared like here are here's how our community is gonna run. I explained like I get out of your way blah blah But I wanted to plant some seeds to get people used to things number one use data to understand how our features work in production and how customers use what we make and In that I explained that some teams are using monitoring in production as testing very well I've started them off on Ed Keys talk as a As a start there. I'll give them some more more things after Brent gives me a good list to share And that works on the service by getting services side used to using monitoring as testing in production they know how that works They're gonna start thinking that way and then for the client bits using that customer data to understand Analyzing it seeing how customers use the products I believe that kind of moving in that direction without saying I'm moving them from data oblivious to data aware Yep, that's that's step one. That's that's the mission right now number two, how is that Resonated very very well, okay. I made sure it would first I bounced things before I Probably worth mentioning is I would never just spout this out saying okay, please follow this direction I made sure it was gonna work with the majority after had the allies you're gonna go this thing right to you Yeah, let me tell you why everybody gets it. They're all on board Okay, but I just wanted to say it out publicly and our slack channels are are shared They're all wide open. We have a few private ones for like, you know some managerial stuff, but they're mostly wide open in fact in my I never use email anymore. I posted this to our public slack channel And what's great was a lot of the likes and comments came from devs and support people reading about how we're going to I'm structuring QA. So that was good. Number two discuss our hard problems and solutions with each other So what I found in doing my my rounds around the world is like, oh, here's a really good thing you're doing Here's a really good thing. You're doing Oh God, if you guys just shared this stuff and with each other Both right beginning with the solutions, but also the hard problems like I have a hard problem figuring out how to do this we're really challenged with this and encouraging the community to Collaborate and just using something like slack works much better than email for this where you can find a way to have an open discussion around anything from conceptual to Concrete like technical solution. I want to bring up something because actually this this hit me at my work this week And I want so on that one. I love it be proactive in stating that Duplication of effort is okay but Doing so without collaboration is not Yeah, right So the there's this one in and I've rallied against it in my entire time here at Microsoft this one prevailing belief that Duplication of effort is just naturally evil and it is is not Because it's again very context sensitive. Yes so it and they've already heard me early on in in not Like stating principles for the org just talking about how I work is that I really value learning and learning from mistakes and Trying new things out they get that so this is a natural progression. I like that. Let's share what we're doing It's important that we learn from each other Right. So and that's it and then I wanted I truly believe this and I wanted to be a little aspirational is earlier in the week or last week I Shared some of my favorite services tech blogs with them like the Netflix tech blog the Etsy engineering blog There was a great article about engineering at Pinterest this week I love you saw and I I share those and so they're kind of getting the idea again Helping bring them from our team them our team from data oblivious to data aware Yeah, and it's also you're doing the element of sort of Greasing the wheels on Crowdsourcing to some degree. Yeah. Yeah, it's like that look We're here to solve problems. I don't care to to Create a culture of not invented here. Well, absolutely not Yeah, yeah, and and the last one I put is I think a logical extension of that is of all that together is Unity has a tech blog and sometimes there are quality related posts on there mostly to this to at this point talking about how Like we've handled some complex testing for the shaders and the graphic stuff like you can imagine like it would be in an Xbox blog Good stuff on there. There was one just last week on how we do exploratory testing, which is very good But I encourage them number three was share our best technical solutions publicly I have aspirations of unity services blog being unity tech blog having posts which are right up there in that group of my other people look at as their Tech service blogs if you look at again Netflix at sea, you know, maybe Pinterest Unity and they get there. I think there are some good solutions already, but to start thinking about How important those are for not just to share with the public to show cool things we're doing but to inspire customer confidence I think one of the reasons I'm amazed using Netflix is because I look at their blog and I know how much cool science and technology Goes into how they do selection engines and uptime and streaming and things like Chaos Monkey and the whole Simeon army as they call it. I think there's some good stuff there and I want to strive for artwork to be there, too So so so whining back. Hold on because I because the omits questions But I think you've nailed the how you're approaching this But then I don't think you've covered What you might suggest if you were doing this and you weren't a manager and And more specifics around how you're gonna handle the the geopolitical Time's only boundaries. Okay, the second one's easier because I actually think I have covered that have the discussions in the open transparency is key and My org is all over the world and it hasn't been a problem people It's so have the conversations like at your company You're saying no don't call me and have the conversation have the conversation with me on slack channel Right an exam everything is just transparent in the open around the world. Everybody can participate Like like I said my team channel on my team channels. I have you know, there's QA services QA component QA they're all public channels and Anybody can jump in and anybody's is Encouraged to jump in and it works around the world I think a tool like you heard it here first Alan Page wants to kill the hallway conversation the hallway conversation is slack you because Because of the world being flat and having organizations everywhere if you have a geo distributed company Slack is your hallway Channel we have the company of 1,400 people. We have 800 slack channels There you go You join the ones that got 600 more to do I just joined the Seattle coffee walk So if someone wants to go get coffee We we have like a great coffee machine, but we'll walk over to cafe Laudra for just to get outside in the gray sky Good yeah, it's good and the last question was so not as a manager It's largely the same. There's probably two things. I will add to this before we close up for the day I'm gonna change it. Yeah, not as a manager in a command and control system. Oh god, so I've done this before so I've done this actually a very similar role in Xbox as an IC most of my IC time at Microsoft was spent sort of as the Technical assistant to the director of test or test manager person running the queue Yeah, it's not a real IC and you know it it but it is but it's a leadership role The thing is individual contributor can be a leader So what I how I did this in Xbox for example largely command and control although my manager Chris was very Definitely not a micromanager, which was awesome Is I built a community again? I just because you're not a manager doesn't mean you can't build a community I could have sent this message to slack as a senior IC and said here's how I think we should be doing and Just have my manager like it as a as a mode of support But I don't believe even in a command where I worked at Microsoft for most of my career in command and control most of my career at Microsoft was in a command and control system as an individual contributor that Didn't stop me from attempting or trying or sometimes being successful at being a leader across an organization That's that went even beyond my managers often almost always went beyond my managers Organization because I thought I did the work in a way that Was not Dictatorial Like a dictator. Yep, but just in this these same ways as I'm doing now Constantly spreading seeds and doing things at a like very slowly turning up the heat to get people moving in a direction And like I said realizing that the direction may change over time So the one thing that I'll say Because I've gone through this sort of conversion Repeatedly now, right? The way I like to run my teams and the way I like to get them going when they're running smoothly Means the team doesn't come and ask me for to make decisions all the freaking time. Yeah, because you don't number one you avoid the command and control As much as I can that is around you I mean you've almost had to do that in most teams at Microsoft I was told that you know if you do that too much you get fired Like if if I were to solve this for Microsoft I would just say like look if you're a manager you have to have at least 15 reports Because you can't do micro management very well with that And if that's your style you'll get pruned up pretty quickly Right, but the other thing but there's another aspect because I'll tell you one of the really hard problems around around this when it comes to individuals right command and control creates a safety net it says I the leader the command and controller are the is the one that's accountable for risk-taking Because there there is there is no leadership without risk-taking correct and really what this comes down to like what I do is I I I boil frogs and I teach these individuals first thing that has to happen is to teach these individuals What it means to influence and lead? Right because a lot of times I get the questions like well How do I do this as an IC and what they really want is a formulaic step-by-step plan that guarantees success and? You have to have built credibility as a leader and maybe that's the answer is how do you do this as an IC you lead You learn to become a leader. Yes, exactly. I think this will inspire some more questions We'll get to you next time. Yep, but we should probably close for the day and Put episode 56 in the bag or the can all right. I'm not Brent and I am See you next time. Bye
