Hey, howdy From do a podcast sure. All right. Hey everybody gets Alan is Brent and we're here for episode 45 45 of a be testing I was just thinking I thought 45 and just at this moment thought of like the kids listening today won't remember these but 45 records. Oh Man the records like a CD but it's made of vinyl and they had a big hole in the middle and they played at 45 revolutions per minute and if you didn't have the freaking adapter You couldn't play your 45. Yeah, I have it. I still have adapters. I'm sure you do You're much more of an audiophile than I am. Yeah, I still have 45s I'm sitting around I have about 700 CDs Sitting underneath my bed wondering What I should do with those so I have this I have like this pile of 45s a lot of them are collectibles He's to get like these collectible import 45s But I also have buried in there like a Van Halen dance the night away 45 that's pretty cool. I Have all of the Van Halen stuff. That's great up until they Changed to Van Hagar, which I was anti Van Hagar. I don't care Brett. Okay, then. All right then so Shall we begin on? our last episode There's we don't have a recap because we don't have I don't know about you I don't have retention beyond about 15 minutes. So I don't know we talked about last time but it was something around How to become data-driven and I feel like we got a great start But that maybe there's more we could talk about so I like to continue that topic if you don't mind I've written on the whiteboard pew Ww. L. Oh, what's your thing means pick up where we left off You want to start with the second one? No Really? Okay, cuz I can't it's too early in the morning for me to do the song Later, that's a teaser Later alright, so last time last time on episode 44 shots we covered as Alan just called out how to begin this journey and we We addressed it by talking about essentially Leveraging the strengths of your team right now beginning the journey and We spent a good amount of time talking around how to kind of clear the way by connecting with your executive Um here I started I am Looked over our show notes. I actually relistened to the episode We have lots of great questions and comments up on the slack channel one of the three dot slack calm. Yes Actually it occurred to me as well we have a listener who up on Twitter is very actively Stating what episode he's up to and he's like up to 24 and He was asking a whole bunch of questions and I'm like, why don't you just go to the slack channel? And I realized oh if he's up on 24, he doesn't know the slack channel exists Maybe we should add that on the eB testing. It's it's kind of a time paradox Thing right it is. Are you giving me web administration tips? Requests all right, maybe I can do that I'm taking volunteer webmasters as well Maybe Percy will sure alright, so I was thinking about it and one of the least useful things that I did over the weekend is Lots of Catching up on Xbox and those connections hit and it it It occurred to me that really what we're sort of talking about is not Unlike a tech tree from any game you've ever played ever where what you're trying to do is Master a particular skill and then when you have enough Experience points enough mastery or experience points right then the next Element of the tree opens up in general Some questions I Thought about is as you're pursuing What exactly are you building? So what I don't mean the product here, but I mean the the assets that you're putting together to be able to Do data analysis That of course leads into what are you're measuring Another thought you need to think about is where does your team grow? its competency next Right. So let me just recap here. So you have I remember the steps are data oblivious, right? Then date was a data aware That's the one I added in between there's data oblivious then what happens next data oblivious data aware We'll go ahead and go with that Then there's data driven then data centric. Okay, so One of the techniques I like to help map out my tech tree I like that is I describe my Current state how my team works today my desired state and then I know there's like 150 different paths to get there Which is your tech tree? I like that analogy So could you take a few minutes and describe what is the desired state if you are a data centric team? Firing on all cylinders. Tell me what that looks like because I think a lot of people have a hard time imagining that data centric team first and foremost Has a dependency on on the data. So the the one high order bit is People feel like if they don't have the data They can't move forward Right. So there is that dependency that you can You can use to detect number two In a data centric team Most organizations have lots and lots of data you have billing data you have customer data you have operations data you have a Factory data and what I mean by that is how well you're able to ship a new product You'll have all of this data and I'm barely touching on okay, so I have a bunch of data and I'm dependent on it You'll have all of this data Integrated in some fashion such that There's a term called SSBI which stands for self-service bi and what that means is a person who doesn't have statistics or data science skills is able to consume the data and Confidently and competently make 80% of the decisions with that data on their own Okay, so the data has been integrated has been cure curated and simplified Such that you can light that up so to paraphrase so far again because you use more words than I would I'm dependent on the data. I have a lot of it and it's Available in a format that could be consumed by anyone on the team consumed and acted upon. Yeah What else is that it? Confidently as well that because one of the problems with the data is formulas and and to tangentialize that a word to Tangent we've made up words here before why not really we have tons Now I forgot what I was gonna say It's Tuesday morning after a long weekend ah and the kids are back in school rough life first world problem. Um So The tangent was that's important because I've seen so many over the last 20 Some odd years of being in software people Using what he called confirmation bias look at the data and make it and make it say what they want What they want it to say versus being able to use the data to make actual competent decisions that actually are true. It's like years ago, I Went to a leadership class and they gave me a definition of empowerment that I'm rather fond of which is When you empower people You are expressing a confidence in those people to make the same decisions You would in your absence Awesome if they had the same Information okay, so you can think of it here is sort of data empowerment So you in that world you're setting people up to be able to make the same analyses as a data science team would in the data science teams absence So let me modify my paraphrase. So we have a lot of data and I depend on it and the data is consumable in such a way that anyone on the team can make Make similar decisions based on that data. Yes Anything else to it the the last one that's The next Three things that I would say are that are critical number one Generally when you start this journey, you're gonna be working against what's known as cold path data and cold path data means It takes a while before the data itself Yep, I get that you kind of back into the how you get there But I want to I want to make sure I understand what the desired state is. Are we done with the desired state is near real time real near real time hot path hot path a lot of Action ability and decision makings is Automated so you have things like machine learning algorithms or you have that's more the how We can get there I want to make sure I have a good decision that I can out because I really for me being able to describe this Desired state of where you want to go and sort of an elevator pitch I think I think any leadership over any change requires being able to articulate exactly where you're going and it's an adaptive problem Meaning we don't know exactly How we're going to get there or if or if the actual desired state is going to change slightly or more that or more dramatically over time But we want to have being able to articulate that goal being able to tell people whether it's an executive for bought enough for Didn't want a drink for Whether it's anybody on the team just to explain kind of where you're going so We could talk about I love the idea of warm path hot path cold path I want to talk about those I used one time a Microsoft history called fast path and slow path But I like the terms warm hot and cold much better. He explained what those are in a minute. Yep But if I can I have a bunch of data that I depend on or to do our job and everybody on the team has a way to consume that data in order makes the same decisions no matter who they are and Those decisions are and then that data that we get is as close to real time as possible That's a great state to be in yes I rely on this data coming in in real time like I know right away when something's going on and I can make the decision You can make the decision just down the hall can make the decision Cindy upstairs to make the same decision because that data is easily consumable and interpretable The last constraint or the last just when I thought I'd get it nailed you add more crap There's one more. I said three start when well, you can't count the last one is event driven responses So a lot of analytics will be when you first start off it will be everything's get pumped to a data store and It relies on a human to go in and do queries and say hey Oh look something happened two weeks ago Here in this world not only do you have? NRT or hot path, but you're going to have Event driven situations where Customer just did this and that kicked off on its own a whole new analytics Path I'm gonna put that in the close to real-time umbrella fair enough So I have to modify and once again try and restate my desired stuff and you did a very good job Okay No, I get and and what the things we're doing here and what I do in branch starts talking about either One he's talking about stuff. I don't fully understand or two. He just doesn't make any sense regardless I try and paraphrase parrot it back to him. So I'm going to make sure I understand things good technique to use I'm sure all the all the three know how to do this But you kind of make sure I'm in the right ballpark and it's it's useful for the three as well since They're at least two days delayed on their ability to ask me questions Are you making fun of my ability to get the podcast edited and out? No, maybe sometimes do sometimes a whole week All right, it depends how much it depends on how much of your idiot stuff and coughing I Have to edit out. So what Alan just walked through? Seems like 10 minutes ago is How do you know if when you've got there we've already established Brent can't tell time the oh That was before knowing the North Star knowing the North Star can be helpful I don't like the term North Star. I'm gonna stick with desired state. I like current state desired state path I'm just gonna pick on everything you say for while till I feel better about myself That shouldn't take long Might take a long long time So you're trying to understand what do we desired state, okay And that frames it up nicely One of the things from my experience though that if you do in I would say 70% of the time expressing the full richness of the desired state When you are in a data oblivious team is a bozo bit flip flipping moment That is So far out there People can't can't really visualize how to get there from where they are at So I recommend a strategy Around hey those who are the leaders who are pulling together this this strategy don't go so far out of the box that you lose the attention of What you hope to be your future customers Instead do around the box thinking which is Kind of what we've been talking about. It's Establish where you are today and what is the next useful step? That moves towards this this long-term Direction and that's that's how my exercise of current state desired state works is you don't it's always a multi-step Path to get from current to desired and desired changes as you go along the way which isn't to say if people ask you What's what's your desired state and I am totally okay if I give them an answer and they look at me like I have two heads Right because I can move them gradually in that direction. I've done this before and they get there and they go, holy Heck the other thing to to assure them is that They are not going to get their value only once you've achieved that dire desired state You're sure you have to get value along the way. Otherwise, you can't they won't continue the journey with you, right? Alright, so you brought up cold path warm path hot path. Do you want to go into that now? Sure, do you so yes for our look for the three should we just tell each each of them get one cold path warm path hot? No, so what do you mean by cold path rent? cold path data is the easiest way to qualify it is it is a a ton of data And because it is a ton of data It gets transmitted from your system into this final or this Final destination where people can use it So we have a big Data store that we've made in Microsoft for years But you can think of a lot of people will use Hadoop or elastic log search solutions or Azure data lake or Azure data lake I get yeah, I guess there's an opportunity for us to Hock our own wares So basically some sort of massive storage where stuff sits for a while. Yeah a large data warehouse say based off of SQL or an oracle type solution. Okay, so when when the data gets from your product into those Storage locations and it's a large amount of data That's typically called path and it's called cold path because by the time you can use it The the data is multiple days old Okay, a bunch again to paraphrase a bunch of data shoved into some big storage solution Yep, where it sits for a while and becomes cold hot path is The the opposite of cold path in its so the data comes from the big storage thing and gets no No, not quite that opposite hot path is a small amount of data that is That lands in its store very quickly usually within Five minutes or less and I would hope even faster some of those things are like site availability Yes The It isn't very rich But it can tell you things like for example in Azure We one of our big hot path Signals is VM up or down It's basically a list of its metrics in our team that we need to act on immediately. Yes That's not everything you can measure it's it's for us. It's mainly things around site performance and site availability now on warm path there is Of these names warm path is where there's sort of the semantic religious war Now I also I'm blown away There is something in software that has become a semantic religious war. Yeah, I know well just a minute Okay, go on. Yeah Well, I cannot represent the other point of view because I Because it's wrong and I semantically and religiously disagree with it, right? I I don't I don't even pay attention to it So warm path is essentially when you mix cold and hot just like in my tub with my rubber ducky, right? So in the data path there's these there's there's generally two types of data ones known as Dimensional data and another one known as fact data fact data is essentially Transaction information this event occurred on this time This VM was up this VM went down that sort of thing. Okay Dimensional data is the metadata So for example, which customer owns this VM? Okay So a a Strategy with with warm path data is essentially you reuse your hot path store and You have cold path updates of the metadata such that you can then join these things together And have a fairly good confidence Of Building new insights, for example, if you wanted to in my situation if I wanted to know which customers were down in near real time as Long as the the customer didn't sign up in the last two days. I can do that And a lot of times that's a that's a valuable and a reasonable miss Okay. Okay All right, so and and that's probably fair is cold path definite definition we can all agree with Hot path we grew it as well Warm path is something in the middle. It depends on right? Hey one. So that's fine Well, that's true with water as well. If I might digress cuz like what maybe warm to me may feel cool or hot to you Yes, the the You know what one of the things I say we can solve this When we're done here, let's take a shower together We'll see we'll see what how as long as the check clears first Alan. I'm okay with that There's no check. There's no check Our relationship is based on nothing but trust Brent is frantically trying to look at his notes and get back on track It's my job to not let it be that easy for him. Yeah so another way of thinking of I don't know how to incorporate data awareness, but when we talked about data oblivious Data driven and then data centric There's another terminology they think is a good synonyms for this one. So that oblivious It's you're driving the business off of intelligent or off the intuition that adriven you're dividing or driving it off of intelligence and data centric off of Smartness now define smartness. I was about to say Several folks will say hey isn't intelligence and smart Synonyms no in in the data in the in the data analytics world. They are not synonyms. They might be in a dictionary They are not here. So Intelligence is you can think of it's you can think about the difference this sort of book smart versus Street That's exactly what I was thinking is the difference there So when you have an intelligent system, you're basically book smart you you are You now have the data where where you are able to confidently Express what is happening and to some degree express why it's happening When you're in when you're in the world of smart You have able you have been able to filter out which of those Intelligence aspects you generated You can automate and drive action with so intuition You don't they don't even have the data in an intelligence phase. You've got gain a mastery of Curating the data but you don't really know which of these data feeds really helps to drive the business or any customer set sense within the business and then when you're in a world of Smartness you not only know which ones drive the business But you've you've begun to leverage that data and automate that data So let me moving the people aspect of there's an interesting I'll paraphrase but this time in with an interesting maybe insight maybe stupid comment sometimes hard to tell the difference but in The first step is intuition only and then you're sort of you swing the pendulum all the way and it's all just like data only and Smartness this street smartness comes from being able to combine intuition with that data Yes with and Connect it to validated outcomes Like you've but to me that's that's connection of intuition and hard data No, you so you can connect intuition with hard data. Yes, that's intelligence, but then connecting it to proof That responding to intelligence Actually moves things forward one of the biggest challenges there are there are The two biggest challenges that I've encountered from data science teams themselves Number one, I have produced World-class brilliant insights and no one is using it Okay, and this is this is a common phenomenon People will leave their data science team because of this and the second one is all I do is reports Right. So the the value proposition To get to smartness is you got to get people to use it if they're not using it Then you're in the wrong path. I agree and that usage criteria If people are asking you for a lot of reports and they are And you're generating a lot of insights You're in the intelligence phase and you're working through how to get to smart a lot of data scientists will come out of school For example, and they've been told by their professors. Oh when you join a data science team, it's all about ML and it can be That because we're in a phase in the worldwide where Where there's sort of a shortage of data science teams and a lot of organizations are trying to build this up Most teams aren't at most companies aren't fully at the smart phase. There are a whole bunch of them but most are so I see and perhaps I Think you'll agree with me Although he may be offside of this and the data data science fairly new profession people come out of school with degrees that didn't even exist a while back there used to be called just statisticians or and But being able to apply what they do to provide value to an organization is critical, but I've interviewed I was gonna say hundreds maybe thousands But definitely hundreds and hundreds of people at Microsoft from very good universities with very impressive degrees And these people were all intelligent in your definition But not but not I shouldn't say all of them many of them were in very very intelligent, but not very smart this is a good parallel for you to me with data science software developers who Wrote papers on algorithms, but actually couldn't figure out how to apply them I'm not talking about making the right code at the whiteboard just talking through like How do you think through solving a problem with code was something? Just they couldn't make the connection and the same thing with I see software testers Who can't eat maybe they have certifications or whatever they've they'd know a lot of facts They know to bring up things like boundaries and performance and but they don't Know how to apply those things to actually test something. Well, there's a connection that has to happen to be successful between This background these tools you have and being able to actually apply them in a meaningful way And that's true with any knowledge work but there's that connection and then data science is sort of on the edge of the same place and other professions have been where you People have this background like you should be able to do this, but you're just not being successful at it You're not crossing that bridge, but I've studied machine learning and I know how to use our but there's a leap from there to actually Doing the work that provides value to your org Moving something by by using that knowledge right now the The other thing that's just as an aside most of the people that I interview for a data science position are PhDs and Professional students. Yeah, there's there is a challenge with with those folks I Don't know if you were aware. I learned this just in the last year that most PhDs are encouraged by say their prior sponsors to stay in academia and heavily encouraged it's almost viewed as a Desertion if you go into industry, so there's a big discussion between academia and industry am Academia is has a lot of value. I'm on the I talked about this a lot. I'm on the board for the Alumni Board for my university's School of Arts and Humanities, which is a Different side it's not in the computer science software world computer science side of the world but one of the things we discuss a lot is the ability to Basically just talk about before the ability to apply critical thinking to knowledge work versus just the thing on the theoretical side Versus the practical side and we need people to bridge that yes, we do the academia is Really good at pushing the edge They have a whole engine around not only masters but PhD students Looking at the current body of research and creating new Original work in the general way that you create a new original work is you look to see Where there's unanswered unanswered open questions this this leads them to to push forward on the theory And so some of these folks come in and they've spent the better part of the last eight years With that is their personal culture and so when they come into industry I Spend a lot of time looking through great like Here's one here's 50% of my interview In one single question great. How can I use that? That's fantastic. How can I use that? Okay, and They struggle with that. Yeah, at least I want to get back on track here, but at least once a year there's a PhD paper on someone who solved the problem of making bug-free software and they haven't some method whether it's an analysis tool or a new programming language that eliminates the functional bugs from their software, but They're just oblivious to the fact that the software They're describing in their paper is nothing anyone would want to use and we've talked about where quality comes from People wanting to use the software Either it has bugs not quality is value and you can make a bug-free program that has no value therefore no quality The other thing too though Because when you say they want to use there's an element of proactivity the nice thing with with the data space is As you build up the assets and as you are working towards making your analyses more truthful and simpler Then whether or not they want to use it if you socialize it correctly It becomes more actionable and you can essentially force their hand on using it most people when you have when they have a belief like By shipping this feature. We will grow customer engagement by Blah blah blah if you can show them the data That says that does not appear to be true Data Well-articulated defeats intuition Almost all of the time correct So let me let me do a couple things First and foremost we talked about how do you know when you get to data centric? when you get to data the way, you know you get to data driven is You are doing a lot of what's known in the statistical world as Hypothesis testing and what a hypothesis test is is you you've trained people to Date their beliefs in the form of a sentence So much like what I just said this feature will increase customer engagement by 50% then So the PM or whoever is working on it will continue on building their features But then they're gonna work with you to figure out. Okay, what's the data that needs to be done or Generated in order to prove or disprove that hypothesis, okay, this is different than say the Gqm model that test was informed as As the brilliant way of going years ago Go question metric by the correct silly what I want to do I guess in the remaining minutes is I want to walk through Sort of the phases since we're talking about how do you know when you got there? I want to walk through there is jog through jog through Gallop through the phases of a data analytics maturity Now here I'm gonna talk about abstract stuff again the principles we talked about last time around starting with what you have and Building from that solidifying that then build again is the right approach here Don't swing all the way over to any sort of these North stars So the first phase is what's known as measure am in when you're in the measurement phase Really what you are able to do is answer what questions? What what feature is the most popular exactly what customer? pays us the most what useful feature is And come back combinations of those One of the things a tool That I've used in when we're in this phase. I call it real and it's an acronym What it stands for is reliability engagement availability latency So if you can pull together an asset that measures those four things it generally isn't a challenge to Get dev bought in and it also isn't a challenge to Provide useful value so You're using existing data. You're being reactive. You're not being proactive You're basically saying hey dev that feature you shipped yesterday Here's what the the real report shows our reliability reliability Engagement engagement availability and latency. What's the difference between reliability and availability? Let me go through them all. Okay reliability is a measure of the frequency in which failures occur. Okay, okay Engagement how often it's being used is Yeah, it's like how many people so engagement is a measure of the priority of this path. Okay. Okay so if whether it's used or not Availability so if reliability is a measure of the frequency in which things are occurring Availability is a measure of the consequence of failures. Got it So the way you measure is it just an API failure or the site become completely unresponsive? The typically the way you measure availability will be by downtime Okay, this failure occurred These these machines were damn down for two hours or two days. Okay, and then latency is essentially A measure of the success path. Hey when everything's working. Is it zippy or is it painfully slow? Yeah, so these four things together really useful then the biggest thing you can do in the measure phase is automate this the visualization of this data end to end such that whoever using it typically developers don't have to come to you and As for this report you just you've strung it together you've worked through it you've you've Talked with devs and found out that this is fact the truth. They began to leverage it. Okay The next phase now great you can answer what questions The next thing is that people will start ask want wanting to diagnose How to fix that? So you have you have all of these Services, they're all failing dev wants to know what's the pattern? So you being able to drill down your aggregates and diagnose It is the next one Here you want to be able to automate drilled in an exploration in that context and But your goal is to enable human beings to do the root cause analysis You do want to automate what's known as the Pareto order? So as you work through debt with dev to figure out how to automate This process and how they investigate it You're gonna learn new knowledge and you'll learn that they have common patterns and then you can automate the Pareto order of the impact You now have the data so you can create a new report that that says These are the things that should be worked on next and that's extremely valuable The next phase is known as predict and optimize. So now you have all of this data You you now want to be able to not react But how do you know when you're about to encounter a reliability problem? Generally, there's other signals perf counters Traffic Changes that you can use to sort of predict these outcomes This enables you to answer Not only why questions very confidently, but also what if questions so you begin to be able to Predict the future Okay Predicting things is hard, especially about the future and with the what if questions you now are able to address Hey given two choices of the next steps, which choice should I take? Okay good and the next step which is there How many more are there three more? operationalize and integrate But this means is data is easily integrated across all teams and here we're decisions can be made on Multiple different fronts as you go through this though I started off talking about with quality of service the type of data that that Us as testers are accustomed to why do things fail bugs, right? Here between then and now you're gonna want to incorporate customer and business data. I Will tell you nothing drives an Action with a developer Better than the ability to file a bug and say this bug cost the business this amount of money and be able to state it with confidence Then after that once the data is operationalized and integrated then you'll start getting into What's known as automated decision-making? This is the NRT stuff that we're talking about event driven decisions Plugging the ml instead of the ml being something that drives decisions with humans You plug the ml into a product right for example just to interject even though we're real short on time is that right now? Our product gets released through rings of deployment pretty common and that is always a human decision at this point It combined with data. Yep, but that could very well and I want it to be purely automated based on data and then the very last step is A lot of people you will hear them talking about data democratization No, I don't hear a lot of people talking about that. Okay, a lot of people in my neck of the woods Okay, we're data democratize Whatevs and this is Essentially meaning the data that comes from the service. It's democratized anyone can easily use it. It's a key part to the operationalizing integration step Like I want to I'm gonna add a survey to the slack channel and ask how many of you use the term or hear the term data democratization in your daily work the last phase Which is known as transform is around knowledge democratization So we talked about the difference between intelligence and smart you need to have data democratization in order to reach the intelligence When you're smart is you now have Curated assets that allows you to democratize the knowledge gained Does that make sense? It does make sense is democratization too big of a word for you. Not too big for me. Okay, and then Hey, we just got just a minute left, but I want to make sure we cover one item as teased earlier from the mailbag We Got a question from Michael Rocha. He asks what? resources articles white papers exist on data driven testing Unfortunately simple question and unfortunately I have a simple answer I'm sure they exist. There's none of them that I'm aware of But if I were to begin looking at this I would look into the concept of testing in production Just search this just do I would say being in some good. I would do some Bing in on effective means of for testing in production that we've We've talked in the past the testing and production does not mean you move your test cases to the cloud It's the testing and production done right is heavily driven off of data emitted from the product That's where I would start the stuff we talked about in episode 44 is a bit different It's sort of testing in production when you don't have production Got it. Okay. There's our episode. There it is. Hey everybody. Don't forget to re-swizzle your thing about Or whatever Jim Moore had us say. Oh, right. It's a little bit different Oh right in in is a Is star is the the star promo code still active should we do a reminder of this sure you can go? Do if you go to the star to register you can use the code a be testing and get two to two hundred dollars off All right, then. All right. Hey everybody. I'm still Alan barely and I am confidently Brent
