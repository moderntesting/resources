Hello again, howdy, hey, I'm Alan I'm brit and we're back with another episode of a B testing Does it have a number are we up to? 87 we are 87 welcome to the 87th episode of a B testing if this is your first time listening to a B testing Welcome, please go back to episode 80. You may want to back up We've been diving into the modern testing principles on you can read those on modern testing org We've been spending this is our sixth episode going through the seven principles will hit the the last one in two weeks, but this podcast in general is your guide your gateway your information Center for a lot of things about software testing a lot of software engineering Quality and of course the aforementioned modern testing. Yes It's all that so that's the plan for today if you'll hit the fast-forward button now you can avoid our chit chat or Since we don't work together anymore. This is our chance to catch up, too So what's new with you? Mr. Jensen? Oh The biggest thing that's new is Baseball seasons over Not for the professionals for your children. I assume yeah from my son although that reminds me I need to sign them up for a fall ball. I keep forgetting that you want to stop and write yourself a note. Yeah, he actually Totally going to do that Like yeah, cuz if I miss the date let's see Okay, then yeah, talk some amongst yourselves the Bellevue which is also called the Seattle Unity office because outside of the Seattle area. No one knows where Bellevue is. We are moving offices we are vastly outgrown both the Physical space and power and AC limits of our current space so Another month or two and we'll finally be in our new spot pretty excited about that. It'll be pretty and nice. Where you going? Six blocks away. We're going to Lincoln Square South. Oh, okay again for the locals everybody else like shut up and talk about modern testing Lincoln's is that the same building you used to be? No, no South it's Three blocks south on the it's the newer one that went up on the corner of fourth and Bellevue way again more local trivia Okay, we'll move on here has a lot of restaurants Had they put anything into that Toys R Us yet? No the toys our s space is still available Okay, so anyway, so anyway, I thought I'd just cuz I was thinking about it on the way to work I have a bit of a Where is the weasel update? Oh? I'm I mean I'm at the I was I was waiting for the song but oh we'll come back to that We'll go back to that, but you weren't done. I forgot that you just took a pause to Write notes on your phone so that I can read that we now return to a quick update from Brent Jensen yes, so the the next biggest thing that's happening is So my oldest has been home for the summer He's got an apartment where he's he's gonna move into his apartment on Saturday in Pullman in Pullman He's already pre-warned Things like he may not be home next summer. He may not come home for Thanksgiving So I actually think even though he's not willing to say this and he may not know but just because you know I've gone through the college experience. I actually think this is It I think this is him actually moving out That's congratulations on a successful early launch Yeah It I I hope I hope I and all of our listeners with children have the same experience with all of our kids Yeah, no, I don't think I'm gonna have this same. No I can't wait. I can't wait to get rid of them Move out they're obviously not avid listeners to the podcast No, but they have heard me tell them that as soon as as soon as the younger one goes to college that The house is being sold immediately and we're not leaving a forwarding address just a PO box That's you know that's not a bad strategy But you can mitigate it. Just you know if you if you'd like where you live you know just change the locks Thought about that thought about that, but I think it's better just to actually I don't like The house is fun. I like the house. It's a nice house is beautiful I am I have not adapted well to suburbia We became suburban to get the kids in better schools and all that but I I would like Living this cookie-cutter house. It's nice And it's big in the three-car garage and lots of room and have a huge home office And it's awesome a great place for a dog and everything that's cool, but I I Suburbia takes attacks on me I need I need a neighborhood or a building with character that sometimes only a more urban Environment can provide yeah You and I are so far apart there. I can't even see you from where I'm saying I want a house with so many acres. I don't even don't even know which direction my neighbors are Yeah, that actually would be pretty sweet Yeah Yeah, not cool for me not cool for me I want to go outside and run naked in my prairie. Oh god you that God confidence Could you move to Russia and do that? No, okay. I don't want that happening within a thousand miles of me Too late All right, so yeah, so that's that's a that's a big deal and then the next thing that I'm So school should start back up for me on August 20 you get a finally finish You didn't go for it get the home stretch done You know I'll just I'll just submit to everyone on there. I just don't Want to do it? I want to be done with this thing and I don't want to do one final burst of pain but yeah, so I'm kind of Constantly flipping that coin in the air and picking it up and re-flipping and picking it up and re-flipping Yeah, it's it is the last time but the idea of Going through another four months of all of my nights and weekends gone No pain no gain. Yeah, but I am thinking first you've already got most of the game. I am yeah, I've gotten all of the game That's the other thing too is I'm so wired for for return on investment right yeah, I am too old I am too old and Not from the the weariness part, but I'm at a stage in my career no one will actually care About this degree the only reason to do it is to be done It's not gonna get me a job in the future Right. Gotcha. It's not it's it's I've gotten what I wanted out of it. Yeah Anyway, there you go. So School may start for me in August. It may also start for me in January All right. We'll see how I will finish I have six years from the start to finish And I still think I have five or six semester starts left Alright, excellent. That's now I'm done. Okay a quick update of my fall travel schedule because it just got a little ridiculous In fact, I just in fact, I haven't sent the mail. I just made the choice last night To turn down I almost went to a conference in November because in Korea and I really wanted to go there But there's too much else going on. I'm heading off to Iceland next week Shouldn't that next week? No, not the week after and then in October. I thought I was going someplace in September end of September Very beginning of October over that weekend heading down to Anaheim to give a workshop at Star West popping back up north be home for about four days heading down to Portland for a couple days to Give a talk on modern testing and also a workshop at PNS QC which is one of my favorite conferences I think the size and caliber of presentations is usually pretty good. So I'm excited about that in Later in October. No. Yeah later in October. I'm home for like two weeks and then I'm going to Copenhagen and Helsinki on a work trip Home for about three more weeks and heading to Sweden for a week for a work trip and that should close out the weasel 2018 travel schedule I would have had to shove that two more weeks later hit that Korea trip But I was like that's I think it's enough. So doing that So shall we you have a sub in Korea or is that a no? No, the Korea trip was a conference request speaking speaking request And I thought about doing it because I actually I am trying to not speak at any test conferences in 2019 I may speak at Given the right opportunity. I'm trying to get out of If I've talked to you about this before I want to get out of the test. I Want to get out of the test conference speaking except for rare occasions. I will always speak at ministry test because it's like The test batches because they're really good and the audience actually gets it. It's it's a proper audience. But I I think I want to If I do more speaking I will do it more at Development center conferences. I think that's where my mind and content is is what improving software quality through better engineering and development practices so I think I may start focusing more there when I speak and just speaking a lot less in general because It's fun and it's great and people clap at you and they ask you questions. You feel all validated and stuff, but I think I want to focus my efforts elsewhere. I think I think that makes sense based on my My knowledge of you and your passions. I think you're done Sort of teaching testers how to test Yeah, right exactly. It's kind of not where we're going with modern testing I think it makes sense to start you going through and say okay No, we need to start teaching devs how to test Although I don't I think that may be premature quite honestly like I would suggest to you that No, there's still value in you going to the test conferences and teaching testers how to lead I think yes, but I'm gonna do that selectively test leadership conference in the one I did in New York That has some validity to it test bash as I mentioned before like an agile testing conference I could do but Again, I'm gonna be much more selective. I'm I'm I am done talking to Junior testers about how to get started in testing and test careers and all that stuff I want to help I and I think a Lot of what we need to do with testing is about Being a modern tester and someone just asked me on Twitter Jim Holmes. Hey Jim about Give a description of what it's like to be a modern tester. I like given the tautology answer of Well, actually it says no such thing as a modern tester But we do recognize I spoke for you. So we do recognize that Someone who leads the team towards following modern testing principles. I'm okay with calling them a modern tester Yeah, it's a leadership position and it's a position that I am happily grooming Most are all people in my team towards I mean they're they are Whether they know about modern testing principles or not. They're all kind of in a modern testing role right now In terms of like the the tipping point I I I don't think we're done here on this topic until We get a sufficient amount of the test community to understand that The content after the semi-colon in principle 7 is not only a good thing But something they should be working towards. Yeah, I want to walk Yeah, there is a lot of fear and people see it as it's like the controversial part and we'll talk will We're all the good time talking about that in our next recording. Yep But yeah, yeah, I think so. All right, so we do this week. Yes, we shall we shall and let me start let me start by Saying that I slapped I don't know if I CC'd you on this or not Maybe I mentioned it in slack But I did slap a creative commons attribution share like license on the modern testing principles To encourage people like it's totally yeah do whatever you want with them. It's so people have asked like can we copy these? Can we translate these? Yes attribute the source and do whatever you want change them for your team If you want attribute the source, it's totally fun Took out the middle man. No longer need to ask just the licenses there follow along I would be careful about changing for the team though, right? Some people could change it and turn it into something and that supports Traditional then it will yeah, it wouldn't really be modern testing anymore It says that would attribute the original they would go. Oh, okay, you've you've changed this There's a license give us the right to tell somebody to take it down if we discovered No, I don't want that. I want people if somebody wants to bastardize. I don't think they're going to I am a truster All right. I'm a truster and an enabler Maybe that last doesn't sound right. Okay, let me read to you modern testing principle number six. Oh my god It's been so long since the podcast started. It's about freaking time. Okay Number six we use data. Um, he thought I was gonna start didn't you you can read these at modern testing org number six we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between product hypothesis and business What does that mean? Well, we'll dive into a deeper Give it to me How would you Paraphrase that back to me. What does that mean? We do or and we meaning teams following modern testing principles or teams delivering software in this way Why is Actually, let's talk about why why is this important? Before I go on to that, that's a great question and we will get to it I want to read you a tweet that that I Don't know how I got it Follower of a follower of something and I'm gonna tell you This is relevant. Okay. Okay. I am listening to your tweet reading exploratory testing is the key to high quality software semicolon a highly intellectual and time-consuming activity Often pushed off to end users. How do you feel about this tweet it? And again, it's relevant. It is relevant and I had a similar tweet Exchange that just to continue on this morning about the same topic it reeks of ignorance To me. I am NOT first. I am NOT against exploratory testing total value in that Using data to understand customer usage and to close the gaps and monitoring etc Has nothing to do with shoving buggy software on to customers because you don't give a shit about them And there is a and I'm gonna get on my soap boxes. I'm pissed off about this because there are people in the industry Some with loud voices who tweet about the new tweet saying that or speak saying that Having customers, you know letting customers find bugs even if they're not actually finding them directly It's monitoring that's revealing these things is a horrible thing and it's lazy I had I saw one author. I can't call him an author one article writer Because in the internet, I guess everyone's an author I had an article where they mentioned testing and production as a last quote Maybe I'm quote me. I'm not quoting but as a last gasp resort to find bugs using the customers as testers so so anyway, that's why you triggered me because I see a very big lack of understanding on how to use monitoring how to use data and how freaking valuable it is done, right and They think it's just this lazy thing teams do because they don't want to do testing where that's not the case at all Was that the answer you wanted or did I kind of go? close You know if if If this Tweeter Had not used the words pushed off to end users. I would have had no problem. I Actually, I totally agree with the first half of that. I mean again to be cool. Yeah, anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna you talk I'm gonna breathe. Okay, it is not pushed off the end users So the the principal talks about validating the hypothesis Actually the way we word it is better than the way I'm remembering how we worded We close the gaps between the product hypothesis and the business impact. What does that mean? means when we wrote code We had a theory around what is valuable to be clear We had a hypothesis Right. Yeah, right. Well, I'll just say yes, right? Well, no, I'm a data scientist in my world Hypothesis is overloaded but I'll just say yes because it's not worth going into but There are for the record I win. Yes We have talked about this before in that is the problem with ET Now is it the key to high quality software? Probably now, but they're saying exploratory testing Okay, if this is something that's pushed off to an end user Then I'm gonna say it's not exploratory testing anymore. It's actually this clever thing that we call using the product Now when a customer is using the product, is it highly intellectual? Maybe Now I will say most products if it require highly intellectual You probably have a usability problem like customers don't want to have to think too hard to get their solution solved the time-consuming activity I also have a problem with a traditionalist point of view is we try to We try to prevent harm to the customer and we see it as as us Again, it kind of is like the the champions the champions of quality slide that I keep referring to that Alan has produced Right. We're a superhero team. Why are we letting that poor pregnant pregnant mom? Take the bullet instead of us. We should be doing it. That's not actually the reality today, I will let me share a Story and then I'm gonna go into a lot more on the the what why and how after you do you share your story? We'll comment actually have another tweet thread Highly related. I want to read to you. Okay, so we should do a whole episode of Alan and Brent read tweets No, actually would be fun I'm already vetoing the idea. Anyway, go on story time. All right it was my last week and bing and I'm sorry. I need to interrupt just for the the new listeners Bing is like Google. All right, go on All right, but Bing Bing Google's things really well, it's fine. It works moving on It was my last my last week in Bing my Executive had set up in all hands on the Wednesday and we had We had an individual from a partner team come in And they did a presentation because we had worked we had done a co-development project with that team and it and Finally shipped it well It was best essentially shipping a Bing app in in the Windows Store at the same time Google Was shipping an app into the Windows Store? in and this person told a story about about how We finally got this thing across the wire and one of the things that they owned producing was a sort of a documentation on how to streamline and get things into the ecosystem and They decided to produce us a slide deck around what not to do now they decided to use the Google app as an example because a month prior when they were first onboarding the Google app, they went through and they just found bugs everywhere and Much like I think this individual Would have done is just mocked how crappy the software was There were just bugs and bugs and bugs everywhere in the Google app, okay, so I Again fast forward a month later She's she's producing the streamline thing and she wants to get screenshots of what not to do so she's like aha, I will load the Google app and She loaded it. It of course had updated by that time and she failed to find any of the bugs that she had found earlier and She she actually commented on Yeah, it was amazing how how quick they were I do not understand how they did that and I pulled her aside and I said That is why Windows is having a problem The traditional point of view when you're in a world where you have a lot of software in your reaction time Like when you and I grew up in this company in this company Windows shipped every three years Everything shipped every three years, right? You did not you had to get it right the first time Did we ever? No, do we have any idea of how much we got it right the first time that didn't matter We have some like a Episode or two ago. I talked about kin right that was last time. Yeah, that was a traditionalist That started off in a traditionalist model Right and it was an unsuccessful product right Would the company like to have had? That time and that development money back you bet We talked multiple occasions about lean startup and the metric that matters and the decision to pivot and persevere This is what data brings to the party data allows you to Understand what parts of your product is being used What parts of the product isn't being used? And it allows you to scale the team by focusing your limited resources on The parts of the product that matter. Yes Yes. Yes there is a 12 minute answer to your question. Why? Data is critical to scale now If you combine these with the other principles, right? So this the the individual I was talking about before was amazed that she couldn't find any of the bugs in Google Right. I'm not Because I know Google instruments the crap out of everything They worked through When they saw errors coming in I know because I interviewed with Google years ago Right. They have a two-week release cycle. They go to or at least back then. I don't know what they do today Yeah, and again not Google in general says Google apps Mobile apps in this case. No, but this was this was this was the Google philosophy all up I don't know if it is still today but back then What they did is after the initial release they had They would have an individual or team of individuals after the release They didn't start working on the next features They the after their release the deep dove into the telemetry and go what is the problem that we have now? they're even smarter right because they they follow the practice of Continuous integration which means the number of bugs so you you you do end up shipping bugs But when you do continuous integration you have as long as you have the right monitoring in place As long as you have the right telemetry you end up turning around and fixing that bug the next day I think that's the piece that's missing from the mindset of people who see it as pushing things off Quick story on data then I want to read a tweet stream to you is When I worked on the project that I refer to as a stupid science project to make Android app. Yeah, my windows phone We had an offshore team of five maybe testers who? We just gave them who would test apps just Various Android apps they'd load on they'd side load onto windows phone They'd run them reporting about they found so we could figure out what was up with our system It got to a point to very very quickly where we said actually just stop entering bugs Run the scripts overnight because we knew from the data every morning when we come into work exactly what bugs they hit We knew where every single incompatibility was yep It was faster for us to look at the data and figure out what the problem was and dive in and and fix the bug if we could Then it was for them to enter the bug report. Oh, this is I know we have talked about this on multiple times on Before we actually even started talking about modern testing, right? It is absolutely my belief that the best way for testers right now to write automation is Write the automation as low generators. Yes, and you their validation from the product telemetry Let the telemetry be the Oracle Yes And I've always said in fact this may even be in how it does offer at Microsoft the Oracle is the hardest part to write The part that figures out whether the test pastor failed let the telemetry figure out what's going on Yeah, it's much easier because what I often ended up doing was but I remember having a whiteboard conversation in 1997 to discuss whether I could use get pixel to test set pixel and I thought and what I ended up You know taught at least whiteboarding would never doing was we whiteboard it out basically an implement a new implementation of get pixel to test set pixel and and luckily even in my Niamhiti was smart enough to think that was stupid And you know why? Because it was stupid. Yes, because it Exactly, let me read you this is actually it's interesting you brought up that tweet because To read to me because I don't know if you saw this tweet for me last week Or I said I did see something relevant Just because a team relies on customer data to understand or evaluate customer value or quality It doesn't mean that the team is relying on that customer to test the product To the people who keep saying the quota part of that sentence, which is the last part stop saying that then someone said Analytics are great, but they don't reduce the need to verify correct system under test behavior before shipping Unless your software doesn't matter much to people like a free game on your phone And I said actually in a lot of cases example web services It's much more efficient if my monitors detect changes and reject new code appropriately than if I took the time to verify correct Behavior before shipping. Yeah, and The reply I got back was how is it more efficient to break customers? All the information is available to you before shipping. You just have to look and be smart about looking what services do you ship broken and All kinds of the point I want to focus on there is no you Have all the information available to you you you don't know how the customer is gonna use your product You could never know that and to quote Eric Reese Show me a product that ships zero bugs and I'll show you a product that shipped far too late Brent we will not be able to show Eric Reese a product that shipped with zero bugs number one period right I'm sorry even even you know the simplest stupid tic-tac-toe app. I can guarantee you it shipped with bugs right the and the reason why and I'm bet you the developer knew it The reason why is because they made a decision these bugs don't matter oh Oh my god, really shipping a bug So the Google thing so here's the secret here's the secret customers want their problems solved and they want the least amount of time spent on friction due to bugs Okay, so code paths that customers don't use Guess what they don't care. It's not shipping a bug It does not mean the customer is broken. I know I know I know this reminds me actually I gave them presentation on metrics Well at least ten years ago if not longer and one of the joke slides. I made was a This is back when product is I can tell how old it was because remember had a mock-up of a product box when used to buy software in boxes yep, and For the bullet points in like bullet points of features like you know twice as fast as our competition Whatever I wrote like a bunch of stuff customers don't care about like over 20,000 test cases run 76% code coverage No customers don't give a crap about that stop thinking that customers give a shit about your testing effort They don't they don't care about your testing effort. They want their problem solved Yes, God and just get out of the mindset. I don't know why people think that Again, this was ten years ago back then when tests last Software and functional test teams were much more common still they didn't customers Don't care what the testing effort was as long as the software Allows them to solve their problems without making them want to throw their computer against the wall Yeah Right the reason why in the old days we would do all of this testing upfront is Because we didn't have the ability to react right today. We do right we had we would wait I mean the ability to react was wait for the bug reports to come in from the enterprise customers And then eventually build a service pack Right or a hot fix. Oh, yeah, if important a hot fix me um and Here what I'm essentially saying is Treat every release as a hot fix Yeah the Ship frequently ship small look at the data to to describe to you where to go next Let's get back on track here. I see you referring to your notes. So we're of one mind So the angry part is over for now. So the key it start no, no, no the key why is The data tells you where to focus. Yes Yeah, and as we've talked about many times before Speed is what's important in today's world. Mm-hmm. If you want to compete you need speed now caveat just like everything else We're saying this is the general rule There are exceptions Right even even in your current product, whatever it may be There's going to be a set of Hey even in a small Flight environment like with continuous integration you're shipping the prod constantly. I still recommend flight rings Where you're looking at monitors and then you you you then slowly widen the number of customers that can get it Let's move on and talk about a little about a little looking at the clock What is how does the modern tester lead a team to do this? Like like, how do you? How do you make your team use data in a way that that? Closes gaps. So we we did episode 82. Yes, and that was actually a good prequel So at this point you could pause go from the 82 and go. Oh, that's a good idea Huh, so the how is actually covered really well in 82 you're right. It is in terms of evaluating Your your your product hypotheses and the in That's what's important like we would rather Test focus on how to improve the business How to improve let's say the value or the revenue of the business Rather than what they're accustomed to which is how to reduce the cost. Okay, but that said You know I don't know that any test team would ever do this. I think it would be really freakin smart for test teams to do this But then so once their product ships, so let's say they want to go through and do the prescriptive and preventative testing model once Now go back and look at the data and Try to evaluate how much of your time was wasted. How much of your time? Did you spend testing enough? Testing a feature that got three users still, you know go look at the place that got a thousand users and see what problems they're having because That's probably what's more important. But if you go back and you go what miss if you take the product telemetry and say hey Where did the So but let's pretend well, you actually you're a test director. Okay, so Our quality director So yeah, cuz I don't care about testing. I care about quality. Yes so but you still and I don't know if it's changed but as of What was it a year ago when I came and presented to your team? Right you had testers sure. Okay from a management point of view You're accountable For where your team invests its time. Yes I Your philosophy is to sort of delegate those decisions, but ultimately you hold the accountability Like because you made a decision to delegate those decisions. Sure. I'll not disagree It'd be worthwhile to go. Okay, where did your investments pay off? Right. It's a few had a month-long test pass that was scheduled I Just I just threw up all over the conference room It's hyphen never never again in my life. Would I do something like that? How dare you even mention that? Yeah, you may continue All right. It's worthwhile looking at the data and then Okay, so maybe maybe you're gonna go done down this this this path, right? Maybe we've opened your eyes a little bit to Hey, there is a better smarter way Maybe you're in a position where you're like, hey, how do I convince my executives? Right the data helps you make this transition as well You go look, you know what? I don't think this is the right way. I don't think this is the efficient way For us to deliver quality software. I think we need to get continuous integration going I think we need to get I did the data right This month-long test pass cost our business Depending on the size of business like it wouldn't be uncommon and For a month-long test pass that costs well over a million dollars just in payroll let alone the hardware costs right and Look, we got three customer clicks on this feature Right. I don't think we're using our resources efficiently The other thing is Customer it is not true that Shipping bucks of customers is breaking the customer It is also not true that it's a violation of some unwritten test law Also true in in the modern testing thing we want devs to be held accountable for code correctness We want QA to be held accountable for the quality culture and the delivery of quality and It is definitely not the case that if is I could see someone responding to this effect is like Hey, if just one customer hits the bug Then it's a big, you know catastrophic problem Catastrophic problems are things like customer does something and it deletes their data store. Mm-hmm, right or it corrupts their OS or It publishes their credit card Numbers to the dark web. These are catastrophes and you It is absolutely true that you should still continue to prevent though that type of code from going up into the wild But a lot of the times the the product hypothesis is wrong. We've we have talked on multiple occasions that Who values your product often isn't even like in a v1 situation. This is very often the case who values your product is Often not the customer you're targeting Yeah, and again for the third time probably on this podcast will refer you the chapter 8 of the lean startup With the pivot or persevere chapter with all the different kinds of pivots you may make based on what you learn from your customer About how they use the product you learn from the data Who your customers really are and what's important to them? Sure completely agree now going into Into data I'll add You know one one caveat Right once you go into the data, there's a whole rich rural infrastructure on on this right privacy You can go too far. I think once you start getting into the data world. I think we need to start talking about ethics Yeah, right We want from a quality world we want to benefit the business by making our customers happier doing things with the data that they generate that If they knew about it wouldn't make them happier is a likely ethical problem Yeah But there are other requirements and then we know you know we GDPR Government requirements. So going into the data space does come with its own bureaucracy But it is vastly better particularly when you combine it with the other principles we talked about the theory of constraints continuous integration it ends up being a less risky in a much better way of of building product quality. Mm-hmm. Let me our Conversation so far reflects a lot on web services Now we can ship multiple times a day and get this data very quickly and hypothesis driven I want to talk a little bit about how these things apply to slower Shipped products. I don't think there's much of anything that ships every three years anymore No, but if you're a product that ships I mean there is Download fatigue from customers even with apps that they're seeing updates every day for your app, although it can happen in an area in if you're having some bad bugs coming in but There's a level of fatigue or ship There's a level of download fatigue users can go through. So aside from that let's say you're gonna ship your product every two months Two weeks. It's okay every two weeks. Thank you You may Have a brand new feature you want to get out because customers really need this and it's really easy for people to Sort of hand wave around solving a customer problem by just saying a customer asked for this. They gotta have it I gotta get into I'm gonna ship it and I say great ship it to them Do you have how do you know if they're going to like it? We're gonna call them and ask them Yeah, I would say if you're shipping every two weeks or especially if you're shipping everything three months But if you're going to ship something new because you think it solves a customer problem You better damn well have the data to help you figure that out I think what you may not be able to so on the data front, right? Sure call the customer. That's the data point Another common thing is is either a proactive or a reactive survey Sure, just understand that both of these things are considered to be very low quality data Yes, and the point I'm getting to is Sure, all this stuff works in a lot of the examples you see from talks on the internet and articles are around shipping web services Or websites things that can ship and update where you can react very very quickly But the point I want to make is even if you have something that can't react very very quickly You still need to use your better serve to rely on that data to help you understand much much more about customer usage customer quality customer experience Right and the other thing is I find we started the podcast off with this sort of concept and I find that people take a Take a strong stand on on a principle basis. So for example You know shipping bugs to customers is you know, apparently Just natively evil, right? But even if you're in the situation where you where you only ship once every three months That doesn't mean you have to accept That that's the way it should be the next time we ship right? There are always ways to improve this so for example, I I my phone is an Android and I've noticed that there are two different sort of update models. There is the There there appears to be a model where an app will indicate it needs to be updated and Android will will just silently handle that update for me But there also appears to be a model where the app itself you launch the app and it says Hey, I need to be updated and it didn't signal to the Google app management system To do the update for me right am that in place app that in app update That irritates me it should right the one where the app or the Update happens, maybe you tell me after the update that hey I updated right I got that one of these this morning said 14 apps were updated. So you're all cool. Yeah, then my But then for me it seems like four out of five of the times I have to do the in app update It's then a Wi-Fi required. Oh, I haven't and actually I've never seen that one. So I would imagine it happens when the app needs an update, but the Google Store hasn't propagated the update yet Yeah, so in that particular case if I were an app developer and let's say it was Google's problem if it wasn't Google's problem Then I would I would be looking at our code and going okay How do we make it Google's problem because it is a better user experience in my humble opinion to just let Google manage the updates but if it if it is already Google problem and so maybe Maybe Google only does the update, you know once a day or does that check? Once a day and and the app just updated three seconds ago Right. The app is telling me hey, I need to be updated That situation what I would do is is is talk to Google and say hey, how do we make this experience more seamless? right the You're right customers have update fatigue But what I'm saying is that doesn't mean you stand on the principle and say we don't do updates No, we figure out how to do the updates and we remove the fatigue Absolutely, and you see all kinds of apps do that. It's pretty common now for apps to have an update or To just download silently or and install patch style updates in the background. I think it's totally expected It's okay, let's hear on Windows and every damn single one of them requires a reboot and that's annoying, too Yeah, okay. Get my windows jab in. Okay Let me summarize Data is important. It it means you actually care more about the customer not less about them It's actually a more efficient way to evaluate the customers perception of value or customers Yeah value of the product one thing to bring up here is People ask me what's different about modern testing versus agile testing and this it's a lot the same It's a lot about whole team delivery. One of the things we really call out that's not called out explicitly or at least not that much in the agile testing books is this use of data and how important it is because You and I and people who believe modern testing principles and a lot a lot a lot of engineering teams around the world realize that data is critical to Understanding and using data is critical to understanding customer quality and production Using data, so you just made a point using data It I forget how you say it but some of the lines of it is not actually harming the customer It is actually better for the customer. Right, right? Am And still and just because it allows you to Scale up your let's say it's a pure traditional testing Facility it allows you to scale up your testing resources on the things that actually matter to the customer. Yes Right, you can help you target your testing. Yes absolutely Yeah, and what might maybe let me add this metaphor Well, if you have time is in the old days way back in the 20th century We may look at code coverage and we'd figure out where we had missing tests And we still do this today in our unit test and go make sure we have tests for the areas that don't have coverage We can use data in a similar way to understand if you look at customer Usage patterns as a method of coverage. You can look and see where they're using the product and make sure We have and actually that may help you target. Okay customers are really using this 30% of the product Let's go invest some of that time-intensive intellectual exploratory testing there. How about this? How about it? You set up an experiment that Routes 10% of the traffic to a co coverage instrumented build. Yes. I've done that before Right, and then you compare the co coverage of your test suite to the co coverage coming from your usage suite Yep, fantastic Now that means now you have a decision, right? Okay. Should you solidify where there's existing co coverage or Do you fill the holes? right, so if you see that that oh This one one class is just used like freakin crazy But there's a couple of lines of code that don't have testing right you maybe you you bolster up that unit test before you You cover the test suite that that usage doesn't even hit right? Matter of fact, I would I'll tell you what I would do in that particular case. I'd like hey Do we have this feature turned on? Right. There's this whole library that's not even touched First off is it is it actually instrumented? Do we screw up when we deploy this thing? But assuming it is Right. What is this code doing? Is it turned on? if so Okay There's something wrong with it because customers can't find it customers aren't using it Let's figure out if actually this is something we should continue. Yeah, that's an example of we're gonna look at the data and and Prove or disprove our hypotheses on how we think the product works and it's being used Yeah, the You know another way of making higher Quality code here and talking about code correctness another way of making high quality code one of my employees says and I like this the difference between a a four star and a five star developer five star developer Doesn't add code. They remove it. That would be one attribute. Yeah. All right Okay, I hope we have beat our opinions and thoughts on data and it's important into your heads and next time We'll cover the to some not all slightly controversial Principle number seven. Okay, I am still Alan and I'm Brent and we'll see you next time
