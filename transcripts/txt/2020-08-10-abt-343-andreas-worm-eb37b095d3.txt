This is the AB testing 343 podcast a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast three questions about almost anything ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started We're back again for another ABT 343 and this time all the way from Germany, I think is Andres warm One yeah. Hi. Thanks for having me. Yeah one just like the one on the ground and But spelling wise it's it's spelled worm Okay, that's a pronunciation. Yeah For the for the Americans, which is I only bring that up because your nickname on our slack is really cool It's it's a nice little pun global warming and I love it I guess I always Always thought it's called one because earth one Jim is I think we have it's one It works. Just just just just ignore my American ignorance. I love the name I'm super glad to have You know on this podcast I ask a few questions usually three plus tangents so more three or more questions To one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast. So as sort of a pre question, I'm curious How did you learn about the podcast or modern testing? Where did you learn about this thing that Brent and I call modern testing? I Somehow stumbled upon your podcast. I'm not sure if I saw it on LinkedIn or on the MOT slack someone linked me to episode 104 and That was the first time I heard about the podcast and your your seven principles and Yeah, and a few episodes after Joined the one of three slack. So what did we talk about in 104? Oh, that's a great question Maybe we turn off investment Maybe I'm sure I could look it up Just curious Brent sometimes remember these of course we have some episodes that we Always remember like we know like we talked about so-and-so in such episode It's caught leading quality with one Sean Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that one was a good interview with a bad recording On the old equipment. We have better equipment. That's why this one sounds so much better a bit How have you applied modern testing to any of the work that you've done, you know since you found the podcast Since I found the podcast, that's hard. I Because I didn't really do much. I Just discovered it like a week or two weeks ago, and I'm currently without a project. So there's no real real code base or team or product I could apply anything to I Thought about starting an old part of my own podcast. Maybe I can Introduce some quality there or get rapid feedback Whatever No, I discovered. Well, I basically lift the or some of the principles for a long time most things on the list I Already did because I had the had the luck to to learn in a very quality focused environment so things like customer first Quality inbuilt from the beginning and sharing knowledge and continuously improving Have been always there as you said, as you said the quality the principles are very old You They're not so new nothing nothing. Yeah, nothing new you've made my point for me So let's get the softballs aside Let's talk about scrum. I know you are a supporter of scrum and I want to talk about that and also That you have seen scrum used incorrectly a lot. So Let's just go with that. Tell me about your experience with scrum How your problems you've run into how it's helped with modern testing and I'm gonna sit back and listen to you Teach me for a while after I finished my three years of learning to be a software developer, I basically did the scrum master certification and the place where I learned and worked Knew about scrum. My my boss was a supporter of scrum and As like scrum as like one of the best methodologies to develop complex software products we had a team of like five six people and We tried to do scrum to be agile no No scrum implementation is perfect. We were always learning but We were very aware of some of the Missing parts of scrum. We didn't do scrum correctly, but we applied as much as we could or as we wanted to have an environment of continuous improvement and learning and not doing the same the same about twice and yeah having having a customer focus and working with data and one of the Maybe I should tell about the project So we have a little bit of context that I'm what I'm talking about our little company of six people mostly developed event ticketing system the storefront where you could buy tickets for for concerts and museums and these things online Pretty local and we had like at any time 6,000 events active, which is I guess nothing compared to huge I don't know what your local equivalent is yeah, but for our team pretty pretty nice and yeah, we did this for our client and one problem we Often came back to was our missing product owner because When you when you go with the scrum guide you want to have like self-sufficient autark what was the term? The word escapes me, but you want the team to have all the ability to do and make decisions and Develop the product we Were working for a client. So the client had much say and Which direction we went and what to develop and Yeah, sometimes the the So you could you could say the client was the product owner but you could Yeah, and the role the role the person's the person's changed from time to time and we had better product owners and sometimes worse product owners and and Yeah, that was one issue In hindsight, it would have made maybe made sense to to fight for autonomy To say hey come we we align on the basic goals you want to achieve the basic like the customer segments you want to to Talk to to have more conversion with whatever and let us handle the the tasks and how to do it and How to get the feedback and But in hindsight, that's easy to say I'm gonna have you I'm gonna put you on the hot seat here with some special questions because I have my I Can't say that I hate scrum because I don't I think it's valuable and useful and often Misused so I don't think I'm gonna tell you anything you haven't heard before I miss use Let me give you some complaints I have about scrum and just kind of give me your answers on them Just for those you listening along there has been no prep for these. He is completely on the spot. So I will ask try to ask these in an open-ended way, so one is The rituals of scrum there are a lot of meetings that go along with the scrum framework. There's the daily stand-up Which we can go into which it has some pros and cons When done right or wrong and as a tangent It seems like every day on the internet someone publishes an article saying why agile doesn't work and they describe some horribly Bastardized version of agile and you go. Yeah, of course you don't get it. That's why it doesn't work so so going back to scrum rituals, there's the There's the backlog grooming and the daily stand-up and the retros and there are probably a few other ones. I'm forgetting so What are some pros and cons of? Let's just stick with daily stand-up and Actually, let's talk about all that lead up. What are the pros and cons? What are the ways the daily stand-up is? Extremely important part of scrum and what are some ways in that meeting can be useless Let's let's first distinguish between age and scrum a child when I talk about a When I talk when in my mind agile is the main resource for agile is the age of manifesto and I love okay. I like talking about scrum more because scrum has a more concrete Rule set you can compare to it and I'm gonna stop go on go on I was gonna interrupt and give away your answer for you. So keep going so Whatever the actual implementation is you're you are doing all the all the rituals mentioned in the scrum guide and You can okay. That's our main source for doing scrum is a scrum guide and These rituals have a purpose These rituals don't add meetings or are a waste of time because any everything you do in these rituals must be done to build something and scrum tries to Say, okay. Why don't you use at regular intervals these ways of communicating and collaborating to build something because you have to do it anyway, that's why the most effective way of communicating and collaborating and sharing new information aligning on goals and get feedback from stakeholders and Quality what what's the second part of the question? Because I have a love relationship, okay stand up without leading you I'm gonna see if you can guess why I think the stand-up It can be awesome and why it often isn't through discovering I'm doing a lot more on On the learning side because I have a project and I also discovered the liberators network and the Zombie scrum, do you know of that? Yes, you read my mind you're in my head. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it's very very interesting You can boil that down to you have to have passion excitement new things you don't want to have to Trot over into the meeting room. Yeah yesterday. I did this and that now I'm not blocked. Okay, see you tomorrow Yeah, you have to keep it fresh exciting and one thing I'm Recently learning is the importance of the sprint goal and in hindsight That was something which could have helped us very much in our Eight years of developing this event ticketing system and doing scrum there Keep it. Yeah Keep it interesting Yes The difference with you over a lot of people that have done scrum is they kind of pick a little bits of it And it doesn't quite work. I think the sprint goal It's a pat lunch. You only calls the rally and cry getting a team to a line about around something I think that's super important as well And then the zombies the zombie stand-ups people Every day saying they're working on the same thing and it's the same thing that did yesterday and they're never blocked on anything Which is really comes down to the importance of a good scrum master for the team And I am missing out on there's a really good book. I read and recommend on Being a scrum master and if you're doing scrum, I think go ahead We didn't have a scrum master either So that's the challenge that I think It's Incredibly important to have a good scrum master Someone who knows what to do and can dig past those things and this book that I'm talk I can't find I don't want to search for it any longer while I'm talking here So I'm not going to but it does a good job talking about the role of the scrum master as a servant leader for the organization and Helping the team be successful and aligning them on what they're doing Asking the right questions to get the team that did the right level of communication for that team to be successful Which aligns very well with the agile manifesto and agile principles Which I think a lot of people who do scrum haven't they think of scrum as being equal to agile for so Thanks for calling that out that they're not and then You are talking about people saying Agile doesn't work because we are doing scrum wrong and I'm saying yeah, we are doing scrum wrong But agile did work. I have seen enough people Make mistakes with scrum that I prefer not to use it But I have nothing against scrum being used properly But I think you are gonna need someone to play the role of scrum master for it to really work well for the team Honestly scrum is a nice transition for those used to more Traditional models because it gives you you get nice little tight iterations. In fact done poorly Scrum is an example of the spiral model of software delivery can be a way of accelerating waterfall done poorly but if you actually Understand how scrum works within the frame of agile it can actually be very effective. So I have nothing against it I just seems to be done wrong a lot So it's kind of scared me away from recommending it to a lot of teams Versus just coaching them towards understanding the principles of agile in the first place. I'm off of myself box in your notes You said that you like scrum, but mostly for egocentric reasons. I'd like to hear some more about that yeah, the the the best part about the wedding cry and and the consumer and customer centric view is Motivation Because I'm I'm deriving lot of purpose in my life for my work So as long as you can convince me that my work is valuable I will be much more motivated to work and doing doing boring stuff doing stuff where I Don't see the value for the customer doing something which is just thrown in the bin Which was clear before and will totally demotivate me and I guess many people Will suffer from this fate when they don't see the bigger picture then they don't see the value added when they don't make lives better it's It's easier to follow when you have some someone who's really passionate and has has you has you convinced that what you are building is great. I Don't see that as Egotistical to me that's about having a sense of purpose for your work And I tie that back to Dan Pink's works like you need to have autonomy mastery and sense of purpose you need to be able to figure stuff out and Be able to do it and feel like you're in like what you work on matters and that's not egotistical That's just it is taking care of yourself But it's you know when I look at Dan Pink's those three principles that I just mentioned It's kind of like Maslov's hierarchy of needs. It's what we need to do to be successful in knowledge work So I'm okay with that. I don't call that egotistical But it's if you give people work they enjoy that they feel like matters They're going to do better work and create higher quality output. So I am all over that Okay, good to hear that's good to hear as a much younger person than me. It's good to hear the younger generation Figuring out that's important. So I like that. Yeah, I don't know if I figured that out of it's just really the The awesome environment I was learning and we didn't have a scrum master, but we had We had two people with scrum master certifications my boss a really really great mind and Always pointing out the the the problems We had by by applying the scrum guide and saying okay We have a problem with doing three weeks week sprints come let's try to let's try one. Okay, what is what? What is happening? So he was basically a teacher coach mentor And a great scrum master, but also the world shifted sometimes sometimes I was a scrum master and He was focused on more on development. Sometimes someone else was for the sprint having trying to have more like an overview about the the team and the the things we do But that was very hard because we were all developers and we all wanted to develop fancy stuff and great things and Yeah, it's the focus sounds like a good boss excited about that Hey one last thing I'd like to talk about which is the thing on everyone's mind these days Covid so first off, how's it going with you with do you have a family you live by yourself? How's it going with you dealing with? Whatever is going on in your part of the world. I think in Germany things have opened up a little bit more but not much Yeah, I mean it's Comparatively good you see low numbers like thousands But you see an increase now that schools and businesses are reopening again Yeah, that was to be expected. I Was lucky to to just have finished project and I could just go to the office By myself or I could stay at home. I Basically the whole April was on vacation Yeah, and after that I was alone in the office So no no contact there no risk. I have a wife I Have a son who is going to be three years old That's the really stressful part Because yes, I have noticed that too I have a lot of employees with young kids and I have had a lot of young kids join meetings Which can be funny but but related to the the risk of infection even even though the early data suggested that children below a certain age aren't really suspect to the virus and don't face like severe consequences, but the long-term effects and We have a grandma who couldn't visit Yeah, and the soul 24-7 being a dad at home was quite a challenge sometimes Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep So there is safety however in online communities and I believe you just joined LinkedIn recently So what's that experience been like? Yeah, I thought because projects are slow. I just try to be more active on LinkedIn, maybe there's Business value in that I'm quite Surprised I'm it's already and it's already been proven valuable just to It's just funny learning aspect. I'm I discovered a lot of interesting people a lot of interesting thoughts and a lot of updates on my Knowledge of scrum and some different philosophies and advancements Try to to to get into discussions and maybe post one or two things I'm really Confident about that's not we hashed that's some of which no thoughts and hopefully helpful to someone Yeah, engaging in discussion and debates are great way to learn. Yeah, definitely Congratulations on on get now. I should have done. I should have done that earlier. Oh It is what it is Great. Well, that's going to bring us to the about to the end of our time here today But I enjoyed the conversation especially kind of dive in to scrum a little bit and kind of hearing what's going on in your world I want to thank you again for joining our Community at one of the three dot slack comm and then for volunteering to be on this podcast where we try and get a little bit more information around people on the podcast So thank you for that and any final words or or actually maybe share some ways people can learn more about you or get a Hold of you out in the real world It's hard in the real world. You can you can connect to me on linkedin but I don't really have an a Channel a personal channel to spread my my thoughts and joined one of the three dot slack calm Warming or global farming there. Yeah, and also on the Ministry of Testing podcast Slack, I'm sorry Ministry of Testing slack Yeah, you can find me on the the vanity serenity BDD a guitar chat Well, that's basically it. I think a lot of our community is bound to come across you at some point if they haven't already Yes It's good to have to remember rememberable nickname Yes, very much. All right. Well, thanks again. Say goodbye and we will get going Thanks for having me. Bye
