Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey Britt hey Alan back again aren't we we are after a little bit of a delay I hate technology technology blows whatever just got a new I got some more home decided to go all in on Google got like some nest stuff to replace my old nest stuff from the old house which which nest stuff got a lot about I got the desk doorbell I got the nest locked to replace my old ring and thermostat thermostat of course yeah because I can't even I'm too stupid now I can't make a normal thermostat work and why should we have to we shouldn't have to so and of course I can control it off my phone so that's cool until I until it screws up and I just thought I hate technology again yeah I don't see that happening so anyway I haven't put it's in a box on my you ever used it did you use it on your last house no I had a different lock but this one's cool cuz I can tell if I remembered to lock the house but I anyway I'll let you know you'd please do like this got a box of crap so I'm all in on the Google hardware stuff I've got two of the mini speakers I've got one of the tablet minis speaker thingies forget what they call it the the only thing I'm disappointed with is so as we talked about last time I have the new refrigerator it's a Samsung one it's got a huge friggin else or LCD panel on it or touchscreen panel on it but its voice control is Bixby oh and I can't stand Bixby yeah I it's on my phone of course I was Samsung phone but I don't use it I don't either I don't know anyone that does apparently in the in the Samsung 10 you have the option of disabling it and replacing it right it really I hear I have a galaxy 10 I haven't figured it out you have a 10 oh my I'm on there are apps to remap the Bixby button yeah but Samsung used to keep releasing every time someone found a way to remap it yeah they would release a new thing that anyway what I can't stand is I can't stand saying hi Bixby like the name Bixby just doesn't roll for me I'm gonna call you that now Bixby yeah yeah so speaking of come highly related or partially related highly more political you made the comment that Samsung wanted to block people from using the button to disable it you're aware of the controversy with Blizzard Blizzard no so Blizzard banned a user for being all up in that and I forget exactly what he did or said but they banned him and for being pro Hong Kong yes and but so many people were leading their accounts in protest that they removed all foot they made it virtually impossible for people to remove their accounts to delete their accounts they took out the like they disabled I I I haven't disabled mine because I haven't used my blizzard account in years maybe decade but I was reading on the internet which is always a source of good information sometimes that they were that people were unable to delete their accounts because there are four different ways they could do it and they were all disabled in some way okay so I don't understand that strategy how does that help because the thing I would do next is I would go to PayPal or go to my credit card company like if and just disable it there I would just cancel it right no I don't care if they ask for auto-pay do not send them money I don't know if a lot of people would figure that out yeah man so we got some stuff to talk about got a little bit of a late start and so we should probably get going what do you think yo yeah yeah I actually I didn't I didn't realize that that's how blizzard responded so I love you should go look into that I love this not anymore man you're gonna burn that shit I love the star craft franchise but yeah that's that's a bunch of crap yeah so and there's lots of stuff it's weird lots of stuff happening in the world showing should we go in order and get going do the order order on the order of the things on the board I was gonna say what do you want to jump around take a big McMuffin there was more stuff on the list I gave you but let's just start with that so we've been doing a I was chatting with Brett yesterday about our topics for today we were in our planning meeting yes planning meeting over slack I said what do you have for tomorrow right so I got nothing I said okay here's some further I didn't even realize that we were recording yet today he looked in his bag of nothing and there wasn't even a calendar reminder no there was I mean nothing so I don't remember what was on the list or how we got there let's go ahead and start with what you put on the board which is a a vagary a variation of that recently for those of you that don't know maybe new listeners I work at Unity technologies making game development software that is not recent and I've been there for almost three years before that it by the way that is an Allen record no no no remember I'm not in the same job I was hired to do I take that back so yeah two years Brett used to say this I said no no that's not right but in hindsight he was exactly right because I tend to stay in a job for two years and and maybe this is not a tangent this is very modern testinings what happened is modern testinish testinish testing ish got it it's really it's empty adjacent by the way if you have modern testing stories please ping me because I'm giving a talk next month where I'm sharing modern testing stories and so far I have to to share which are awesome and I want to this is tangent inception I'm sorry I wanted to thank you know Lisa Crispin author of agile testing and a pure famous an awesome person who listens to the podcast has been so supportive I really I'm humbled because she promotes the show and supports the show and is a just a big supporter which is really cool because she's done she and Janet Gregory with agile testing and the stuff she's done on her own they've done some cool stuff so that's that's pretty awesome but she gave me a story about modern testing that I'm going to share at this talk next month at or a dev but she got a co-worker also at Mabel different department entirely to write up with graphics and everything which I will use his own story about how he's using modern testing so I'm great two awesome stories different same company different aspects of the company and different approaches but super cool looking for more but just really appreciate the support from all three listeners are you looking for a complete empty story or or people who are using the principles to make their lives yes that one that one oh we should have a ton of those on the three yeah yeah yeah yeah I hope so yeah and there's one I'll probably dig one out of I have some other conversations I've had where I've asked some people who have we're kind of doing modern testing before we put a name to it and assign principles to it so we can dig up I mean there's a lot of those type of stories here at Microsoft right I have your last your last you have your last team at unity right um so send them my way but I think something not us is yeah yeah you can comment on the blog you can email me Alan at angry weasel calm just let me know if you have those stories I'm glad to get those from you like you can mail them to me I can talk to you on zoom we begin to get them verbatim but anyway I brought that up changing jobs because I worked myself out of the job I was hired to do at unity which is also reflecting is something I've not the first time I've done that it's become a habit with me and I don't know why I do it but it's just it's like it's some negative I you're right right I think some people would see it as negative but that's sort of the way I do things I try I optimize what I the tasks I was given or the goals I was given until I'm no longer needed so I did that my last job at unity have a new job which again took me about just like the first one about two months in I figured out what the long-term path was it'll take a while how to make my how to eliminate the need for my why why not my job 16 months well I've been there since April May June so you got your left I've been if I've been in this group almost six months so I'm about a year and a half left to make my job obsolete okay and what I imagine is within the next six months my job will morph and then it might reset that timeline but we'll see we'll keep in touch so one of the things I've been involved with recently and one of the things I was involved with even at a much deeper level at Microsoft were something at Microsoft originally called ladder levels then called career stage profiles then called career guides a lot of companies called career maps and we called job architecture and what it is is and everyone's seen this if not there are numerous examples on the internet a grid a matrix of descriptions that describe what people do at a company at different levels of career advancement or development and usually they give these names at Microsoft you are a you are an SDE one then an SDE two then a senior then a principal then a partner then a fellow then a whatever it's been interesting I'm gonna kick this off I'm gonna go back to you say you have some strong opinions on this but right now I'm trying to roll my eyes so hard they've actually turned 360 it's really creepy they've come all the way back around I didn't know eyes could do that yes I'm trying to make sure it comes across on the podcast so let me be so there are pros and cons and I was able to meet with one of our HR directors before I started at Unity and they were talking about this process of they wanted to build do something like this and I gave them all the warning so here's the challenge here's the balance we you need to deal with the companies that have this one you absolutely need to provide some guidance to managers and employees on how people can grow their career and advance and get better and provide more value to the company however it is a fine line between that and creating a culture where people only worry about being promoted and I see it's it's like in the horror movie when you start to see the flashes of the dark side like pop through go go away maybe if I ignore it it will happen again there's some worry in some parts of the company when I talk to people about this I think it's it's a difficult it's a difficult thing to navigate I think it's more of a managerial problem than an employee problem and a leadership problem than an employee problem but we can all take part to try to make sure it's really easy to go to the dark side and I'm gonna stop there and as a Brent eyes are actually spinning backward he looks like a reverse slot machine I'm hoping they come up cherries anyway I'm gonna shut up and let Brent talk about his thoughts on this for all before I go any deeper all right so here's the first thing good I wouldn't want you to start with the second or third thing awesome okay now I'm starting with the third thing no I'm not first thing okay when you put in these sort of structures you got to think you think about the good and the bad and that's that's what you're doing okay but any tool just like automation co-coverage example any tool that can be used for good can be used for evil and will be indeed now there is something it happens quite often at least here at Microsoft when it comes to promotions this is all limited by budget every company will have a budget that they allocate to it I don't know how unity does that but we have a budget guarantee you have a budget right that's one of the things it's very similar there's a budget and you're expected to be thin the budget and yeah yeah so here's one trick that companies will use and be very wary of it in the end that is they will frame it totally in the positive oh we need to have a way to set a career path so that people can get promoted when it comes to budget for example oh we want to differentiate our top reward people so you know 9% or 10% now my eyes are rolling 10% of all of you of your people need to be in the top rewards so that sort of behavior that even more than even having the the models there in the first place is what encourages people to focus on being promoted focus on trying to get in that top percent versus doing the right thing for the customer if our priority I'm attached to modern testing our priority is improving the business our priority is not freaking getting promoted well so there's two businesses in play so we'll talk this out again alright because I'm now I'm getting boilie here I'm taking my jacket off yeah so let me first close on on why I was bringing up that that top 10% budget okay now I don't have enough knowledge of how other companies do this but here as you go into different tiers the rewards is nonlinear yes okay so when they push a model that says top 10% and you have a limited budget what does that force to happen you give your top 10% to the people lower in levels because they take less of your budget yep and that's that's for sure one thing that happens until they until they say oh and you have to do it by band or something silly like that I'm sure that's the next thing that they'll say but what it does is it forces you to take a huge chunk of your budget and distribute that and a lot of the times this is my biggest problem with that it creates a hero culture mm-hmm okay because what in order to let's say I had to raise Brent let's say I had 10 people and I had to do 10% that meant one of my person people had to be all the way to the top okay in order to pay for that I have to put everyone else below average right even if they are yeah and even if they aren't now what happens though when you do that is it is it creates a culture of that one person versus the rest of the team it creates and this is my one of the biggest reasons I left Microsoft is and and anyway in any of the flashes I've seen none of this bad there have been there are no inclinations at my current company to do any sort of rewarding like this we try and reward fairly we have a pretty decent budget do it and we but anyway this culture of competition where it's not about the hero doesn't give a crap about the customer the hero the hero is the hero is concerned with being a hero and my last I've thrown one of the bus before the last group I worked in a Microsoft team so it's hands down the worst at this stuff the most I think toxic gets thrown around a lot as a word so I won't call it toxic I'm gonna say the words what's in your head toxic but it was an unhealthy culture where people were far more concerned about promotions and looking good and getting into those top reward bands than they were about actually doing the right thing for the customer and it just drove me batty I love the times the reason why you see that as well as this is a defensive action like the only way to make sure you don't get a bad review is to play this game and and compete to get a good one yep right so a lot of folks are just trying to avoid pain I have to do this because if I get another bad review I'll lose my job there are two businesses involved when it comes to promotions right there is the business that employs you and there's also the your personal business off for example here if I were guiding you I would say you need to consider the business of Alan right you have a right to to get the best pay you you can right and but not here I'm saying on the open market like your skills are sellable like it you this is taking a pure economic point of view we talked about pink many times like that is that is not always appropriate and most often absolutely not but let's imagine let's say it's it's a year and a half from now you've yet again succeeded in automating yourself out of a job but this time there's no home for you and you're like you know what I'm ancient you know I've always wanted to do this nonprofit consulting gig right but doing that you're gonna go to 50k a year right now if you love what you're doing enough maybe that's worth it so this is a good and relevant example because as I don't have a wrench in on air but I will spend three years I can do it now I took a definite total comp pay cut to go to unity and I have not once reg even watching the Microsoft stock go up I haven't once regretted it because it's the the exponential improvement in mental health and quality of life means a lot more so pink is exactly right pay people enough and I get paid enough where money is not an issue I'm paid well I'm paid enough that money isn't an issue and I don't focus on and maybe this maybe this ruins my own career development right don't focus on getting promoted I just wanted I want to help people I want to do the right things I believe in servant leadership I want to provide a service for our organization and I like doing that so there is a balance so what I saw at Microsoft and Whitaker and I used to talk about this extensively where we would see people in we would see people in Peter principle there and what happens is your value and you know this happens there are people at Microsoft whose value to the company is far more than their value on the open market and Whitaker used to joke that we should have all these all partners and maybe it was Dan Masi who came up with this now I can't remember but it doesn't matter we had the notion that people a partner level and above which is the high bonus high stock level Microsoft all those people should have to interview for an external job once every two years and show an offer that shows that they're actually worth that money and the argument is the one I just made those people are more valuable out internally to Microsoft than they are externally to Microsoft so it the idea that while the notion was fun to talk about it would never work but I'll ask you how do you deal with I mean what's the so you have someone in a role who's been who's played this game forever to a level where they are paid more than their worth but they're still playing this game and I want to get back on the track of levels again in a minute but yeah now I'm talking about things that pissed me off about Microsoft I don't have a good answer for that one right maybe it's out of our hands it's just something that happens it I'm sure it happens at every company that the so in 2010 the Nobel Prize winners for on the topic of management science I had no idea there was a Nobel Prize for management science yeah today I learned they got the prize because they proved that Peter principle exists and works so do you know why we have the bell curve the bell curve strategy for promotions and incentives I thought it was something we borrowed that came from Welch it did and did Welch get it from somewhere else but it is the best known defense to the pre-d principle that is why most companies do it because people get promoted to the point of incompetence and that bell curve is the only tool are the best known tool to get those people now that they're incompetent out but you and I both know there are incompetent people in very senior positions at Microsoft who are still employed what happened there's politicians exist everywhere and that's actually you're right it's actually a very good answer and and by the way the let's say let's say you were back at Microsoft and you happen to be one of those people the way you deal with with it like your defense against the bell curve is that you you become pro you become very supportive of people moving into your band whose output would be lower than you I I watched this I won't name any names because I think they're both still employed are all still employed at Microsoft but in my last group I had a friend a good friend who was a partner level which is as I mentioned when you're out of the room a very senior level while they weren't looking to fire removed from duty anyone their awards are still spread out across the people in that band and his goal was to says all I have to do is be better than person a yep and it was a low bar yes you just had to make sure you're not the one on the bottom now I will share with you what my ideal strategy would be okay and I will also tell you I have no idea how to implement this yep but the ideal strategy because companies they want to make sure that they are paying people enough to be competitive right they don't want to they don't want other companies to pull people wages on the purposes of money but it's a full package right yes money can go down in your company the more your company creates a very vibrant and genuine employee engagement practice policies right if people people who are happy need to get paid less I mean it's not a directive but they need the money less because they're willing to trade off much like you just said right all right let me go into my my first thing on on ladder levels yeah and again let's shift let's talk about ladder levels rather and well yeah we it was a necessary not even a tangent a discussion but go ahead so first off I guess I'll talk one last closing but on on promotion there are two ways to get promoted that I've noticed there it actually is it really is just one way to get promoted you have to add the perception of consistent results okay and I have seen many people get I'm gonna let you fit I'm gonna let you finish you want to tweak it or you want to push back I think that's go ahead and go on I think that's not necessarily universally true I don't know if it I don't know if it is but there is there's okay so if I actually I'm gonna push back so can you said you want to get promoting you have consistent results the perception of consistent results okay so but as being so I'm a I'm a entry-level dev yep and I write code and I write unit tests for my code and my coach and I deploy my code and I really take on any new big things don't try harder things but I just do that and I'm consistent I consistently check in code that has tests and which is so I'm not horrible if I do that consistently I should get promoted okay now you're being pedantic I am that the that's my that's my middle name okay then let me add an adjective okay the perception of consistent exceptional results oh that's completely different yes go on okay thank you now notice how I said in every time I defined it I said the word perception because it is in fact a very successful promotion strategy that all you have to do is get people to believe you've delivered it and actually delivering it is entirely irrelevant so you're in the political side of getting promoted which is yes and which again drives me crazy it absolutely drives me crazy it getting promoted shouldn't be a marketing spiel or a political rally no all right so my ideal strategy would be we have some magic means to know that every company has some magic means to know how much profit they are making off of an individual that's very difficult it would be and then I would that should never happen my role is entirely intangible so I do not want that well even the value my unity to value is somewhere between zero and ten million dollars somewhere between there well no so folks in an influence role actually actually that makes it even harder I'm gonna I'm gonna rephrase that my value to unity is somewhere between negative my salary to a million dollars somewhere in there okay I could be just a total net loss so but if there were a way to to actually measure your value and such that you could have say near real-time visibility to it then you would learn and you would adjust and you would be able to go oh okay yeah so I spent six months on this thing where I did I see if I go focus on this thing my value to the company boots but that let's let's stay out of the theoretical game so let me know I'm gonna cuz I'm I want to push back it so I I want to see how you do recall that I said this doesn't exist right yeah okay but but I want to add one more thing so way back 20 plus years ago 25 years ago holy crap somewhere back there I wrote this front page was this web development tool that Microsoft acquired it caused some bad things to happen I work working on ie 2 or ie 3 I can't remember and I wrote a translation tool to help people migrate their their websites or static websites from the crappy front page output to something that would actually be web standard compliant and it saved accounts it saved millions of dollars all on my $40,000 a year salary at the time should I have gotten that should I've been gotten paid a million dollars that year I don't know okay go on I'm gonna be quiet at least 30 seconds and I again I admit this is idealistic and there would be a lot of details to be worked out and they haven't been because again I don't even know where to begin to start measuring this but an ideal situation is at every annual review your salary is adjusted such that the company continues to make the expected amount of profit off of you so if you do something fantastic your salary goes up because they are expecting okay this guy is a influencer but you're in a super high role and you know you start doing the skating thing yeah your salary tanks that's the biggest issue I see once you get promoted it's really hard to go back down and I think if there were a fair means that didn't involve subjectivity so I feel like you're describing my 30 seconds are up I feel like you're describing incentive based rules let's look at the sales role where a large part of your salary is dependent on performance and actual measurements yep I think that it can just as easily even more easily drive the wrong behavior you can steal subtly steal accounts away from your colleagues you can do stuff to game the system let's let's try this all the way back so let's say my salary was a base level of something that I could live on but I had incentives because my job is intangible because they okay for every let's say our XR budget for dealing with outages is n dollars some round number ten dollars and through my efforts which would be intangible but I could tie it to the might I have a bonus tied to I get a chunk of that money back if we're under that budget so if we only spend two dollars on incidents throughout the year I get eight dollars back in my as my as my incentive bonus even that could drive the wrong behavior I could just say okay no more deployments because those might cause me to lose my bonus which would not be good for the business so I think it's important that you have values and things you want to accomplish that are outside of any sort of incentive so I guess in short I'm pushing back on a said doesn't exist I feel like an incentive based whether you call it that or not an incentive based reward system or promotion system would create more problems than it solves it might it might unfortunately every in every incentive base promote every promotion system is incentive based okay let's talk about we have a just a little bit of time left let's talk about ladder levels yeah I want to talk about you talk started but I want to steer this before we finish to a more we've talked about everything where they can go badly I want to talk about how they can be used effectively as well so but go ahead and start with your stuff and I'll try and steer it so I'm gonna I'm gonna share with everyone the most common speech I give mentees when they come I Brent why can't I get promoted yeah it's it's usually some variant of that people come and start talking the opposite will be hey manager says I suck but but but but but you know slurry of excuses and and when I get that one I go look I'll convert it to a promotion discussion then I said look you're being defensive what one thing I call Jensen's law of politics is he who is defensive loses always you cannot win any battle taking the defense position only so I said what you're gonna do is you're gonna start having a conversation with your manager and you're gonna say yes I understand that that you have this feeling what I want to have a discussion around is what is the things that need to be done to go after a promotion because if you try to avoid getting fired if that becomes your mission there are so many directions you can go and some of them in fact are worse what you want to do is set a positive direction that you head towards and if you only get 70% there strong chance you did manage to avoid getting fired okay so it's a common conversation now at Microsoft we have several bands and I'll to generalize it I'll call it we have the beginner band we have intermediate let's call it that beginner intermediate senior principal partner is the ones I'll go with right now and the way I tell people the purpose of these bands talk about key expectations that we need people to learn okay every band has an entrance and an exit that you have to show consistent capability so let me let me talk about it the the beginner band the beginner band to get into that you just have to pass the interview right and that different teams will have different skill sets but you just have to pass the interview to get out of that band there's two key things that you have to do number one you have to show that you have mastered independently learning what you need to learn so know how do you stack overflow whatever but you in other words the people who I see that don't get out of that band are the ones that constantly talk to their managers or others around well how do I do this how do I do that how do I do this how do I do that okay now things that are hard right we've talked about this before knowledge work is hard and it needs to be reduced but you have to show capability that you can learn on your own to go that's to leave the current band you still have to be able to go into the next band and that is you have to show the capability to go into the next band of getting stuff done okay that intermediate band when you look at for example Microsoft stats that's where most people are yep and that's where the most of the work gets done and that's in it is and the expectation there is if we're gonna move you into the band you've shown capability that you're gonna be able to independently get work done and and and those are generally your hot and to be clear my previous statement those are typically the highest output folks right and then I also want to interrupt and say like the bands of Microsoft are not unique every company has basically the same band that's my experience as well and you can go to levels dot FYI a website it you can compare level systems of 50 different companies and they're all kind of the same yeah and and I think it's because there's only four or five key criteria right the first one I said you have to show mastery of being able to independently learning but capability to independently get stuff done okay all right now to get out of that intermediate band you have to show mastery of independently getting stuff done but capability of leadership okay and that's leadership not at leadership influence technical leadership getting working through others not necessarily management to be clear leadership in my criteria is in order to be a leader you had to have followers and that means people in leadership can be people leadership or technical leadership but there has to be an indication that people are following you or the capability of leadership all right and then move it along so they're in that they're in this band then they get into this band where they go to get out of senior the the senior band is you have to show mastery of leadership but the capability of what I call investing in the business so you don't fully own the business but you are a key decision maker for that business and now that's actually super critical and the why leadership comes before that because if you get into once you go into that role you have to show that you can make the right trade-offs and the key part of leadership is being able to get others to follow that new direction even though it may be tough yes absolutely if you are not a leader and you move into that and you go oh well what we need to do is this this and this I say so many people fail at that they just don't get it like they yeah yeah there is and I'm gonna refer to Maxwell's five levels of leadership not gonna go through them all but the first level of leadership is you're put in a position of leadership not a silly management but you're maybe you're in the senior position then you don't get out of that you don't get to the second level until people give you their permission to lead them in other words they become followers like yeah I will listen to you because I believe what you have to say and you've established some credibility with me a lot of people never get out of that they put they're put in that position but they don't know how to get to that second position they don't figure out there's things they need to do to get to that second level yeah so the biggest issue I see with people when they move into management is that never learn the difference between management and leadership sure and then finally lastly partner you're a business owner right if you don't have experience around understanding how we should invest certain things it's gonna be really hard for you to take to take the ultimate head or the the top of the pyramid position and be really accountable and move that business as a whole forward there's a lot of things you have to pay attention to mm-hmm uh-huh so I want to talk about we have a couple minutes left but one thing to build on what you just talked about is that as a company as a person who is trying to help people grow through these levels under it is key critical absolutely necessary you understand what the transition is like between these levels because that helps you understand what people need to do in order to grow from one level to the other and again I want to rephrase that because the goal isn't to grow a person from one level to the other the goal is to help someone grow their abilities to accomplish things and as a side effect of that they end up getting promoted because they're able to take on more and more capabilities at a much wider scope or level of leadership I worry that again going back it's really easy for the individual to focus on okay I have these levels now I treat them as a checklist here's what I can do to get promoted your guide as a manager or as a mentor to these folks is to help them understand that their goal is to provide more value to the business and these are ways in which you do it which will also end up getting you promoted because we're gonna have a business need for someone to be in this wider scope role and help and help get things done I think it's again I think the abuse of ladders or maps or guides whatever you want to call them is a management problem or a leadership problem sure it is not the fault when I had employees who were every single one on one or maybe every other one on one what do I need to do to get promoted to the next level what do I need to do that is that is easy no that but show show consistency that you're operating at the next level done when they would ask that that is I recognize that and I would lead off of that that is my fault as a manager it's my fault if you have to ask that it's my fault not entirely if they're at a lower level it's right you can turn okay fine I could turn around and ask what do you think you need to do there should be but that discussion like I've I talk a lot with employees about career growth like making sure that ACB framework where you have stuff that stretches you you want to have a good chunk of that stuff it's hard new for you a bunch of stuff you're good at and minimize the stuff that's sort of below your your wheelhouse talk a lot about that making sure people have the appropriate level of stretch work because that those are the things that's my job as a manager to make sure those are things that are guiding you towards a more value to the company and at the same time a higher level let me let me try something out okay okay mmm this is not a big stretch for me because this is actually how I do that okay right if you remember as I was going through these bands I kept on using the word independently a lot great first bam you need to show mastery of independently learning next one independently doing what do you think the next one is independently leading correct what about the next one this one's harder independently deciding or make independently making decisions including all of the follow-through including I didn't know I could have multiple clauses in my answer no I just want it to be following through on your decisions right I have several employees who aren't yet ready to go to that principal band but they're at the top of the senior as an example I've come up with a strategy that seems to resonate and work because sometimes that independently deciding things it's vague oh I decide things all the time independently I'm gonna check this in I'm gonna make a hack here right it is so the way I frame it is all right let's look at the KPIs that our executives are targeting which one of these do you want to take ownership of and they're like what which one of these do you want to take ownership of what and what that's going to mean is I'm going to carve off some scope right because obviously you're one person you can't do this for all of Microsoft but if you can that's super but we're gonna carve off the correct scope and what you're going to do is you're gonna move that KPI you're gonna make all the decisions you'll be responsible for talking to all of the people that need to be talked to getting the correct assets put in place in a timely fashion etc etc etc the goal move that KPI be the decision maker for a key portion of the business and when I frame it that way they get it they're like oh that's hard I'm like oh yes now you're beginning to get it now you're beginning to get it all right we could go on and so let's do this we're out of time so let's close there and then if there are questions you can ask them either in a comment to this episode you can join our slack channel you can go to modern testing org to get an invite an invitation or you can email me Alan and anger weasel calm and go a little deeper otherwise we'll move on to the other topics we didn't get to next time sound good to you yeah so thank you for going through a little bit of a I think this is what I mentioned improving the business is the goal I didn't that wasn't just so I could make the sound modern testinish I think that's my new word I I really do believe that you need to tie your growth to principles and values in this case it's going to be both the business that you work for in your business the business of Allen for example yeah the business of Allen is doing okay anyway lots more to talk about we will get into it today but we'll talk to you next time I'm still Allen are you sure fairly positive and I'm Brett all right bye
