Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show we're back again I'm Alan I'm brain and it's an episode of a B testing it's to be clear our 145th episode of season one of a B testing where did you go so here's the deal where did I go Brent you well your voice like dropped like 25 decibels which is gonna be fun for me later but also Brent because he's on Windows can't get his camera to work so now I can't tell where his microphone is I can't tell what's in his hand I can't tell what he's eating it's a it's a black hole on one side of the podcast today yeah so we are me and the three are all gonna are all going to enjoy how quickly does Alan trigger when he doesn't even know what the hell is Brent doing now Brent was a couple of minutes late and I was moments away from just sending a message out to Twitter and saying first DM reply gets to be on a B testing with me this week unfortunately I lost and it's Brent again but actually you can still hear that no no no this is a conversation that the one I want to have at least a little bit today maybe the whole time we'll see what happens we'll see what once we get out of our tangents is probably better for you and I how you been what's new anything exciting yeah I don't think I mentioned this in our last podcast so I'll just proactively say I regretfully inform you and the three that I survived my surgery last Friday Oh what surgeries you have oh that fear your wrist no no this is I was thinking about it on the way and wait did you finally get the lobotomy I'll let you finish that's that was me attempting to do a drooling noise no I had a hernia repaired ah and they feel the skin back and shove it back in and sell you back up no and it's unfortunate I was like a horrible doctor I would improvise too much it's unfortunate the camera is not working for me because then I would absolutely torture Alan and show him all of the maybe it's the internet sparing me first and foremost up until then I did not know what a hernia is do you know what a hernia is yeah I do do you okay for the listeners then I guess because I didn't I did not know I mean as we've talked about before I'm in my 50s now I did not learn exactly what a hernia was until three months ago and essentially as you get older and I hate going to doctors and because I'm now at an age where so many doctors start their statement with those three words as you I guess it's four words get older the the wall of your abdomen can wear thin when it does one of the purposes of your abdomen is basically to keep your your keep your stuff for it belongs keep your intestines right where it belongs yes unfortunately as a process of digesting things what it does is it creates places in your intestines where it will push against the your abdomen and normally your abdomen will hold it back what happens though as you get older your your abdomen weakens and then your intestines are able to push through this is so disgusting and gross ever everybody just keep on hitting fast forward until we're talking about something else and certainly overexerting like for me the cause I know what it was is I was doing yard work and I was acting like I was 18 and and just aggressively moving bags and bags of and anyway it can be dangerous when you have a hernia because if it's if it's not reducible which is medical term for you can push it back through the hole then one of the things that's potential happen is it could lose it that part of the intestine that's poking through could lose its blood supply and die and then shortly after it so will the host excellent yeah but they got to put back together like Humpty Dumpty right yep and I got lucky my my surgeon is actually known for being one of the best in the north Pacific Northwest still I'll tell you that man yeah that's true little trophy that says I'm the best and and I had performed a robotic surgery so I have currently three scars on on my stomach and three itty-bitty scars and one was for the the whatever the instrument they use basically a surgeon chopsticks right itty-bitty little hole that these string whatever that is that they do the next hole is for a camera and that that middle hole was is literally like an inch above my belly button and then the third hole is where they stuff in a tube and they blow me up like a balloon with carbon dioxide okay so right now I'm just gonna say for our two listeners who are left could one of you send me a message on Twitter in two weeks on Friday maybe midday and remind me to not ask Brent what he's been up to that would be great I think it's I think it's gonna help the podcast so just thanks in advance for that you don't you don't want to learn about no let me check on my podcast maybe podcast testing agile software leadership yeah it doesn't fit oh I'm glad you're okay my apologies yeah boy oh boy man you are old I was teasing Brent Cronela I've been on the planet longer than Brent but for whatever reason you just seem way older I don't get it yeah it's it's because I'm wiser I think that's it I think it's something else we'll figure it out have I been up to anything no yeah I've been up to getting mad that the Covid rates are going back up again that's what I've come on beeps we we run the risk of waxing political I know all I want to say is everything I want to say is just gonna landslide into just be careful out there don't you don't need I don't know why we're not ready to have big festival concerts yet I'm talking to you lala Palooza we're not ready to have Florida exist I saw a bumper sticker by the way that you'd love it said DeSantis 2024 make America Florida I wanted to I wanted to slap on a just say no sticker right next to it but I didn't have one with me all right off of the political podcast on to I I will just say I mean I don't want Florida but I would pick Florida above California any day I'll just say that right now they're totally different versions of crazy sauce and then since we're on it why the hell is Cuomo not already impeached what the hell I don't get that either politics are broken why why is it that Trump is still even allowed to hold public office again in the future if you want why is DeJoy still in charge of the post office there's all kinds of crap that's wrong I got two years till my daughter is out of college and I'll be accepting free agent offers for the country that wants me to move there the most so two more years on my contract and then I would like to I like to explore new opportunities in new countries I'm frickin serious it's it's just too broken and nobody gives a crap about fixing it no and the people that do aren't in the position to do it so it's just it's all about power and money and not about helping people and it pisses me off so anyway speaking of being pissed off I think it's I'd like to talk about this a little bit although I do find the absolute irony and potential in appropriateness of two white guys two white old dudes having this conversation but I still want to have it I'm assuming that you and or our listeners are both have at least heard of if not read a lot of the articles and accusations around the Activision Blizzard lawsuits I have not heard anything about I will catch you up and then I want to have a little bit of a talk about it this topic is not the right conversation so is Blizzard is Blizzard a customer of unity probably so I probably shouldn't go into it all I'll say is there is some bad behavior and it's just it just it just hurts me to see like someone told me a long time ago that the way to figure out what your values are are to think of the things that really push your buttons the most and your values are the opposite and fairness is such a huge for whatever reason such a huge value for me I can watch a sporting event in a sport I don't care about with teams I don't care about but if I see a bad call or something unfair happened I just get riled up and mad I can't handle seeing things that are unfair probably shouldn't go into the details of that stuff but just yet another example of people being treated horribly and unfair I can talk about the times early in my career when I see that saw this at Microsoft again I'm not gonna name names it's not fair of me a second-hand person to do that but one of my friends a woman was constantly harassed had sexual propositions made to her by her boss the guy was married with kids it went on for a year before he finally at least in this case he finally you've heard this before Brent decided to spend more time with his family that's that the Microsoft line when it went when an exec is fired it wasn't special projects it's not well special projects means they're still employed they just take them out of their team they removed that they just removed the sore from the team but when someone's when an exec that's fired at Microsoft it was almost always they decided to spend more time with their family it was kind of hilarious but you know I saw what are they called microaggressions not as much in my last few years there I do say that but early there was a little bit more of a frat boy culture and I did see that in some teams and just and I think given who I am now if I back then I would have done more about it now that I'm who I am now I don't see it but it just I don't like well let me actually take this out of the the negative into the positive a little bit as I can so one I'm just mad I'm just part of me is mad this stuff goes on and part of me is mad that people can't just treat others I just don't get it I see this happen the golden rule man just treat others like you'd like to be treated I don't get bullying whether it's male on male male on female female and male etc I just it just irks me at all and I just don't want to see it and that got me thinking about just diversity in tech because another thing happened this week totally a different thing but it made me think so Stack Overflow did their their survey and they published their results 82,000 responses to the developer survey and you're not gonna believe this is a segue alright so and they've published the information it's just demographic information nothing really exciting here's the languages people use here's the salaries etc but one thing kind of stuck out with me 82,000 responses 82,286 open to any developer going to Stack Overflow who wanted to fill out the survey so they're getting a little bit of it there's a bias there I forget which one it's gonna be what's the bias when all you have is the people that actually responded information and not a full gamut of people whatever that one is right but just short of go ahead it there's definitely a selection bias selection yeah okay so of those 82,000 sorry to keep saying the number 92 just short of 92% of the responses were men just over 5% were women with non-binary and prefer not to say filling in the rest 92% of the responses were men I don't know what your teams were like like I was on a team once at Microsoft that was almost it was like 45% women never been close to that before I went and looked just for transparency I went looked at my current team and it's 23% female so I have a couple questions but I want to go over today there there's the big lead at Brent's going Alan this is I'd rather talk about my surgery man yeah so anyway they blew me up like a balloon with the carbon yeah no no this is this is an important topic you know I can commit on this podcast into my team it's like as my team grows and next year I'm definitely doubling down on getting a more diverse team and not just diversity men and women but all the different flavors we can get there I've talked before how on the podcast we have and I didn't Brett and I didn't have our yearly business meeting yet well I actually have never had one as I mentioned before on the podcast we I take all any money I get for talks or courses like the course on ministry of testing comm on an introduction to modern testing which is excellent any money I get from that anything about modern testing where I'm paid for it that money just goes into the AB testing podcast bank fund and it may be testing is an LLC just so I can get a tax ID so I can open a bank account for it so there's some money in that account and I think with your approval no pressure man as we're recording I could just delete this part if you don't think it's cool I do want to donate $500 each to both girls who code and the women in tech charities there's 501 3 C's on behalf of a be testing it's only a little but hopefully it helps just get a few more women people of color etc into into tech because I think we're losing out I just again I go to fairness we're losing out by not having I can pick on ourselves just having a bunch of white dudes doing the job we're losing out so what do you think is that cool with you guys spend our money that way certainly I like the idea of girls who code like that one a lot when when we talk about the the other one that you brought up I'm wondering if it's actually called girls in tech I'm sorry it's girls in tech org yeah I'm wondering wondering how we diversify right because it's why don't we do this this is better actually let's let's get our listeners help us figure it out I want a be testing to give a thousand dollars to wherever is gonna we think is as a group gonna make the most as a community the most difference in helping diversify and in my words make fair the tech world and it can be one place multiple places I am willing to take input on that but I would like to put our money where our mouth is and see if we can just make even the smallest little difference here because you and again you and I sure we're in charge of teams we can do we will definitely do our part in hiring but we can't do it by ourselves here's one thing and I think I may have shared it on a podcast before but I feel like I have right because you keep talking about two old white people and I'm gonna push back on on that as a concept the fact that we're two old white people is meaningless here right I've done the research and I can sit and I can waste the rest of the podcast explaining to you why diversity and inclusion are important and it will not be at all about body parts or color right it it's it's I don't know if I've I've shared this right so I grew up so I come from what is turned as white trash roots so there is a lot in my familial history that's in alignment with a lot of the the poor downtrodden type phenomenon or classic demographics that's what I'm looking for that that we hear about non-trivially I do not feel any association with the term white privilege I personally find that term offensive because of my family history but ignoring that aspect right the diversity and inclusion it is let me let me let me just try to summarize it like diversity why is it important diversity is not about demographics it's about how you experience life okay and how you experience life is also associated with demographics in other words diversity inclusion like what race you are what gender you are is not causal but heavily correlated are you following me so far I am so far all right I'll let you go a little farther before I really back in all right for example women there's been lots of specific studies around gender studies that show that women in in leadership positions actually boost company's performance and it is it is in no small part because women's experience of the world is often more they're often less risk-averse they're often more collaborative they they want to hear the opinions of others right however it's not solely owned by women and then there's a lot of aspects where where I'm sure you've encountered these where whether certain women that by their gender are women but are there actually their style and their training their culture or whatever I don't know how they got there but their behavior is very toxic masculine the benefit of diversity is getting these other different definitions into the pool of what's right and going these other right ways of approaching problems are all just as right but they come from different so if you yeah I'm losing myself I'm going I'm gonna really in here because I think you're you're you're walking a thin line and I I am not in a thin line I am and I will I will assert this like what I am doing is I am trying to share the science behind diversity and inclusion and around the studies that have been done here and diversity getting at the end of the day okay I found a way of doing it at the end of the day diversity is around getting a diversity of ideas into the ecosystem okay and and when you get multiple different ideas what happens Alan you get great ideas and right I we are stifling we are blocking our path to get there because we don't have a way to get those diverse ideas into our teams right and that's where inclusivity comes in because everybody has their own personal identity they have their own sense of do I feel included or not and what the science has shown around inclusivity is you will not gain the benefits of diversity if people don't feel included if they don't feel psychological that's exactly the topic I wanted to get into I will I don't want to dwell on this I will say I will disagree with you on on white privilege being offensive I think it's a thing and I think there are plenty of studies that would show it would exist but I want to move on because what can happen exactly what you said is the problem is is we read and what I saw what I have seen is that you can get into a situation where people are afraid to speak up they're afraid to put their ideas in there they don't have psychological safety and you don't get psychological safety by itself it has to come with transparency and accountability though to me those three things have to work together so what is psychological safety Britain I kind of already defined it but go ahead no no no but before yeah because before we continue on like the one thing I also want to call out you and I being old white guys is not what matters here what matters here is that we prioritize collaboration psychological safety and the birthplace of ideas those who don't like in your position at work Alan if you got replaced by someone who fit this other characteristic but lost that environment that goal that initiative you have around psychological safety I'm gonna say is harming that company okay yeah no I agree that's that's all I'm gonna say I think there's too much of this focus on on on birth characteristics but I'm gonna get I disagree but let's go on psychological fair enough psychological safety is essentially the construct or it is where you have an environment where people can feel they can say what they view is a true view of the world and not be bullied by it feel and not face any repercussions and not face repercussions right and it's critical to call out but there's no way to have like one of our values unity is best ideas when that statement can not it can never be true without psychological safety because you'll never you never have even a remote guarantee of hearing all the ideas well and actually you don't even want to hear the I mean you just want the ideas to be breeding with the other ideas right right and if the ideas are silent how is that gonna happen and I have a bunch of ideas throughout here also but it's I think it's worth it to talk about what are some things what are some things you do in your order what are some things you've seen that work to help build a culture of psychological safety so I am constantly working through this there are two things that I have done in the past that worked very well on this number one is I ban well the very first thing that I did is I would have an individual speak up in detail what they are going on and then I would give them permission and I've shared this on the podcast before it's essentially during a retrospective the person who's sort of walking through what happened is often generally the person who did the work and I say all right you are to you are to tell the story and everyone else in the room is going to operate under the assumption that you were perfect in every way right and that it was actually the rest of the team if anyone's to blame it's the rest of the team we let you down and the team's job is to figure out how how did we let you down like if this ticket usually in retrospect we're talking about tickets that went into the weeds and it could be in that creates it a an environment where each individual as they listen to the story they're they're now thinking through okay how did I actually let this this person down like I actually saw like stand up two weeks ago I thought this thought but I kept it quiet right and and now now this this ticket suffered the the team suffered so I started thinking through the consequences of this independence in a way that forces individuals to collaborate together other times other times I've I've as I mean a very simple technique is you you look for and you simply ban any semblance of blamewang which just ban it that's like setting the framework for it but I've also found you have to keep kindling the fire because even in an organization that has a pretty good level of psychological safety you'll still find occasions or people feel afraid to make a mistake or they they're not public enough with their mistakes which of course eliminates the ability to or the opportunity to learn from those mistakes which is the thing I want for example we review as I mentioned before we have a weekly review weekly team meeting where we look at projects and dates if someone has to move a date the only real question is okay cool what did we learn and emphasizing that learning another thing is one thing that helps in my org is my pure what would I call this pure unabashed oh I'll put it this way I consciously or unconsciously I you know my idea thing the way to get good ideas is get a lot of ideas and throw the bad ones away they watch me screw up all the time by or watch me propose dumb ideas and when there's somebody pushes back I won't give the exact example I posted something hey I was talking to so-and-so we thought it'd be great if we did this what do you think and what can happen in an org without psychological safety or a hippo or where the highest paid person's opinion matters the most they would just be yes sir we'll go do it but instead even one of our newer employees it was great he pushed back and told me why it was a bad idea and then I very quickly and publicly said thank Tim for pointing that out and said you're right we shouldn't do this makes a lot of sense and just it's continually finding those examples of showing people it's okay to speak up it's oh there's not a hierarchy or a rule you have to follow one of the things that pushes my buttons of has to do with fairness or just lack of safety is the there's probably a name for this move you know when I'm when Brant when I can't get you to do something so I get I tell my boss to tell your boss to tell you to do it that up and over and down if that ever happens I just flip out do you yeah I cannot handle that if you need something ask for it yeah I have it probably nothing to do with safety but it just it got me thinking on that track no so for me I don't I actually don't flip out on that one I internalize that I introspect I go I now at a point where I operate on the assumption that I had not earned this person's trust and that's why they did it and I so and then that actually is also the way I then I then go and do the confront yeah and to be clear I don't flip out externally just it pushes my buttons inside I just I will just have them go contact the person directly but right but I will tell you I will tell you if the reason why they did that so where it happens with me the most often is because they did talk to me and I told them no and they didn't like the answer right and in that one they still need to have that discussion I right I believe in managers but not hierarchy and I tell my team that all the time we have managers but not hierarchy and sometimes people who are a skip level or two below me they'll ping me on slack say I'm sorry to bother with you on this directly but you know it's like and I remind them don't be sorry we have managers not hierarchy and anybody and that's one good thing about it's usually a new employee one thing about unity in my org especially because I care about this is everyone is everyone feels comfortable or should feel comfortable talking to anyone and of course as my organization grows it's a bigger fire to keep kindled and that fire is psychological safety accountability transparency the the other thing that you just called out just to shift back to that like I do think one thing that's really important is to lead by example on that one as a leader I admit my mistakes all of the time I will publicly do stuff self-deprecation all of the time I I I apologize to my team and go wow you know what if you guys didn't report to the world's worst manager this would have happened this way but it didn't it happened this other way right leading by example where where specifically I acknowledge my mistakes and that I show what the preferred behavior of the preferred action would have built basically creates trust within within the team and we have much more friendly conversation yes and let's talk about trust for a minute like actually you're going so I want to pivot yeah that that's where I was going I think trust is that basis of psychological and there's another model that fits in well with that term it's it's the the pyramid from Pat Lynch on his five dysfunctions of a team talks about the first dysfunction is trust if you don't trust each other if you don't have that safety you can't have the in his words you can't have he calls it conflict I like I prefer debate if trust is missing we're afraid to have that debate and we and we or we take the debate personally and we can't flesh out those ideas the way we need to if we can't debate over what about this what about this what you think we should do this we have to be able to have a debate and discuss and not be afraid to tear someone's idea down or to build someone else's idea up in order to come up with the best solution but without trust you can't have that healthy conflict and then once you can have that debate then something Amazon calls disagree and commit a lot but that and again not putting Amazon's in model company but without that debate people aren't committed you have a lack of commitment people feel like okay they're doing what they want to do I think it's the wrong thing I'm not going to support it if you feel like your voice was heard and decision is made that wasn't entire you know wasn't the thing that you wanted to do you've you've had enough debate about it that that commitment can be shared across the team without commitment you can't have accountability because I'm not going to be accountable for a thing or I've shared accountability for a thing that I didn't believe in and was thrust upon me by the hippo and without accountability you can't get results so this basis of trust or psychological safety is critical for flow of productivity and output and well team health which has also been studies shown as correlated to organizational health is directly correlated to the quality of product that organization produces whether it's software or whatever but organizational health is critical and it all starts with that trust a psychological safety then you can build on that and get a team who actually gets crap done yeah yeah actually you said it in a different distinct way than I would have but I completely agree with everything you said the because I'm absolutely right go on like the single most important book I've ever read on this topic is one called getting to yes and it was written by a masterful negotiator and it's a it's around how how do you have discussions and it's still very valid value today and one of the key things is how do you how do you convert what they call a positional argument to a principled argument so a positional argument in this particular case is for example let's say I disagreed with the topics that Alan wanted to present for A B testing okay well he is in the position right he has all the the editing equipment he has the recording equipment he absolutely could say well if you don't agree with me Brent then I guess the podcast is over for today but he I could I don't imagine you would ever do this but you could always do the I'm gonna take my ball and go home strategy because you're in the you're in the position of power on that discussion okay but a better approach would be a principle one okay okay Alan I propose this as the the topic so one of the things that I do with that focus is I try to convert it to anytime I see a dispute anytime I see a discussion right how do I turn it into a principle discussion versus a positional one and just as a metaphor when I'm very fond of a a difference in this is this a Alan you and I were we're disagreeing on something I'm not gonna try to flesh out the podcast metaphor it'll be too long winded right in a positional discussion you and I are sitting on opposite sides of the table and then generally one of us is gonna win and the other one's gonna lose a positional discussion is is often always about it always results in a win-lose proposition in a positional or a principal discussion what what we're trying to do is move you to my side of the table and let's put the problem on the other side there are times where where hey I want this this and that and I'm like okay but the current implementation is going to take too long and I need it by this date so can we can we can we come up with a different strategy right I'm I'm laying out a principle that hey delivering this bare minimum by this date is an important principle for me and yours you're stating I'm I'm lost in the metaphor you are yeah but the more you change it to say what are the principles that you're making your decision on Alan how are you how are you thinking through this right the more I can encourage you to say I move away from hey I'm the guy in charge and I I get to decide and the more I can shift you to go okay here's here's the principles that I the constraints that I wish to have satisfied for for whatever the final product is then we shift away to okay how do we invent a new solution and includes my definition of win along with your definition of win totally get it I read that book many years ago it's it focuses primarily on sort of the mediation negotiation aspect which you've described very well but it's also knowing when to use those tools versus other tools to make sure everyone's ideas heard so I would use it as part of a suite there I did look up though by the way disagree and commit was it's a while while it's an Amazon principle it's actually attributed to Andrew Grove at Intel whose high output management book is excellent so that so for me me that book what it what I use it that one for is it is to sort of help teach my folks how to communicate in the way right yeah my everybody every one of one of the things you hear from me all the time everybody on my team everybody I have ever met is awesome their ideas may not be sufficiently thought out and their behaviors may may have some negative consequences in the context that they're in but they are an awesome human being and part of my job as a manager is to do the right matchmaking or the right behavioral suggestions or teach them how to communicate so that they get their stuff across in a way that will construct the win-win environment yes and coaching employees on communication and framing and all those things and listening is critical the one thing missing and again I thought the book was good it focused a lot on and I guess been 15 years since I've read it that that mediation negotiation like I said before what it doesn't tell you is what I recall it telling you is some of the best advice I can give a leader who wants to have an organization where best ideas women where there's trust and their safety that they don't do enough of and that is shut up give you got to give your team room to talk that's how you walk the talk because there's so many people who say oh yeah we have psychological safety because I tell my team we do and and they blah blah blah blah blah and they never shut up I shut up and listen sometimes I will I will agree with that and I will take it I don't know if I'll take it at one step further one step back but if you're in the leader slowed down give additional time like resist your urge to give advice for as long as you can and get better and better at better at it's like learning to breathe or it's learning to hold your breath right practice holding your breath for as long as you can and keep practicing it because the more your quote-unquote giving giving this advice the more and more instead of giving the advice ask questions that's the right question and let me point you to another book that I think is great and this is not you you being the three or you bring the coaching habit and so do more coaching as a manager and when you a good coach a bad coach of crochets give you advice throw the ball higher hit the ball farther move your leg back but a good coach will ask you how does your right leg feel there or how does it feel where your hands are on the bat what position is your hand in when you release that shot they'll ask questions you get you to reflect and internalize what's going on of course there's been some advice before that he can't do coaching it you can't grow entirely via coaching but as a manager it's getting people to reflect so they can learn if you give advice that's all you're going to do and you're gonna spend a lot of time giving advice to your team so they can get their stuff done instead ask them those reflective questions how did it feel when you gave that feedback what do you think is what do you think is the best way to solve this turn stuff around ask questions the coaching habit is so excellent it's a book I've it's not even that old I reread it three times now because every time I get some ideas that help me help me help other people grow recommendation over five stars on Amazon that's what I give it if they've turned it into required training and actually I've just here at Microsoft and I've just yeah I keep I keep telling you my company made drag its ass out of the gutter someday after all yep I keep telling you since Satya took over it's it's a different place sorry took over when I worked in a toxic environment at Microsoft so there is that right but he didn't have enough time to fix that and I'm I keep hearing Xbox is still a an epic nightmare so I don't know that it's fully done yet but he's on the right path I absolutely agree with that no I hope so because yeah as the frat boys grew up and you have 45 year old frat boys running the company it was a mess so I'm glad to hear it's getting better and I trust you and we talked about why team sucks last time so you can go back to the last episode for that anyway I do want to give our listeners Brent had no idea what I was gonna make him talk about today so thanks Brent for that conversation when I sprung it all on you but I still have one more thing I do it quickly cuz I gotta go have another meeting fair enough trust is everything okay the they actually the best manager I have ever I ever had he passed on one rule in these days if you only do one thing as a manager the only thing that matters is you need to recognize that when you start off managing people you have not earned their trust and work towards doing so that is the only thing that matters and I will tell you in my experience that is a hundred percent correct right you have to do it within a business context but but recognizing that you cannot be reorged into earning their trust and that it is on you as a leader to do so if there's any secret rule I would say to my success as a manager it is that one all right so I'm gonna build on that and then we're gonna close cuz that reminds me of yet another book I want to recommend which is Mac Maxwell five levels of leadership and he says at first you're put into a position of leadership that's it the next level is people have to give you permission to lead them and that's your trust and until you do that these bill just like the chonies five levels once people give you permission to lead them then they'll actually work for you and they'll follow through and they'll do work you'll get shared results and then the next level of leadership is you focus almost all your work on people development because people see you as a lead I'm not gonna go into the deeply in the book to have people development then at the pinnacle it's your job is to create leaders and people just follow you because of you because of who you are not because they have to not because of hierarchy but because of your leadership attributes but you can go read the book but those first two levels really sunk your point home for me when I read this book again a book I've read a couple of times but first you're in a position of leadership and then people have to give you permission to lead them and there's definitely something to that people who felt like I'm the I'm a whatever level leader you have to respect me I just hate that crap no I do not you get nothing from title you get nothing from position you still have to earn it screw you and you know who I'm talking about you I do but well I have one person in mind when you say that and I'm pretty certain he would fall in that category I've never worked for him no I have I have probably another one you're talking about when I was in engineering excellence and crap I am so late for the other meeting oh my god I just want to finish one point okay make your point not and I'll bitch on Peter later all right the last thing I would say on this is be anti-NIH be anti not invented here in all forms if you see in a team meeting that everybody's sort of cow-tailing because the one person who is the domain expert is the one that's suggesting the advice that means the other rest of the team doesn't feel like they're part of the solution the way the more you can get them integrated and feel like they're inventing it along with that person the more you're gonna see this inclusive behavior the more you're going to see psychological safety that that's obviously gonna start creating some conflicts and some of some of the advice we've given today in the podcast will help you mitigate it but you need to get them having the conversations first then make those productive I am done go ahead and no I already did so yeah just already done I am NOT Peter LaFort nor am I we'll see you next time man thanks for the time today and I'll have a good weekend you too all right
