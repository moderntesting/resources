Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show so this is the AB testing podcast how's it going Brent super so excited you should be excited because this is our 136 episode and Brent types to figure it out because you can't 100 and 30 something through drive is just 39 or 16 so we're here on another Friday afternoon a beautiful spring is coming sort of time in the Northwest yeah and we're gonna do a podcast and then we're going to I'm going to edit it and then through the magic of the internet you will hear this these words being spoken time shifted by about two and a half days on Monday or later depending on when you listen or it's magical right or earlier if you're part of the secret club oh how does one get into the secret club Brent it's really hard it's really hard you have to magically navigate Google to find the AB testing you don't even need Google you can just go to modern testing org oh come on I want them it's a secret club don't work hard for it no that's the work you're being dumb and then they have to click the link to join the one of the three slack channel yeah and that's it and then you could ask questions there and I always post it again a lot of people stay away from slack over the weekend so there's no requirement to listen to it early but I always post it on our slack group for preview of people that hang out with us the weekend before just or two days before when I get it whatever I get done editing actually as soon as I get done editing and which is also a good chance for me to get feedback on hey Alan you accidentally posted audio from a kid's birthday party I said oops wrong video wrong audio but yeah you get a chance to listen ahead of time if you'd like doesn't show up in RSS feed just download it of course if you'd rather just have life be simple you can be in the slack group take part in conversations and wait until the podcast shows up in your feed on Monday whatever makes your life easier yeah whatever you want that as long as it also makes our life easier we're super supportive yeah we're pretty easy going here for a bunch of old guys or a couple old guys at least two old guys a couple weeks ago I did a webinar next week I'm doing another webinar nice Thursday night which is gonna be really crappy time for those you in Europe but for the Americas I think it's like starts at 6 o'clock I'll try and put a link in it in the show notes but you can look at my both my LinkedIn feed and my Twitter feed and probably find it I'm doing a a webinar on just learning stuff and I'm putting together a presentation I'm gonna tell you what's in it but was really cool the people organizing it at PNSQC said you don't even have to give a presentation you can just facilitate some conversation which I love so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna kick it off with a little I'll kick it off I'll do a little bit of both I'll kick it off with a little bit of stuff around learning I want to talk about probably largely a little recap of Steven Johnson because the reason they contacted me one is they know me because I've spoken at their regular in-person conference a couple times right you're a favorite of theirs if I don't know if I'm a favorite but you know I'm on the list they're also curious like we're like how do you find these five for Friday things what motivates you to learn which is really good question of course five for Friday comes from a brief infatuation I had with what's his face Tim Ferriss and he does a five bullet Friday thing I thought you know I'm gonna do something like that for the stuff that I care about but really it comes back to a book I read that I don't remember the name and I don't know how it is for you but I recollect what year it was by what product I was working on at the time so sometime around 2001 2002 I read some book and in the book it said hey if you want to get new ideas you should probably read some stuff that's outside of your area because as I learned from Steven Johnson years and years later ideas come from other ideas oh yeah let me can I good no let me shit up all right no I'm sorry go ahead just like yeah go ahead right I actually use this a great deal so as you and the three know I manage the data science team and as you and the three may not know data science is an extremely broad term right and there are hundreds of specialization somebody who who for example is working on face recognition certainly he or she are gonna know all about the basics you know what's clustering what's classification etc but in terms of words yeah in terms of specific techniques there's a deep specialization and in that context okay and so even though I have my unfair share of PhDs reporting to me they do not in fact know everything about that is like so one of the things that I do papers we spent a lot of time on on research papers you go to Google Scholar use look up stuff and you can see sort of people's prior published ideas okay but in terms of the concept of ideas always come on the on the old ideas coming together a research paper is exactly that I will call out you go to the references section and the references section is not only the old ideas that are being brought together but it is a very clean follow-up a bowl enumeration of that list and and so when I when I have one of my data scientists come to me and and say hey I'm stuck I cannot figure out how to move around this I give them the following exercise okay all I want you to do is every day I want you to start off and and go to Google Scholar and just do a search for something that you see as you know do a keyword search for something you think is relevant that's it and then I want you to pick one of those articles there and read it and then next day and don't do anything with it just read it next day based off of that either do a different keyword search and and read something or go to the references of that one and pick one of those to do it yes and I'm gonna add that to my presentation something I've done before but I forgot about is read a in short read a research document but go look where they got their ideas from right and I just basically say do that do that just reading that algorithm reading one paper a day for 14 days and I promise you you will you will find the answer you're seeking yes and even further than that you won't get the 14 days yes I'm gonna go in that's good we're gonna get more anecdotes to share I do want to do an AB test here on the AB testing so I'd technically be at a slash B test on the AB testing podcast could you take your microphone maybe lower it three inches just keep it above nose level but a little bit there try it right there now Brent on a scale of one to ten how much of an idiot do you think I am seven oh what one to ten no four five okay half an idiot that's that's fair that's so I'm gonna you know I gave a presentation years ago leveraging Stephen Johnson's material and there's a slide in there that's probably worth going over in our tangent weave here so oh back to the presentation it is hard to keep track of all the tangent sometimes isn't it what the bill I don't bother anymore what the book suggested which was something became a part of my life for about five years and I kind of lost track and it went away once I had children but it's suggested I subscribed to this thing called you know just one of the ideas was science news and science news was a print magazine tiny it was like it arrived every week but it was maybe 12 pages and I could read through the whole thing and not understand most of it but for some reason just like looking at these research ideas you're for you're looking at something different every day it planted seeds that made me think about some things differently and it may not say oh I'm gonna apply this thing from science to this thing I was doing in testing it was more of oh here's another way to think about stuff and I would just maybe even subconsciously think about not applauding the thing from science news but oh here's when it is experiment they thought about this thing in two different ways can I think about this particular problem in two different ways but a lot of really subtle things so definitely suggestion there I don't know if they make the magazine anymore it might have gone from weekly to every other week and a little thicker but at some point I stopped subscribing but just fascinating I felt really smart after I read it and I've been progressively dumber ever since so as part of that presentation I looked for some titles of some of the best conference talks that were happening on the test circle for various reasons I go over in a minute I want to share some of these with you and gonna get your thoughts the art and science of load testing internet applications that's applicable to developers as well as testers model-based testing for data centric products also interesting could be applicable managing user exceptions tests and large projects it's that could be again it's a little businessy title but in the when we care about like we're trying to outcome based testing those user acceptance tests can be important yes architectures of test automation I'm much more comfortable having a development team own that but I like to hear the ideas there habits of highly effective testers very generic one but you know good so what do you think about those talks I just described I don't like the last two the last two kind of feel you know 1996 ish to me but the other one actually you're very close because these are all titles from conferences given in 1999 and 2000 mmm yeah so the point is could we please have some new ideas I'll take new ideas and test for $500 Alex what is blank the problem one problem in the industry and something we've talked about before directly and indirectly I'll just gloss over is that a lot of people get their information on how to improve whatever craft or knowledge work they're doing from one or two places or one or two places or people that is not a way to get new ideas you regurgitating for example I was reading and I'll name drop Michael Bolton here I was reading an article he wrote on LinkedIn and someone tagged me in it and for good reasons someone who is not not trying to stir anything up they had actually a reason for tagging me in and since I was there I asked about this concept of someone else mentioned oh I found that critical distances blah blah blah and so I spent a bunch of time searching on what critical distance was and I asked the person not very much to find Bolton later told me later later to look for a different term called psychological distance or something but a little bit better but I'm glad again they've done a lot of thinking on this stuff and they get it I think this particular thing is in a little bit in a vacuum because yeah if it is one person doing all of the work some of those things do exist but we work collaboratively but the main thing was the main disappointment was this person had no idea what the term they were using meant they just regurgitated they did no like my reaction is to go figure out okay I want to see why I have some cognitive dissonance with this term because I can't I want to know more about it so I can understand where to apply it so I did the research try and figure it out and it turns out that the person making the argument this was the reason in this case why developers can't test they're using a term that they had heard but never researched and to me I find that again for a knowledge worker I find it some word I can't I don't remember the English word for it bullshit stupid I mean idiotic I mean I mean you're old but I mean I came up with three right there yeah whatever but I mean if you if you want to be good at anything in knowledge work I don't care if it's testing specialty or software development or data science or Jesus architecture anything that requires the creative mind and the balance of adaptive learning work that I mean the definition of knowledge work is that you are often learning as you go along you have to take the learning part seriously so I could go I could for the rest of this podcast talk about the different methods of where new ideas come from Stephen Johnson and I won't know I won't but you have to seek out places to expand your repertoire of ideas it can't be from one or two places it can't be from 10 or 12 it needs to be from dozens or hundreds and you have to be hungry to define those things I'm it's frustrating to me to see people who their thoughts on tests are based purely on what they've seen one or two or three people say about testing I don't get how you can I don't get it I'm up on a soapbox I'd not intend to go on but the point that I want to go over in this talk is you have to find ways to get new ideas into your head especially in the last 12 months where you can't go meet with other people the the Enlightenment and one thing from maybe Stephen Johnson's book is the idea of coffee shops and getting people together finding a meeting place a community for people to exchange ideas that helps innovation and ideas thrive the one line from the book is chance favors the connected mind yes like being in the right place at the right time to figure out how stuff works he talks about the adjacent possible which is taking something that's and just and just making that one little extra step to make to figure out that peanut butter and chocolate go pretty good together but you have to constantly seek out ideas and you have to not be afraid to do new stuff maybe this ties into a chapter for a book I wrote that I I'm really proud of and I don't have a pulled up here to read from but there's this e-book put together called around the world around the testing world in 80 days or something where I was given free reign to write about anything I wanted and I'm gonna tell a story which is a paraphrase of my article it starts off with me saying oh hey I'll take that on and it was me approaching a conversation back when I worked on that stupid science project and I was bored and I happened to walk by on a conversation of someone wanting to set up a bunch of static analysis tools and sonar cube and some other tools for our product which built on Linux I joined that team so I could get my Linux skills and my Java skills up to stuff it was very early in the product I had no idea how to do the thing that I just said I would love to take on because for me if I'm not in a position where I have to learn in order to be successful I'm kind of bored and not happy yeah and that's actually one thing that you and I have in common is going back to the orders of ignorance we're pretty confident in our ability to construct a means by which the one thing that I'm totally mind-blinking on right the fourth order that doesn't exist any means by which you don't have a suitable means to discover what you don't know you don't know right you and I both have a process by which we go well I'll say like for me I just go most of the time it's like it's just code it's not magic I'll figure it out it's really not that hard but I do know that a large number of people and I think some of our listeners don't don't sort of have that same sort of sense the so I've always been attracted it up until the team I'm on right now like you one thing you and I had in common is we get bored and change teams for me I got more interested in looking for and whenever it was on the team hunt is go okay what is the team that I think would most be able to leverage my strengths but at the same time is working in the space I know little to nothing about right and if I can go and find that the people culture there is great then I'm in done it's over yeah but we could add another topic I want to get to but I want to stay here a little bit because yes this is absolutely true and what I've sort of inadvertently done as I've grown into managing a larger team which we've talked about before drink is I've developed a little bit of a pattern and reputation for taking on taking a hard problem on figuring out the details on my own and then delegating it away to part of my team to continue to maintain and grow it helps me learn a lot and then it gives me opportunities to give people things to do you know when I joined my current org it was program management and again I said the same thing my the by hiring manager who did not have an engineering role for me to go into said hey can you do program management because you wanted to have me on his team I said sure and I had never done that before and and again to remind you Brent program management in the rest of the world is much different than the hybrid thing at Microsoft it's it's reducing complexity and understanding and what it turned out to me in the end once I figured it out really what my role ended up being was running the what he calls the what we both called the engineering system engineering operating system that's just like running an engineering team it's the same thing I did for what I was the senior or quality architect or some high-level senior tester reporting to test directors way back in the day so and because it involves coaching teams on agile practices and coaching teams on quality that was great but anyway I did that I was not intend to talk about what I did but really I took that on figured it out and now delegated as someone better than me running that portion of the org which is good because our projects are getting more complex in some cases same thing with quality I have a super great quality leader on my team who I've I don't have to of course I'm involved and I'm curious and I'm I try and remain a highly opinionated about quality but really my whole org is quality but I have a part of my org who are dedicated to quality coaching and someone very capable they're all delegated away most recently as I believe we discussed I've been diving deeply into cutting our again don't know how to do it sure I'll figure it out but figuring out what we can do to cut our spend on cloud hosting I learned a lot of things got it all figured out made a lot of dashboards I'm delegating that work away I'll take on something new when we talk about knowledge work I've found that people again I'd have to be just like me I'm like you and I we're happy we're most happy when people can keep on giving us more and more things we haven't done before I'm most happy when I get to be in over my head at work and I see folks who pride themselves on the craft of blah but they just want to do the same thing over and over and it just baffles me I mean everyone at some point in time is you got pink's principles memorized better than I do but mash mastery is important but it's like you and I we're sort of mastering the meta like we're more we're more interested in mastering the I don't know the journey versus any specific destination but other people are wired differently but mastery comes from not being able to do it but being able to have the right resources to be able to do it the first time this happened to me I thought I was gonna get fired I was three years into Microsoft remember I'm a self-taught programmer but I figure stuff out well enough people gave me more credit than I was worth and I was maybe I've told you this story I was paired with one of the original Microsoft OS guys to work on the debug version of Windows because it had been neglected for a while and to get it running from the Win9x platform and debugger development and I thought great I'm gonna learn a lot from this guy hopefully he doesn't call it how stupid I am but then he retired like a week in they said it's okay Alan you could own it by yourself so I am scared to death but I got a book on assembly language because I had to learn assembly language in order to do this because the kernel and the debugger are largely an assembly and I slowly poked my way through the same way you would you make a bug fix here a bug fix there you tweak another thing and and eventually it was almost like I knew what I was doing I knew enough what I was doing people assumed I knew what I was doing and I went from I'm gonna get fired to you know what I love figuring stuff out that's really hard it's what motivates me and since then I seek that out I seek that steep learning curve and it sounds too much like I'm bragging but I guess the point is a lot of in addition to being a white male a lot of my success comes from just chance favoring the connected mind being available to try new things out being just being open to new ideas and accepted them yeah well you and I've talked about it before right in in knowledge work is essentially ideal work and so for me to sort of lock into this is the best idea ever like and I think you agree with me but I'll just ask what's what's your thought on the term best practice I'm pausing because it's a loaded term on one hand taken semantically correct as written it's stupid because there is no it's all contextual there's no best practice generally not always but generally when people use best practice they're not looking for that but not it's it's similar to using literally to say Brent I'm literally on fire right now I'm not so for best practice it depends on the for a phrase it depends on context it depends on the context of how it's being used if by best practice do you mean the thing I absolutely have to do all the time then I don't like it if I best practice do you mean a thing that generally works most of the time which is the typical use of that then I don't mind it what was the answer you were fishing for the term by itself without a context is in my view just blatantly offensive the point is it's not used that way in general and you know you're right the well I don't know like the places where I seen it used is in terms of weaponizing an idea during a negotiation hey this is known to be a best practice for the last 10 years of course I would then argue if this is a best practice for the last 10 years you're wasting my time yeah it would be easier if we got rid of the term because it yeah it can be abused so I'm not sure where you're going with that you asked me a question about it but what was the intent behind of that question it was essentially in terms of knowledge work and idea work yeah there is a best known way to move forward today however knowledge work will continue we will continue to learn new things in this sort of stay locked into sort of a mindset that the things that I've learned for the last 20 years and I have now mastered this in our space I think is at best mistaken idea at worst just abject foolish hey I want to change the subject slightly slightly and get your this is something we've talked about before but I want to frame it a little bit differently so I could almost ask you a similar question back but I thought I haven't thought about how to put this but I'll put it like this inevitably you know I've written these articles highly opinionated somewhat controversial there is there are a few people who've come back on both articles and say oh you do you wrote testing but you meant checking which I think is a big load of crap what but whatever you do you but I do see from even those folks and a few others there is among the internet a high like you and I have both said I'll put it this way the readers are all going Alan get to the point and the point is a lot of testers focus on testing as almost as the end all of what they're doing and you and I have both stated we don't really care about testing we care about quality yeah our goal is different it's weather is for and this is I think the crux of it I don't know where your question is but the crux of it when you say the word testing do you view it as the ends or the means well you know the answer it's definitely the means well for you and me it's definitely the means but it's not for a large portion like is that what what what led people to believe that customers care about testing because they don't heads up customers don't give one little bit of their red freckle on their nose about how many tests you run and how many which tests you ran on this build they don't they don't and matter of fact the only places where I've ever seen testing by a customer being communicated it was an expression of lack of quality hey Apple didn't test their shit right it's just the only useful term from a customer in terms of testing turns out in my mind and this is a hypothesis of generating on the fly is to scapegoat right it's the same shit Deb does no longer have the conversations I'm out of now at a point I'm like oh my god if I haven't heard it in years but when people come to me well why wasn't this tested before I'm like is that hypothetical like are you just asking yourself this out loud like what is actually the answer to that question and what are you gonna do to fix it let me interrupt you I'm gonna weave you through some thoughts I've had about this and get your thoughts on how they relate to this topic where we can go back to Weinberg who says quality is value to some person quality doesn't say about testing so what value it brings we've had discussions about that if 10,000 people are using a thing that has 20 known bugs and only five people are using a thing that has no known bugs which one has higher quality it's the one with more people right you know a long time ago did you ever read quality is free the Philip Crosby book no it's about manufacturing and and and people read it and poopoo it and there are some it's about prevention which you and I both would actually prefer fast detection over prevention because it's more efficient and we like to be efficient go INTPs by the way we were gonna talk about personality types this time we're gonna do it next time instead because we've already used all this time on this topic I don't want to end it so another thing he said that I've been thinking about recently I want to plant this on you is this is a book where he says quality is conformance to requirements I have a twist on that but first I want to know I'm sure you've heard that definition before but what do you think about that definition of quality of conformance to requirements I'll do it this way I'm okay with it under the condition that those requirements don't necessarily have to be communicated my statement is what every customer wants is actually a solution to their problem yes and that that's the twist I just got I read that and it didn't it didn't sit well with me when I read it 15 years ago but it's principle number five I would say quality is conformance to requirements when the customer defines the requirements their requirements are defined implicitly yes explicitly yeah now now you and I are in the same page I mean the problem is this is the problem with this podcast is eventually we're always on the same page because we yeah reasons yeah exactly it's conformist to the requirements sure but it's a requirements around what the customer needs not necessarily what they are asking for that's it now would I ever if I were writing a book would I ever use that statement no because I know there's a lot of people that will take that literally and then go off and do the wrong thing so let me build on my last statement make a statement made by me not by anybody else so based on the Weinberg definition that quality is value to some person that that would be a customer and then my modified Crosby definition that quality is conformance to the requirements as defined implicitly by the customer I would make this statement and I want your reaction on it if you don't know who your customer is and what problem you're solving for them you cannot define what quality is you don't know what quality is yeah but isn't aren't you just restating principle 5 I am in a different way okay so it made me think that this when we talk about quality and testing not being the same thing and people will say oh of course they aren't but then they talk about how they improve quality all they talk about is the testing they do and principle 5 says that we can't do that we need the customer we can't build a quality product without a customer even if it was quality we won't know it's like it's like the tree that fell on the forest we can't measure it right right I've been thinking through since you brought it up earlier the the checking versus testing argument there's no argument system yeah no no I get it hold hold back hold back the soapbox ramp for a moment and they hold it off and in and honestly part of me wants to go and say okay guys let's sit down let's have an objective and real conversation in today's world what is the value of testing that you are holding up and then trying to drive and improve a specialization and craftsmanship around because to me from where I sit honestly Alan I kind of think of testing as a specialization very similar to blacksmithing right it's in a back in a certain time in a certain context it was extremely valuable it still exists today and if if I had a choice between let's say a pocket knife built by a master craftsman and and one built by a factory in China that were the same price tag obviously I'm gonna pick the master craftsman yes those but if if what I need is something that's going to last my expected a lifetime use of it I'm probably gonna go towards the the cheaper option which is gonna be the factory in me and you know what so it's the majority of right it may be easier just to buy a new one every six months or cheaper right right so I want to keep on going I know we're getting to our last 10 or 15 minutes here so there are more pieces to this and this is why again going back to our first topic is maybe I'll repeat another statement when I read my first book on test software testing I thought I knew a lot then I read another book and I thought now I know a lot then I read a third book and I got confused and realized how little I knew and the more I've read about software engineering software quality software testing I realized how much there is I don't know and how much I need to learn there's is that done in Kruger effect right I knew a little bit enough to think I knew a lot and then as I knew more I realized I didn't know anything it could be something different yep there's some other things that feed into this so the question the context of this is so if quality is value to some person or performance requirements and testing does not equal quality how do we build a quality product and then one other flavor is it's been 15 years now since Ed Keys gave that keynote at a Google test automation conference where he said sufficiently advanced monitoring is equivalent to testing so there's something in there too and I would say monitoring is testing well I'll I mean I feel safer with what Ed said okay fair right so because there's with there's a lot of crap monitors out there so if testing is not quality what do you need to do to build a quality product I can't just write code then test it then ship it you told me Alan that's not quality so what are the steps to build a quality product are we redoing episode 83 all of a sudden there whatever it was principle 5 like the you we do principle 5 is prevalent in this theme but right so then no it's coming together in a different way it's a experiment there's two things you have to know to determine if you have a quality product number one what the hell problem it actually solves right there's a hypothesis hypothesized problem but it's a lot of the times the problem it actually solves is actually not the one that you intended right and that that goes to your early example from Stephen Johnson I actually think of his air conditioner story what problem does it solve then once you're firm on what problem it solves to what degree it actually does so you have to have a you have to have a technique to evaluate quality you have to have some sort of technique where you are continuously evaluating those two spaces simultaneously and you cannot do that without here I'll use double quote customer data I'll call it that right and here I because I don't want to get into the the semantic quagmire around the term customer but I think the majority of our listeners probably understand where I'm coming from well our listeners do and sometimes are preaching to the choir but it's good to think about I like to think about it this way because I this massive I've noticed because I'm getting you know I get lots of Twitter DMS and LinkedIn messages and comments on my post because I've been talking about things that make people feel uncomfortable but the point is for everyone who thinks I'm a quack and who I've made feel uncomfortable there are at least as many people that that think well again I'm not describing this new panacea we're describing what we're seeing if you disagree with it you disagreeing what's happening in reality so the feedback I've gotten is more I would classify it more sort of name-calling hey you're disrespecting the discipline that you grew up in and honestly I don't know I don't I don't have a whole lot of empathy for that and I don't care about the feedback right I'm trying to figure out how to I don't say educate but I want to justify what we're seeing and put it into perspective so let's do a quick thought if we have five minutes left just do a quick experiment I have some fingernail clippers you can't see him friend can see him barely again yeah on my desk I'm uses inspiration I am I have a customer hypothesis a problem statement I don't believe I don't believe people in a across around the world are able to to solve their nail clipping problems efficiently enough I am going to launch fingernail clippers calm it's gonna be great I have a great designer and time goes by and we have the site as we've tested extensively the shopping cart and and orders and shipping it's all set it's good to go we've done a hard launch with lots of marketing big marketing budget we want to be the premier place to get fingernail clippers on the internet we tested the crap out of it so on one hand I'm thinking it's high quality because we can't find any bugs we ran a hundred thousand tests and our my little website is live and then very little happens we're not getting orders or getting very few orders what happened obviously ours is our site is failing you could say it has quality issues because it's not providing value to any people or very very few people what did we do wrong how do I fix it how do I do who Brent I've hired you to help me get out of my quag Mars reminds me like Elizabeth Hendrickson talks a lot about she was hired to fix quality problems and they were never with the test team so anyway help me fix it what do I do it did this one this one is I would take the role that I know venture capitalists do and I would just simply say okay Alan who did your market analysis like what made you believe this was a problem that needed to be solved and if you came back and said you know one day I had inspiration and I was staring at my shiny black nail clippers on my desk and and I moved mountains to make this website happen then the solution is easy is okay who's your target customer all right so go on let's say I did market analysis and I assumed I had a million customers any one time across the US just pretend so then where do you go so you look at that you basically look at that data and it's rock-solid and you're thinking wow well you should be doing better now what do we do wrong did we not test it well enough no testing has nothing to do with this one so I'm leading the witness right no no it's like the solution therein is the problem here is why did you ship it right given that the data that you mentioned why did you invest in it why did you ship it right it's a clear thing that you showing it is that it is it is not providing an interesting enough solution to a problem humans have and the fix would be Alan to send you out to physically talk to not your marketing team you to talk to the customers and find out why and you didn't want I mean you're exactly right I was leading you a little bit deeper into it you absolutely need to make sure you're solving a relevant problem you're really trying to do your hypothesizing you're developing a hypothesis to determine if you're actually going to provide value for some person you could because tests of omission might occur so what often we do as you know may have been a while since work on a commerce site but there's the whole acquisition funnel people have to know about the site they have to come to this site they have to put stuff into their cart then they have to check out I'm just making this up on the fly so it's not great but if you're actually so there's do you have an audience and maybe we're getting 10,000 visitors a day and that seems obvious like you know well then why aren't we getting more sales we can go one more step down the acquisition funnel and I think you'd be better suited than writing a whole big automated test suite of course you want to test the happy path to make sure people can put stuff in their cart and enter credit carding and get it checked out and get added to a shipping queue but monitoring it every stage of your of your funnel every decision point they can make from this is where you can do your experiments and your A.B. testing and your monitoring sorry experiments and A.B. testing are the same thing but you want to look at every decision point from when they enter the site to where do they find because they have to go through a half a dozen decisions or more until they check out and they put money in your in your bank account to see where they may be failing where they may be falling off maybe anyone with a maybe you have a bad regex weirdness and anybody with a two digit two digits for the first part of their IP address can't check out or something stupid like that you maybe you discover that there but there could be all kinds of things that go wrong where monitoring is and focusing on customer value and that acquisition funnel is the right thing to do user journey funnels I like that name I like that name of user journey funnel is that a real thing can I look that up it user journey user funnels there I've heard user journey and I call it the acquisition funnel but a user funnel or journey funnels so there's there there's acquisition funnels there's there are retention funnels or their churn churn they call funnels but they're really anti funnels because you're trying to prevent people getting to the bottom of those funnels I thought at the bottom they check out and make money not with a churn funnel a churn funnel right it depends on yeah okay fine whatever or for example support a support thing you would you would look at sort of key sequences and you're trying to get them to not go to the next level right it's I frame it normally as an anti funnel because I think it's clear but yeah if the top of your funnel is has a higher rate and let's say you know your favorite host of deities were the ones responsible for the testing like their codes bug-free then you you still have you have something worse you have you have a problem solution mismatch some place in your system that you need to go fine I think the meta point before we close on this is you have to go and go back to what you said earlier focus on the problem you're solving for the customer and then determine what you need to do in order to know if you're solving that problem correctly right right testing again I'm not saying don't do testing testing is great for regressions mitigating risks there's lots of reasons for it please please please please please don't think of it as the end goal of your quality efforts it actually just agreed and sorry I'm gonna go back to one last thing I just thought of it a perfect example for your scenario where you could have a situation bug-free and a high attraction rate okay when you sign up people for a trial ask them for a credit card number right that just pisses people off asking them for a credit card number for a free trial oh I could do fingernail subscriptions fingernail clipper subscriptions yeah I get the credit card yeah no I know but this is again why you will get much higher quality if you get to that culture of experimentation and hypothesis around what you're delivering to see if it's providing if it's solving the problem you intended to solve the fact that you ran 10,000 testament mean you well there was the Eric Ries quote if you show me a product that's bug-free I'll show you a product that shipped three months too late yeah I don't know if it's three months but it certainly should play so yeah that all comes into play there too so I want to bring all that together into that conversation we are out of time but this was fun yeah we will come back in a couple weeks and talk about personality types a little bit more but that'll be fun and was there anything else I was gonna say see ya okay then see ya Brent says see ya bye bye everybody
