Hello everyone howdy I'm Alan I'm Brent and we're back with a be testing one more time I'm Brent. I'm Alan Hell oh one more. Oh, we're back for one more episode Episode we are episode 77 pair of sevens double sevens. You can't roll those on dice unless there's two eight-sided dice Or more or ten yeah, yeah We Are the podcast about things like software quality software testing modern testing agile organizational change? Random stuff squirrels and what else Brent? It's mostly the squirrels mostly squirrels. Yeah. Yeah, how you been Brent? Oh, it's been a rough week How about you? Well all my weeks are good. I was skiing last week at Whistler had a great time Home this week working away Working away next week working away the next week, but working from Brighton while I go to test bash. Yes Where in the world is how is the weasel you gotta work on your prep there? Yeah, the weasel will be in which means we need to move our podcast vigil around again because I'll be in Brighton That's fine. Gosh. Nothing much else going on. I'm taking the gear you're gonna do another not taking gear if there's gear there I'll use it, but no I'm gonna spend day and a half at unity. I'm going to Workshops on Thursday conference on Friday Unconference on Saturday as I believe that I'll leave Sunday morning. That sounds like fun Yes, that's my plan is to have fun. It's test bash officially our favorite conference now Test bash is officially my favorite conference. I don't know about you Officially hands down and they are crazy. I cannot believe this grassroots thing and has they think they have five Conferences, maybe it's more That's great. They're doing their first ever test bash in San Francisco next year. Nice I believe there's one coming up in Australia. Yes, there's one in Sydney. I think oh There they just pop up all the time I'm just excited to be part of it Richard Bradshaw who I've met I Think I've only met him in person once twice I've been in person twice because once at test bash Philly when I went two years ago Then before that I met him at Euro star Was I giving oh I went to euro star a few years ago not to speak at euro star But to speak at the mobile conference they had the following day, you know euro star I Haven't heard that in a long time. It's still around. Yeah still around That's a you picked up on what I was thinking Yep. So as I get ready for Test bash god head brain. I have a dentist appointment this morning I like to be nice to my dentist and not pound myself full as much coffee before I Have my teeth clean does I normally do so I'm a little I'm not quite on a full tank You want coffee? No, I can get you know, cuz I have to go straight from here to the dentist and oh You're going to and I don't want coffee breath for other for I like but like be a nice to my dentist because I'm sure they Smell worse things. Oh, no doubt Okay, that's a tangent. I'm not going to explore So test bash is coming up a couple other announcements around Talks that I have coming up in the where's the we're in the world is the weasel thing probably worth mentioning so I watched your Abuse and misuse webinar I did give a webinar two weeks ago on the abuse and misuse of test Have you done another one since I did I did one on Tuesday on the future of test automation Which is also recorded and if I am a good podcaster, I will put the recording to both of those links Links to the record whatever I will put links to both of those recordings in the podcast So that's kind of cool. Yeah, I'm interested in hearing that The your last one was with the That's the pan or the two-person panel one. Yes. Yeah, okay. So what else do I have coming up? Let me talk about a few things. I screwed up this year. I Usually am good about saying no and after several years of doing one conference a year one talk I am doing way too many and I I am saying no to anything else, but I So one I have an in end of April beginning of May I'm giving just a workshop at star East on web tools Which will be fun, but I forgot that when you sign up for a tutorial at star they book they automatically book you Twice so I'm also giving the same workshop at star West in October do they And I forgot I feel bad I want to Maybe not do it, but I'm going to do it So that happened just record the first one and have them I kind of thought it back the second time I didn't like I like even the same talk twice So that's happening. I'm going to I'm not officially announced yet, but I will be speaking at a conference in June on the East Coast I'll leave it at that for now, but I'm giving two workshops there Interesting to our listeners maybe I'm giving workshops on managing the modern tester nice and Community builders guidebook so things that we've been talking about on the show the show will large will dictate large amounts of the content also giving a keynote there on Don't exactly remember But that'll come up later once it's official and then finally I'm going to be giving Yet another iteration of the adventures in modern testing based on feedback feedback Learning more experiences. I'm going to be doing that at PNS QC in October as well the one of my favorite conferences one of In Portland so all kinds of weasel information, but Let's reel it back in Real sound effect brand bridges bridges stairs at me. He goes shut up Alan the clock Just shut up actually shut up and don't talk just just shut up No, just keep talking okay Okay in preparation to Give these talks on modern testing and a and just think about modern testing in general and to maybe bringing up Content and make modern testing org a real website that does that just doesn't redirect to the podcast website One of the things I had been thinking about for a while is what are the modern testing principles? what are the principles of modern testing and a couple things came in mind while I was creating these and these are not Brett Brett and I are gonna vet these a little bit on air Maybe make some edits as we go so I can get these two I feel a little bit more confident in them I read them last night again, and I'm starting to feel pretty good about these But I know there's some things that aren't quite right so in preparation for this I looked at the Agile principles and you know what the agile principles are Brett you have memorized no how many are there? Isn't that the one with 12 there are 12? Yes. Yes, and You pick this up from the agile manifesto I did I did Lisa, and I did not want to these are from the agile manifesto I did not want to Repeat these directly that would be Plagiarism yes, and I didn't want to for the same reason I didn't want to just make them all about agile testing because I see Modern testing very much as an extension or an evolution of agile testing in many ways Yeah, my view it kind of view it as a Subset maybe yeah, maybe In my mind not sure yet because I know Lisa says that she really likes it She wants she grabbed on to the idea of the tester as a coach and that's coming up a lot more in conferences we saw some feedback from a conference in Australia on Twitter over the weekend and Katrina colloquy whose book I still over review on it's a very good book on on testing in DevOps and She pointed out some theme. She had heard in the talks and Yeah, much like much like modern testing it freaked some people out. I thought oh, those are pretty good things They reflect they reflect some of these principles of modern time. No I So I have her tweet Loaded up right now and and she summarized that at cast 18 that a lot of them themes were around testing being a bottleneck and they were trying to come up with solutions which and the ones she had listed were Essentially reduce the amount of testing done push testing to the users remove tester as a roll and Removing step-by-step test cases the last one I'm like I hope we did that a long time ago. I thought we did so Out of out of context you could look at those go. That's stupid But within the context of modern testing a lot of this you go yes, of course So let me blast through a few of the agile principles for context You get an idea of what principles are and by the way I highly recommend if you want to read a good book about principles in general and how they're developed Ray Dalio's book called principles is very very good. I read it reread it every few years. So here are a few I'm not gonna read all 12 of the agile principles Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early continuous delivery of valuable software People are nodding their heads. Yeah Welcome changing requirements even late in development agile processes harness change with for customers competitive advantage I'll do one more Deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference to the shorter time scale and they go On but you'll read these you go. Yeah Yeah, those are things we try and do when we do agile or if your team is faking as you go Yeah, we don't do that. But But again I want to get some context on what principles were and then I want to talk about what I've come up with as the Modern testing principles and Brett and I are going to figure out live on air Where some word changes may need to be made where we may need to remove one because it just doesn't it's Maybe it doesn't reflect True modern testing principle or it's not part of what we should be the subset or maybe there's some things that are missing So, how do you want to do this? I'm gonna go through one by one or just read them all that's So I have I have this printed out as well. Let's start off with What which one of these do you think is the most important? They're all important there. They are all important if you look at the agile one Right. I our highest priorities to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software I I do I don't know where we going because I Yes, that's very important but all the agile principles I think number one should be number one, okay Good. Yeah, the order makes sense. I have Let's put it this way. I have changed the order of these around no No, no into an order that I think makes sense for the cause of modern testing. Okay, so let me let me be clear I don't think what you have listed here is number one is actually the right number one Which one do you think is the right number one with what you listed here? number three Okay, I could we could make that change So number three is number one. I'm gonna start with number three. Are we just gonna do the whole podcast talking about bullets? Yes, so let me start with number three then I'll go one two four five six no other changes So number three is interesting But get it is the one what I was gonna get when we got to is gonna bring up is Really most like one of the agile principles. So I want to talk it. Let's do number three first Let's have a discussion on why it's important in the modern testing principles in addition to some of the similar things that are in The agile testing principles sound good. Yeah, let me just do one Blip and then every lister is going please just tell me what you're talking about number three In my podcast ever Yeah, if you believe that please go back and listen to episode one In my mind modern testing that what we're really trying to do is number one pull up principles not not not Alan has written out a definition principles are a fundamental truth of proposition that serves as a Foundation of a system so it's not the system. It's it's essentially the skeleton of the system These principles are what hold it together Yes, okay Guide is guide me completely So I view when I think of this I am thinking of three concepts combined together and that's where the principle should be formed and that is the testing discipline agile itself and the business as it is interpreted from data So that last one is sort of a business data thing and I haven't quite gotten the good name on it then like I do think that the principles of modern testing need to like the fundamental foundation whatever the the skeleton of the skeleton is a t8 or a ta OSQ Right accelerating the achievement of shipable quality. That's that's the job so I think the modern principles need to flesh that out of around what we mean and and inform the The skeleton for the next phases. Okay tactics and such should form off of this All right, I'm done go. Okay 20 minutes into an episode on modern testing principles. We're gonna tell you what one of them is maybe You're so awful so new number one Squirrel the customer is the only one suitable to judge and evaluate the quality of our software Yes, so that's do you think that that's the only lead with I think that's number one. This is actually Paraphragm something you and I have both said before you probably said it first This one is obvious it does overlap the agile principles as well. I Feel like it's still worth bringing up here because I agile is a lot about the customer But I think the role of the modern tester is to Magnify to help magnify shine a light on the customer yet the So this is these are words that were in my deck that I presented to unity and What I wanted to call out in particular with this so Test is not qualified To evaluate the quality of software only the customer is yes, right? So the the point of As it relates to a modern testing principle It's test has got to get off its its high horse on Being the at I think of your slide the champions of quality the slide he is referring to for those of you that are Wondering why we never talk about anything in particular is I have these slides I've used in the past having used him in a while talk about testing the champions of quality and showing these superheroes I say you know You're the gatekeepers at the end and then I show these people shoveling horse crap at the end of a parade Yeah, is that what it is? I've always imagined them shoveling elephant crap. It could be all for ya I don't see a lot of elephants and parades so Sure, okay. Okay, then I will again if I was a good podcast coordinator I would Promise but I will try my best to print these out For the show notes. So any wording could change there. I don't think so. I'm gonna call it good I'm gonna read it one more time. The customer is the only one suitable to judge and evaluate the quality of our software Yeah, the only one The so when I when I wrote this originally What I struggled with is the word suitable because I really wanted to say qualified But then having qualified and quality in the same sentence Triggers the only lesson I remember from sophomore English. Okay, I'm gonna keep it as suitable And then I know I've heard that I feel like I've heard this somewhere Before you I'll dig it out sometime. Okay. All right So the we can look at my if if I stole it from somebody it's it's quoted in my deck. Okay Consciously it would consciously sold it. No, and so I don't if I paraphrase some I will I will attribute If you remember no, I do it when I do it right in the deck You don't have to remember what I'm saying It oh is that perhaps sometime you maybe read this or saw it in a presentation Oh god, I gotta get and then it didn't register like oh, yeah And it kind of triggered a thing under this shit all the time and my brain is not as screwed up as yours not quite I That could be another episode I firmly disagree with that I'm old but I drink a lot and helps preserve the brain cells The the formaldehyde Let's do another one. Oh god the anticipation ooh We accelerate the team by identifying and mitigating bottlenecks Particularly if the bottleneck is testing captures part of ATA SOQ it does the thing I don't like about this one is that it it Focuses the acceleration and I don't think that that's I don't think that plays out You were right in my thinking what you brought up a few minutes ago was apparent in my thinking I did want to support accelerate the achievement of quality Yeah, so that's where this came from and why it is the original number one What would be a better way to support that? I think it's important that we are We apply theory of constraints to identify a bottlenecks to identify where the slow parts are in the system and implement processes tools Discussions as needed to help optimize and make those bottlenecks Less of a bottleneck and more efficient, you know Since you invoked the theory of constraints and you know, I'm a invoked. I'm a Wholehearted believer in it, you know what? I'd so I like the the principle you're trying to get across I Just don't think it's getting it across What's a bottleneck and maybe we don't need the words a bottleneck is an inefficiency in the system particularly one that slows People or the process down so they actually now I think it messes with our ability to get quality software frequently to our customers, I think I figured out what what I What my gut is telling me is missing on this. I'm gonna test this out Live and see right the theory of constraints essentially is all about number one. It's it's you it's you can only go as fast as The bottlenecks in your system in essence. Yes, but it also calls out an approach in techniques around identifying Which bottleneck so here? That's the thing. I think is missing. It's around investigating identifying and I didn't and then working through the bottlenecks in Business order Yes, I get that because the line I use is you want to mitigate your find your most severe bottleneck and mitigate that not till it Solve completely but tell us not the biggest bottleneck anymore Yes, so we're missing a word in there. Yes, we're missing a I think it is just a word by by identifying Prioritizing and mitigating bottlenecks. I like how you just phrased it where it's essentially What we're doing is we're constantly reevaluating and removing the next current bottleneck or the next biggest bottleneck we could say And welcome to the brainstorming session baby testing we could say we apply the theory of constraints to identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks in this from the software system. I love that You should type I write slow Make sure the word accelerate is in there and the word system is in there What did I say? Do you remember we apply the theory of constraints? To and then a whole bunch of other words We apply the theory of constraints to identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system. Yes Okay, so that one sounds very David Debbie the first one also sounds Debbie Okay, fine. So we have somewhere in the principal is we got a cover What is? Tests secret sauce. Well, let's actually get through all of these Okay, and then we can figure out what's missing or if we need to add some spices to the others So we have now for number two is we apply the theory of constraints to identify Prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system I like it and what I had before was particularly if the bottleneck is testing which we can add a salt later or something else Let's let's let's leave it as it is for now without that tag and see if we have to go back and add something to it How about just a separate principle? Testing should never be this a bottleneck It's funny. I've said that before many times actually several times. I should say over the last few weeks is What was the quote? I even put it in our slack our slack channel. I said QA is never the bottleneck But really testing is never the bottleneck Testing is the bottleneck all the time testing is never really the bottleneck Explain if testing is the bottleneck. It means you've likely messed things up elsewhere. Oh, it's not the cause of the bottleneck, right? Yeah, it's not the root cause of the bottleneck. Let's come back to that let's leave this one as is and like I said if we get to the end if We can go back and add something around testing frantically take some notes. I'll type them up later. So the next one is Our primary focus is helping the team create higher quality software. Is that going to be redundant with the others now? The thing I don't like about it. Is it soft it is soft and it isn't disambiguated from Traditional testing I wanted to capture the coaching role we use so much in modern testing Yet, so I picked that up and what you're really trying to say We're testing word and it kind of piggybacks off of the bottleneck Right if the bottleneck is that devs don't know how to test their own shit Then it is better for the modern tester to sit down figure out what makes it so hard for them to test their own shit a Modern tester this is how I've kind of viewed the thinking of a modern tester none this front. Okay it is important to drive code correctness upstream it is it creates a bottleneck when We let the code get all the way down to Amid to low-level tester to then write the unit tests. We're slowing down the system Modern testers role is to figure out why code correctness isn't moved upstream and to make changes to make that happen so for example One complaint I get from does all the time is they don't know how to test Fine, we sit down and teach them another one is look. It's my job to write dev code. I Need I need the ability to write these unit tests or whatever super cheap Right good when they starting off. They're gonna view them as a high cost So I think I think a tester can help in terms of teaching can help in terms of reducing the friction I get it and actually something I've been saying recently since I first wrote these which has actually been a few months Something I've been telling people on my team Which I think is going to tie into this is that you are not responsible for quality quality is owned by the team however, you are responsible for the quality culture of the team and That ties in a lot to what you're saying because I'm gonna babble some words out here Then we'll figure out what they're what the right principle is Okay is that I do count on the modern testers on my team or the soon-to-be modern testers as the as they grow and mature to Figure out what? Like what's the testing we should be doing and where should happen in the cycle? Which is a little bit of a paraphrase what you just said Yeah, if there's better unit tests need to be done They're going to dive in and help make that happen whether it's coaching or just identifying where missing tests are identifying What are the integration? What are the what are the? Tests that we may be missing around maybe there's some stress or load tests or some performance testing looking at the what I call The all aspects of quality Maybe one thing though and and I don't disagree with what you're saying But maybe this is one thing that we need to explicitly call out Software quality and code correctness are different things That's while true. It's not really a principle. I know no, I don't know where to integrate it in but the I'm okay with with software quality That test being accountable for software quality. I am NOT okay with tests being accountable for code correctness and What I think somewhere in here is we should say Something up to the effect of part of our job is to push code correctness upstream Right two years from now. I don't I I would very much not like to see your team at unity You know writing test cases to make sure the dev didn't introduce a bug Right. Dev should be focused on that So this perhaps needs a tag but even a better phrase pulled out what I just said that I liked for changing from Our primary focus is helping the team create higher quality software. Let's get rid of that but This may need a tag like I said, but what if I just said what I said before We are responsible for the quality culture of our team. I like that and just leave it at that Could we have a tag? We are responsible for the quality culture of our team Hyphen comma semi-colon including coaching Blah and blah the thing I still think is missing from this and I think this is an important principle Because when you just say software quality quality as you know, just like the word test is ambiguous No, but that's in the old one you lost me. I said we are responsible for the quality culture of our team I did not say software quality Software quality was in the old one the old ambiguous one. Okay, we are responsible for the quality culture of our team I guess the old so others be more explicit Something in here needs to state in a way that's helpful that we we hold some accountability for teaching Others how to fix their code correctness issues But we are not the safety net Something in here needs to guide people to realize That a modern tester is no longer the safety net for code correctness issues Yes, and I and I think we add that as a separate that I have an idea here Okay. How about this for this principle? We are responsible for the quality culture of our team and are accountable for helping and coaching the team in this regard Next principle added and perhaps in this order. Maybe maybe it goes first In between those two is just straight out. We are not the safety net for software quality That can be given the definition of principle. It's viable to leave that there or to have that as a principle I love that if you replace the word quality with correctness That is done. All right. I'm feeling good. We are halfway done With the principles and we'll read them out. I'll read them out in order as When we're done on this list, what did we do one through four one through three? Dude, we did three then one and two now we're doing four. All right number four We use data to deeply understand customer usage and customer pain Yes, good with that one. I I am okay number five booyah Continuous learning and adaptation both as an individual and a team is critical for success And maybe this falls into that vague category a bit. So let me talk about what I was trying to capture as a modern tester. I'm Deeply care about the retrospective. I am probably it's this could be some my personal bias I think that learning the learning organization is so important for software quality now it's trying to capture the modern tester role in that process and also the fact that as Specializing generalists we need to constantly be learning new things to be successful. So that's what I was trying to capture I don't think I quite got it, right? So this is what I need some help. What do you think? So I figured out what you're trying to do there and I completely agree Continuous learning is important however in my sense Like what I would love to see the principles tie out Or when when you look at the whole set it helps to clarify What is the ROI of a modern tester into the business? Why do you hire these people? Right because that's been a long-standing problem in in the test community Test doesn't even know what the health test does Now continuous learning It's not really a It's not a ends. It's a means Right it is but adaptation in my mind is an ends and we've talked about this multiple times So if we're focused on accelerating we can't accelerate way and and have a you know a year in between the The cadence points where we get any sort of feedback from the customer whether it be verbal or as we stated in the prior principle via data, I do think that is critical and that is So here's what I'm thinking in my head something along the lines that says We will move forward with a goal and a plan That what I'm gonna write or what I'm gonna say is is gonna be too verby But the idea is we move forward with a goal and a plan But we're constantly paranoid that it's wrong We test it and adapt There's something there and it reminds me a couple things I want to bring up one is I use this phrase a lot in my current job is make sure people have the I say Some people do or do not have what I call the appropriate level of paranoia. So that reminded me of that but test traditionally has been a cost center people look at it as a cost there was a book that came out it I Don't want to trash on it because maybe some of the listeners contributed to it But it was called how just the title I want to talk about how to reduce the cost of software testing What I see as a modern tester is it's not a cost a modern tester is a force multiplier a modern tester You can often tie dollar signs to their contributions which we only could apply negative dollar signs to testers So I don't know if I want to capture some of that But that thought came out in my head to me what I'm trying to communicate. I thought it might that's why I babble So say it again. It's Kaizen K-a-i-z. I know Kaizen is yeah, and and I'm trying to find the the interpretation Believe someone once shared with me Wikipedia is not validating this but I believe once someone once shared with me that Kaizen was literally translated as llama lines of being chased by a tiger That the that you're you're trying to improve but there is a sense of urgency around it so Wikipedia just says it's the word for improvement but The way it was once described to me was more around there's a sense of urgency around it The the other aspect that you were just talking about as it relates to adaptation And as it relates to a cost center and it occurs to me This could combine with what you've listed first for number six modern testing strives to be an ROI Center not a cost center So how do we continuously adapt to remove the wasteful practices from our system? It is a wasteful practice to test The last month before we ship. Yes, it is a wasteful practice to have a bug database These are all wasteful practices that that encourage manual human philosophical interaction Whereas in the modern world you don't need this You don't have to be theoretical you can ship you can get your data from your back-end database and you can Hypothesis or do hypothesis testing and prove or disprove which approach is better That is way too verbi for a principle. It is how about something like we Apply we something about We apply continuous improvement We use continuous improvement. What's the right verb there? We use continuous improvement I did a couple blog posts last year after based on my time in teams not not as Anger inducing as my last one about teams, but talked about two problems that team had the fallacy of now customers have to have my feature now and Failure to launch meaning well, I got to get it perfect before they get it I was too common in those two principles in a team culture is just death Yes, so what I have now and it has to be perfect So with a and and you have two different either we want to stop both of those right we want to One They don't maybe they don't need to have it right now and we need to be able to identify when that's not the when that's The case also we also need to identify with something. We have to get feedback on this. It's useless Because of a previous principle for us to just iterate on this forever without getting customer feedback So there's something about finding that balance maybe This you triggering a thought of this speech. I give my team and that is the single most precious resources I Am worried about it's calendar time then engineering time I cannot scale calendaring time and I can only scale engineering time to a degree and Nothing This is what I want this principle to sort of call out because nothing pisses me off more Where I have one of my superstars heads down on a project for three months We ship it and we realize no one cares particularly when I have a backlog of A hundred things that I could have done instead can I throw another one? I am yeah Doesn't use adaptation, but let's try this Continuously as this lot. This is a lot like the second one accelerating the three of constraints, but a little different Continuously solve problems for the team enabling them to optimize calendar time closer or farther away little of both I Think it's net farther away. I like calendar time in there Yeah, I think what we have here is better better Yeah, the thing I'm trying to I'm trying to do an emotional plea here really honestly Does this principle need to be I am the quality guy? My customers in pain Their pain is continuously moving. How do we adapt to solve the customers pain? That brings in the desperation and the pain part, but there's an important aspect here and that is Test shouldn't just be focusing on preventing customer pain instead of just figuring out. How do we make their pain go away? How do we figure how do we apply our talents to make the customer happy? What if I said this and just give me the the farther away farther away or closer? Ensure that the team adapts and optimizes in order to solve customer pain in order to solve customer pain Something there should be a time constraint in there in order to I like that Better so that's closer. I don't like the ensures the team part because then that it sounds like a guy in an ivory tower You guys will adapt What if I say embrace continuous improvement and help the team adapt and optimize in order to solve customer pain? Yeah, I think let's go on to six or the next one and then I think we'll we'll do another round offline Because I want to now see what all of these what the whole set looks okay I'm gonna leave it as the original one. I wrote with my notes here and number six is We strive to reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing role on our teams by increasing testing abilities and know-how across the team Yes, I think I'm okay with that one as is yeah, it's too long because really what you're saying. It's not that long I think it's shorter than any of the agile principles What am I saying? How would you say you're saying in essence what we've said on the podcast? It We're here to eliminate bottlenecks a Testing specialist is a bottleneck a specialist is a bottleneck in general. Yes testing is an activity that Can be taught and be incorporated into a specializing generalist system. That's essentially what you're trying to say. Absolutely I like the shock value around Testing specialists are a bottleneck That's this that's what this is saying that is what you're saying But I can't just that that as I've shocked value doesn't explain the principle behind it. It's a it's a statement No, yeah, it's it's that by itself is only useful when it's combined with the prior. We hate bottlenecks All right. We'll go with that. Let me read them off in order Okay, and then we'll have a little bit of a recap on that and then I think we'll be pretty close We may be tweaking that one for a while. So There's one other thing that's I think not Called out. What's that? So the thing that I am finding more and more validated by external content is that test is shifting to be much more focused on Business KPIs then code KPIs. That's not a principle, but I think we're missing something. I'm not now I think that's captured here. Okay, I think The customer is the business and that may be coming because you're doing a lot of stuff with business KPIs. So that may be Brent influence over modern testing influence That's fine. Let me read these in order in the new order Number one the customer is the only one suitable to judge and evaluate the quality of our software Yes, number two. We apply the theory of constraints to identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system Number three we are responsible for the quality culture of our team and are accountable for helping and coaching the team in this regard Number four we are not the safety net or the modern tester is not the safety net for software correctness We use data number five now we use data to deeply understand customer usage and customer pain number six Currently to be changed continuous learning and an adaptation both as an individual and a team is critical for success and then number seven for episode 77 we strive to reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated for a Dedicated testing specialist on our team by increasing testing abilities and know-how across the team. I think that's good I think those aren't bad. Yeah, it's what's triggered when you said that last one or the number six again What triggered this time around? When I go and help when I am doing doing the agile coach thing and I'm walking people through how to think about agile Okay, I Bring up It's about adaption not iteration. Yes, right? But that's an agile thing. It is an agile thing But what's the difference between adaption and? iteration constant learning That's the implementation. It's about changing the goal Iteration you don't need to change the goal you just Iterate correct adaption is your your changing the direction of the system. Yes, of course So the continuous learning and and all of that right if you combine these things What is our role in the system is to adapt the system towards a more positive customer goal? continuously and then when you say that I realize that that principle is very much Probably a lines with one or more of the agile principles exactly. So it's not unique to modern testing It isn't but That's true for several things. We've listed here not entirely not entirely constrained that one Specialists no, no, I I disagree Wholeheartedly the rest of these are all about modern testing. All right The fact that they do it within an agile mindset is one thing but they're all about modern testing These are things that most testers on agile teams won't say all But I'm gonna say many I'll say most the other six now are things that most testers on agile teams are Not doing it's the difference between agile testing and modern testing and it is a it's a gradual change It isn't like you're in one school or the other But if you're on an agile team and you're doing it right and you're not doing fragile continuous learning and adaptation a part of what you do, but the other things we mentioned are things that are Slightly different to most testers working on agile teams so they do specify some difference between the agile tester and the modern tester and So I'm thinking my thinking is is when I print these out. I'm going to remove that one and With the one we added about the safety net we'll be back to say and then see how it hurts and see how it hurts That's what I'm gonna work with I feel good about these I'm going to print these I'm going to vet them again with the test bash crowd and Then because I feel much better about these and then we'll at that point all that's left is maybe is a little bit of tweaking Which we can do Again based on feedback. We the principles are great because like everything else in agile they are fallible and they will be Adjusted as needed as we learn more information about our customers That's the one thing that once we publish these things if this if this ends up being a thing one thing I want us to do that the agile manifesto did not do is continuously iterate it as Think flaws are discovered. Absolutely. I cannot work any other way. I am incapable of doing anything perfectly I recognize that and embrace that so I figure I will just throw stuff out as it's close as we did today It gets better which it did today and it will continue to improve as we get feedback from smarter people than you and especially me It just occurred to me We could use the principles of modern testing to test the principles of modern testing. This is like inception No, we could we could shoot this out to to the three Then we can evaluate as they are Who's the customer of these principles? We have a customer. Yeah these principles the three is a is a good set of them So what I would suggest as we wrap up here is I'm going to write these out in the blog post They'll be a test bash. I encourage lots and lots of feedback via email the slack channel Twitter or whatever and We'll take that and iterate and learn Okay. All right Once again, I'm still Alan and I am Brent. All right. We'll see you next time on a be
