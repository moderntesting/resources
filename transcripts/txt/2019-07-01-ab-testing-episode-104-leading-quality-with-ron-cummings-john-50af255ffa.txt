The modern testing podcast join your hosts Alan and Brent I am mindless agile robot I must iterate as we talk about software engineering software quality leadership and whatever else comes to mind now on with the show good morning Brent good morning Alan it's been a while since we've been together been a month was reunited I'm not gonna sing on you that's a bad idea bad bad bad I know how you been? yeah now I got that song in my head I know you do how you been I'll tell you how you been yeah you're wearing one shoe today tell me a story I broke my foot last Sunday and how bad did the other guy did it? the the brick is just fine so the story I tell people the punch line is is I broke my foot by sitting and what happened is I was sitting cross-legged on my front patio unbeknownst to me I had put my foot to sleep and it was time for me to get up to go do something and in the process of getting up and walking I had failed to notice that my foot was paralyzed right the the tingling hadn't started to make it a clear sign that oh there's something problem so I started walking failed lost balance attempted to adjust my balance by shifting my foot sideways straight on an edge of a brick which broke I don't know if you've ever seen an x-ray of a foot but your your foot when you look at an x-ray the bones look very much like a hand where the little tips of them end up being your toes and doesn't work very well on a podcast brent brent's pointing to his hand right now but I essentially broke this knuckle so you can think of it as as um the bone as it extends into the big part or the big bone on your foot the pinky toe bone reaches into a knuckle and it's that knuckle I broke so you're a deuces I am it made a very concrete noise I remember in mid-flight I heard the noise and I said very quickly oh my god that's going to be a problem but first I need to make sure I do not fall over because after I hit that brick I lost my balance again and started tilting the other way and almost landed in a bunch of um bushes I successfully blocked that fall my son asks uh hey why don't you just put your hand out and just stop the fall and I said oh because I had my phone in my hand and I was also trying to protect my phone so it is you are an idiot on so many levels I'm not sure which one to make fun of the most so first off when you are uh in a situation like that it is all muscle memory there's no conscious thought no I would have I would have superhero rolled out of it all right then I'm just overall your muscle memory I mean I uh is that thing I've told you before I'm a black belt and take one though I've done superhero roles multiple times yeah how did those help you in this situation it did not good protect my phone crack and the I guess on that front I have I have destroyed many a brick with with uh in karate with with hands and feet but this time the brick one so this was brick revenge it might have been and I just just a quick question do you just have bricks randomly laying around your yard no this was uh edging you can imagine yeah sidewalk and I hit it that master of coordination ladies and gentlemen brain jensen yeah a b test how long where the empathy so at least you don't have like a big old cast on you have like a foot uh what's it called a not even a boot you have a you have a wrapper around your foot this is how long do you wear that uh another three to seven weeks okay what do you do when you go to put a shoe back on and uh your shoes are worn unevenly buy new shoes no you break the other foot to even it out no no that that does not happen I don't have a cast I would like the three to put odds on that given the story you just told given the time you know depending on the timeline like ever in my life I won't take that bet but yeah and the bone is not castable that that particular break is not castable so that's the reason why so what this this thing I'm wearing now what it does is it adds support to my foot I can I have crutches out in my car I don't need them per se at least not yet I can walk as long as I put the pressure on the inside of my foot not the outside where the brake is so really the way to fix your foot is the same thing as the root cause of breaking your foot you should sit more all right on yeah I don't know where I'm gonna go here yeah welcome to episode 104 so we have a guest today don't we Brett yes yes we have all the way from London England author of an upcoming book called leading quality Ron Cummings John Ron welcome to the A B testing podcast hello it's so it's so lovely to be here you guys are like the funniest pair talking all the time so yeah I'm excited about today I'm I kind of feel sorry for you because we're not that funny no we've been accused of this I know it's weird there is reminds me first tangent of the day I listen to this podcast called tech talk y'all which is interesting because it's a good way for me to catch up on the pop culture of tech but these guys describe themselves as a tech comedy podcast but they don't tell any jokes they're not funny all they do is make a few funny voices once in a while and act excited so compared to them we are funny so this is this is a testing comedy podcast you only you keep the bar very low yes all right back back to our guest we are I'm excited to have you I have read a preview of Ron's book and I have a bunch of questions out in front of me but first of all just tell us a little bit about yourself Ron and and what you've been up to and what you do and what kind of led you to writing this book yes so I am a co-founder of a crowd processing company I've been working with my my co-founder a guy called always pissed about 11 years now and we originally weren't from the tech or the the the testing well we were actually in the process of building a search engine for beauty products and we got backed by our investors to build that and as we were going about this process of building a search engine oh my goodness QA and just dealing with quality was a nightmare and um I remember we went back to our investor one day and said look I know finding the right beauty product is a problem but I mean I think that the testing could be a bigger one and that's how we got into the space that I'm you know fast forward five years we now work with some of the coolest tech companies in the world which is super fun and and what that did is it gave us this opportunity to understand how do some of the top companies the world like your faithless you google your your etch and all these guys how do they how do they test how they look at tests and how does that differ from what we see from other companies and so we came to get an ask this question by people you know what should my QA strategy be and we we originally thought that we could we could work that out and write a book on it in about six months little did we know it took us on a two and a half year journey of basically just meets lots of people finding out you know the truth behind what really happens in company and this led us to to complete a book which is uh the summer called living quality which really the summary if I was to say to someone is really that we in the testing space need to ensure that we elevate our conversation and are providing as much value to the business by focusing on what's happening for our customers and the QA and quality and test teams there are many ways to do that which is the kind of things that we end up talking about yeah I really like there's a quote in the book which you just uh talked all the way around I'm going to read uh which is as we came to the end of the book we realized that there was a much deeper question than what should my QA strategy be the question was how can I better lead quality inside my company which aligns a lot with we have these modern testing principles of course modern testing dot org check them out and our fourth principle is we care deeply about the quality culture of the team and coach lead and nurture this team towards a more mature quality culture the thing I like is how he just said he basically said principle one in his synopsis of the book yes which is our priority is improving the business and that's that's prevalent a lot that's uh I was as I was reading through your book I was kind of oh okay that aligns with that principle that aligns with that principle so congratulations on on agreeing with us so I I just privileged to have been on the same score pattern yeah I was going to say um you said you thought you were going to pound out this book in six months and I'm like in this particular community I'm not certain you could accurately define testing in six months oh man you know what let me tell you let me show you what really happened right yeah we wrote the first version of the book and um we gave it to a couple people and they were like no because one thing that that you probably know about the testing community is we love debate and arguing and the accuracy of everything that's that's said we test the idea to its empty group so the first version of the book basically got destroyed um and then we wrote it again and once again the level of uh questioning and justifying that has to happen before we could get to a releasable state was um was emotional and character building that which doesn't kill you right ron exactly so I guess the first question I I didn't I didn't make uh the short list of the the pre-read um um I actually thought that was on purpose I wanted I wanted Brent to come in cold and kind of hear all this for the first time no so we call it a b testing and we tell people it's because of Alan and Brent but uh you know a lot of the times it becomes clear and clear it's the a team and the b team yeah uh anyway before we continue I Alan has standing in front of him he has a long list of questions he wants to ask but the very first question is potential questions that I may ask is sum up when you say leading quality can you sum up the definition of quality in that case you know I feel like every time I talk to people that's the first question that they want to ask so what do you mean by quality you know and my continual answer is thank you for asking a loaded question um we it depends on how long you would like to continue the debate for um but really you know I think that the term and the word quality can be continued right because we we all get it right it's important everyone says they care about it but it has quite a nebulous definition of of itself and when I think about it I always say there's there's two facts that I guess everyone can agree on fact number one is that quality is subjective which means determined by whoever using it at that point in time which is obviously why the idea of making sure we're building things that customers care about is so important and then the second thing is that is relative right the idea of what quality is for you and I can change over time I often think back to yesterday years when I used to I used to sit and wait for things to a page to load on dialogue and you know that was that was fine you know I could wait 10 minutes it's perfectly subliminal however if that happened now my perception is if things were taking 10 minutes to load I I'm probably carrying my hair out and if you can see me realize I don't have much of that so it's interesting how not only is it subjective but it changes over time and so I often do support myself to uh Michael Bolton definition which is quality is value to some person at some time who matters and then every time I say that people are like well you know but Michael didn't actually set that he actually did it as an expansion of jerry and and this is why I think the book expanded and doubled in size because you have to qualify everything that you write before you explain it to anyone in the past week yeah so the problem with and Alan and I know this quite well the problem of doing anything that targets that community you got to expect the testing community to test that's that's the issue speaking of community you uh you quote Malcolm Gladwell on the book and you say if you want this is a global quote if you want to bring a fundamental change in people's beliefs and behavior you need to create a community around them where these new beliefs can be practiced and expressed and nurtured so tell me about your thoughts on community and how they lead how they help you with leading a quality culture well I think one of the things that is incredibly important when you're thinking about being a leader of quality is that we have to be good at influence those leaders and yes we're nodding we're nodding our heads loudly good because because there's like the people from the sales background that love selling and then oftentimes with people from a technical background who are like I don't sell that's not my thing that there's a thought that to sell is like uh not as good because sometimes it's a little bit more fluffy it's not as accurate and I truly believe that that thinking will limit people in the in the quality in the testing space in order to make the change they want to make happen inside their company because Daniel Pink has a book to sell as human and yes I think he pointed out we're huge Dan Pink fans here on the AB test yes good good because you know he did this whole study where he was like well it turns out that if you look at it the majority of your life is selling something to someone whether that's your kid your partner your wife your boss and so we all naturally sell but sometimes we don't think we should so coming back to your question of you know how do I believe that the community can can help us as we inside our companies for leaders and shape and quality it's really that if you are the only person in your company trying to make that change it's going to be tough you need other people around you whether that is your your peers your boss people in below you and your team you're going to need to start influencing and persuading other people inside the organization to to almost think in the same way as you but where I find people often go wrong and this is kind of what we found when we were talking to the different people is that they believe that everyone else cares about the things that they care about so when I hear people say oh you know the management team aren't listening to me when I'm explaining this thing around quality I asked them what they explained and the thing that always well it didn't surprise me but the thing that hurts me I guess is that often what they describe has nothing to do with what management teams care about they're not talking in the context of how it sits from a revenue perspective or the potential uh monetary saving they might talk about things like risk mitigation which is something we talk about in in the test of quality space but on the spectrum of what's pressing for that executive you need to make sure that you are attuning and saying things in the light that they care about and so this whole idea of utilizing community inside your company so to make the changes that are changed I think we always have to look at ourselves as leaders to work out how are we conveying the message and what I like to call the quality narrative inside our company so that we can help make that change happen and and sometimes I find that a blocker to change inside a company can be the existing narrative that that is that if you're inside a company right now where you know there's what we call that a poor ownership narrative so people believe that it's just the testing team that should own quality you've got to have trouble trying to get everyone to do to do stuff around quality in order to get that change where everyone is involved in quality and is thinking about quality there's going to need to be a narrative inside your business that hey ownership is part of everybody's responsibility everyone has a part to play in making sure we have a good quality product and so coming back to the whole Martin Gladwell quote it was really just trying to encapsulate that when we are trying to make influence happen inside our company we have to make sure that we are evolving multiple people and we have to also look at the narratives and the stories that are being told inside our company and work out how to adjust more favor to get people thinking about quality yeah um I have no so that that whole discussion you just had just reminded me of all kinds of things I've said similar things in the past right the the one thing that I will call out is in order to influence in order to lead you have to have followers and and I find that this is the this is the single most important thing people forget leadership is influence and and everyone thinks it's a tautology but I'm like no if you don't have followers you're not leading now the question this is how to get followers and and that is essentially by setting the narrative such that that individual makes a choice that the direction that they're going to go is in your direction because it is beneficial to them um you just thought I'd talk about some exciting stuff yes right it's it's you can't go to the executive and say hey we need to stop shipping bugs and and then fall back to old tired stories around you know bugs are bad or customers shouldn't be testing you know principle-based things um if those principles aren't clearly aligned with a business goals or how the business wants to run uh you're gonna be you're gonna waste less time just banging your head against the wall uh literally yeah right because it's if you want to move forward you how you express the narrative and how you communicate it in a way that the person you're trying to influence cares is what matters yeah I can't wait to read the book and you know what you just got me excited on something yeah because there's this there's this concept um that we talk a lot about internally in our company which is right there of vision which is that you know every company needs to have a vision of what they're doing where they go and then oftentimes people like oh my goodness I'm not the vision for this company that's why I want to join etc but the truth is I don't believe anyone cares about any company's vision whatsoever what they care about is the vision for themselves and the company is just a vehicle by which they plan to achieve that vision and so if you understand what the vision and direction of motivation of the people that you're trying to influence you and you can talk about things that help them understand that what you've just said to them will help move them in the direction of their own personal vision they're going to be so much more involved yes for sure completely yeah it there's a there was a multiple books pink did one and then there's a book that's one of my favorites called influencer where they say if you can target yes extrinsic motivation moves things along but if you can target an intrinsic motivator what personally drives that individual it's 10 times more powerful what's your next question fully agreed fully agreed hey uh I have a couple more to get to uh and all surprises for Brent of course um you in the book you have a section that talks about growth metrics with a shout out to another our principles are pretty much entirely based or largely based on uh the lean startup and you have a call out to Eric reason they're uh talking about vanity metrics of course and growth metrics and which ties again really strongly with our first principle our priority is improving the business so what's your advice to testers who work in a company without good growth metrics how do they get started what are they what do they do what if you're they read your book and go yeah we need some of these growth metrics what do they do you know that's true because sometimes people in situations where either their company isn't clear on the growth metric and they're not in a position to influence the core company's growth metric but what we have to say is even if your company doesn't have a clear metric for you to use you can still work out what yours is and and use it as the basis of a the work that you do and being how you drive communication so for example we often say that there are three main types of growth metrics that exist in product companies and and for those that have no idea what a growth metric is it's really just the idea what is the one metric inside your business that will help roll the business moving forward and oftentimes it's not just we need more money because that's not really a very valuable useful growth metric for the whole business it's usually where the customer derives value from your product and so there are three broad categories that we often talk about when we think of growth metrics the first one is attention-based growth metrics so companies that are B2C where it's like media or gaming or entertainment they're often trying to grab people's attention as for example this would be a company like Facebook where their core metric is the number of daily active users so a lot of the work that their teams do is driven around how can we increase the number of daily active users so while that team is testing instead of them just testing and doing some triaging and you know I think this is critical that they're actually going if we work on this problem if we solve or fix this bubble or prioritize it do we believe that we'll have a big impact on increasing the number of daily active users in this um in the product as a whole or if you're just working on a subset of the product whatever the the core metrics that you're trying to push off at that point and by by having that kind of focus you end up attuning your work to what the business cares about which is going to be the improvement of that metric which is going to be like more users etc and you also start to have other people in the business start to understand the value that you could bring and I often have arguments with people and they're like no no the people in the community shouldn't be focused on the core metrics for the business and I'm like that's probably why you're struggling to communicate with the rest of the business because you're not you don't care about the things that they care about and it all comes back to what we were talking about before when we were talking about um influence etc so what I've been saying is that the first the first growth metric that you might look at in an attention-based metric the the second part that you might look at is a a transaction-based growth metric so if you have a e-commerce website or a a marketplace of some kind there's often a transaction that has to happen so companies like airbnb their growth metric is around the number of night books because when when someone books a night it's the moment that the person that owns that property gets value and it's the time when the person who wants to be in that property gets better value but but there's also this whole section of growth metrics that is around productivity when you say productivity it's often for the the b2b space because when we have b2b software it's usually a workflow design or some kind of improvement in some sort of digital task that someone was trying to use that b2b software for and I love when I looked at like what slack were doing where they had worked out that if they could get a a company 2 000 messages then they knew that it was something like 97 98 percent more likely to go on to actually upgrade onto their school plan so everyone in their teams was so focused around making sure that they hit that 2 000 they can work on the problems or solve the issues or do more testing around the things that would improve that 2 000 number and so this whole idea of growth metric is really about making sure that you are focusing on activity that if you can change an effect have the biggest impact to the rest of the business and then when I talk about this I sometimes have people argue and they say well but you shouldn't just focus on one metric because loads of metrics to focus on and yes of course there are lots of other metrics for people to focus on but if you're trying to have the biggest impact in your role in the business that you're in beginning to think about what's going to drive our business and always have that at the back of your mind if you're making decisions will only make you more valuable as a tester and even if the stuff that you work on a day-to-day basis you haven't been able to find something that's going to move that needle incredibly well but you're still talking in the business about this idea unless the rest of the business know that you understand and care about driving a business forward whereas most times when people have conversations that I find when they're talking about testing they keep it so technical and testing related that it becomes hard for others to really engage and so coming back to this whole idea of leaving quality it's really just about ensuring that what we're talking about and the messages that people hear from our part of the business is we understand and care about the business and we think that there are certain things that we might be able to do to help push and affect that the more that anyone can have that narrative in their personal role or inside their department the more value like people are going to find for the work that they do and this is really what we believe from what we see Yeah, I... Brent was nodding his head a lot. Yeah, I've said many of the many things that you've talked about. Dow-MOW, daily active users divided by monthly active users I use all the time. It's a fantastic measure of stickiness whether or not your customers are coming back and they're finding value in your thing or are you just having a... you're able to constantly bring in new customers but they don't stick around right? What's that? Sorry, I was just saying when you look at that you know those are the most important questions that we need to be asking and one of the things I love about the testing community they always ask incredible questions. Yes. And ensuring that they're asking some of these business context questions which come down to the fundamentals should we be rebuilding this sometimes. You know the value that we can bring in our questioning is incredible so it's just ensuring that we're using the skill sets we already have but ensuring that we're adding the business side to the conversation that we have around the business. Yeah, it's one of the things... so the old definition of quality, the traditional point of view of quality is essentially bugs. It's what I now call code correctness. I won't talk about bugs and code as a quality issue. Quality in my view can only be defined by the actual consumer of the product that you're building. But it can be measured by people within the product, it can be evaluated, it can be improved. I completely agree with you that one of the strengths in the test community is its systems thinking and its critical thinking skills. And I do in fact dream of the day and where the community at large, I've converted multiple test teams myself, but the community at large realizes that applying that skills towards the definition of quality that you are suggesting is... and I'm a data scientist by trade so I'm making up numbers now, but I do believe it's an order of magnitude difference in the value proposition that these same individuals can use with their same skills. It is much more valuable to go in this new direction in this man's humble opinion. So I don't know if you're done with your questions, but I do want to ask Ron one of the common questions we get all the time on this. I'd love to hear your answer. So Ron, that's all nice and good, but that's the PM's job. I guess that wasn't a question. I can't worry about the business. My job is to find bugs. That's someone else's responsibility. I abstain. So I'm wondering... My response to that is actually just good luck. Good luck for your long-term career prospects. So he doesn't have a better answer than we do. So I do have some thoughts, right? So I was sitting down with Haseen and Zet the other day, and we were talking about defining roles versus gray area. And oftentimes people are like, oh, I really, I just feel like we need to define my role a bit more. I feel like I need to be clearer what I'm doing and where I'm going. And she said something, she said, here's the thing. If I work with someone and they are so stringent on I will only do the thing that pertains to my role, then I know I've got a problem with that person. Because in life, in business, there's always new things happening. There's always changes that happen. So if you're not comfortable with gray, you probably shouldn't be working with a company. And it is the gray where you actually get to provide a big different amount of value. And so this question of, hey, that is not my responsibility to look at what we're doing in this business. I think it's everyone's responsibility. I would much rather be in a company where every single person down to from the CEO down to the janitor is going, that doesn't look right. I should probably raise that. If you don't have that mentality in your business, and you're not a person that has that mentality, there is probably somebody out there who could do your same role and add that additional value. And the business that you're in would probably be promoting them faster and be having them do even more interesting things because they're going to be trying to make sure that person's mind is attuned and they're going to just work with them harder. I hate working with people that aren't looking at their role and asking themselves about that role in context of the whole business. Even when I work with developers and meet developers, I would much rather work with a developer who is asking critical questions about where we're going as a business than someone that just agrees to code the thing that I told them to go. Because no one has all the context and knowledge in their mind. It's this collective knowledge, these cross-functional teams that have the most value. So if someone actually began saying that to me, I think I'd begin a rant with them on how much value they're truly providing and where do they think their life is going. But yeah, maybe I don't have a good answer. No, no, no. So that one is more aligned. One of the things you went a different direction, but one I still agree with is one of the things that I've seen lately is a rise in the number of companies making an explicit shift away from, particularly in the tech world, away from specialist roles. Because the need for a specialist is sort of Moore's law of software development or personnel in the software world. You hire a deep database expert and then realize, oh, our product is now going in a new direction where we don't require a database. If that's all that guy can do, you've got a problem. And so there's definitely a move towards what's known as a versatility or a tee sheet person. So people who are deeply knowledgeable in two to three areas and are adaptable. And I'm now at a point when someone, I will probe them on two or three questions. And if I determine, no, this guy's closed-minded and his content being a specialist, then I just go, okay, I'm done with the conversation, right? Please come back to me when you realize you actually need me and don't want to just argue. Some people don't want to be helped. That's my question. One last question. I think we all have a hard stop coming up here, but in reading your book and then in our conversations, you saw like we did that your book aligned with a few of the modern testing principles. And believe it or not, these principles have been controversial to some and some principles more controversial than others. One I wanted to bring up was you said that your book aligned with our fifth principle, which believe it or not has been controversial. We believe the customer is the only one who can judge quality is the customer as king principle, which we fully believe. But believe it or not, we have had rather severe pushback from some people in the test community on this principle. I'm just curious on your thoughts on how your thoughts align with the customer being the only one who can value equality. When I'm actually, I'm not one who actually fits and argues with people who are adamant that they're right, because it's not worth the energy. It's not worth the time. When it comes to this whole idea of influence, one thing that I personally learned is if someone categorically does not want to change or want to be influenced, there is nothing that I can say that's going to help them. I would much rather work with someone that is ready to hear an idea. And yes, they may have questions around it or they don't agree, but still have taken the time to understand what had been said. So usually in cases where people are like arguing some ideas, I just don't have the time. I'd rather sit and talk to someone who is on the path that needs a bit of context to help them move forward. I think that's how we make a bigger change. And then by that point, we have enough people that means the person who could, who wouldn't listen, no longer could not listen. But on the idea of the customer being the main person of Jonas Quality, I believe this is so wholeheartedly. I often think about the idea of customer personas that are created by marketing and product. And companies would create these personas like Eileen Enterprise, who works at Enterprise, and she does this. And these personas are awesome for the product, for the product and marketing team, for them to generalize something. But the truth is, when we actually start to look at quality, there are quite an infinite number of personas because every single person who picks up that application or who logs on to that application to use it, they expect it to work perfectly for them in their conditions. Which means, in my mind, there isn't just a small two or three personas that we have to deal with in our company. There's actually loads of them. And we call them local personas because every single device, every single location, all the different presentations become unique personas that we have to end up looking at. And then once again, coming back to this whole idea, it was really going to drive value for our company. You can start to look at your personas and go, okay, so out of our customer base, we have right now, what are the locations or devices or the usage patterns that they're seeing where we should actually focus our testing to make sure the people we care about the most, we can have the biggest impact on. And that's in the case where you're trying to look at your existing personas. But oftentimes, and this is all about thinking about streaming from a business perspective, but when you look at the quality, oftentimes, the customers that you want in the future are not like your existing customers. They might not be on the same devices. They might not be in the same location. So you actually now need to test differently. You need to think about testing from a different perspective because you're now dealing with new personas that you're not currently looking at. And so I look at this whole thing in the same way the manufacturing industry went. There was a time in the manufacturing industry where they spent all of their time just focused on optimizing the production flow. And then after a couple of years, total quality management movement came along and they were like, guys, I think we should be caring about how these products work for our customers. And people were like, what are you talking about? What was your idea? And then over time, people were like, wow, if we build products that a customer actually wants to use, we can sell more business. And I almost feel like we have an industry that's going on. That's crazy talk. Crazy talk, customer. Yeah. I feel like we're in the same journey. Your manufacturing paradigm is spot on. We still hear it today. The single most important thing is that we make sure that our devs times are efficiently utilized. And then you find out, okay, they're not producing at fast rates. And even then, there's no idea of what value is of the thing that they produce. Right. Great. You have a machine that produces code like crazy that no one uses. Congrats. Exactly. And the reason why I know this following a similar trend is because every single methodology that we use inside software development right now has its roots in the manufacturing process. All of these Kaizen lead manufacturing, oh, let's look at DevOps. Let's look at Agile. All of these come from manufacturing processes. I say history repeats itself. We're going through the exact same evolution. I know in 10 years' time, people are going to be like, well, of course, we need to make sure the quality is defined by the customer. What else would you do? But hey, it takes time for people to change and adjust their thinking. Now, if you spend 50 years of your life with one paradigm, it is hard naturally to have a new paradigm. But over time, the ground will happen and change happens. We got to go. When does your book come out? And so Ron's book is Leading Quality. It comes out when? So it comes out the beginning of August. So actually just about a month away. Okay. And where can our three listeners buy it? So your listeners can go to Amazon.com or .co.uk or whatever your URL is in your local location. And you can order it there. You can also go to leadingqualitybooks.com. And you can request a free chapter. And actually, I think you can sign up now. In the first week of the book being released, we give the Kindle version away for free as part of our own promotion to just make sure that people understand these ideas. People just need to hear the stories and have the new reference points about what they can do to lead quality. And I honestly believe I'm going to spend a large part of my life, as well as my co-founder, just preaching and messaging about how do we lead quality. And I honestly believe in 10 years time, people who listen to this podcast is being like, well, those guys will listen to the future. Yes. It's a great book. I've read it. Ron Cummings, John, the book again, it's called Leading Quality. I'll put some links to it in the show notes. Thank you very much for taking some time out of your day to recur with us today. And we will look forward to rereading the book, Brent reading it, and to the three people who listen to our podcast, reading it and getting the word out. Thank you, Ron. Thank you so much. All right. See you.
