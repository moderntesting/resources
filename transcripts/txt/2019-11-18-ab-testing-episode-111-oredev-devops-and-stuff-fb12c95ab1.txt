Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey Brett hey Alan it's a podcast time is it I've pressed early I've pressed all the appropriate buttons I think you were clipping a little and now we can go hey never mind going fine it's always interesting and and you know how you get a bias when you have some knowledge about something and you assume that everyone has the at least basic knowledge of what you're talking about yes like I can fake it with statistics you've heard me fake it I have you cannot fake it with audio no there's probably some things like you do is it is it jujitsu which martial art do you do take one though take one though sorry I know nothing you could talk to I have zero knowledge there's no basic knowledge other than I can sort of pronounce Taekwondo you did that quite well thank you very much so I didn't do it well so you're saying you got two out of the three words correct welcome to the A B testing podcast where Alan and Brent were the A and B and A B testing will guide you through whatever as you can tell comes to mind right so perhaps semantics so shall we get on with the what's what's going on should we do topics right away and freak people out some people just skip through the first 10 minutes of the podcast waiting for us talking about something interesting yeah yeah so I took a brief trip to Sweden I saw you saw me in Sweden I saw a video of you in Sweden oh oh you want that I only watched the first half of it because at the same time we had I think his name is yao yao do a presentation I don't know there's the the three least two of the three oh the 343 podcast you did with Dave lots going on in the world of A B testing it's like a whole corporation no for sure except we the we don't make any money and I'm I'm sure the surprises you I am vastly more interested in what the three have to say than what you do yes you should you should and so I went to or dev and in Sweden flew into Copenhagen took the train probably one of the best run conferences ever I bet that I've been to this is a devops this is your first DevOps it's not a dev it's a developer conference okay there was a testing track but the testing and quality track but there weren't really many testers there but let me get there quality the number of speakers the quality of speakers it is a huge conference imagine I don't know how many people were there but my room had a hundred ish people in the testing quality track people like like Jez humble you know Jez one of the authors of accelerate and the author oh yes absolutely he was also a speaker there a track speaker okay so on the day of my talk I showed up early outside go I'll go to the keynote I'll check out my room first make sure I know what it looks like I'll go to the keynote I go to the keynote I'm going I hadn't looked at the really looked at the program in advance I wonder who they got here and what they're gonna talk about and I don't know if you were ever read the book everybody lies good book on data he oh wait this is the author that did a whole bunch of when Google made their search data public he did a massive amount of research and found really really high correlation between search for racial racially derogatory terms and Trump voters found out that far more people search for porn that admit minute anyway he was the morning keynote speaker okay so that I have not read it but that is one of the many books that I have purchased and is sitting in a stack that I'm hoping to absorb the knowledge through osmosis brief tangent I also have this problem of buying books that I don't get to read I've been I was really good for a long time a little bad right now about four or five behind not too bad one thing I've started to do to rather than buy the book but to hold a placeholder for it is I do like the Kindle thing where I haven't sent me the first chapter for free and that's sort of the placeholder when I'm around this is I can read this chapter maybe but maybe by the time I actually get around to reading it may not be relevant anymore so that's my new plan oh so you so you load the first chapter in your Kindle it's sort of a placeholder and it ends up being like a to-do list yes exactly right and then you go oh and if I ever actually read chapter one yeah I like this strategy so that that's what I do anyway or dev great conference I had a good time with my talk the recordings available I watched part of it I've never really watched my speaking much but I actually I'm curious what people have to say about it because I created a presentation where I would I was planning to adapt it depending on the audience and their experience so if I were to give a talk on modern testing principles and and how they've been used to the three I would go a lot I would not go much into explaining the principles but I would dive into all kinds of examples and examine some of the controversy and go on and on and on in this room there were maybe one or two people that had heard of the modern testing principles so now we have more people to know about them there's also maybe 90 plus percent of the audience were developers and what I found is the development audience were very very accepting of modern testing principles because they're not that much about testing or modern and you didn't get to the end but one I'm just gonna get I'm gonna get one little spoiler because somebody asked and the inevitable question should testers be able to code and where Brent would say yes I said it certainly helps and and then I elaborated as I do and I said something something to the effect of and they should but if you know how to code you can use that to write tools to help you do testing I wouldn't spend that time writing automation and then the next person said I have a question did you just say did you just say testers shouldn't write automation and my answer was yes that is correct but I'll elaborate because now I know you want me to but it was it was perfectly set up I love that question anyway good conference I ended up I went to a big chunk of the conference on Friday the day I presented also I arrived on Wednesday didn't go to anything out there too late Thursday I went to a few talks ended up working a lot from my hotel room had a bunch of stuff going on one other tangent is Netflix does not have Brooklyn 99 in the US okay but every time I go out of the country it's available on Netflix for me to watch so I watched a lot of Brooklyn 99 from my room and then I downloaded a bunch to watch on the plane on the way back I can still watch the downloaded ones that I downloaded in Europe but I can't download anymore while I'm here so it's like I have to drive to Canada or something why is I don't know licensing deals I'm not involved in Brooklyn I'm not involved in Amazon's licensing deals Netflix Amazon whatever it's a it's a fluid download thing also of interest is Disney Plus are you signing up for that no I'm not neither am I and I've heard and I've heard it matter it really I've heard it said kind of a hot mess I think it'll be a matter of time before I will feel obligated I'm not sure I will ever feel obligated for that so I'll just I'll just ask one question yeah Marvel or DC Marvel right and I think that closes it eventually yeah but what if I already own all the DVDs yeah even then that doesn't block it five ten years from now they'll be like a way for you to play your DVDs you're right and actually I own digital copies most of those but anyway one thing was interesting I want to elaborate on one point before we get back into our topic that was last week's topic that failed is I mentioned the audience for my talk was mostly developers and I talked quite a bit with one of the conference coordinators after my talk about how two points to make I have two points to make and then we'll go on to our topic no I actually I think this is an interesting topic right there's there's a lot of movement in this is the first time to my knowledge that you've presented this to primarily a dev audience and one observation there and then I the first observation was is the controversy in the principles is much less so there to an audience of developers of a lot more head nods in fact anecdotally when I've even at testing conferences people to go thanks for giving a name to what I already do those people are primarily developer type roles anyway with a little bit of quality background maybe remember when we wrote the principles without the one that would cause the biggest uproar is one more we say where the testing role may be eliminated oh my god my livelihood you're ruining the craft but I feel like we've been able to talk about that one quite well and people have they get it they go yeah I can I can picture that world what has been more controversial at a lot of talks about this at the conference was principle number five where we say that only the customer is able to evaluate the quality of our product and we take a lot of everything from you just expect the customers to do all your testing because you're lazy or my customers special or whatever flavors of those you want I still believe that now we can is worth talking about a little bit because we do take not only a lot but continued grief people come across this one it really triggers a lot of people and they make some arguments which I I kind of see where they're coming from but they're also in some cases getting lost in the semantics of the customer as a software developers it's off for a team I want to make software that helps help someone do something better that person I'm helping or something easier remember customers don't want software they want their problem solved right I want to help people solve their problems help people do things they couldn't do before help people do things more easily than they could do before help people get their eyes opened up to new things they could they didn't even think they knew they could do those people are my customers so let's say for example I am the team building software for a medical device that well we've had some famous bugs with x-ray machines I say I'm building a software for automated collection of and dosage of an x-ray machine for various uses who is my customer person that's impacted person being x-rayed the person using the device so I can have multiple customers the doctor the hospital may be the one that buys the device for me but I think I believe my customer is anyone it's the person's his problem is being solved which is it can be a multi-layered customer well in that case right so I and correct me if you disagree I'm just I believe it's yeah that would be no concerns there Alan so if you think about it from from a two-pronged approach an x-ray we don't want to just a simple thing we don't want to over irradiate our clients yeah because that would be bad they would die right but what's the reason why they're getting an x-ray they're having a problem right okay purpose of an x-ray is diagnostics yes tool it's it so with you so far the the person under study is a key customer here as well as the person who's using the tool to do diagnostics is is a customer as you know I broke broke a bone in my foot recently it's still not entirely healed it's one of these slow breaks but it's a lot of work for for the doctor to go what the hell's wrong particularly if it's a fracture right could you there's a be a different treatment for a sprain strain ligament versus a bone fracture and the and the amount of the fracture etc yeah you need to know what's going on so if they can produce a higher confidence diagnosis faster then that that x-ray versus say traditional x-ray devices is going to be a preferred one and also I want to dive into this little bit so there's there's value in we all get everyone gets the value in the in the diagnostic software but also the software we create should do no harm that sounds a little bit too much like Google it should not the the the side effects the the it shouldn't have unintended consequences that detract from the value it should so who values an ethics yes so who evaluates the quality of that other consumers I don't know I'm trying to come up with a new version yeah what I've discovered so here's the thing I'm gonna take an aside that's actually relevant but maybe an aside I'm not surprised that dev audience was like wait why are you setting up here telling me things I already know right but and that's hyperbole it is because I I I do weave some stories in and I want to go actually I'll go back to that in a minute but go ahead and go on a lot of my portion of developing MMT came from my own personal experiences like helping moving to unified engineering right I was ahead of a dev team and we've recorded this several years ago or where I spent a lot of time I had left tests and I said okay now why would I bring a tester back into the system what value would they add and I realized would have caused more harm than good having a specialist in right I had a smooth running Kanban system I had a process with dealing with very rapidly errors in production there wasn't a value for me in a test specialist at that point in time and thinking about from from a dev perspective I find it interesting when I go and talk to dev I don't have these semantic discussions I don't have to clarify what is quality I don't have to clarify what is customer and and I'm trying to in my head going what does that mean what is that it like there's there's definitely a key culture difference between a dev specialist community and a test special there is there is and that just got me thinking of an epiphany that immediately blew out of my head because I was thinking about too many things at once yeah it's it is and I am super old I'm about to have a birthday congrats I'll be a hundred years old I don't think that's true not quite I'll still be in double digits no but times ticking for me March 5-0 oh yeah I remember that one so I was really drunk so I want to back up and then move on I kind of put a cap on the maybe a temporary cap a trial close on the principle 5 controversy I think I truly believe and I and I still I believe people I hear arguments all the time and how we're and against it all the time I still truly believe that is not only a valid principle and worded correctly but one of the most important principles nuts pretty much I mean that's stolen from a chapter of Reese's book I think five and one are the two most important it's you don't get value from your engineering effort in touch in the hands of customers and even with an x-ray machine I may find building an x-ray software I may give the doctors the soft before it even actually hooks up to the x-ray machine to make sure that I may give them the software a prototype that does doesn't do the x-ray but so they can use the software and it'll have mock-ups for example of how it may give the feedbacks to make sure they understand how to use it that using is intuitive and then the way they use it is the way that I thought they would use it so I can adjust as needed I may do all fun developing this x-ray software I may do all that work so I can get that customer feedback before I actually start implementing the the hairy x-ray part yeah absolutely I think it'd be a great way to do that a lot of the things and we could go back to how about the software for an airplane that fails and causes it to I would put that in a massive amount of simulations with pilots and well before I put that in the plane no I think I think on the on the the quality discussion there's a couple of thoughts right number one going back to briefly back to this difference between the tests and dev culture right I remember when I went from test to dev with a strong passion around quality I felt oh oh my god I am a lot closer to the customer I can now actually influence quality which leads me to and fully agree and that leads me to the second big takeaway and this came up in my conversation with the conference organizer after the talk as well which tied into my observations at the conference which have tied into my observations and you know when you reflect on years you go oh my god you have a revelation you go how is I so stupid they never get to this before you've been on the channel you've heard me talk about this and I mentioned it to a few people internally but I am realizing that DevOps whatever it is is it a culture is it a role in my five for Friday last week I pointed to a podcast that talked about it and what's interesting in this coding blocks podcast I I would say I put the link in the show notes but I'll forget look up coding blocks and find it they talk about DevOps it is haunting when they talk about DevOps how much it sounds like testing and how much they talk about specialists really just want someone with us but that specialty you don't want to have a DevOps team and going oh my god and not just that point but points over and over and over and over and I'm realizing that as far as accelerating the delivery of customer value or accelerating the achievement shipable quality DevOps has far more to do with that and or an infrastructure team working on accelerating the team in way in safe way in ways that ensure safety and quality is a farm hands down far better way to do that than QA oh and I ran and talk about bringing the quality perspective to a product team when I was at Microsoft on teams my last project there I was hired as the quality guy at the quality coach and then I had a manager who was kind of a dick and it kept on yelling at me every time there was a bug and it's like Jesus this is 1990 2015 2016 but I ended up taking over all of the infrastructure team everything from developer desktop to customer deployment and that gave me a lot more control I got yelled at a lot less still wasn't super happy but it worked so since then I you sacrificed you sacrifice something I can't put a finger on it for autonomy maybe but let's move on because that was that was a good learning experience for me and more learning in retrospect I but that was I actually also managed a lot of offshore testers so it wasn't wasn't the best experience so let me move on to my current role at Unity and we'll we'll splash back and forth between hold on I'm not done with the last topic no no no we're we're easing in here we're gonna go back it's gonna it's gonna we go ahead that's great there's I keep in the back of my head I keep thinking about the experience and this difference man I do think there's something important there and it occurs to me like hey Ellen do you think testers should code no yeah I'm actually gonna change that and you said Brent will say yes and I'm gonna say and when Alan said that he was right but I'm gonna I'm gonna change it now because I'm actually now wondering if Tess can really understand quality from the outside meaning in a and when I think through processes you and the listener should be aware that at first I go to the extremes when I went from test to dev that shift was very much going from theoretical to actual previously I stood on principle I stood on theory I said things like what you want the customer to do your testing for you needed and right we had an episode we had this whole conversation when I was in a dev role the accountability the responsibility was on me to prove to to provide value so I'm gonna say yeah test should code but even further they should get on a feet they should be coding a feature see I don't fully agree I think there's so I think the the path for a quality specialist to be effective as and an impactful on a software team is not to specialize solely in testing but the paths they can go into are wide and I think I have found I don't think we disagree but you said feature and I think this dev ops this infrastructure role is a very common path for testers I think whatever so we both agree they should we want specializing generalists not specialists yes okay what I'm proposing because there's one commonality that occurs to me for both you and I we both coded features yes we have right it doesn't have to be a big one so this testing specialist that I'm talking about could they be assigned a small feature and be an own that in the end just for the experience yeah that's exactly I'm not I'm not against it I don't think it's a requirement I think it's a good idea yeah I'm trying to come up with what is the key thing is that we have to de-theorize the testing specialist position yes that's it theory always breaks apart in the face of reality right there's a lot of thought experiments there and yeah and all right I'm done now my the modern testing course on ministry of test there's a lot of thought experiments there like in episode 7 one of the exercises is what would need to change on your team in order for it in order for testers not to meet it just think through it just just not saying quit must think get yourself fired so just think about what would need to change maybe the list is huge maybe it's short just think about yeah there's a lot a lot of theory there so now this will still tie into my point from earlier is I've been thinking about this move to DevOps and what people do and I have a small I wouldn't call it a QA team so I have one I have two people who on my team former testers okay one of former lead very experienced knows how to code super smart guy he is basically functioning as a test coach for a huge part of the organization what I found is that our developers do pretty much 100% I'll say 95% of the testing they know how to do which is that's a that's a greater amount of testing than maybe they knew how to do six months ago but not probably still not enough so having someone there who has that breadth of experience to just think about new ideas have you thought about this should we try this has been really really helpful also at the same time he's he's sort of half in a DevOps role and I would consider him part of the DevOps team but he just happens to some quality coaching and in fact I would view him as longer term as DevOps but he has the testing expertise so he's gonna end up coaching there we've talked before about this were just like you have a database expert or performance expert or a front-end expert or a react expert having someone with some experience and expertise in testing is a good value add for the team but being a total specialist of being a bottleneck is not a good idea so I had an interesting we added one more person to my team through acquisition acquired a small company they had one QA person but it's interesting how much it's weird when you have a manager who is not like me at all but we tend and we get we get to our conclusions from different angles but we agree our philosophies are highly aligned and I'm not sure how or why because we came from different directions and backgrounds but interesting conversation he asked about this person QA person in the New York he didn't use these words but I think at first he was worried there were more of a traditional QA and I'm gonna I'll paraphrase the whole conversation but basically I think what he wanted to find out is could this person be it be a test coach like the other person on my team okay and the answer is yes but it made me think more about people with test expertise in modern testing growing in the test coach roles or test consultant roles and I realized one thing that a skill that I've been working on but an interesting thing is there's a level above it where I need to one area where I want to get better it as coaching coaches when I rely on coaching from my team so much that makes me realize that I need to and how to coach coaches right yeah I have a similar problem and it's essentially have I ever shared the definition of empowerment please do so Brent empowerment is trust that the person that you're empowering will make the same decision you will in your absence I think I've heard that before yeah I am spending time empowering coaches I'll use the term coaches in this context on my team in order to scale right I need this I need more guide ers in order to in order to take one of the key things that I'm doing right now and have it go viral right right now it's bottlenecking behind me oh bottlenecks are bad you should I want to get the coding blocks podcast again because you got to listen to it you'll crack up they have a long conversation they're talking about whether DevOps should be a role or a culture and I and I believe it's a culture but that you may hire some DevOps folks to help there and in the middle of that argument they had a nice long discussion over where they don't want the DevOps team to be the only people that do that stuff so that stuff bottlenecks on them sounds familiar huh good strategy so it's very much I mean DevOps is very much a there's some expertise around things like Kubernetes and Jenkins and CI systems but you want to empower the teams around you to use those tools miss and come to you when they need expertise to figure things out that whole role is at Unity at least is a small team imagine so 200 engineers working on a very profitable business and there are five people working on six people maybe working on infrastructure and DevOps and tools so obviously a lot of it is them building the base and the rest of the engineers absorbing their output one way to make sure that team isn't a bottleneck is to not overstaff it because it's small because it's because it could be a bottleneck make it so that if it were a bottleneck it would be so painful to death to do something about it right which is kind of like the way I actually I believe that's why basically three people across these 200 plus engineers who have some testing expertise with me being one of them make sure that we are not a bottleneck or when I was a when I was the test guy the quality guy on teams I wasn't a bottleneck because I was if I would have had a team of ten people who would have been the testing bottleneck no but the other key thing is leadership and in this case so I have seen teams with your same degree of staffing and the same degree of power that you have go a different way it is just a flip of a switch Ellen in your brain that makes this a coach model versus a command and control right if you could just as easily take your three people and turn this into command and control structure I suppose and with your background be able to articulate it's the right thing for the business you and I both know it wouldn't be I know but it's it's do you think it comes really comes down to that flaw because I inherently believe in autonomy and giving people a framework and getting out of their way and and coaching as a leadership style I would argue that sort of attitude is becoming more and more prevalent among tech leadership I think it is and they and I think it's because I'll tell you when I changed my mind accountability is an important thing and every person in leadership role is going to have a different philosophy but they're all accountable for something true some of us are risk-averse some of us are that I don't know what the opposite of risk-averse is but take a damn the torpedoes mentality when I when I went and I learned the Kanban model and I learned that shipping small things faster continuously integrating getting that feedback loop so I can respond immediately if we screwed something up not only was better in producing quality but also reduced risk right and true one million percent true yeah and and so a lot of it comes out of the decision making factor in in prior roles no we're shipping on this date right and so I had to spin up risk mitigation mode to because again I was accountable for the the risk that we shipped and the more that that loaded up the more time I needed to be able to evaluate the risk and the more it further loaded up the more I lost confidence of my ability to evaluate the risk so when I learned and when you're in that mode command and control is critical because you need to make sure that somebody somewhere randomly doesn't do something that completely changes that risk equation because you're already having a hard time figuring out what it is right but with this other model I'm like oh yeah you know what you think it's right Alan do it make sure you have a monitor make sure it turns itself off within the first five minutes you realize you're wrong just help people stumble towards success right so I want to tie this in we got about 15 minutes left here to our oddly rambling discussion in the last podcast and it was odd one of the three said they really really liked him we weren't sure why but because we spent most time exploring my role at Unity the conversation really got thrown for a loop because my official title on paper is director of program management and there's a skew because Microsoft has a odd view on what program managers are it's different from the industry and we spent a lot of time just trying to clarify what that was so my title on paper while works I want to reframe that around the discussion we just had so it was so wouldn't help last week but I consider myself a delivery director or delivery manager but then that sounds too much like your release manager you you accuse me of being that's not quite it at all but then Percy reminded us we had this conversation a year ago almost a year ago when I was thinking about this job and you said Alan it sounds like you're a release train engineer which is a term from the safe world and bread test safe training and the definition the RTE the release train engineer facilitates the agile release train or you know TM facilitates processes and execution escalates impediments helps manage risk insurance value delivery and drives continuous improvement or in short the RTE helps the team deliver and get better and that's actually doesn't describe my entire job because I have some other coaching aspects in there but that's largely what I do I try and I I try and help the team learn from failures learn from mistakes and try to improve and overall make sure we're getting value to customers actually the way I put it I think I'm this last week I try and balance velocity and quality so under that and that ties into what you were just talking about so does that and then I'm gonna get into the question we never answered last week does that framing of my job as release train engineer since you know that language does that help you understand what I do what my responsibilities are yeah in the last cast the topic was what what KPIs it wasn't really KPIs like as someone with quality experience or as a quality leader in a release train engineer type role I'm paraphrasing to fit better context this time what would be some things you would do or I can't measure within there what would be some things that you would do or measure along those lines yeah I've spent a lot of time thinking about that and also thinking about this one witticism part of our job what's a witticism word I made up okay just checking when we talk about quality it occurs to me that a lot of the times it's getting overloaded oh yeah right it's there's there's three words that I'm finding one of the definitions of quality is a word that means 11 different things 10 different people well the thing that's really interesting to me is that in the test community right we've known that the only the only thing testers can agree on around the definition of the word test is that it has four letters other than that there's no agreement on what is test true but customer and quality are also ambiguous apparently and we learned very recently that customer was ambiguous I sure but in your role right it's two phases there are two aspects build the right product build the product right cliche and cliche right so those yeah I'm involved I'm involved in helping teams get better at that but I do also partner quite a bit with both product managers and product marketing to build the right product so let's go back engineers don't know how to build the right product that's one thing need to be told how to do a lot of the time right in decomposing that how do you how do you reduce the friction to tell them what to do and most importantly so that they self-learn it so I had a conversation and I should ease into this if we're different direction while product marketing or product management may have a good idea based on what they've done talked customers research whatever to figure out building the right product we don't know that until only the customer can evaluate that absolutely so it's all a bunch of hypotheses so that's where my role steps is a great understand we're trying to build how can we what's our path to get that feedback as soon as possible I had a conversation yesterday with with someone at Unity I'm talking about a project that they said was a failure that may not have been his words or may have been his words and expressed disappointment yeah and I said so I was at a failure and he talked about things and and blah blah blah blah blah end of story the product was a failure because it was canceled or redirected or whatever and never really solved the customer problem and I said let me rephrase that again so get rid of that that face this product was a failure I want products to fail that's where we get to learn but this product took three months to fail when I think we think we could have made it fail in a month and that's that's that's what we need to learn from I want products to fit I want us to reduce the time from product hypothesis to customer impact customer feedback and if it takes if it takes three months to figure out the building the wrong product that that is something to learn from I think it depends on what you're making but you want to so here's a product idea blah one of the things I help teams discuss and I think we're off the track here a little bit but we're not is what is our path to figure out and this is the right product how are we gonna validate this as soon as possible and what I'm finding is to the less experienced their idea of the minimum viable product is much more expansive than what I think the minimum viable product may be so that is a I haven't heard that discussed much the far as how to make how to really identify the MVP because what I've seen in practice is people call the minimum viable product something that I saw this on I've seen this for years and years and years it's a certain definition we used to call beta yeah what they call the MVP is far far far more than minimum so one thing and read and one of the three listeners can point with this exists but one thing I've been working out a lot is helping teams narrow down their definition of minimum and I haven't seen a lot of writing or I'm just thinking a lot of the talk about this is something we that needs to be explored more is how do you take what you think is minimum viable product and make it a truly minimum viable product that's one aspect of my job from a strategy that's easy we are all over the tangent world here I actually don't do you know this all makes it's all connected I am briefly considering everything you just said and go okay is this the next most important so for me it's easy a minimum viable product is the smallest thing you can ship where you gain the greatest amount of knowledge around should you continue to work on this thing yes okay I have had this particular conversation with multiple different people I always bring up the Reese example because I think it's beautiful they had spent six months and realized that they had spent one day building an advertising website that said click here to download they didn't even have to implement the download that it could have returned a 404 and they would have learned in one day what took them many man-hours in six calendar months to learn yeah yes yes I think it's and this has been true for my entire career in software I think there's too much faith from developers that the customers will want the thing they're building and we need to use customers and data to understand that do you know who Stephen Blink is no Stephen Blink is was actually the inspiration for Eric Reese he is a professor at Princeton he highly recommended book four steps to the epiphany also I would link it but I'll forget look it up he shared you know I paused there he shared if one of the three if you just want to be an admin on the podcast website and and want to go and happy to have it happen just gonna throw that out there anyway he shared see now we're we're a B test coaches we're realizing that I'm the bottleneck I'm right right I know I know my limitations so I'm looking to delegate yeah yeah now I have to take a moment because I completely lost my train of thought he shared no I got that part Stephen Blank shared inspiration for Reese oh you're talking about developers great developers developers developers so I happen to happen to go to a place where I saw Stephen Blink do a talk and one of the phenomenons that he talked about was was venture capitalism in Silicon Valley in that the culture had been changing and VCs had learned a heuristic which is if this is a company trying to get additional income if they had a head holy of sales already hired odds are we're going to say no why because it was the head holy of sales let's say a VP of sales or VP of marketing their primary job is to go talk to the customer now usually the founder is the inventor and one of the problems with inventors and I'm going to say this a problem exists with developers as well is the NIH phenomenon we've talked about many times my idea is awesome and it is absolutely better than yours if you have a VP of sales and they go out and they try to flight this idea and they realize the customers don't want it let's say you're the the CEO and you have this my shit don't stink and I'm the VP of sales and I say Alan no one wants this idea right you have two choices reevaluate your belief in that of your idea or reevaluate your belief whether or not I'm a competent VP of sales long far longer story short VCs nowadays they want you the founder to do the customer connection not a VP of sales because they have learned you trying to hawk your wares to customers helps to you to get the feedback and understand where you're wrong yes and an irrational belief of righteousness kills startups yeah and but you see so much of that not in startups as well as within companies I saw that Microsoft 150 million trillion times right and this is why this is why I always take the term product requirements nowadays and I change it to hypotheses yes I am I am trying to purposely make people realize doesn't matter how important their belief is there's still a chance they're wrong of course and the first thing we need to do is evaluate that as and many textbooks talk about this the idea of falling in love with your ideas yeah and I always fall back to and going back to customers don't want software they want their problems solved and if you don't understand if you don't have at least three different solutions to solve the problem you don't understand the problem well enough that's from Weinberg slight paraphrase focus on that and realize I mean here's it's a hypothesis you can understand the problem and go here's my idea for a solution you get you get some feedback on it you either you pivot or you persevere yeah I think about right just before you and I met this morning I was staring at a report that one of my directs and I have collaborated on and that whole report its whole purpose in life is to shine the light on everything I can think about about why I'm wrong yes that's a good way to look at it and that helps I think I've brought that up recently it might have been in my in the course it might have been in the talk but I feel like I've talked about that recently yeah prove the negative hypothesis yeah so there's the the you want to you want to aggressively try to prove the negative hypothesis and then hope you never do yeah sure and but what I find it's a nice lens to put on that every time I actually prove the negative hypothesis is hugely valuable in my role my currency is credibility yep right when I stand up in front of a crowd and I have my data scientists hat on and I'm saying this is what this is saying people are going to take action and and I don't want to come back next month oh yeah remember when I told you that never mind yeah I'd right when I'm doing a public presentation this is an aside that when I'm doing a public presentation in data science mode it really hurts me because I cannot allow my natural tendency towards hyperbole out that is dangerous I think we've decomposed enough for discussion we will talk about continued topics of whatever comes up in the world as we continue our path towards a yeah we'll see ya we'll see ya oh my god soon I thought of something else I wanted to mention earlier but then I forgot to bring it up so I thought about bringing it out those at the clock I said no I'm not going to so that's all we're gonna do today okay I am the master editor of this podcast and I am NOT all right au revoir
