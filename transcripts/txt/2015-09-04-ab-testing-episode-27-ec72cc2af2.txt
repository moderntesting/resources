Hey, I am charming. I charming. I'm mr. Hilarious. You're not mr. Hilarious. Just hilarious. Yeah. Yeah, sorry Yeah, all right Screw that up already. Thank you. You want us as go for your? Labels for us. We had a conversation we talked about you want us Cast talk last podcast. Yeah, and we had a little Twitter exchange afterwards She insisted we were charming and hilarious. We insisted she was wrong In fact, she is wrong because in this room she cannot argue with us anymore. So correct. All right, so I'm actually Not Brent and I am not Alan. I Always want to say stuff and see what Brent does. Hey, this is episode 27 of a be testing welcome everyone and 27 I don't it's a it's a nice number Sure cube divides by three. Yeah, that might even be three squared Don't you don't you have like a math degree? Gonna sip some coffee. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I gotta think what's new. What's new with you anything? Anything cool? I'm saying going on. Hey, I just came back from vacation. Where'd you vacate to? I took two weeks off first week I spent Finishing off a sentiment analysis project for my school. Oh, yeah. Sorry. I know I know it sounds boring No, I like really cool It's a lot more work than than I ever expected to just get to 85 percent accuracy And then I spent the next week at Walt Disney World Those who are around or near Florida during last week one of the one of the exciting things was it's hurricane season and Erica spent a good portion of the week threatening to let us not go home. Oh So every day I was calling the airlines. Hey, have you canceled what's going on? And it turns out up until literally 8 p.m. That day Everything was gorgeous except it's freaking humid in Florida. I'm never moving there. All right. Good to know. Yeah I'm sure actually people in Florida would be happy to hear that. Yeah, yeah, they're lucky Anyway, yeah, it was it was good times. Very cool. Very cool. Should we dive right in? One thing no, not yet. We talked about her Presentation where we got the charming and hilarious. I wouldn't re-reviewed it after our bar And you didn't like it didn't like it. Oh, it was fantastic That's Thing was gonna go off in the wrong direction. They're one of her slides where she talks about the mysterious customer like That cracked me up. I I didn't see the recorded talk. So I haven't seen her president. I think I got the slides I walked through I think it's finally been posted with they kind of post things in order I haven't chance to go through everything. I've only watched a couple talks, but I believe it's posted now I think I saw a tweet about that. I absolutely think it's it's a worthwhile I'll see if I can dig up a link and put it in the the elaborate show notes. I post every every episode That was sarcasm for those of you that just download the episode never read the show notes There's like two sentences there in this episode Alan and Brent talk about nothing period and yeah We're like the Seinfeld of test podcasts Except we're not funny That's absolutely true. All right. So one thing in number 26 podcast 26 We were talking about cast and we've had all just a like a 30-second talk about context-driven testing the school and Which I thought was plenty but Brent would like to talk about it some more so I'm not always a fair game talk about Well, so dive in a little bit. I don't know. It's it's Almost a mailbag item, right? We All right now it is a mailbag item. All right, that's right we had we had several folks who took that that 30-second blurb that we put in and Wanted to get more information from us as to why we sort of felt that way. So are you Let's get some of the that before someone Just turns off the podcast and either yells at us or just ignores us Are you? Against the context-driven school. I am NOT against any of the schools that the Thing it so Alan in in his Twitter response said something and I don't think I could say it more succinctly I just think it's redel. They had 140 characters Yeah, I know But I think the context-driven school of testing Redundant I think it's just simply testing. I'll play devil's advocate because I've watched the growth and the the following of this school and So I'll play the other side of it and there is bad testing going out there. There is factory type testing happening In the world today. I also call that bad testing or I mean, I think all When I first read lessons learned in software testing Which I I think the cut the school is out before them But it was mentioned in that school quite mentioned in that book quite a bit I thought well a lot of stuff like yeah, this is that comes book. That's the I call it the gang of four book It's BOC Pedicord can maybe just three of them BOC pedicord and caner. Okay Lots of you know interesting ideas I thought it was great that you know, sometimes There are things like I know I haven't read it like in ten years, but like One page says do this next page says don't do this. I thought it was great It's kind of a good thought of the funny way to bring up context like it depends Both articles were about the context of when you do that why it's good and why it's bad. I think if testing weren't knowledge work if testing were the same thing it's like you need to make sure that if software testing was There are four red buttons and four green buttons on this thing. Make sure when you press each of them, they make a ding sound You would not need context for that. But I think any knowledge work is context driven. I can't think of any sort of whether it's There's no context driven school of lawyers But lawyers for the most part even like the most boring law job you can think of there's context to how you do that You know you you know what I mean medicine, especially there's no context driven school of medicine I'm trying to think of wait, I I started off on devil's advocate and then I and then I fell off the wagon I'm sorry. No, I actually I Think that's probably the best you could do on devil's advocate in this context Years ago Before I had gone back to school and significantly slowed down on on writing my blogs I actually wrote a blog Entitled test is a four-letter word. I remember that one. That was one of your first ones. I think first you've written one of the earlier Yeah, you only written like ten. So I've written at least 15. All right, whatever. Anyway, go on and In there I was referring to I found that there's a link in that blog towards a old slide deck that from pedicord who talks about the the four schools and After our last podcast I brought it up because I wanted to remind myself of the of the context Or the content rather in the first slide like bothers me immensely He just is Brett announcing the four schools. I think there's five now. I don't recall with the fifth the agile school Which I think you know Yeah, and who wrote that I you know what I haven't followed the etymology know it like it was added It could have been pedicord. I think and we'll get a lot of corrections from the the hardcore indoctrination of these schools, but again, I think it's very similar overlaps a lot with the The context or in fact, I would anyway, there's an agile school's fifth one and there's a sixth one also Wonder if Lisa or Elizabeth have the sixth the sixth one I'm introducing today I'm gonna get the cat out of the bag is the Allen and Brent school of testing. I Think we should come up with a the a B testing school That may imply actual a B testing size worried about that one. We'll call it the BA testing. I'm back testing. I'm okay with that But when you look at the slide deck, like the first first thing I notice is that it was published and presented February 2003 well for the first time right? I mean, I'm gonna I'm gonna try and stay on the devil's advocate side I'm just it was I don't know when lessons learned came out. I guess it was right about then Maybe it was 2004. Maybe it was three that it came out. So actually that maybe they overlapped a little bit When did your book come out? 2008 2008 it is now 2015 I believe oh Yes, let me check my calendar. Okay. Good job And we we've talked about this on the podcast before and you've even blogged about it Your the content of your book if you were to write that today How much if you were to write second edition? I know that but that book is very there are but there are timeless books There are books from longer ago that I still find very relevant. So that's so I don't want to harp now playing devil's advocate Or do you actually think that that's relevant in this context? Um It's slightly relevant. I think what's happened. What's happened over the years is the other schools which are factory analytic What's the other one? You know They've become even less quality assurance. Oh, yeah Analytics, I think I wonder if it's in context Is I think those schools have become the schools have become less relevant In fact if I were to rewrite this and I'm not going to I'm not giving suggestions And I'm sure someone will tell someone and cool and they'll yell at me about this But if I were to rewrite if I were to look at this say I wrote this a bunch of years ago Like I like I looked at my book. I thought well, this is irrelevant. You mean? Yeah Let me finish my sentence So I have talked about how I would rewrite my book if I could rewrite it today Yep, if I had written this this slide deck I think the way I think about it today is less about the four schools and they're just sort of a treatise on how Testing because it's knowledge work needs to be context driven and because I think the other schools They are I mean, I'm sure someone gave me examples of Joe podunked IT shop in Saskatchewan Absolutely is the factory school for these reasons and that's great But they probably don't make software that people like or use very often. I think anything you're I think Good even not even great, but all good software testing is absolutely context driven. So so the idea of Indoctionating a school around it. It doesn't bother me because like okay, whatever the bet it seems Like it's like whatever to me. It's like it's the same same for me, right? It's What they're I must by the way, I am a crappy devil's advocate Don't hire me as a devil's advocate because I fall off the wagon to his I can't I can't I can't keep in my role It depends on the context. Oh, you know what? Yeah, we should have separate Test and dev Alan. Do you think you could devil's advocate that side or the opposite side? the funny thing is is one of my There's a I probably have half a dozen Quotes I use often enough where I clean them as my own and I should number them some point But one of them is the answer to any sufficiently complex question is it depends And I don't know if I've been using that sentence for longer than the context of a school's been around or not But I've been using it for a long long time Yes, so it doesn't matter. Yes, and I Want to suggest I mean Daniel pink is well known for drive and motivation But the book biff previous to that I'm a big Dan pink fan Wrote a book called uh crap now. I can't remember No, no, don't look it up. It's gonna come back to me a whole new mind. Oh Whole new mind which is about Knowledge workers and how people who use the right side of the brain are gonna be the creativity as part of their work are going to rule The world and it's it's not rocket surgery It's not unique to testing that is context driven. We need to get out of that mindset So yes test needs to be contact driven and we can't test Software that people actually would like to use and want to use the same way. We test buttons on a widget. Okay done story over Agree you had more you wanted to say so so just looking at the at this deck like number one This is old old old content. I would say it at Today the only real value in the the context driven school is For people who who need that to validate their identity. That's quite honestly it it gives people like to belong Yes, so sure I belong, you know, I'm the context driven school. It's great And I think there are people the one thing I liked about watching the cast talks Is there some people that are really gut they wear their their their context driven school name patch proudly on their jacket every day but what I noticed not the talks it was a lot of talks actually just from people like you want to just just give a good talk and They didn't dive into the doctrine of CDT They just talked about doing good testing work and then that's that's good. I think that's great So agreed whatever if you need it for your identity, that's fine. I'm not I Again, I have nothing against the context driven school. Maybe I have something against schools. I don't know it just Probably I think we've we elaborated enough on that Yeah, let me do the preemptive next sort of brings up the next podcast Somebody at some point in the next week or so Well, maybe even today if I get this out today We'll post a link to an updated doc on the school say no, Alan. It's much different. We have an updated doc It's not old it is in context and I'm gonna read it. I'm gonna go. Yeah, but my my stance is the same So this is nice the updated. I'm great Great. We took care of the problem of being old and and it really is still contextual today And that's awesome, but my stance doesn't change. So thank you very much. Yep. Same here. All right So there is our library still is redundant and it is likely only valuable for for people and their identities There's our elaboration on CDT. You know, it's funny. Why is it CDT? Context see the context driven testing. Oh, because I do I'm a con thesis in bios all over the place I'm a context driven tester. Okay Again, that's redundant You know what Brent I'm a context driven driver me too I'm a context driven podcaster That's not fair because what somebody's gonna say is in that one you use context driven to mean sucks All right Took me it's it's almost 9 o'clock in the morning. Yeah takes France an extra half a second to catch on here Yeah, but I don't know that I would dispute that So hey I Last night we're changing the topic here and I think you have you have a conference coming up, but I'm gonna start first Go ahead. I'm gonna let you finish and now I'm not did you watch a totally random here? I watched the The MTV music video awards on Sunday to check those out Is this the thing where Kanye goes on his yeah forever long? It was yeah, that's the one yeah, so You know, so I watched the whole thing. I haven't I haven't watched the whole video I'm freaking old and I haven't watched the whole music video words in years But it was it's funny you watch this two and a half hour award show and they give away like four awards That was pretty funny but uh, I Forgot us to say about that. But oh, are you supportive of West in 2020? Um, you know, I don't think so. I Want to hear his platform? Yeah. All right. Anyway moving on Last night I awesome, bro. I Bought some plane tickets. Yeah, where you going and a hotel reservation? Maastricht, Netherlands, I probably got the name wrong. It's like m a a Strich D You talked about that's about a hundred miles from but I know where it is now because it's about a hundred miles from Amsterdam So I'm gonna fly into Amsterdam take a train up there and hopefully find my way around You've been there before haven't you I've been to Amsterdam That I've been to Copenhagen Which is a different country but in that part of the world. I've been to I've been to a bunch of places in Europe But this is my first time to Maastricht and what are you doing this time? I'm giving a talk at a mobile. I'm giving a keynote at Euro stars mobile deep dive So the zero star goes on from it's like all week Monday through Thursday, then there's this Mobile deep dive on Friday and I am going to talk about what I I think you guys all know that the team That I recently left was the team that made is making or has made I don't know I'm not keeping up with them, but we made Android apps work on Windows phone So big challenge in mobile application development is compatibility. Mm-hmm Especially if you go to Android you have all the different hardware and different OS's and and dependencies but iOS has many as well and we had it kind of from the other end or building a we have all the Windows phones and Trying to get we're doing app capacity other side trying to make all these Android apps run on Windows phone now This this could that you guys worked on That's only with the phones that that ship with the windows 10 that'll be on the new windows phones. Yeah. Yeah Which I believe should be out by Christmas. I don't know I Have to look at it, but I'll anyway it's funny I'm looking almost daily because my fold phone is old and I want a new one in and you'll like it because I'm gonna dive pretty deep into how we used telemetry and Data analysis to sort of solve a lot of the app combat problems So this is your first non test conference in a while and you're doing it. It's a test conference Oh, is it so it's Eurostar is testing conference I'm doing a mobile deep dive at the end and then that's in November, but I'm doing I Mentioned last year something to walk through kind of my horizon here Just for the hell of it because it's random and it's morning. I just my coffee just kicking in last spring I ran a half marathon for the first time I think I'd mention that but I'm doing another one So last time my goal was to finish in two hours and it took me two hours and 45 seconds I was pretty bummed about that Didn't stop that water Is the other way around I had to stop and pee So seriously 45 seconds and I had no gas left to run at the end though. So I'm doing another one I'm doing a do-over in in October I'm gonna see if I can get that time under two hours. I think I'm on track but as we'll see how that goes You're practicing right? What do you mean practicing? Way back in the day I used to I used to run cross-country and we would art When we trained like I would run 10 miles every day. I don't miss those days I'm too. I'm really too old for that. So I all the training I don't really have a I mean I run I'm running I don't know 20 or 30 miles a week. I've been doing longer and longer runs I can I can run 10 miles pretty comfortably not at race pace, but my for what it's worth my My like five and six mile times are way lower than they were six months ago So I think hopefully that translates into a what's your five mile time? about 48 minutes 47 minutes Best I ever did was under 35. Yeah. Well, you're younger than I was. Alright, anyway, so I'm doing that But I did I felt way too long talking about that. I am I just gave Lee Kulp on an ab an abstract Remember last year in the spring I mentioned I got a call I was going down to Someone canceled and I went down to the better software conference in Las Vegas to fill in and give a talk on Actually that a B testing So it went it went well enough that that ended up being a For me was surprisingly a great deck. I You don't talk about the data science stuff all that often So I made a false assumption that Alan has no clue what he's talking about and actually he does it Was a good deck. I can fake it and you know what it went well get till you make it baby I made it because I made it well enough that I'm going back to better software They lost Vegas to give a half day tutorial on a B testing fantastic You should have seen the bread Said everything I said before I take back You don't know enough to talk about a B testing for a half for a half day No, I and I do I suspect you do I suspect I'll figure it out. I'll Know we'll play games. I don't know. I have time to think about it. So that's coming up Lee's a very funny man. I think that's it. Um, and you have something coming up too, right? Yeah at the end of the so I'm not going to present But at the end of the September I'm flying to New York, but they'll be my first time ever in New York. So I'm pretty excited about that For the city so great the name to twice, right? Right. Yeah for the strata conference. Oh Which is for those who aren't In the world. It's a major big data and data science conference I'm gonna be going there partly to always like to learn latest and greatest and I find It's interesting the world today when it comes to to data science those folks working on Hadoop yeah Kind of pushing the the envelope so it's a great place to pick up new tricks and new ideas But I'm primarily going there for recruiting. Oh Which for it so I've signed up for all the Networking events and I that's what we need we actually the first time in like 15 years. I have business Carter cards ordered You know, I haven't ordered business cards in a long time. I do have Angry weasel business cards. I said, I don't know where they are Holy cow off think about that. They were show you this No, I I had I got like a thing for a free like 50 pack or hundred pack of business cards, but in design so I designed some angry weasel Oh, is this like one of the deals up on cloud or yeah I've had like three dollars for shipping. I got some it's fun to do When did you use those never? They're still in the box they could give one away. I was thinking like for your book tour or something Oh speaking of which I went to Right If there's any of the three that's in New York and and you're gonna be in that neighborhood send me during that time Love to meet you send me a message on Twitter. Let's see if we can connect. All right two things I'm gonna do one if I ever get that cloud deal again I'm getting a B testing business cards with hashtag one of the three. Yeah, two wait You're not one of the three. No, if we count us as one of the three then we have like one Coffee is working for me Alan. Apparently not for you charming hilarious and an idiot. All right On Friday it was awesome Trey McRae shout out Recruiter it right I shouldn't calmer it didn't invite me to recruit me But I got to hang out with a bunch of people from riot games who make League of Legends they invited me that little shindig down it in Seattle and they got to have some Beer and food on them and hang out and talked to him for a while Cool people who was fun. I was I was like socializing software people. I ended up talking to some of their testers about Or I guess there were testers there. We're talking about quality stuff I didn't ask him what their title was there an online game. They have all the right Processes in place and it was good to talk to them and why they call you over, you know, Trey's been Apparently internet from I hear from his co-workers internet stalking me for some time now So he it was gonna be in Seattle said I will meet this man. So he hung out. It's cool. That's nice guy Anything else on the upcoming home front? I get to the last topic. Yeah, that's good. And then we'll get out of here So I posted a tweet about this yesterday And this is the rant portion of the because we screwed up and put the mailbag at the beginning but the rant portion of the podcast is I've ranted about this before Not on the podcast. Can I do one bit of intro? But because because it occurred to me when we were talking about the the charming and hilarious Topic. Mm-hmm, right the what we what we ended up in the episode 26 is talking about In essence god damn it. We're sick and tired of testers playing the victim card. Yeah, and in it And here's another example of the victim card. I saw it a lot It came because I saw it a lot yesterday and it comes up that comes in spurts, but it's it's consistent enough that I don't get it is a lot of The cool kids, I don't know consultants a lot of experienced testers, too I don't actually I kind of know who some of the consultants are. I shouldn't blame them I don't know who they all are. I don't look at bios that often on Twitter But I see a lot of blogs and posts About we could make better software if it weren't for the managers or we need to get managers to let us do our jobs correctly or managers are stopping me from being you know a Proper tester blah blah blah blah blah blah if I were to if I were to just pop out of the ether With no other context and read this stuff. I go. Oh my god all managers of software projects in the world are complete idiots and morons and I will and Apparently entirely anti-test. Oh even though more than likely they hired the tester right and even better they are they they focus their whole job around you know bean counting and and absolutely no context and and Guess what there are probably some managers like that. That's great and All know most know some yeah, but backing up a step You know I've worked for good managers and bad managers I've been really lucky to have some really great managers in my recent past, but I've had really bad ones as well and Regardless One thing I can tell you and if I think if you would talk to any of my managers for the last 10 or 15 years Microsoft they would say they would agree with me when whether I've had good managers or bad managers You know if one thing I said to my boss when I came here Was this current team current team this? Thank you I said I have a track record of making my managers better and And we had a conversation about that news Blob is great, but I've done that I I think I have helped every single one of my managers get better at their job In multitudes of ways, I think it's really important think it's important Sure, I can complain about them But to be the victim and go I can't do it because my manager says my very first day at Microsoft My very first week at Microsoft I've told this story. I think it's in the book I've told it before manager gave me a list of test cases and said you need to run these every day I said well when do you need them automated by because I was gonna just they were very automatable test cases said oh No, we don't have time to automate. You just need to run these every day and I could go to you know The Twitter wasn't around them, but I go my managers Management will let me automate and I could just kind of be the the cry baby and go do this thing You know what? I'm gonna automate him anyway because I know I can do this like in my spare time So I had them automated by like Thursday and and they run in the background while I was doing other exploratory testing it worked out fine, I Don't know if I made that manager better that manager was Probably my worst manager at Microsoft if I didn't realize after I had better managers But there's a point when I think even if you have a bad manager You don't need to be blocked by them or if you have a bad managers manager You don't need to be blocked by them the one thing I know I've said before on this podcast is is I didn't make This one up. I've heard it before if you have a bad manager and management chain You know you can change your organization or you can change your organization Meaning you can be an instigator of change in your organization and moving things in the right direction Or you can get a new organization to work in but I'm so tired of the whining and complaining and it What bothers me more is it is this is this anecdotal and this may not be true? But it isn't always like the person in the org making the complaint. It's like some person who's not even a Employee at a software company, but works in software Saying these things about management in general when they have no and they have no context So well I've worked with or I've talked with and every time I see some logical fallacy bothers you the most every time I've someone's really gone off on like really far out there with I call him on it I say do you have an example of this you point me to know but I've heard of this or I've talked to someone Who did this and it's like oh Jesus? Form your own damn opinion that part of context forming your own opinion. Well, apparently they're part of the factory school. Oh There's my problem Anyway, that's kind of my rant for the day on I just stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it I know the three you guys don't do this, but tell your friends to stop too. So I am a manager You are actually actually was funny just yesterday. I was telling one of my employees He didn't understand why I made a certain decision like screwing him on his review. No, he actually got a fantastic But he didn't understand one of my decisions Where essentially We had this huge big data job that was taken and I stole resources from one of the big data jobs to Feed it to this other one and that created a huge bottleneck on the thing I stole from We had this big fire drill this other thing needed resources and I basically made a decision to damn the torpedoes I don't care what happens to this thing. Yeah, it's gonna screw things up. But this other thing we got to get Going and he's like man. That's really screwed us up. And I said, you know Oftentimes I just want to remind you that I that I am a manager And what that means is, you know, a lot of times we spend a lot of times talking about architecture and really cool brainstorming and Strategizing and building plans and doing really excellent work But just remember that every now and again, I am still a manager, which means there's a little bit of pointy-haired guy in me, too But on the on the manager thing right that the one thing Right. It's one thing to tell people Quit friggin whining and take control of your own destiny That's another thing is is What they should be doing instead Right a lot of these managers when they are not managers, but the employees like my oh my manager doesn't care about quality The hell he doesn't there's not a single manager on the planet that has hired a tester that doesn't care about quality It's about risk or Return on investment in your particular case your your first story, right? And I do find it interesting that my first manager also is the worst manager I've had as this company I think you know for context on there. I think especially back then not as much anymore We've kind of flattened dorks, but their turnover was so high I might because people were resting and getting out of here at that time early in our careers The managers we worked for were very inexperienced not just as managers as employees I know people that were became people managed to being at Microsoft like a year. Yeah, and and We were back in those days It still happens, but back in those days if you got into management It was generally because you were awesome as an IC Yeah, and it it takes a while for people to realize and it took us as a company a while to realize Just because you're awesome as an engineer doesn't mean you're gonna be awesome at management And that it's funny because I've seen that I'll sidetrack here, but I saw that come up I forget who was tweeting about that or blogging about that just very recently, but Is there should be a path for and we figured this out a while ago, but there should be a path for ICs It's not management. Yeah. Yeah anyway your story is and in it and there there is I mean nowadays Yeah, I don't think it's true at all companies. I think a lot of people I like a lot of companies your path your only path to growth is management I think it's done that I think that's still true today, right? Anyway back to whatever to your manager Right back back in those days right God MS test was still around Recorded scripts Were the dominant way people automated? Mm-hmm, right? and it was very common for Those things to suck the soul of your test team away from maintenance because no one Testers the primary testers that we hired back in those days were were essentially Knowledge workers and it was very common that they didn't understand how to code Right. I remember multiple times walking through very high-level testers and introducing them to oop right So I think your manager just made a call on round his perception. Oh, absolutely of what it's gonna cost the other thing, too is Testers They always got to be conscious of what the right thing Right. The biggest thing I find is that they're not thinking about the right thing as it relates to the business They're thinking about the right thing in some sort of idealistic point of view around a Pure testing world a pure quality world like software should be bug-free No, that's the quality. That's the quality assurance school, right? Close your laptop. Yeah one thing I'm gonna interrupt is One thing I've done for I learned to do this about ten years ago I do it a lot is wish I would earlier in my career is once someone makes a decision You don't agree with you don't like or they're dumb and smart people make dumb decisions all the time, but often What I've learned to do now is I think about there's a motivation behind that Where does that where did that come from and absolutely? I was looking at my manager, but his motivation is I need to have these my Man, just probably beaten on me to make sure he's tests to run every day if he takes time to automate those They're not gonna get run so we can't do that So that's really easy for me to see today or it's gonna take too long to run and I I need these results Yeah, because we have some fire. Yeah, but you see that all the time It's like, you know your your employee says I can't you know, you cut that really screwed this up. You look motivation Well, I don't think why would someone cut that and probably because well, this other thing obviously is more important It's very critical. So Anyway, I think anytime someone makes a decision that you don't like don't agree with you think is dumb One really valuable exercise is to just take a moment to reflect and brainstorm in your head on What motivated that decision or that action and then then that gives you different context to work with them on Especially when you want to modify that behavior. I'll add color to that, right? Almost every manager whether to do it consciously or subconsciously when they're making decisions like their job is to make decisions They're making decisions on a return on investment criteria. What's the value I'm gonna get out of this What's it gonna cost me and What is the window of opportunity where this value is useful and I would even modify that that part of the state When I think of managers and leaders, I think leaders make decisions a manager can be a leader Leader doesn't have to be a manager managers make decisions to it. Yes But some managers who are better leaders are better at it and do it more often and make more higher Riskier or more impactful decisions. There are a manager can be and I've known managers who Weren't great leaders. They're okay leaders, but they were really good people managers They knew how to relate to their employees give them the right work Make sure they were motivated make sure they had the skill and the will etc etc etc Which I guess involve decision-making as well. Can you briefly because We're not on the same page anymore. Can you briefly define manager and leader? Manager who is someone who asked people reporting to them in charge of Responsible for their career as well as you know work, etc, etc, etc. A leader is Someone who does not who may or may not have people reporting to them. But the leader is Does more coaching whether it's technical coaching or career coaching? can make decisions can So a manager who's a good people manager? Can not be a leader. No, we can't be no But the Venn diagram is that there is what I'm saying what I'm saying is it's possible What I'm exploring a manager what I'm exploring people manager and still not be a leader and still not be yeah Maybe not be much of a leader. Okay fair enough. All right My my bar I give this speech quite a bit, right? The biggest difference between a manager and a leader managers Have people who report to them first and foremost leaders may or may not but managers do have people who report Leaders though have people who follow them. There's a key difference between those two My reports if I'm a manager my reports don't have to respect me they don't even have to Follow my beliefs. They don't even have to believe in what I believe but if I'm a manager, they do have to do what I say a leader though If you don't have people who follow you and a follow means they've made a decision that What you're saying is the right thing. It's goodness. It's the right path to go it Will not only benefit whatever the goal we're trying to achieve but but benefit them directly right We talk here at Microsoft We have this thing called the senior band and one of the most common speeches I give people is that to get into the senior band you have to show signs of leadership and then I go into As long as speech as the what is leadership and to get out of the senior band you have to show them that you've mastered it And that you have the capability To be an investor in the business. Yeah, and you remember many years ago I designed and taught a course to testers on what it meant to be senior and talked about many of those things Yeah, that that cracked open like you had a whole like testing personas thing that you did for a while Yeah, I had all kind and oh man. I haven't thought about that Yeah, it's a different world because the world has changed and I've recognized that the world has changed and not holding on to ideas From the past. Yep So on that on that pointed note. Yes. How about we bring 27 to a close? Yep Alright, mr. Charming. Okay. I'm charming Alan. I'm hilarious Brent and we'll see you next time. Thank you
