Hello again, howdy Hey, we're sitting farther apart today. It's odd for me here. Let me move closer. Okay. All right One day we're going to release the video version of the a B testing podcast people will see our faces and never again It'll be the final episode Maybe for number 100 we should do a video Okay, I'm kidding people don't want that. Yeah Welcome to a B testing Yeah, we just put an explicit flag So anyway a B testing the podcast for software development software testing data stuff experimentation leadership test management quality quality leadership and most lately modern testing and Brent's laughing at me which is par for the course if you're new welcome if you're not you're used to this stuff. So Thanks for tuning in again, I think it's episode 85. Is that correct? It is 85 But really we didn't figure it out till about 60. So maybe it's only 25 There were some good ones before then. Ah, you know 60 is when we really started off on the the modern testing theme I don't want to say 60 because we'll come up with something new eventually That'll be the the shiny thing for a B testing and then we'll say that's the new number Sounds good Brent, right? Bringing up I got it while we're podcasting here Uruguay and France are playing I just need to check on the score. I have lost it I'll bring it up sometime when Brent's talking. It's halftime So yeah, it's work up time. I'm gonna cheer for worldwide ah Viva la France Talking about the modern testing principles which you can read on Modern testing org and today we're gonna talk about number four which we'll get to in just a second any Thing else I should be caught up on before we get started, right? No, let's just dive in this time. Wow. I know people are so you need it up people are gonna fast-forward They're already talking about it what happened to their stories of bunnies and squirrels Okay, Brent. Do you have principle number four loaded up where you can't see it? I can't because the company where you work Microsoft is too cheap to let anyone who doesn't work there have access to Wi-Fi While they're in the building unless they get like someone to hold their hand and sign their life away. So anyway, I have no eggs Freakin two clicks. Yeah and wait for an email to come through those shitty exchange service. Yeah, you have a phone I'm looking at it right now. Yeah, it's it's a phone. Anyway, I'm done making fun of Microsoft for now. So Okay, number four share principle number four number four We care deeply about the quality culture of our team and we coach lead and nurture the team Towards a more mature quality culture Awesome two big takeaways for me. We're gonna dive into I want to make sure we talk about the why it's important Talk about what it is and a whole bunch of how but there's two big pieces one is quality culture We're gonna have to define the crap out of that because that can mean about ten different things to five different people and the other One is this aspect of leadership Where I think people leading teams towards modern testing principles whether or not that's the current or former test slash QA person We need to not be passive and not wait for work to come to us Like maybe we did 15 years ago in leading a team towards a modern testing culture There's a lot of aspects of leadership. You need to be able to do to get that to happen and the third call that I'm gonna say that I think one of our earlier iterations had this explicitly But principle number four is In our list. It's the community principle. So the leadership is not just You know leading by example and being the best tester creating a community of quality. Yes Creating and sustaining a community of quality anyone can create a community Let's start with quality culture Since that's probably gonna take 85% of the episode today In various forms What is a quality culture? Will gets three different answers of the quality. Oh, very good. Very good. We are also the tautology podcast or not. Oh Ponder ponder ponder The one thing I think I think I'll put in one. I think it would be good idea Here because between the two of us Right. It's it's Alan is By far one of the best community builders I have ever worked with seen and observed But the one thing I think is super important when we call out here any time there is and I think this is This is missed a lot and I think we probably need to explicitly call it out Anytime we talk about The word quality just want to make sure the listeners understand. I am NOT talking about bugs I am NOT talking about code correctness These are Separate concepts not mutually But they are separate to me a quality culture is around how do we build up a strong a active and a For lack of a better word a non into it in intuition based And I'll just add another useful View of user empathy within the organization. This is about For lack of a better word feelings in a lot of regards Caring about the problems that our customers have Remember care and quality are two sides to the same coin. They are they are I mean quality It's you know, there was a An old podcast that you mentioned something from your music history about art and You mentioned that art is something that Creates emotion or The quality of art is in the interpretation from the user. Yeah, you mentioned some piece I'm sure you you have it on the top of your head where there's like 17 measures of just nothing but silence well, there's the John Cage four minutes and 33 seconds, which is just in three movements, which is Just silence but the but the music the art is the audience's reaction to that silence there was a thing in the early 20th century called danger music where the music the art was Maybe these boxes you had to reach your hand into you couldn't see inside and some had Fur and cotton and some had broken glass and razor blades but the art was in your interpretation of your reaction to The the value is in your reaction to the art Quality is that not a very similar definition? It is it's it's a lot of it is is the user reaction Mm-hmm to what you've built right and you've made the metaphor or maybe it's not a metaphor many times like what's what's higher quality the product with very few users, but no known bugs or The or the feature product with a lot of bugs but a hundred thousand users Yeah, I like to talk about Christopher Alexander Alexander when I when I bring this up, right he talks about These positive and negative forces right and then Do the force are the forces? Aligned such that That the person interacting with this the system at play or the in his case the architecture are they? Guided towards positive thoughts or or negative an example. I'll bring up is he once got called into a house and They had a kitchen with two double doors from the double doors from the kitchen you got to a patio then there was a staircase down to a lower patio and He put or the there was a little picnic table on that lower patio and he found out that no one used it They never they it was clear from the intent right they intended to have outdoor meals But they didn't and so he looked at it and he just said oh, okay He got a crew put the picnic table up on the upper deck and that fixed the whole problem the issue That he identified is hey one of the forces is in order to have a meal there. You had to transfer the the food and Going up and down the stairs created enough of a friction That they didn't enjoy The table and it didn't take much like you could go oh, it's so easy to work around this No, it's it's if you just have a little bit of negative Force it just changes the entire scenario Agreed. So let me rewind the stack a little bit. I think I like the way you brought it upper or the you mentioned community because community and culture have a lot in common, it's shared mindset shared practices shared values shared vision shared goals a Lot of sharing a lot of sharing but because you want a culture means people are a Quality culture can't just be the a person going. Let's have higher quality. No No This is about you know as Barney says sharing is caring and knowing that the muscle memory of The group of folks that you are working with is heading towards the same For lack of a better word goal because a lot of the times these goals are emergent. They're not Clearly understood up front sure we've talked about this before They're adaptive challenges versus technical problems technical problems. All it is is an implementation thing You got to figure that you got to look up some algorithms, whatever you're done adaptive challenges You don't know the answer when you start you have to learn it as you go along and a lot of culture things fall in That direction you have beliefs for sure But you don't You don't want to stick to them if you if you you want to be able to adapt to new knowledge gain Yeah, when when starting a culture and I'm gonna get into my definition in a second because I actually created one for better or worse But I'm reminded of a Weinberg quote where he says unless and until all members of a team have a common understanding of the problem Attempts to solve the problem are just so much wasted energy I think quality culture fits into that as well as a technical problem. You need to have There's this ad car model which fits into this as well. Let me talk about that for a minute. This is from consulting company called pro-ci Anyway, the model seems to work pretty well for culture change talks about awareness of the problem like okay We need to have higher quality. There's the desire. Well, actually awareness is the act quality is bad. There's a desire to change the problem Okay, we want to improve but until you can go each step builds another one once you have awareness and desire you need knowledge You need maybe it's knowledge of tools or things you may need to implement And then you need ability You need the ability to do those things So maybe you need some training and how to learn how to use Jenkins for CI or or whatever Maybe you want to put some other? Tools into your CI pipeline. Maybe you just want to get maybe people need some coaching or training on some agile concepts Or maybe they just need practice. We have you have awareness desire knowledge ability and then finally you need a way to retain those practices you need repeatability, so it's a it's a Model that I like to use for thinking about how to move through changes awareness desire knowledge ability retain Okay Usually when I go into these speeches, I start with just two it's it's motivation and ability But I think that a motivation definitely well it You can't have motivation without the without the awareness. So it just puts a few extra Stats around those. Yeah. Yeah, so the definition of quality culture I wrote and there are again, it's not perfect It's the one I use It's a shared mindset that delivering high quality software to customers is our top priority and that all of our practices support this effort Yeah I'm absolutely fine with that Because it's vague and means nothing until you dive into the detail. Yeah the one thing Mate, this is the thing. I think we need to hit hard on on As I've already mentioned in this episode right What is quality and or more importantly? I think perhaps is what is what isn't? quality right so It is quality. I can't hit this enough. I think I'm gonna be repeating this until I die Bugs and quality are not in any way shape or form Sinner nims or antonyms are related one of those nims. Okay. Good so point made yeah, I the way I think of it is getting people closer to Understanding the the problems That users are facing how The software organization is geared to solve it and how we're staying current because as we as we release we've already talked about The the need for continuous deployment the need for continuous integration small batches Those are small little tests to say hey customers are you happier and Then and then sort of a discussion around Okay, why or why not? You have backed into an important question we need to answer something to interrupt with the question that you continue Yep, so why is the quality culture important? You actually already started answering it if you didn't realize it. Why is it important to have a quality culture? Why is this a principle? Why do we think it's so important? Okay, do I help you out? Yeah, hi. I'm not connecting the So The reasons that a quality culture are important and small batches contribute to a higher quality culture If you're able to deliver quickly, we want to get feedback from our customers more often We want to be able to understand and react to what they're doing We want and at the same time we want to reduce risk in our ability to do that Yeah, all the culture helps with those things and many more But you're talking about those realize that's part of a quality culture and in order to function in the way we want to function and to Keep and retain and engage more users. We need that high quality culture and the key thing I think you talked about just a second ago is Actually, I love how you phrase that I felt a bit surprised you started off at contributing it to me Sure Yeah, yeah, that's exactly where I was going Alan like the continuous deployment We talked about it in some regards with respect to risk minimization, right? This is this is one of the reasons why companies hire testers today They're kind of like an insurance. Yes on the product, right? I will pay and Thousands or millions of dollars to do an amount of testing to reduce an amount of risk, right? But Here we're shifting it towards No, there's another reason why we want these small batches and that that is so that we can react To knowledge gained. Yes knowledge gained with respect to Hey, is this causing pain or? Is this creating delight? And I like to light delight your customers It's sad that that meme ended here within Microsoft. No one talks about customer delighters really much anymore No, but anyway, it is what it is The other thing that I think is important around building the quality culture It is all about knowledge share Knowledge sharing in any system that In a software world, I'll just I'll just say it this way if you have a system in the software world that contains human beings and You're not working towards Creating something that optimizes on Utilizing the knowledge within those human beings You're really putting yourself Not in harm but but you're slowing yourself down Software is knowledge work. Yes, it is and the great thing about Knowledge is that the more you give away The more there is in the system a Quality community given given an agile world and sort of an emergent goals right by by constructing a Place where ideas can come together What happens? New ideas get formed We may have mentioned this before Thousand times yes, and I can't hit it enough we in the knowledge worker business you want to make a mechanism where the these ideas are coming together new ideas form and tested and try out and that is One place particularly that if it's around the quality culture That's one place where you're really going to accelerate the achievement of shipable quality And when I think about a high quality culture, I'm thinking about a culture that is purely in optimizing mode So they're in a they're just in a place where everything is about learning and adjusting so to recap the first 20 minutes here The quality culture is a shared mindset about how we're gonna make quality software and we do it It's important to do it because it enables us to Accelerate the achievement of quality Enables us to much better do that. I'm gonna tweak that because it's I don't think it's about how we're gonna make software I think it's about how we're going to solve our customers problems. Yes Right because customers don't want software. They want their damn problem solved, right? So I want to do Some what like what is a quality culture and then a whole bunch of how is it cool that fit in your agenda? well, so the second part the second part of the The principal specifies that one of our goals is to coach lead and nurture the team towards a more mature That is the how so I want to talk about what a more mature quality culture is and then how we lead teams towards that it The second yeah, and then what is a more mature because it That's me that that invokes thoughts of any number of Maturity models, so I have a thing against maturity models So I and only because and I can get over it, but I've just seen them used wrong so many times and with the biggest culprit being CMMI which a lot of our European listeners have had to deal with and Two huge problems I have with models like that is CMMI You go from lockstep to level 1 to level 2 across a whole bunch of different areas Whereas it may even make business sense for you to grow your maturity model in different rates in different areas or attributes of quality the other thing is is a lot of companies wore their CMMI level like a badge and it turned into much like tester certification a a maturity model certification level where people would pay money and if you if you paid more you might get a higher Rating so it's just I don't like that. I like the model as being a discussion point not a blueprint It's a way to figure out where you want to improve so that disclaimer in in Front of it. Yes, it's a maturity model, but please use the Use the model all models are wrong some are useful It's a model for learning and a model for assessing and figuring out what you want to do not a badge to wear. I don't disagree Maturity model the one thing quite honestly that that that I am I'm not wired. So maturity models are great because they kind of I like them to help describe sort of a known set of patterns around what typically people will once they've mastered a particular amount of knowledge Where they immediately realize oh if we mastered this amount of knowledge We'd be able to do these other things, right? If you remember the a Sierra Stuff we talked about here a long time ago around data Right a line collect inform recommend act Right that that's kind of a journey, but you wouldn't pick much to convert it to a maturity model Describing going from data oblivious to data centricity Right, but I don't I don't prefer that I prefer sort of a guiding light. Yes and part of the main reason why is I view them as Well known sort of practice patterns sure, but I see them often being referred to as best Practices and that concept offends me. Yeah, it's easy to use them incorrectly I like the idea of there's another problem on the plus side for the model Here's a problem they help solve and then we'll talk less abstractly and talk about a maturity model that I'm building for my team Or my teams. I think often people see okay. We're here Current state we want to be there the desired state. Let's just do that, but you can't there's a whole 100 baby steps in between so one thing a maturity model like construct does is lets you see some progression towards infancy to adulthood lets you see what adolescents and and and Teenage years are like in between as a metaphor for maturity or an actual Not really a metaphor because that's actually actually is maturity I've been working on trying to figure out trying to walk the talk and figure out what is a maturity model for going to figure how to improve this So I started thinking a lot about what attributes make up a quality maturity And I came up eventually with what I think is a pretty good list It's probably not perfect and because everything I do iterates all the time It doesn't matter but I came up with eight or nine different areas There's testing breadth which is like we just do functional testing to we test we actually Contextually test all the things that you know, we know when the test reliability security, etc We do the right right breadth of testing. There's the quality and test ownership. Are the testers doing all the testing? Or are the testers merely coaching in some cases principle number seven Maybe not needed because the teen just gets testing testing is part of what they do listening to a podcast this morning I won't name it because it wasn't very good But it even in talking about DevOps and the in the podcast I was talking about They were still referring to testing as this unique phase that happened during the process I just it just made my head shake a little bit Bug lifecycle we've talked about bug backlogs and how those are a bottleneck I think There can even be maturity of how you deal with those from the traditional bug backlog on one end all the way to Working with a zero bug policy and bugs are dealt with very efficiently and quickly as they come in I know you say this isn't part necessarily part of Without the testers job, but we don't talk a lot about code correctness and code quality, but I think there is a maturity in in Code quality code correctness tools how you use coverage analysis tools Etc in your life's up part of your CI. I think you have to do those in order to reach levels of quality elsewhere Yeah that that These are for me. They don't have to be for ya. That's fine Customer the data analysis we've talked about a lot of times. This is basically can go maybe not align exactly with your Your model of oblivious aware driven centric, but there is a level of Starting with oblivious and moving to data centric actually maybe maybe as those Maybe that that maturity model fits really well within this quality culture The development approach this is where the agile practices come into place you have you can have a total ad hoc People work on whatever it's done whatever sort of thing or on the other end of the higher maturity you have super small batches and and the process the process is used to Build the software or to think about how things are broken down are very mature and efficient and just a few more learning an improvement where Do you bother to learn from on one end? Maybe you don't even bother to learn mistakes or things where blame happens? But on the other end every failure is an opportunity to learn and that opportunity is taken Very good retrospectives happen on these teams, etc. And then finally you need some level of leadership support And not I don't think is leadership mandating everyone follow all these other practices I think for culture change one of the things doesn't have to be like the person at the top leadership support this can be When you see good quality practice is happening. You need people who will Point them out and celebrate them people that will you that reinforcement of Excellent. This team is doing blah or this person is doing blah. This is great You need a level of support if you have a shared vision or shared values around quality reiterating those Pat Lincione in his book the advantage talks about the power of organizational health which has a lot to do with mature quality organizational health with product quality and his Four steps which are really interesting and I love them for building a healthy organization are to Create a cohesive leadership team Create a great division clarify the vision communicate the vision and re communicate the vision that was five so two of those are actually combined but it's about if You have beliefs or values and how you're approaching your engineering efforts or how you approach solving customer problems you should Live those how many times do you giving double from Microsoft? How many times in your? Microsoft career which is over 20 years now, right? Yeah almost 25 have Wow. I didn't make it that far have you Seen some vision get blasted out whether it's like for your organization and then No reinforcement of it. Nothing ever happened with it again. It kind of faded away people didn't know what it was If you're really serious about this you need to make sure people it's part of how people function Unity has these customer values around democratized game development solve hard problems and enable developer success Which actually come up in conversations all the time I hear stories from my Amazon friends about how their values come up meetings all the time for better or for worse, I think if you're going to have if you really want to reinforce and ingrain a shared mindset you need to Reiterate and clarify and celebrate Those values the one thing I didn't hear In in a lot of that like I would actually And maybe maybe that's the right thing in the maturity model. We're in right now with respect to To MT although it is interesting so Alan asked me on slack just the other day that Or maybe you made a statement around surprised not surprised at how The the community at large is responding to MT right We're sort of We're sort of If I were to put it this way, it's sort of a polarizing There's one set of folks that seem to be saying ah That's what we do Thanks for giving a name to the practice something to that effect and then there's another set of folks that are kind of Going oh that will never ever ever ever work Right in yeah, there's there's there's there's folks in between but that's sort of where I see the polarization going Yeah, there's a lot of in between I do talk to a bunch of people go that's yeah, that's where I want to be We're not there which I think is actually a much better place to be in then that'll never never never work because You're already proven wrong it does work. Yeah Those the folks that that's claim it'll never work my them I just sort of Ignore them and I used to look at them and go all right Do you not pay attention to what's happening in the space and I basically found out that the answer to that is no right and I Neither have the time nor the patience to sit down with them and walk them through what they Should have been paying attention to On quality culture So I think a lot of those techniques and a lot of those approaches are some a lot of places where where people can start with today I'd really like to see this shift towards more again It is not focused on the process. It does not focus on any particular technology stack This is primarily around people people not only in terms of I have said this on many times before Any time you're trying to make a change there are three things that you need to change simultaneously The people the technology and the processes So we talked about the technology, but if you if you change the technology, but don't change the people's mindset you're not going to be able to Impact the the process which is the glue between technology and people You can't change people without the why you can't it sure helps a lot You can change people without the why you could use command and control aspects But I recommend strongly against that because it has a top end on how you scale. Absolutely. Absolutely One thing I want to bring up and then I want to dive into the how and they just if I do it right old segue the Method I used to come up with those list of quality attributes I wanted to improve you should come up with your own Don't copy mine you can but you shouldn't the method I use that of a book I've referenced a lot on this podcast in my blog and etc. But called leadership on the line by Ron Heffetz and this is where this concept of adaptive challenges come from that I mentioned earlier on the episode and one of the things you do to help solve an adaptive problem is to identify the current state and The desired state and I what I did was a variation on that. I thought about what are I just basically affinity exercised By myself all the different things. I thought all the different engineering teams I work with and even indirectly What would that minimum level look like and then? for all those things I thought about what would the Highest level look like and then I did some consolidation where I was like Oh, these things are the same as these things. That's right eventually got down to those eight or nine categories I have and then once I vetted sort of that beginning stage and then the end stage I filled in a couple levels in between and ended up with a For better for worse maturity model to be used as a discussion point figure out how teams can improve Their quality culture you can do this exercise yourself for the things that you care about for your team in your context So now that we have that The next step and this is gonna be different for everyone as well. The next step is about Making that change happen. That's for the leadership That's for the leadership aspect and the community building aspect of this principle coming to play Yeah, the I definitely view The community building part of this is Is growing other leaders There's another book I can't remember the name of but another model of leadership where you have to be in a position of leadership and then have people's permission to lead them which is about establishing trust and There's a few levels in between and they one of the higher levels is you're able to You're not able to more of your focus is on building other leaders and I realized for better for worse Brent just slipped off his computer a lot of my success and my my success is in Helping move myself out not of a job out of a role is I need to that is hinged on my ability to make the people that work for me now Good leaders who can build other leaders so they need to be in much as I'm worried about building community and And leadership they need to be able to be leaders and build community as well. They need to build their own Quality communities and quality cultures and the teams they work on so I've done a lot of Over the years a lot of leadership training one of the things I'll absolutely share Whenever a mentee comes to me and says hey, I want to be a lead I could tell you I don't know but 80% chance that this speech is gonna load You want to know what the single most important? aspect of a leader is Please tell me they have followers True this seems like a tautology It is not this ties right in that principle. It's one thing being a position of leadership it's another level up to have followers or as This Maxwell maybe as the author to have permission to lead Yeah, there's a that it's it's a line with that permission to lead The you cannot be re-orged into or out of leadership You can be re-orged into and out of management leaders have followers and a Follower is someone who has made a conscious decision To go in the same direction you are right? Um, so there's To to be good at leadership. You have to be good at communication so that your goals are clear And you have to be good at Influencing and and inspiring others to decide to walk your path right it this And then there's another speech that In this leadership training I've done years ago Right. There's this definition. It's somewhat controversial, but I think it applies here. How would you define empowerment? Empowerment is very simple empowerment means Others would make the same decision you would in your absence That's an interesting definition. Yeah, it's some as I mentioned it's somewhat controversial But if you empower someone to make the decision What essentially are you doing? You're essentially saying Do you think you're saying? So let's say you empowered one of your employees to make a decision in that decision with the same data is Diametrically opposed to the decision you would make Right there's a strong chance You're gonna stop their decision-making process Right, unless you unless you can springboard it into a learning lesson or along these lines This is important. I just read something as recently and I wish I could would have wrote it down But what's the difference between delegation and empowerment? Oh That's actually pretty Delegation is I decide you do Empowerment is Is essentially you decide And we do we do you do someone else does I think the do part is Irrelevant there, right? Yep. All right. Where are we going? We were trying to veer towards and in and dancing around the how Yeah, so you should take points on that one in this conversation because you've done it a bajillion times try stuff fail learn the exact in an organizational change and in improving quality in the how it's just like a Just like good agile software development. You need to Don't try and make sweeping changes at once. Don't sweep in with mandates and saying we're doing blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Try little things Stuff works do more of it or try more things when things don't work Figure and don't just give up do that pivot or persevere the same as you do with experimentation and figure out Well, why didn't this work? What should we do differently? What areas do you want to focus on it all those areas I gave earlier? Do you want to would you want to work on improving all those at once maybe probably not Figure out which ones are the most bang for the buck but make small changes if you're if you have a huge bug backlog Say, okay, we're not gonna have any bugs long any bugs Stage one. Let's see if we can get down to no bugs older than a month three months Whatever makes sense for your team figure out what the right baby steps are going back to heffits leadership is disappointing people at a level they can absorb So if you try and make a sweeping change people are going to be too disappointed. They're gonna shut down. They're gonna rebel This falls into the boiled frogs parable, but all these things work You need to make lots and lots of small changes and evaluate all the time that said Do you think? Ripping the band-aid never works. I think you need to look first ripping the band-aid can work I have been on teams where we said screw it. We're killing we're just gonna Declain bug bankruptcy and close anything older than you know, two weeks fix all the rest and start from there So you can rip the band-aid off if you but you kind of need a Majority or large part of team buy-in or that culture or that shared values first So you need you do need to take time to see whether it's to see if it really is a tourniquet Yeah, I was I was actually just thinking about that right? I think I told the story last time Where when I went to development and being I started off with doing scrum But I described Kanban and I said we're gonna do scrum on the way there Right and then when scrum failed they said how about this Kanban thing? Right it so so in that particular case, it's a lot easier to rip rip the band-aid When yeah, but the team was ready the team was ready for it. They asked you they were ready for that change Well, they did they did they still didn't understand it. They were just like well this sucks. Let's not do this Yeah, look just don't assume everything's a band-aid and don't assume everything's a tourniquet Disappoint people at a level they can absorb or as I paraphrase at a level they can tolerate and Yeah, there's there's this concept You've heard of out of the box thinking sure love out of the box thinking it's fun Have you ever tried to implement something that was out of the box? Give me your example, then we'll get back on track well, so some the example I'm thinking of right now is When I was Leading in in media center and they had Gone six years and never passed BBTs Okay, and it's not a great example, but it's it They were holistically entrenched and This idea is the Way we we need to move forward like they as I described back then they were heavily solidified in No, what we need to do is have our end-to-end tests in our BV T suite, right? And this is just a horrible idea But their whole organization was bought in But they couldn't get BV T's to pass In that particular case and I met with a whole lot of resistance But I basically said no we're gonna stop that. Yeah Yeah, that's just a dumb definition of what a BV T is For sure, but I mean the point the point is I was surrounded with people That said we've tried everything Last six years. We tried everything we can't make this change Alright, and some of the times like one of my favorite things to do is When I realized that a change has to be made but People want to see something but they don't feel it can be done Because of politics or or You know interactions or people complaining Right. That's a great place to just rip the band-aid, but it's sure but you're out of the box And what turns out to be a very very small box Yeah, if So I think the point is you want to try These little things they can be things that are incremental or things that can be Incremental changes from where you are or maybe some out-of-the-box things that can leapfrog you So what I was gonna say if it's too out of the box Then what you want to do is around the box thinking so you earlier you're talking about where are you now? Where do you want to be? right and a third step is Alright, what is the first action? that you should take towards where you want to be And communicate that one action is actually the goal there are a zillion Quilts you can go look up on the internet that basically say the hardest part of any change is starting. Yeah So for anything you want to improve just start just try something then the other bit I wanted to get to is They're gonna try a bunch of stuff you use different kinds of thinking you're going to Reflect and try and find new things to do to you're trying to create a learning organization I think it's a lot of parallels between the learning organization as Peter Senge talks about and a culture of quality In Senge wrote the fifth discipline where the five disciplines Well, the fifth most important one is systems thinking which I think is highly related to a quality culture but Once you start getting these changes to happen, you need that reinforcement. You need Some celebration of hey, we're able to cut down our cycle time blah blah blah here. Hey, we were able to learn This thing from data weren't able to do before. Oh, hey, it looks like we have not a bug older than seven days in three months Those little you don't need to have a huge party for all these things but celebrate the things That are leading you in the direction you want to go and by celebrate. I mean, you know, call them out in a slack channel call them out in a Standup give some recognition for those things because those that recognition to some people Often is worth more than giving them a monetary bonus, especially in front of people, but it also motivates others to Try and model that behavior so those things as a leader are very very important you want to inspire your followers Use your language from earlier to Model the behavior to the behavior you want to see so when you see what you when you see what you like Make sure other people know that you like it Or know that it's appreciated. You have to be careful with that right, because It does it can run the risk They get misinterpreting. So you want to make sure that what whatever you're celebrating you're celebrating it as a team goal achieved and that it's not being interpreted as oh I'm gonna do this because this is what makes Alan happy and Then I'll get a good review. Yeah as well right cuz that would then reinforce I see how that could happen at Microsoft so So that is important depending on the culture where you are. I'm glad I was able to load you know load up another Microsoft thing well It's a company obsessed with competition both against other companies and internally with teams against each other and people against each other That is for better for worse the culture that drives Microsoft Yeah, that aspect is is The intra team Competition I'm not gonna lie to you and say it's not there anymore but it is vastly It was there in full force a year and a half ago. It's vastly toned down. All right. I can't comment after that Alright anything else you want to talk about as far as principle number four No, I think we're out of time anyway Excellent well one last thing to say is viva la France France just beat Uruguay Oh France will go to the semi-final in the World Cup. I'm very excited I predicted France would go to the final where they would lose to Germany But Germany failed to make it out of the knockout stage so that happened I Picked a bracket before the before the tournament started and I get another long outro The left side of my bracket was I was France perfect. I got everything right the right side nothing It's all a big mess of everything's wrong Okay. Well, I am Alan and I'm brain. We'll see you next time
