Approaching a test today would not be to test quality in like I did when I started is to understand what quality is and Recognize the gap between what we're doing and what that is Welcome to a be testing podcast your modern testing podcast Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey everybody, it's Alan and Brent and it's a be testing podcast You didn't tell me we were gonna do like the monster truck Podcast come in this Monday Monday Monday. Yeah 165 165 165. All right, so everybody's awake. I'm sorry I'll tone that down and post prod as they say, but we're here again to talk about Yeah, who knows really right Brett? What do you been up to? Are you watching the fun and politics on this fine Friday? I'm kind of Sick of the politics right now Yes and no, but I was thinking of a podcast episode Right. Yeah, and I was just thinking man to me the politics are extra political and I was thinking about how we've talked about Really in America. I think you agree with us really in America the fact that we're a two-party system Oh God friggin blows and Right now I kind of see the two parties in dominant are Both trying to make it a single party Yeah, and I'm just like this this As you know, I am neither of the the popular party No, but it doesn't help to be neither It doesn't help to be neither until we have ranked choice voting and then people can be neither it can make a difference No, because then yes, then you're asking me to be the enabler and join the two-party system Be all freaking least go I'm a liberalist or Whatever it is and I'm gonna vote for my candidate and I'm net my candidates never gonna win because we have a hostile two-party System, but I have my principles you tell me how How throwing in with one of the stupid two parties that is what today to be? How does that help it become a three-party or a four or a five because today no matter what one of the stupid two parties is going to win people like me who may want to vote for another party are afraid to We don't want our vote to not count. We don't want the worst of two evils to get into the office Okay, so more more Because you're afraid you want me to join your idiocy Is that what you just told me no bullshit you're wasting a vote You're sending a vote to someone who is not going to win and then that vote just gets flushed down the toilet Doesn't matter for anything else. I want you to continue to vote for your little party of that that aligns with your principles. I Do not want I want to do this I want to vote for whatever party aligns my principles, but when an inevitably at least at first that candidate doesn't win it doesn't let a for example a Person convicted of espionage and selling new potentially selling nuclear secrets from getting into power But if we all vote for the party that wins we have exactly the opposite of what I want So your logic No, my my logic you're saying you're saying that if I vote for my principles. Yep knowing that My party is not gonna win Because eventually if enough people vote for your like you vote for your principles people get more and more comfortable voting for that person party will get more dollars to Campaign and become a little bit more prominent get their voice heard more than they do today Which ends up letting these third and fourth parties rise into prominence Well, it sounds like then I should you're reversing that I should continue to vote the way I do You're not gonna get the momentum. You need to challenge the two-party system without ranked by sorting. Well, I agree But okay done then which of the two parties are gonna give me that none of the other party because they both Desperately want to stay in power and be in power and be the power so we're never gonna have ranked choice voting We are always going to have better candidates than the two Democrat and Republican I'm so sorry everybody but you didn't get this anyway We're always gonna have better candidates far better candidates than what the Democratic and Republican parties put out there always always till the end of time Yes Unfortunately, that's the only choice we really have we can vote for other people and feel better about it But no matter who we vote for either the Republican or the Democrat is going to win any political race Did you see in the latest latest voter pamphlet for Washington? There was somebody running? I forget which office I almost voted for him, but I chickened that up last minute. His party was the elven way I Mean, you know what? This is where we gotta go We got to get to a place where if I feel like voting for the elven way I can vote for the elven way and they have a chance of winning But today we'll go all vote for the party with the best chance of winning and I'll be yeah No, so I'm not gonna do that. I mean I would have voted for the elven way guy if If his principles were aligned a little bit of a rant there We're about seven minutes in but we'll get on What? Well, I was just thinking the I we didn't have much time Post said it last time, but I gotta say I really enjoyed our our last guest Yeah, he was fun and I feel bad one of our listeners pinged us and was a little bummed He said hey, I listen to the first 10 minutes sound like an ad so I left and it did turn out that we talked About his product at the beginning, but by no means was it like it really wasn't about his product at all No, although we did talk about it at the beginning just kind of because it no man set some context What happens is you want to be on the podcast you somehow internet stalk me and you go? Hey, can this dude? I know beyond the podcast or this can I be on the podcast and I'm Yeah, sure, whatever and then we then we get to know the person on the podcast and we talk and yeah, it was fun You're gonna say something. Yeah, I was gonna say no I mean it made sense it to me it makes sense for us to talk about their product very because our job is to convert the Conversation to something that we think is gonna be interesting to our listeners or just what we want to talk about Yeah, but if we have a guest on right, I'm gonna want to talk about their product Because then I'm then I'm kind of probing to figure out what okay What are these guys or what is this person a domain expert on that's interesting to our listeners? Ah Yeah, right and I didn't think it were 10 minutes in like like I thought we had it pretty quickly All right Yeah, this leadership is disappointing people at a level they can absorb a mens All right Okay, anything else you want to hit on before we give you a topic? No, let's that's that's top All right, I was recently to a couple things going on here and I'm gonna be very transparent about what's going on here I am super lazy. Did you know that Brent? I did This is why I automate stuff and by that I don't mean writing Selenium tests. So stuff it I am Superly so slimy Selenium tests. We've covered this Selenium test is is is the opposite of lazy Let me give you an example how lazy I am Okay, my I was new monitor, but it's a little screwed up in power management When I plug it in in the morning It doesn't turn it doesn't connect it like my my Mac thinks it's there But it's not there and I have to well used to have to unplug it and plug it back in Okay, and it would work fine the whole rest of the day just after being off for a while It won't plug back in kind of a pain Well, I am way too lazy to crawl under my desk every morning and unplug and plug in my monitor so I put a little internet addressable plug on the monitor and then put that on a timer so it turns off and on about 10 minutes for my first meeting in the morning and That's how lazy I am To me it feels like a YouTube word of the life hack Lazy someone asked me Recently like would you write? Can you write you know, I write articles once for a while I said, yeah, I think I'd like to write an article It's been a while and I said you have a suggestion because man, I don't even know where to start that I haven't already ranted about how the way how we test at unity No, that isn't in my list I did repost someone on Twitter post I saw another I just glanced by another one saying someone with the testers mindset could blah blah blah So I reposted my myth of the testers mindset thing on Twitter last week Yeah, we got a got a few few head nods and yeah, ha's and that kind of stuff But anyway, they're right another article I asked for a suggestion and then which I'll share here in a second and then Another company asked me if I do a talk like a recorded like 10-minute talk, which I can usually spit those out pretty quickly But I'm gonna do The same time in a read an article about something and then I'm gonna talk on the same thing and Because I'm way lazy and I should say in college every once in a while I would get an assignment from two different classes that was close enough like a writing assignment I could do the same paper for two different classes. Now. It's not plagiarism if it's plagiarizing you Major me ism. So I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write a paper probably this weekend. I'm gonna give a talk I'm probably gonna record it Next week, but we're gonna go ahead and kind of hash out the topic today We have this more than a couple times We have we have like vet my topic But I have some ideas here and I want to walk through kind of what I'm thinking about but I want to get your Initial reaction first to the topic of if I was starting as a tester today How would I approach it and I want to get your initial thoughts and then I have a whole bunch of thoughts It's gonna go somewhere. So like Brent if I'm gonna ask you if you were starting as a tester today, how would you approach it? Okay first question What's a tester? No, we're we're we're question you said starting as a tester, but I assume I assume we're gonna go with sort of a straight out of college type of No, no, no, I think up to interpretation So I think my question while you think about this my question of what is a tester is a valid question because Today if you look at the people who have a tester role, it's a lot of different things. All right So let me start a little bit on Kind of what I'm thinking on my story cuz I've been a bunch of different kinds of testers and some of them haven't been Much of testers when I first started off way back in 1993 explored applications I Found errors. I reported bugs. I work with developers to understand them to show them to demo them I did I validated things were working as expected. I used applications all those things Someone who does that role even today is still called the tester, right? So when I go back and do that again, probably not Probably not. I did that for a while and then I did a lot of API testing I wrote a bunch of network analysis utilities and tools to help me examine fonts and font rendering and bitmap rendering on Windows a lot of deep API testing not just Automating the API but writing tools and applications that helped me understand how Because I was working on GDI mostly with some user how these user facing API is worked on Windows So I did a lot of API testing a short story would I go be back and be that kind of tester? And the answer is no because I fully believe today that everything I did then it should be the developers job The developers should write their own tests and there's a tester could write a few of those But I was writing a bunch of a bunch of tests Fortunately at that time very few of them were kind of unit testy But I think a lot of the tests I wrote at that time still should be owned by developers They probably could have written them better than I did for sure And at the time to my to credit I think there's a lot of like these tools are I'm picturing them like stuff to render code pages to dive in and look at the shading on true type fonts things like that I Shared with developers and they kind of end up being code developed over time But still API testing you could say my you might even say my job was a developer Who did mostly testing versus implementing new stuff? I don't know. So after I did that For a while basically is this jumping ahead a few years, but I was still a tester on a test team I was a test architect But I mostly wrote tools to help testers do better work. I wrote like test test runners In fact, I wrote a co-wrote a CI system back in like 2001 Really stuff to help stuff. I taught developers how to write unit tests and gave them Like code generation that could look at their code and figure out it stubs for some unit tests go ahead Yeah, but then at that point in time, were you really still a tester? Ah, good question, right? Good question. You know what I was doing at that time You know what I began to do at that time for the first time in my career tag I began to accelerate the achievement the shippable quality. So you were an accelerant versus a safety net I think for the first time ever I began to be an accelerant versus a safety net. Yep. Yep But I was working on a cellar primarily except for a few cases 95% of what I was doing was accelerating testers or No, well the what you just described was accelerating testing. Oh, yes, but at that point only the testers did the testing Yeah, I was trying to remember And it's hard when you were still here at Microsoft Was it still? Was this still a place in your point of view where it was common to have a discussion with? Developer if I'm doing all the unit tests, what are you doing? Yeah that that was this is yeah that happened for years That that was gone by the time I left Okay, so this is all everything I talked to you now. We were coming This is like my my job as a tester up to about 2003 2004 Yeah, I Yeah, so I like how I like how you did the shift there into into an accelerant. I really do I'm like Okay, so he's He can now point back to a time where he actually began his journey as a Modern tester if you will. Yeah, very I didn't even realize it and I knew a lot about testing and I was teaching testing and talking about testing and techniques and But for the most part I was focusing on accelerating the test team But then a few years later Eventually, I don't even know what I did on link or communicate or ever it was at the time But when I moved to Xbox I that point I was still doing a lot of accelerating of the test team But really more of accelerating the entire team I did a lot of stuff in the build system a lot of tools for developers to use as well as testers So I was still working as an accelerant, but in this case accelerating More of the team and then I moved so so there I'm a little right when I think about I think when I think about What do we call it our motto our mission statement? Accelerate the achievement of shippable quality. Yeah, you weren't accelerate in Xbox But just because you're on engineering systems Doesn't mean you were accelerating shippable quality now me knowing me knowing you you probably were Right, but well, I was doing things like porting app Verifier to Xbox because I believe in the power of dynamic Analysis tools making sure we had efficient static analysis tools in our build pipeline With bugs auto assigned to people for accountability there. So it's code lots of code correctness work. I did I accelerated code correctness For whatever that's worth right? So and then that just naturally graduated into like what I did on teams, which was even more focusing on Well, I did I began to do more test coaching then even on Arcadia before then the Stupid Science Project of working with developers I'm really helping them probably the first time I helped them do better testing maybe worth what maybe that's worth talking about So then I spent a time in my career as a tester as a test coach Least partially helping developers learn how to do better testing teaching them that they don't need to have a testers mindset they can just have a growth mindset and at the same time doing that focusing on velocity and Even though I didn't know them at the time indirectly working on Dorometrics like cycle times getting faster at delivering and getting feedback from customers But a little bit of coaching in there, too Yeah, so so at that point you could say that that point I was no longer a tester Would you say that if I was coaching testers? Do I still get to wear the tester hat if I'm coaching developers on testing? You do but to what? Like are we going into the weeds now in terms of your initial question? No, I want to go back to it There's an evolution here There's like this is where my career went and it's all based on a knowledge of testing When I shifted into accelerating the team I moved into a little different approach in how I wanted to improve quality on the team and maybe it's Somewhere in there. I began to care a lot more about quality than did about testing So if I pop back original question, I don't actually know the answer here yet If I was a tester today, how would I approach it? Yeah, so I was thinking of it this way. Okay, so let's say Let's say you just came out of college Okay, and brand new you're reported to a new manager and your title is ste Okay, okay, and your your new manager tells you hey Alan Your job is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality Great WTF does that mean right? That's gonna be your first question. What does that mean? How would you go about working it through this to me? I When I think of it the other way around it's like the The first thing I would want to know is Okay, shippable quality What does that mean? How is that measured? Right. I first need to know that to know if we achieve it And then the the other part of the statement is talking about cycle time and increasing cycle time, right? Well, the definition of shippable is directly tied to cycle time. I don't know if my out of college ste Persona would know that but I know that right when you and I came out of college on this one the ship date was Sure, it had wiggle room, but the ship date was just decided 18 years ago, I'll say for me And I have I have Modern testing principles up for me. The first thing I would do is all right Where's the customer usage data? Right, they I'm gonna start going coming up if there isn't already an active Definition I'm gonna start coming up with What are the problems customers are trying to solve with the the data? So for me, it's it's my role I don't know. I think if I were straight out of college, I would view my role as far more of a data engineer business analyst to try to understand the the customer and understand we are the customer Yeah, no, um, that's that to try to understand the customer. What is the value proposition? Where are they getting stuck? Where are they improving? Let me clarify understanding or make sure something gets clicked like I go Yeah, you're onto something. So This is approaching a test today would not be to test quality in like I did when I started is to understand What quality is and recognize the gap between what we're doing and what that is. Is that where you're going? Yeah Okay to me it would it would absolutely start with Where you are a world-renowned Expert, okay. I can't I just got out of college man. I just got out of college. Give me some time No, no, no Virtual you the real you I would start with a be testing right which is of course the podcast this podcast and so a slash But where you are an acknowledged world leader Like go with your wheelhouse This is actually huge. This is something maybe we've been missing talking about coming out of this is like if I'm able to Look at data Maybe even talk to product at customer insights But the more I can understand about what customer perceived quality is The more I can assess what our gaps are now. That's is that a tester job Usually it's like a product manager that drives A-B testing so is this an adjunct of traditional product management or I think the new tester role is to because when I Remember for there was a while once why I confused you by actually knowing some of the right nomenclature and definitions and wording around Experimentation and data science. I believe the correct adjective was impressed me All right, and that and when I was doing that research So I'm really good at learning enough about something quickly to fake my way I'm the king of fake it till you make it But I remember now when I was reading and studying for that stuff The person when they talked about doing an experiment they talked about being a partnership between the tester and the developer But in this case by the tester they met the person designing the test Yes, and the test in this case is not the test case input force you what happens The test is the treatment the different the a the B part of the a B testing Yeah, so let me tell you for example Like I don't know that the product manager is really the person that does that anymore It certainly is is not in my experience. I I assign that to like straight out of college ICs on my team Oh Interesting who partner with straight out of college? ICPMs on someone else's thing Interesting but but those hypotheses range from itty-bitty to huge For example, so one of my team Worked with a PM on a different team very very recently And wanted to understand So do you know how in some text boxes you can you can put you can put sort of a grayed out text in there The kind of guide what goes here and then when they start typing that text goes away. Yeah, exactly the control said Describe your problem Okay, they wanted to to test what happened if instead of that in the treatment it said Briefly describe your problem. Okay, just add in the word briefly There is a standard set of KPIs that we measured against we basically said. All right, you have the the data you've actually My IC just basically said this is what we need how you needed to find the experiment How you need to split it and we need the data Two weeks later. It took that IC 15 minutes to say Yeah, briefly does literally nothing there's there's no difference between specifying briefly or not good example of an A B test, but I need to rewind because my mind is blowing blowing because 20 years ago that new at a college tester comes in and is validating that If the input box says it takes text it'll take text Done things like that valid the canonical example making sure the password you can log into the site now As we've discussed many times before Testing and automated testing especially should be owned by the developer who wants to code Right. So the tester today does that the that stuff's been validated. So instead the tester today is all about Testing via data coming with hypotheses around how the software works and and and and what would make it better or worse Let's let's say better what would make it better and then designing experiments around Confirming or disproving those hypotheses. I think that's perfectly reasonable But that is it's holy crap and I would bet that there are I mean you're doing this This is really cool that you have people do this. This is this is but you don't call these people testers What do you call them? I call them data scientists. Nah Yeah, wait, is it the profession of data scientists going away? That's my prediction. Yeah, and then they go back to being testers or what happens? It's a very confusing circle of life here. So Well, you'll you'll enjoy this Will I so I believe in the industry we're at the beginning of the end of that of the era Okay, I'm pretty certain it started before you left Microsoft Where it's our basically? What do you call something that repeats every decade? It's it's a cycle Ten years cycle ten year cycles are perfect. It is about four or five years ago Someone in HR decided it was time to change the career stage profile because things had gotten out of whack and They started this like five years later and they just finished their current conclusion Okay, the current iteration and I'm like, oh my god, this is already invalid so they're they're creating a They're creating a whole dev track. The test track is gone. Okay, but there is a dev track There is an analytics track and there is a data science track And there is also a data engineering track Those those last What's the I don't know what I know of course there are differences but Uh, I so data engineering versus the other two that one's easy. It's right Make the data right make it flow sure right and Correct and keep it complete But i'll let you finish and then i'm gonna rant in terms of people doing work in data science space Based on my current reading of the other three, which is dev data scientists in and analysis I really cannot figure out the difference Right. I look at them and i'm like, okay, so if I write code that uses data science apis Which one of those am I? It shouldn't matter because some people are going to live in the middle of two of them and then it gets really hard So a little bit of a rant here and I can do this because I worked extensively On the version you just retired or about to retire And also had I guess not much involvement in what we have at my current employer But my experience is what happened with the original we had ladder levels then we had Something else and then something else in this new thing brent described So the first something else we had Was far too specific That the descriptions are long and what happens when you had you're too specific is People use them as a checklist they go. Okay. I did that did that did that did that please promote me Yeah, that was that was absolutely horrible. That was horrible Let me let me finish then The new ones still a little bit but less there was some overlap we made sure that It felt calibrated between disciplines But there was still a lot of like what do you call my accelerant role was I was on the test track But nothing I did was testing. So it was weird again too specific test architect is what you called it. Ellen Well, I I did not come up with the title Okay, I didn't invent that one All right. All right. So what happens is let me tell you where I work now uh, we have two Career the ladder levels over there called here. Um job job profiles job architecture. We have two across the entire company technical and non-technical ooh They're at they're abstract, but they're close they're close enough and there's four areas for each market to go into them and reveal any super secrets But what that leaves is a little bit of a disadvantage is it is a lot of interpretation? That the manager has to do to figure it out. But my argument is that's actually good There's a lot of pushes to go. I need to develop a A version of this just for software engineers or just for program management or just blah blah But they generally on a small team. It's fine. If you can help explain that You're just going to get your thoughts down. But what I've found is the more abstract Principle one that can't be used as a checklist but can be used to differentiate between levels Actually works much much better than the more detailed ones. I saw at microsoft two of them technical non-technical Done. Okay. Yeah, I don't like non-technical It seemed because it it it there was a I'm sorry. There's there's there's three and then there's management Okay. Yeah, and that would be the right Right now you look at that and I go technical non-technical and management like to me. It almost sounds like it put a stack order Technical like the useful people are at the top technical down to the useless ones, which is management It reminds me of an event I was at I never told you this actually so I had an event Uh, it was one of these back prior to covet where we actually would be do forced manager training in a room with other people and we would meet new people and um I met the former drummer of death cab for cutie because He works for microsoft now in xbox studios as an artist Oh cool And I think based on my conversation with him I don't think he'd like being classified as non-technical But like it would be better to be classified as something Pro something like to be clear. There's A lot of people call expert test to call testing. There's technical testing and non-technical testing, which is crap, right? But that's that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the difference between marketing And development we call marketing non-technical Yeah, why don't we just call them? Sales or or something right that sales and marketing are different things, right? No, no, no, but there's got to be a broader name for then non-technical technical and Creed, I don't know technical Important technical and actually makes us money on the dev work. We do. I don't know But I I get what you're saying that this non-technical label is Practically offensive in some cases. So I get that. All right, let's go back to let's go back rewind rewind If you were a tester today, how would you approach it? We went too far back because Okay All right. So you said You had you said something along the lines that you had your mind blown and oh my because I approached testing today by calling testing I would approach testing today as Experimentation and assessing quality via hypothesis based on customer data Yeah, I was looking at it like I have over on A different screen than the one where your camera is on I have the mt principles and and if today the job is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality the world we entered into maybe was accelerate the Achievement of required correctness Hmm That sounds dumb It does sound dumb and that's probably mostly because it was dumb. No. Yeah. Okay We're on the same page. I think if I were coming into a test or if I were managing a new tester team Today it definitely is going to be focused on quality and not correctness Yes So I I I So here's where my mind is because ab testing is still testing No, that's actually what i'm thinking. Alan i'm like in the software world Right now we talk about modern testing is not very modern and not about testing Yeah, okay, and we operate a podcast called ab testing we do What if if I were to tell you In season two of the ab testing is coming up after this cliffhanger No, what if I were to tell you F the old definition of testing this is about Modern and it is about testing But it's today's definition of we are gonna piss off so many people while we change the world Yeah, ab testing it's official. It is modern and it is about testing screw y'all Yeah No, I think we have to go through the principles and say okay with that definition of testing What is missing? Because i'll tell you right now there is an there number seven Yeah, no, they change Number seven absolutely changes. I think expanding it the know-how I mean that's that's what i'm working on right now The I have now gone through so many freaking experiment designs I'm now at a point. Oh, oh my god Why do these people keep coming to me the the mistakes they keep making are so easy. They could just stop Right. I'm i'm now at a point where i'm getting prepared to automate this which is what i've done my whole career as as have you Just the boring parts In retrospective, that means my life has been very boring I think season two of ab testing coming up here Maybe we maybe we really messed and put the slash in our podcast title Okay Yeah, that's interesting. There's some exploration to do here. So I didn't and here's the fun Here's what you get to hear as a listener all three of you of ab testing I didn't know where this was going that my My approach in thinking about how to answer this question of if I were a tester day How would I approach it? Let's try and think about the different kinds of testing I've done And how quickly I evolved out of actually doing testing yet somehow Knowing something about it, but we we made a shift here, which is It's what stephen johnson in where good ideas comes from is called the adjacent possible It was there it was there to be noticed. It just took us talking for us to notice it Yeah, and it's interesting. It was it was there. It was there all the time It has been absolutely we we've just been And and we've we've talked around it like for years it just never it's like we're We're at a party and we keep refusing to make eye contact with this one thing because so we don't even notice that they're there and then suddenly like Oh, you've been here the whole time Testing I am staring at you and fluttering my eyes Hey ab testing What's your side let's go get a beer together it's too much of a random tangent maybe even even for our podcast Almost impossible long time listeners will know it's pretty much impossible to out tangent The a slash be testing podcast. Oh, I you're really gonna stick with that, huh? Just for now I don't know what's gonna happen, man. I don't know what's gonna happen On season two of the ab testing podcast. Sorry on season two So let's be testing podcast. We still got a few minutes left. Let's go through this All right, man. I'm win. All right. I just got excited. Sorry, man. I'm gonna reel it back So we're going to define modern testing like testing now In the the the span of the next few minutes testing is talking about ab testing experiment design And the thing that i'm just i'm like, yeah shippable quality quality. It's about quality. That's what ab testing Oh my god The thing I really like about ab testing is because it's about Quality versus the other testing craft is about correctness old testing not modern testing Now we don't have to do modern and traditional we can actually do modern and old. Yeah, I was I was thinking Could we get away with calling it old And just testing like remove our adjective and put it on the other put the adjective on the other one traditional or like I've been calling it traditional but I now want to turn that makes it sound like it's archaic ab testing our Uh, our priority is improving the business Absolutely. That sounds good. I don't know if it's really well I was like, you know, we put that in some more homework on these and but yeah There are new principles because it's a new we're actually talking about modern testing It is modern and it is about testing right? I'm changing the website in 15 minutes So so for that one The I think the priority is improving the business but unlike when we when we originally did this we put that in there Because like I remember why I wanted that in there and why I wanted it as number one Is because so much of the traditional testers were We're just like I I provided information or I do what I told or I do this I'm like I provide information to stakeholders so they can make the hard decisions Right and we're like no cut that crap out be a part Be an active part of improving the business Not not some dead weight that someone can cut at any time We accelerate the team and use models like I don't know. That's not part of the new modern testing. I don't think it is And even number so I think one five and six So the customer is only capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product That's a new modern testing principle as well as we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and close the gap stream product Hypothesis and business impact. That's a new modern testing principle Yeah, you could you could almost argue six could be removed because we're kind of saying Six is modern testing. Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna take a little bit of work here. I do want to make one little psa. So Uh, just so you all know brent is click training himself So if you hear a little clicky clicky sound in the back that is brent teaching himself how to not salivate when hearing good ideas Yeah, so when I have a good idea the small Mostly non-functional but sometimes functional, uh Resistance to annoy alan just dissipates It's like okay No, must put crunchy things down must hit mute if i'm gonna cough must All of alan's rules that you've heard him over the years I can you know, I cut your coughs and and clearing throats things out of the podcast all the time But it's when you're clicking when you talk I can't I do not have the time to go in and edit out the clicks while leaving your voice in place It is not worth it. So they're gonna be there. But wait a minute. You're saying you could do that though I could I could I could do that. Okay fair enough. All right. I'm not gonna too much effort Yeah, so several things would need to change for sure But I like this direction And I like it too because Now if we do this I have to go back and restudy all those things that I learned once and you all know like it Oh, you know what? I should go back and look at the presentation. I gave at like agile dev in las vegas in 2017 or so where I gave a talk on experimentation Did you know that brent? Yes, I give like a workshop on experimentation. No, I know Because this is where I I I you vetted it here I know because this is what I do. I learned enough to give a presentation people to be happy. It was like a fill-in like Don't have a speaker. Can you come to vegas? I said yeah, i'll come for the day I said no you have to spend the night. I'm not okay I'm not entirely certain you should be so proud of yourself being a masterful bullshitter, but you know, whatever Someone's a little jelly So no, I want to relearn this stuff. So I will I will put my no with that with that light of mine Talking about it. Yeah, this is so cool. We have a topic for the next podcast Two weeks before we're even going to record it We often do that. The question is often We do The question is is will we actually remember? No, I think we will this is big news. This is big news We're talking about season two of the a b testing podcast. Yeah It's freaking funny as well. You're like, hey What if we took the concept of modern testing? And combined it with the concept of a b testing Who could have come up with that idea? I just can't wait to chase the tail line too. It it it is modern damn it and it is about testing now. Shut up Yeah, it'll at least at least the hate letters will be something new right? You know, I yes And we love the anyways give us things to talk about and every we we love for you to hate us I was just thinking no, I was just trying to I was trying to guess what the if we came out with that with With a set of principles that were in fact both modern and about Testing and I don't know it depends on to what degree we wanted to say Yeah, we're we're taking the term. We're taking over the term what you call testing this. Yeah Oh, oh and we can be the ones to say oh, oh, oh my god. Oh my god I know where you're going. Go ahead. We could be the ones to say well, that's not testing Yeah Oh You you went down a similar path But not the one we have heard some people say that about testers in the industry where they didn't like them because whatever i'm not But they would say what that's not testing. Well, guess what? That's not testing either No, no Yeah, what if we were to say? And I would love to be able to say this and back it up What is known as traditional testing? I am proposing that from here on out We call it checking All of it every bit of it your information providing that's all checking all of it all of it You're playing with the app to see if it works and and plugging in random inputs Still checking it's all checking Let's like let's like if we're gonna take if we're gonna take back the term or if we're gonna take the term testing Let's test take take checking as well. Why not? Okay We own testing All right, I gotta go to my next medium yeah me too. Hey everybody It's alan and goodbye and that's brent and he says goodbye and we'll talk to you next time on series two episode 166 of the a slash b testing podcast. Bye. Bye
