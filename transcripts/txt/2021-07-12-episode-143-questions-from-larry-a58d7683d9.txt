Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey Brent how's it going it's going awesome Alan how about you I'm doing great did you have a good fourth doing great I didn't do anything at all not a little bit not even a little bit I did nothing I don't think I think I was asleep by like 10 p.m. I'm pretty boring so what are you doing there all I see is the top of your head and a bunch of moving around I'm moving around and got a top of my head I did breast a record button we skipped the week of podcasts and I forgot how to do a podcast it's a little bit difficult I could remember what to plug in where and I forgot to put headphones on and then just I'll tell a quick little story it's like riding a bike right it is a little bit so I always do the podcast recording from my Mac which we are today the other day I don't know whether it was a zoom update or a Linux update because I took two both at once and then ever since then sort of randomly zoom crashes very horribly on my Linux machine so horribly that once it crashes my whole desktop is locked like everything is frozen and in the no Michelle because I'm on Ubuntu and then maybe two or three minutes later it just then it finally crashes completely takes back to the login screen I have to log in and start over so I thought well I don't have time to debug this and figure out what the hell happened so I will just begin using my Mac it's probably a faster machine and does things better than my that's what I'm doing and but then there was a reason for this story oh I just kind of I'm used to turning the other way and I moved instead of using the Mac camera I switched my other camera to use the Mac anyway long story nobody cares because nobody can see anything so how's work yeah anything new and exciting no I know yeah Brent is so thrilled with life right now I don't know man let's do a podcast yeah TGI yes should we start recording another day of the week so you have some more energy mr. breather no you know one of the things we might want to do is I can look at the schedule and rebalance but now that I am basically working from work more often than not we might want to talk about going back to our morning times okay I got some topics to go over but I was insulted what I we got a quarterly business review for my org with a whole bunch of execs across the company and one of them said Alan your beard is too long and I said how long is too long he said I don't know but that's it but I know it when I see it I know it when I see it and that's too long yeah I don't agree with this and I again I we don't have a lot of hierarchy at uni but unity uni uni is the new short name right unity but I the words that I consider did not come out of my mouth so that was good let's go so I want to lead into some questions but first of all I wanted to tell you something I never told you before Oh a secret a secret I still think it's the right thing I still think it's the right thing so as you know way back in late December early January move the hosting of the AB testing podcast from self hosting to anchor it on FM that's worked out their own by Spotify's worked out very well there were a few little glitches at the very beginning but for the most part it's worked I've been pretty happy with how well it's worked like no no big complaints but one of the things you can do is set up you can add supporters which is which means people can like sponsor the podcast I've never advertised this and even in the text on edge I just said you have an option turn it on or off turned it on and then in the text I is like you can customize your listeners support options and I said supporting the podcast is completely optional all proceeds go to supporting our community through sponsorships scholarships and other support for our three listeners so which I believe in so we have a separate account now we're an LLC I put any payment I get for speaking for about that are that's about modern testing or any other things like that go into this account the only thing to pay out of that account is well anchors free so nothing there anymore the modern testing org bill is about three dollars a month for hosting and then oh then then the yearly domains I put it on I put it on AWS and just hosted it myself versus paying for hosting and it's super cheap because we get like you know three users a month going there right exactly it's the account is there and when things open back up again if I was on the ball we should have sponsored someone's ticket for test bash home but I didn't think ahead well enough and I got to kind of get more of this mindset so the short story is not in it to make money and also a lot of you know I am a patreon member of some podcasts and cuz I like the podcast want to give them some money and they're doing it as a business a little bit different but part of me like one of the reasons I don't want to push this and I'm mentioning it because I want to reiterate the fact we're not doing this to make money we're doing this whole podcast because we want to help people navigate the world of software better right so as most of you know it costs zero dollars like there's one there's one podcast I listen to where if you sponsor the podcast you can hang out with them on a discord channel screw that noise I do not want perks ever associated with these sponsorships because I think it it creates a class system that it's already echoed enough in society I don't want to recreate it in our podcast there's actually there's there's there's actually a different phenomenon and I forget the author but some of the books that I read that led me to behavioral economics which then led me to data science right once right now we're producing the podcast and I'm and I'm glad that that actually you didn't tell me about this and tell now and we'll see later if I regret you even telling me now but I'm glad this is entirely optional because things change once the reason why you're doing it shifts from being a social contract to a fiscal contract yeah yeah yeah and and I just want to make sure like if someone wants to put money in the kitty you'll know where it's going and that's fine I do want to do more outreach with the podcast but again I'm using all of my probably the canonical example is I made an intro to modern testing course for ministry of testing get a little chunk of money every quarter there that just goes into our ab testing bank account we can use that to probably put back in the ministry of testing or other sites or things we we care about I don't want to do perks because I think it creates a caste system yep and it changes our reason for being exactly exactly so it's there I'm not gonna I'm gonna leave it on because I think it does help us with reach and I just don't want to ever feel like it's anything super special that said um we have our actually with me us never advertising it someone uh committed to being a sponsor at a I think the minimum level which is great I don't want anybody to actually do more than that and they may stop after a month one of the things you can do on anchor here's the one little perk you get and uh if you don't want to sponsor us and still want this same perk I will find I'm happy to find a way for you to do it in fact I know the way for you to do it so one thing you can do on anchor if you sponsor someone is you can leave them a voice message and Larry left us a voice message and I'm going I will I'll play it a little in a little bit and uh but if you don't want to if you don't want to do this sponsorship or you don't feel like it you can't afford it totally fine but if you want to have your question actually in an audio form just send me a freaking wave file or an mp3 and I'll put it on there happy to take your questions in mailbag or anywhere in the one of the three dot slack comm sorry my dog is bringing me toys now and we'll answer your question so anyway uh he left the voice message but then he asked the same question same questions in our slack group and there were some answers I wanted to go a little bit deeper I thought for Larry for anybody else we would have answered these questions anyway but I just wanted to tie in how I just it made sense to tie this all together and tell this story so thank you Larry appreciate it and hopefully the community appreciates it we'll find a way to as with everything with ab testing we're just going to find a way to pay this forward but uh in the meantime it may be good to have some discussions about his questions make sense you with me so far Brent I am I'm looking at our text and I'm wondering on on the supporter thing I'm wondering if you can change it and just clearly call out you know just click the x in the upper right like it defaults to to something I think is way more expensive than anyone should okay I've only ever looked at as an administrator so let me find the right window again tell me tell me what it should say live podcasting as we change our crap okay I'm ready so I'm gonna share screen oh god make it hard for me yeah yeah yeah I see I see can I choose their own number I don't know what happens like those numbers I don't either I don't know what happens I guess you click it's like to do this right by here you say it's entirely optional and then here you just put in parentheses click the x in the upper right the upper left okay I'm gonna save that and then we should probably get going with the question so anyway I wanted to mention that because it was contextually seemed appropriate and I wanted to congratulate Larry's being the first one and I think again thank you for that we're gonna make we're gonna do something fun with that donation and let me go to where the heck is questions but and actually I wanted to start with the third question because that's the only left the voicemail about in fact let's listen to that message now I have been using design by contract in the Eiffel programming language using Eiffel studio for about 20 years I find it very shocking and surprising that in that 20 years that other mainstream languages java c-sharp python swift go whatever you have that those languages have not picked up design by contract and made it a part of their compiler and I'm wondering if you guys can speak to that issue as to why these major languages have not picked up design by contract because it's such an outstanding way of ensuring correct behavior between client and supplier code okay so brent um I've actually have some experience here but I want to start with you and talk about like what do you know about this design by contract do you know anything about it or a little bit about it or have you looked into it at all uh I have not done any of those things but in terms of right it the way it's phrased makes it sound like it is a a formal acronym like designed by contract deep well it's it's a often referred to as dbc which is an initialism not an acronym but go on but interface contract discussions and things like that I've had lots of discussion around this makes it from the context it feels like it's um i'm trying to decide is it is it a new sort of agile based technique that i'm just now becoming familiar with or is this something closer to sort of the is the assert paradigm that we've kind of had with us forever it's it's sometimes work it's well they often work so right it's very close to the assert paradigm and it's in the case of ifel it's the difference with ifel is it's built into the programming language i don't know of other languages where it's built in as a design construct now i haven't done much programming with ifel or no programming with ifel but i'm at least somewhat familiar with it and there's a construct i won't go into because anyone can google this where in the beginning of your function you can list basically some requirements that let you validate some inputs as they come in which is a good thing to do and make sure some things are within a range now a whole bunch of stuff to mention there though that you want to talk about i'm not going to let you keep my words going here this sort of construct we did manually so i don't know how actually maybe you didn't maybe you did so i spent a chunk of my early career working in the guts of windows and not the deep guts but the api level guts user mode apis and those were filled with on debug builds especially but not entirely asserts to make sure inputs were valid and expected and within a range those weren't all checked it was checked it what kind of word is checked those weren't all checked in the retail version but running the debug version would catch a lot of poor callers of windows apis some of those could be caught later anyway asserts just checking inputs that way this is but that's using the language or the function or adding like you see a lot of functions if i were to look at windows source code today a lot of those old apis the first several several lines are filled with error correction there was this is available within microsoft's implementation of c++ now but if you remember the annotations the source code annotations we use for prefix and prefast for native code at microsoft those are internal tools those source code annotations were a version of design by contract it's putting the annotations giving giving and again not in the compiler or in the in the runtime but at least giving an analysis engine an idea of how parameters were being used so they could do a static analysis of the contracts between functions makes sense yep and then i don't know how much you've done in c sharp uh have you ever used code contracts in c sharp uh i think so so code contracts in c sharp which are they don't let me write code anymore they say alan you're a good manager i guess but you certainly have to be a better manager than your encoder so you can't do it anymore but same thing um just do uh like contract dot requires and you put it's the requirement it's an an it looks like an annotation but it's a functional annotation a runtime annotation that makes sure that your contracts are between functions are are observed and enforced for example if i'm gonna the canonical example is i have a function called a banking function and i'm gonna call deposit or withdraw and you test it with the happy path values and everything works and then some smart guy like me comes along and decides to withdraw negative 500 and i get a little boost to my checking account because it's stupid but what we want to do instead is through some of my contract requires and again you could do this with code also and just reject it but what the contracts do is you can put in like contract requires uh withdrawal amount is greater greater than zero and it would just fail with it fail with the better error so it's it's i believe it's in the diagnostics library in c in c sharp or net that makes sense it's in some regards so one of the biggest complaints around using a search is people often use a search for flow control which is it well and the search don't help unless you have retail asserts built in they're not going to help when you actually run your code for customers right whereas the contract does seem to be a a better construct around uh flow control and sort of doing a search simultaneously that then does have that production benefit now in terms of you know the question around our thoughts on that as it relates to tdd right i think that's where you're going with the conversation eventually i have more examples to give but sure oh all right go ahead so i was going to say a little bit at unity um back home i'm not sure if it's still being used or not but back in the old days when i had a little qa team that i dissolved side note we were working quite a bit in part of our business with a very well documented and very cool tool called packed pact website is pact.io and it's just a pretty easy to use test framework that helps you build and enforce contracts within a server actually if i remember right it was one of the it actually wasn't someone in qa it was actually one of the developers driving this it was pretty cool it never it never really caught on enough i think to get a lot of usage but the people that used it were pretty happy with it the usage the availability is there and i think there's probably i know python has a design by contract library it is not a like iphone is the only language i know that it is built into the language and i actually looked i was surprised go didn't have this but it doesn't but most languages i believe probably have a plug-in a extension that would allow you to do something similar to design by contract if you if you wish and then packed of course is just kind of cool so now moving on to the rest of the question right so what what dbc is doing if i understand it correct is it's basically significantly tightening how it can be called right it's putting constraints around its inputs and its outputs tdd i'm trying to think it so it does seem like it's a different path to get there like it is let me summarize often a lot of whether it's tdd or just or unit testing without tdd right you're a chunk of your unit testing is making sure that your happy path works and that your and that some error cases are being handled correctly the error cases are automatically handled by the contract right you can't pass right you can't pass bad data it's caught by the contract right now the data parameters so i don't have experience with this one and i and it's funny because you mentioned iphone and and then when you mentioned it i just flashed back uh because i actually i have done programming in iphone in college uh and i i just looked up on the internet because i was actually surprised the thing's still around and apparently it is and back in college oh i hated this thing it was part of a class around object-oriented design and it would go through seven compilation cycles and each cycle was literally like an hour long like it its compilation phase was painfully slow i i i brought a real i got really good at looking at the code really carefully before i said compile and i also brought a book which i completed reading uh during that lab exercise hated that experience when i think about tdd like certainly one thing about tdd is building up your your your test suite but the angle like tdd isn't isn't just another way of getting your unit tests online the the whole purpose of tdd is is essentially the test first approach and the value add from the test first approach so on that front i'm not yet connecting the dots around let me let me let me connect some dots okay a lot of people say tdd isn't about testing and they're right it's not what i've found is when i or people i've worked with do use tdd as an approach to create their unit tests is they end up designing better code because they have to think about their design up front they have to think about what their code does in the first place right similarly if you if you are designing your contracts which are just asserts up front they're also making you think about the way that your code works as you're thinking about your parameters first i guess you could write it in a way where you could go back and add that contract at the end and then maybe it's not as value valuable so i would say it's the same brent is continually shoving his fingers in his mouth while we talk it's just it's um and now he's shoving all but one finger in the middle up his mouth so i would say they're similar if you're designing that if you're starting by designing that contract because then you're thinking about the design otherwise it's similar to unit testing or or other asserts again the value thing i'm curious about your opinion on is okay so the nice thing around tdd is at the end of the day you get a nicely formed architecture you get a much more maintainable architecture and the unit test suite yes and you also get confidence that when you make changes elsewhere that if that those tests continue to pass that you didn't break anything there's a level of security that comes from a good set of unit tests whether generated by tdd or not right which make it safer to change code faster the same is true if you have these contracts in place because you can't change if you change your contract to change underlying api you immediately know everything is broken and you immediately know it's not you know at compile time not at runtime i believe that i don't know ifill i haven't used iful i haven't even played with this so i don't know for sure but anyway that that's the idea okay so if the question is really do any of the languages we know have designed by contract or something like it and my answer is no i don't know of any that do by design but there's a bunch of there's a bunch of variations of it including the packed tool that you can use this and i think it's helpful i if i remember right there was someone at microsoft you can't remember when working on drivers in windows and they were looking at using a contract to enforce interaction between various components in the driver stack i'm not going to go into how windows drivers are built because i the lie remember it i'm trying to flush it out of my brain yeah i'm i'm saying so to me it definitely seemed that there's some value proposition with using bbc and i'll go i probably don't have enough experience on it but all right but my most relevant and recent experience is with packed which is a little bit of bolting it on at the end but still helpful still helpful especially when you're and packed is kind of made for the microservice world where you have a suite of microservices you want to make sure things are complaining well dude i don't know it i'm gonna you know we're gonna use our um we're gonna use all of our money that we make from ab testing it's gonna take a few years to get here but someday we're gonna fix your nose all right let me let me do another question about the uh quick from learning about the theory of constraints all right talks about the old saying a variation of you cannot manage what you cannot you can't manage what you can't measure if you're not measuring you're not managing that's from mcdonald's university this idea is simple you cannot apply theory of constraints or finding constraint bottlenecks if you are not measuring because the only measurement allows you to id quantity quality or both measurement requires instrumentation therefore you cannot measure what you don't instrument with you so far once the cicd pipeline is instrumented from end to end then one can measure which means one can find bottlenecks which means you can do something about them question what are the cicd pipeline components and how do you instrument them how do you improve your situation from those measurements i've done this a half a dozen times at least maybe a dozen maybe maybe a hundred yeah when i am using theory of constraints i'm usually doing it uh through through process organization and tickets on the combine board okay let's add let's answer this question instead yeah i think i think it's pretty valid so the idea is uh if from the moment code is from the moment code is pushed to main there's a pipeline that goes through before it's in people's running on people's computers in my world we like that time to be less than an hour like an hour at the most usually that's for a slow pipeline and the pieces of that pipeline are the build testing deployment to staging whatever extra testing is going to happen in that staging environment and we use a staging environment we're not as good at feature flags as i'd like to be and then that goes live the mistake teams can fall into is they'll go we're gonna spend a bunch of time to paralyze testing and make sure the testing phase is faster but if the testing phase is already only 30 seconds it's not your bottleneck so he's absolutely right you want to look at all those pieces and actually i should back up a step in the overall cycle like here's my code ready to go it has to be it's going to get reviewed and then built and deployed etc etc etc right now our slowest point is probably getting that code review turned around and we're going to measure all the pieces and i've built little line charts that show the relationship from beginning to end of how big each chunk is and i'm probably missing some pieces that's mainly it and sometimes there may be other pre-checks you may have static analysis there's a sonar cube uh pass that runs we have some security tools that run so we're going to break all those down every every single thing and in fact we use jenkins for most of our build pipeline and each of those is a separate function so it makes it pretty easy for us to measure exactly how long each little bit of that whole pipeline goes but overall uh theory of constraint says we want to mitigate uh whatever the biggest constraint is until it isn't the biggest constraint anymore and then repeat well for us the way it works is as i i hadn't thought about it before i started talking through it but everything's a job and or a function in jenkins and they all get their own like you can look at them in the even if we didn't measure if you want to know how long your particular build took you could look in the ui and see everything that happened along the way and how long it took and what we can do from my team overall is get those in aggregate so we can get a media a mean and median per repo per service and show what that is and show who's and maybe target like whoa this team's build takes an hour what the hell and go follow up with them and help them out but more often than not they'll come they'll come to me and our team and say hey our build's taking an hour do you have some people that can help we do the similar thing it's it's essentially that you don't like the way larry asks the question right kind of implies that instrument the cicb pipeline from end to end which kind of implies a degree of complexity that you may not actually need a lot of the times if you just go okay every everything through the flow has these these common phases identify your phases and then just measure starting end of each phase and the the time in between there's a lot of systems like if you recall in the old days there's like gauntlet systems that will go and do check games and parallelize right you also want to measure how long things if there's a queue you want to measure how long things are sitting in the queue right because all of this is is idle time that's blocking the thing from going out the door and even then like like what you described was what maybe five distinct different yeah there may be more from build the build just depends on what you're what you need to do with that build we may have extra checks you want to do there and it may be like one of the static analysis tools is really slow but you just i guess i the way i would instrument that so the tool is instrumented for us in a way but it'd be easy if not it'd be easy to add it i've done that before as well but if like one step was taken in ordinarily long you probably want to look at that step and maybe break it down so you can see which are the long parts of that long step to figure out where to focus like if the static analysis step i'll just pick that example was 45 seconds or a minute which is kind of a long time but maybe there's five tools that run there i will look and see if one of those was particularly slow or if if maybe i have a ton of stuff i want to run and they take a long time and i'm doing all sorts of lookups and it takes two minutes to run that maybe we can run it's it's running off a static code it's static analysis but that means we can run those in parallel if i need to if that's my bottleneck my team i i hired a new kid last tribuary who who sort of had experience on on in a in a build environment at his prior company then you wanted to learn to to to do data science work as i think i've told you before i i i do this i'm full stack right where one way to view it is we're a dev team that specializes in data science like i i operate services and one of the things i had to have him invent is essentially hey i need a i need a a model build process even though models aren't really built in sort of the same traditional fashion i need a model build process and what he did is he went to actually ado uh and they have a great facility there active data objects no what's ado azure dev ops azure devops oh by the way i saw a really cool talk from someone um from that team talking about it and even they in their public talk said it was a stupid name because it is and the fact that i say ado and then you're trying to you're trying to sneak that by me right geezers like us will go oh active data objects right which i actually i don't even think anyone uses anymore so he's strung it together through what they have is um uh so azure devops pipelines that so they have infrastructure in there and so we can independently draw together each individual step and as those steps execute or fail we automatically get all of that telemetry so that's that's one thing that's nice in terms of the infrared that i am on which is the the essentially the azure slash microsoft stuff that does those value propositions just now come to us for free so a lot of it is you don't even need to if you pick the right pipelining tech you you may already have these things and you don't need to go in and re-implement you just need to figure out okay where where is all the the telemetry being stored for my team's processes the short answer is you just measure the beginning and the end and then if it's not a number you like you find more things to measure in between there until you're measuring enough things in that system where you feel like you can find the bottlenecks or you may just decide that's as fast as we're going to get or that's all that's worthwhile the investment that's worthwhile yeah return on investment so i wanted the last question which uh again is going to involve some stuff we don't use a lot so it says a number of empirical studies using function points have shown that software defects first arrive in a design during initial requirement gathering and design specification writing so yes i think anecdotally we could say yeah a lot of times the design is wrong so the question is how can you use a theory of constraints instrumenting and measuring the non-technical specification creation part of your projects before any code is actually written and my answer here is i'm not sure that theory of constraints i'm not sure there's a bottleneck but before i lead you any farther how would you answer that question how would you use theory of constraints instrumenting and measure the non-technical specification creation part of your projects before any actual well so it's essentially how do we measure whether the non-technical specification part of the project is actually the bottleneck how do we determine that that i think that's kind of the point again i would say like obviously you can't do the best of my knowledge i mean there might be by now ways to instrument specs but again if we think of it as phases with a distinct start and end then then the typical azure process is you're measuring the cycle time between an idea the time it takes for an idea to get out to production okay now with that in mind if your team has like a deep technical requirements gathering phase uh that's a that's a requirement then you you just say okay well the start time is when the person starts writing this when they get it done and you you evaluate it against everything else in your pipeline like an mvp i spend a lot of time talking about this with some of my folks like an mvp um we want to get that out and actually use usage and things like that to sort of dry the requirements so the requirement phase in in my my team's projects are essentially hey what's the our best guess that we want to bootstrap the final project with right what's the minimum set of things that we want to get out so that we can then start bootstrapping and iterating and adjusting our direction and at the time it takes to to document that is like two to three times it takes to get the code out then then we got a problem right and maybe it's worth i'm actually going to just build on that and go off in a little slightly different direction but yeah i guess it depends if you're doing work where where it's a long waterfully cycle and you need you need the design approved upfront i've read the research and in projects like that and what i would agree with is for this measurement is this is true for projects where a big design upfront is required as i've mentioned before my teams all do p50 estimates mean they pick an estimate 50% probability and the reason for that is it is a sweet spot between over planning and over designing and just doing something it works out pretty well overall we can get stuff out faster but we get it out at a point where we can get feedback through instrumentation to understand if we've built the right thing so the design we do the biggest design practice we do is we get everyone very before we even like day one of the planning is get everyone aligned on the problem we're solving if everyone agrees like this is the problem we want to solve then honestly that's the bulk of our design yeah and then and someone comes out of like which implementation do we choose but everything focuses on what's the best way to solve this problem for the customer and then ask questions like how will we know if the customer is being successful with the solution and that that drives the instrumentation that we're going to add to make sure that that's being done we do that for a lot of internal tools as well as the external stuff we ship so and that's kind of it so in the world i live in and you for the large part we're delivering so often that i think we're actually i hate to do the snowflake argument but despite the research showing that defects arrive during design maybe it's the same thing i'm all over the place here but i think services are different i think when you if you are and not just services are different if you practice shipping frequently and are comfortable enough with your data and your ability to turn around that you can ship something that you know is not complete or you know is not ready but you're okay with that that gives you a huge competitive advantage right so that's it that's my design like we're shipping i can't tell you what we're shipping because it's not an ounce but my team is shipping something very soon we were going to soft launch it got some feedback from the design team said hey before you do it can you do this these 10 things make it pretty and i said yeah we'll do them we're going to actually do the top few and then we're going to ship and we'll we'll keep on changing things and gathering feedback so we want to get that feedback as well there's the eric reese i think quote that says show me a product that ship without any bugs i'll show you something that shipped too late so there's a balance there for sure like i want that feedback i want i want to be feedback driven and real-time feedback driven and i also know we can we can update this particular thing a dozen 15 20 times a day if we need to yeah i completely agree like part of his discussion in this is right it kind of presumes i don't know to me it feels a bit waterfally and i'm wondering i don't know if it's a waterfall it's it's it's formal it is formal right and if that's part of the if if the requirement gathering stuff right you you you determine when it's enters and exits the phase and and i would like to point out and maybe we're wrong i mean this reads as formal or waterfally which are i mean modern testing is informal and super adaptive so the fact that he's asking these questions and getting value from the stuff we're talking about and working in a different environment that's fantastic and maybe there's a lot more context larry has here but uh i'm actually super happy with the engagement and the questions i think it's really cool so if you are out there and you think yeah i like you guys are all right i guess you know allen's kind of a dick and brent breathes too loud but whatever if there's a question you want to ask just fire it away email twitter one of the three.slack.com whatever i'd like to have more of these kinds of questions because it makes us think makes us think about how what we're doing can apply to a bigger part of the bubble right and hopefully it's helpful i guess yeah this is i gotta tell you brent is now slumped with out of his chair all i see i don't even see his eyes i see like just his forehead his i get tired of his few strands of hair that has remaining and uh the top of his headphones we have to go we have to go back to doing the youtube live casts just so people can see what i have to deal with yeah it's i'll just tell everyone no matter what you think it is it's worse oh everyone should feel empathy for ellen we got like one minute and i'm gonna do a plug here i don't think we've talked have we talked since i did the oh my god we haven't since i did the ama with uh test bash home no actually we haven't talked oh we should have talked about that because it was good uh did i yeah so i i lost my let me tell you my future of automation and you won't get a chance to make a uh do i have it here limit let me why you're loading it up or thinking about it i'll say right miss chrispin right weighed in and and absolutely voiced that you were killing it on the discussion but yeah i totally forgot about that all right yeah yeah i totally forgot what they were but let's talk about that next time a little bit and in the meantime if you're a member uh a pro member of ministry of testing go check out the talk and send us some feedback and questions i was not um uncontroversial you were not but people thought people thought i made sense anyway which is great well so that's kind of our our thing like we're like we actually think we're not actually stating anything controversial we're just stating things that are well i was a little bit looking forward but uh anyway let's talk about it next time i gotta run so uh once again i am the one and only not the one and only i'm the uh i'm one of the world's allens um i am not see you later everybody bye
