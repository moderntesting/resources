All right, let's dance. Let's go. Let's move it. Let's shake it Welcome to a B testing podcast your modern testing podcast Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey everyone. It's Alan and Brent and we're here for episode 161 of the AB testing podcast as you can tell my voice is a little off today COVID You know, that's that's what I thought so I got back from Copenhagen had a little cough like a well, it's my turn I guess Got a piece. So I had symptoms. Alright, so I had a symptom had a cough and I went and got a PCR test right away It came back negative. I took a couple antigen tests and said including one just like an hour ago Looking down. It's still negative. So I think I may actually just have a cold. I have no other symptoms out of cough Yesterday and the day before my voice was really bad and this is kind of on the mend So, I don't know So maybe I have COVID and none of the tests will work on me and the tests give an amazing number as you know If you know anecdotally from I'm sure as I do that a lot of times they're negative even when someone has COVID So but I'm thinking not I think because for lots of reasons, but anyway, you have important insights to share No, I was just gonna say so So what happened to the team in Copenhagen? Were you were you yelling at them the entire trip? No, no the the opposite the opposite there was too many fun Conversations and hugging what happened what I think happens is this I have been in this office Which Brent can see nobody else can see pretty much non-stop for the last two years With very few human interactions. I think I lost any immunity that I had to anything else in the world I think anytime I venture outside my house and with people I'm probably going to catch something for a while Oh, so you're like the aliens and what was it war of the world? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah something like that something like that I think there's something like that going on so that you no longer have immunity against common human diseases. Well, I think I'll build it back up. I am planning to travel I'm gonna get back to a I don't know what to call it a Regular but infrequent travel. I'm gonna head down to San Francisco for a day Remember I used to do day trips San Francisco back in the before times. I'm gonna do another one coming up here Yeah, yeah, obviously not till my voice is better But maybe July sometime be a good good time frame and then heading to Montreal in September for a week need to visit the team out there and then probably head back to Copenhagen Maybe in October or probably probably November and I'll split it. I'll spend three days in Copenhagen Leaving on the third day and then so two and a half days in Copenhagen and then two full days in Helsinki I haven't visited that team in a while either and then Gosh, I got a visit Brighton too. So I'm pretty well spread out But the biggest pockets of people on my team are Copenhagen Helsinki and Brighton But I have a lot of my leader I have a couple leaders in San Francisco probably my top managers down there I want to go visit them see some of the team there a lot of the partners I work with are there So yeah, I just got to get out and see people it's not surprising but also surprising how Effective it is to see people face to face once in a while There's stuff you get done in a in a conversation in a room full of people that would take Half a dozen or ten zoom meetings to get through. I don't know why the other thing is You're gonna comment on that. I'll go on there's absolutely you got a comment there, right? It's interesting as as as As you know I've been coming into work for pretty much all but one month of the whole COVID start and and Certain things are changing that are annoying. I actually have an old-school commute now when I go back home Like 405 is is trash and I'm like, oh, yeah, I didn't didn't miss this And every now and again, right? I've gotten to a custom like I'm not gonna mess with the camera But I have a parking spot It's been my parking spot for two years and now people are taking you had you had no It's mine with nobody around probably even light security at Microsoft You could have put an A B testing logo in that spot along with Brent only I Still good. That's It's again But but let me but it's different like there's a difference like like some people need to leave work and be it like you Need to be in an office away from home to be productive. That's different It's the it's the seeing people part and there's two things that one is just having a proper debate and conversation in a large group is Just more effective in person in my experience But the other thing is that was really fun about the trip was in zoom or in your case teams All you ever talk about on that 30 minute 60 minute video call is work We net we just don't have enough of those non-work conversations, which are so important to get to know people and They're more Recharging then then work over zoom. Yeah, there's there is that there is that that's slow relationship building That you just can't I can't do over over a cough call It's exactly I had I guess it's now about three weeks ago. I Had I was in my office and I had someone knock on my door And I'm like, whoa What am I supposed to do? like And and she's like hi Brent I am random PM and I was told that you might be able to answer. I'm like, oh wow This is like I remember this when people would randomly stop by and interrupt you in your office I'm like, I'm doing that right now. Wow Right. It was weird now on the other side though. There are certain people That I realized I missed working with Individually like standing up at a white board. Yes in brainstorming brainstorming shit That was fun Yeah, yeah That that that sort of creative energy, which is really hard to do over over the cuff call that For me we've talked about this before my number one strength is ideation. I'm all about brainstorming Invite me to any friggin brainstorm event you want. I'm in because it's massively energizing, but it's just It's flat over At least I haven't I haven't The white board in zoo, I'm sure it's the same in teams They haven't figured out how to use it Well, yeah now and really to do those like right you kind of need a tablet and a pin device With that being connected to a shared whiteboard We have one of our conference rooms in Copenhagen, by the way has that has a a touchscreen that you can draw on And it shows up in the whiteboard for zoom which which kind of works But it worked better if everybody had one and not just all the people in the conference room It was also the first time I had a lot of meetings where like it's different when everybody's on zoom What's a little weird? I think on both ends is when you have 10 people in one room on zoom and then 10 other people all on zoom like like individually There's a weird meeting dynamic when everyone's in this hybrid world where everyone's not remote I've experienced that same thing as well and as much one of the benefits of This conference call world is it was a great equalizer the remote people Didn't feel left out and it was because Hallway chatter you can't really call into hallway chatter. Of course the problem is it's a great equalizer because it's It's focused on the least common denominator, which is not something I've ever really been Abort on you don't you don't equalize everyone by bringing the highest people down. You bring the lower people up. It's weird We'll never gonna get and I'm okay with this. We're never gonna get to a world where 90% of all of us are back in the office again, just just not gonna happen but I think we need to get better at Figuring out what this hybrid world looks like like I'm going to the office two days a week now So I'm doing some of my one-on-ones in person. I actually have Two direct reports in Bellevue now weird, right? No, I thought you've always had no I didn't for a while I didn't have any team members in Bellevue. Now. I have two direct reports. We hired a director of docks and my Internationalization lead is in Bellevue. That was the consequence of your last Last move right? It's too hard to keep track. It's kind of like a never-ending carousel of shifting Gotcha. Anyway, um, no, you know some insights there good to be back. Sorry about my voice I think they're wondering who is on the podcast with Brent this week. Who is this guy? He sounds pretty smart. Maybe he should replace Alan speaking of I don't know about smart But you got the voice growl there you definitely sound sexy. Well, there's a it's a fine line between sexy and smart I think that's a lot of a lot of famous philosophers have said that Well, then there's hope for me yet. Hey, I keep on digging on Microsoft I'm gonna do it really quick here for a second But then all right I want to talk about like then you do some things that I like which freaks me out So I want to one quick dig is I had to spend some time with the Windows machine this week for the first time in a long Time and I am so glad we're on two tracks because Brent is like slurping coffee Anyway, so I had to spend some time on a Windows machine had to troubleshoot my daughter's machine brand new machine Came with Windows 11 installed could not connect to the internet Wi-Fi card is working. It's connected to my internal network. It can't connect to the internet Doesn't have an IP address did not get an IP address from my router. Well, maybe my router screwed up I'll make a hot spot on my phone. Nope. Can't get one from there either I download drivers to a USB stick for my Mac and move them over I install those I go through a bunch of Unbinding rebinding things random solutions on the internet People have asked had this similar problem on several different computers and they've all tried these different things which is bad enough and The the error messages from Windows are I hope you realize this are I know you don't work on Windows are pretty horrible I forgot how horrible they were you don't like 0 X e 8 9 4 C 0 0 8 I actually and then oh gosh my wife's computer is blue screening, but they've now hidden I used to be able to kind of half debug from the blue screen what was going on and know what to go look at Now it's all hidden from you because that's more user friendly God It's like in trying to make things friendly to screw it all up. Anyway, networks not working I have looked at everything to try and make this work. The internet is no help. It's just broken So I go in old school. I get to the the the network properties dialogue Which coincidentally is unchanged pretty much from when I used to test that in Windows 95 But anyway, I go through there and I go I'm just looking at for something. I don't know what it was something Yeah, a red a red bang someplace. Anyway, there were no red bangs. Everything was working correctly It gets to my router wouldn't get an IP address. So a Little voice in my head just something telling me it's probably gonna be the dumbest thing ever. It's Microsoft It's got to be something stupid. So I disabled IP v6 I unbound IP v6 from the network card boom on the network in a second No explanation. I'm sure I mean by the time she needs a daughter's computer by the time she needs IP v6 I'm sure there'll be some patch for it that makes it work. But that kind of shit infuriates me. So Windows is a steaming pile of crap. However, when you tell me Satya is doing good stuff and I go near yeah Whatever you're actually right Like I see all kinds of great stuff coming from and the latest is and I want to talk about this a little bit I think it's really important. I think every company should do this is is Going to post salary ranges with jobs And there's a couple things I want to as we've helped people adapt to modern testing I think I have a few tips on how to help people and help people adapt to Salary ranges offer with jobs because there are a few traps there. Did you know about this? It's announced internally to see the news on this. Yeah. No, I know about this. Okay. I think it's pretty cool A lot of fairness comes out of this What do you think? Before I start with them, what do you think some of the traps are with that? I will say I Supported but mostly from a principal standpoint Transparency and data versus Invisibility and subjectivity I'm always gonna pick transparency and data. I don't know Why they're doing this move what problem it solves And I guess time will will bear it out I think I think it solves the problem of fairness that a lot of people are worried about I think people feel often like they're low-balled for a job Which I working, you know, I they happen. I don't know But it gives you a range now. I think it's good I think all companies should do it, but there are some traps in a job search. So what happens if Okay, I've posted a job level n we'll just make up a number level n and the salary range is between 135 and 185 You love the job description print you think this is a job I want But you'd expect to get paid more. Do you just now? What do you do now? It's like the difference is You may not apply if that salary range is too low for you. I think that's fair to do, right? Right on the other hand think back to the days when maybe you looked at I think I don't if you ever looked at the Internal job site at Microsoft and think people just came and got you and and and recruited you but I've done both Often you'd look at a level higher than you were Because something you stretch into right I think the thing to keep in mind in that range 135 185 Maybe I would just again transparency. I would be upfront just I would just contact the company say I love this role I really want to do it. I think I can do more than here and my salary requirements are higher and Maybe they'd up level the job like today often will in the background someone comes in and they're awesome They've interviewed for a job. We haven't shared the salary range, but we up level the job in the background or to give them a fair offer Correct. Yes And the same thing can happen here's where it gets weird because the same thing could happen the other way say you a lot of People apply for jobs are not They're not qualified for it, right? But I hire humble hungry and smart if you have the right attitude You have a desire to learn and I can tell you make good decisions I know you're gonna learn quickly on the job. I want to be able to I guess it just because matter of transparency I say look, I can't bring you in at level N I really want to hire you at level n minus 1 and here's why and here's the things you need to do and Your and your salary may not fit in that range I guess it just forces me to be transparent in that range too, but I guess the point I want to make is in Publishing those salary ranges I think people both below and above that salary range should apply anyway and just be Transparent about what they want. I don't think when a company posts a salary range with a job Can we post a job and same as Microsoft you post a level a job at a level? You have a certain expectation of what you want out of that role You may hire someone who's a little less than that or a little more than that because they're the right fit for the team, too Right the one thing about salary ranges that I do think will help in the fullness of time is Essentially to sort of level set expectations each of the big companies in in Fang I guess it's now main the empty MS for meta not right Microsoft They don't get to be fang No, actually so so he he updated it and Microsoft is now in the list I think they're calling it mama now. Oh my god. Yeah, whatever and Netflix got dropped the Anyway, my point is you go when you find out Oh Google's Google's got a perfect role for me. That's an L7 And I'm like, okay, well, what the hell's an L7? right is so for me in my roles Where where I might look into I want to know is this an executive position or not as an example Right and in unlike you I Will like the big money, but I don't want the executive position Now it might depend on the the company Right. It's one of the things I love about my job right now I have broad scope but I get to sit in the type of role that that I love which is the ground level Manager and so that kind of gives me a sense of okay What would be the role expectations above and beyond what they're communicating here, right? If it's an executive Okay, you're gonna be spending your whole day in meetings and and This is where it levels FYI can help What is that levels on FYI website where you can compare levels between companies? Fan that'll help it figure it out Yeah, I I honestly don't think I will ever I think when I leave this company Well things could change I'm in the best job I've ever had I don't I don't see any reason to To move. Yeah, if you enjoy your work and your manager is not an asshole I would keep doing it, you know, I can tease I can you know complain about windows But that's it autonomy mastery and purpose if you feel like your work matters and you enjoy it and you're you Given the freedom to do it in a way that makes sense and you balance that with accountability, of course And you have the skills you need just keep rolling. That's the gravy train right, no, it's Chocked full of happy sauce, right? There's a couple other things that Microsoft is doing and I'm wondering Wonder if you so there's another one so like the equity angle on terms of posting Salaries that's an interesting angle. I hadn't thought about before I think there's probably gonna be pros pros and cons I think people end up doing a lot of comparing between companies and which is gonna be bad at first they'd be good in the long run because God, you know, this could go all the way from chaos to Companies calibrating their their you know in it, you know indirectly calibrating their job descriptions together Well, I think that for sure is gonna happen. Like I have no idea what what this will do in terms of our competitors Right as you know Companies in fangs slash mama They're constantly stealing employees from each other, right? So I don't know if that's gonna make that easier harder what that's gonna do right from a from a negotiation standpoint Well, it'll change something but change doesn't necessarily mean good or bad now Microsoft getting rid of the non-disclosure agreement I'd love to see more details on that one in general what I understand of it is Positive and you don't have to answer this what might take from the outside after me leaving and going through it is I think it's just too hard to enforce Why bother? No, so I don't know that they're going to do so that's the thing. I'm like, okay, is this all up? Because there's certain clauses in your in your in your NDA. I think that they're striking Right. It's as for example if if you report to so you had this right you couldn't You couldn't badmouth your old team for a year because that was part of your NDA. Yeah, I did anyway What the hell see they can they don't enforce it whereas technical IP Even though they don't enforce it It's still probably wiser to keep that NDA there because once it's discovered if it is Important then they still have action that can take the other move that's happening is a move. I Don't like So Microsoft is going through We've I don't know how long how long it's been since you've been on campus Long time the the big soccer field Next to building 16. Yes, that's gone I used to play soccer there like in the old days. I will play soccer there twice a week at noon Yeah, it's a big parking garage now and Building with the soccer field on top. No building buildings one through four gone With an indoor soccer rink rink soccer's in the bottom floor again. No And buildings one through four gone. Yeah, so if I I they were I think they were like getting ready to tear them down When I was leaving they've turned them down. They built them back up and they probably probably taller than two stories down Way taller. I think they're I'm not in any place where I could see him, but I believe five to six floors All right, so you don't like this change where is this going? No, so they're putting in they redesigned them to all be open space Which again, I think we talked about this before in the computer science industry There's multiple studies that show that that is Anti-productive not productive, but they're now moving it as a response to covid They're now moving at one level further and that is You don't even have a desk anymore. So when you come in You you reserve a desk and that's your desk for that day Yeah That's what I do. It'll work over time. I just I just want to see studies Like I like that makes the company so friggin sterile Like I don't even have a place to to put a picture of my family anymore. There's no personalization Whatever put it on your phone like the rest of us. I Do you get your phone into a little picture frame? Little digital PF. All right, I guess you're not a board on Well, humans are hugely adaptable and will adapt to that but doesn't mean What I want to see is these decisions as they align to key business criteria above and beyond the short-sighted view of Hey, we need to hire another 10,000 people. Where do we put them? In right now I look around it in my building as I just talked about Microsoft's been open for business since the big the end of March Well, this goes back to what I was saying before we're never gonna go back to I don't think we're ever gonna go back to You know 90 plus percent of the people going in five days a week. I think Unity have stopped a lot of their office expansion even like the number of people Associated with an office in many cases far exceeds the capacity of that office But well, I guess it's a problem we can solve when we get there But for today, there's today. There's plenty of room Yeah, the thing I see this thing I see as a beginning trend and I don't know if Unity is seeing this I see a beginning trend of I'll just call it remote ism as a as a requirement for the job I think that's one thing people learn from Kobe is hey, I can still get my job done no matter where I am Yes, and no and here's an I want to move on to another topic here But I want to there's something I've noticed here one is people can do their job from home But also there's value as I talked to earlier in that human interaction And what I worry about is there are people that? Need to see people they need to be in an office once in a while who don't know they need to be in an office Once in a while, I will tell you in terms of so you and I have worked together for a while, right? The You know about Colosso, for example, one of the key things around around Colosso Is that it helps to build a stronger team? Okay, and I will say Covid has kind of shattered that But it's it's harder for the team to become a team and be a team in that Because you need the members of your team to create multiple different connections with the other members of the team I can force it in some regards. I can set the stage and say hey Alan this week You're going to pair program with Bob and next week you're going to pair pair program with Susan and etc But that that whole knowledge That that organic knowledge sharing Knowledge sharing is the consequence Now in some regards remote work is basically saying hey, I'm going to be a siloist and I'm going to stay that way Or at least that would be my fear of it if that happens. I'm I'll just be fundamentally against it. All right Well, yeah, I I think As in all things the answer is it depends and it's a balance I want to move on because there are a couple of the topics here today and One is so we talked last time about Ken Johnston one of the authors of Howie Tussoff or Microsoft going to Ford And he's all over posting on LinkedIn, which is that's nothing to do with LinkedIn has become nothing what it was designed to be but whatever but he's posting pictures of his electric Ford truck He's been driving around. He's very excited and then he is working On the test team on the dedicated siloed s debt team and He did a couple other things at Microsoft after that and then retired I think he was in retirement and apparently in a cryogenic tube For about 15 maybe 20 years Basically, you know, I was working on a test team For about 15 maybe 20 years Uh based on the mail he sent He said I'm gonna read the I know I know he won't listen to the podcast and I think it says educational and like i'll give you the Whole email conversation. I want to talk about this thing. It's interesting He says I got pulled into this madhouse and have not had this much fun Pissing people off in a long time Point number one is why why are we why are we pissing people off? Why don't we work together then it gets better he says Startingly, there is pretty much no software dev test knowledge here nor any consistent automation Trying to bring in the concept of an s debt who makes devs cry And I thought oh man I I feel so 1999 right now It's not worse And uh, he's you know trying to recruit me to come be an s debt on his team He says maybe you write how we test software at ford and uh Still No, they found that Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait ford Yeah So he's he's that ford with ken johnson Two of my previous managers are now at ford Which I have absolutely no interest in Are they somehow related to each other? No Oh my god, anyway, I wrote back as you and I brought up I said my views on testing have changed with the industry research shows for example that automated tests owned by developers have a high correlation with Quality whereas automation owned by a separate team has no correlation with quality. So I focus a lot on helping Developers test better and on giving them better development and analysis tools so they can move faster with higher quality I imagine the process would vary in the automotive industry But and there may even be regulations blah blah blah I'm happy in the world where shipping a few dozen times a day is the norm We're the only bugs that reach production or bugs that can't feasibly cop before release The slow shipping world is something i'm happy to leave behind. So i'll see what his response is to that So We talked last time. I don't want to spend I want to move on from this before too long but This is goes into what we talked about in the last podcast. There's this You know, there's different bubbles of where people live and our next topic is going to talk about that some more but This idea of and this one thing I want to hit on is this idea of an adversarial connection between different parts of the team It's so funny because you know, we lived that world a long long time ago, but it seems so foreign and wrong to me like yeah You know, it's weird how the how it like I I used to be that person But now it's like we need to collaborate work together the more connected we are the better we're going to do And it's like it's weird what you know a decade and a half will do to you Yeah, it you you try things out you learn right and To me, I just I just think of that and I go Wow, how did they isolate? Because I I don't think we're in the bubble anymore as we talked about before drink I I'm drinking tea I think it's not helping if not taking the edge off I think the perspective that we we have is far more mainstream and and that the the traditionalist point of view Is is now What do they call it the lagers? right, it's Certainly, it's going to be still there Like as I bring up as an example all the time you can still go and find jobs doing cobalt programming Absolutely Right, and I can tell from the email that comes to my inbox every day that I can still go get a job as an estet Because I get enough job offer. Well if I can pass the interview, but you know, yeah I don't understand that why that's the case like you're linked in like why would anyone find you on linkedin and offer you an estet job? Because i've been an estet in the past. I need to remove estet from Everything in my profile. Yeah, but it says vp of engineering on the bloody thing. Why would it? Oh, hey brent. Here's a news flash News flash are you ready for is it now? Yeah, some people are dumb. I am aware of this sadly um Statistically half of the people have a lower than average iq Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say you don't have that quite right but yeah, I fixed it because I adapt So yes, I want to you know, that's one bubble and i'm i'm if anybody from unity is listening. I have negative Interest zero to negative interest in joining forward because um, unless you all want to get rid of me you can let me know When I also go to copenhagen, it's awkward because I bet nobody on your team listens to the podcast I have people in my organization that listen to the podcast. Hi everyone And it's a little awkward for me because I i'm just so anyway, whatever I'm glad you find me interesting This is how people find out what i'm up to how they get to know me better without spending time with me My my my team do not listen to the podcast or at least they don't you should require it anyway, uh, Our our buddy conference gerald who was in an abt 343 a while back But I used to do those in fact if you want to be on if you want to like spend 30 minutes with me on a podcast Ping me alan page on twitter And we can set up some time. I'll do a little interview show with you when my voice is better but uh connor's presenting at romanian testing days and I think we is i've actually i've Again, this is again the bubble, but this is somebody who I i've worked with them respect that still is not quite In line with all the principles and that's okay We out when people want to debate the principles we say welcome to the conversation and it's okay We want to be challenged. We want it to you know, make it real for you but but but Connor is in line connor is oh very much in line, but there was a reply someone took a picture of Talking about the ab testing logo principles. He says Modern testing principles being mentioned by connor I still do not agree with alan page on principle seven. They never Mentioned you it's always me good and bad. It's always me. Anyway, I still did not agree with alan page on principle seven Not everybody contest which is right. Exactly. Which is not exactly principle seven says Everybody can click around this wait, let me finish. Let me finish Let me not finish go on brent. Okay. Thank you. Number one you look at the picture and This is this is this is your short form of the principles. I you know what I stand corrected It's not It's not mine. Now. I I still agree everyone can test like But my version of principle seven was fundamentally different. I kind of like yours better, but mine was Uh, some of them lines of execute fearlessly Right. It's it's like that's too far abstract from the original It's the but then if you think about principle seven It's we're basically need to do this Even because it's the right thing to do even though it may have these consequences Yeah, and for those that haven't read the principles, they're on modern testing not over but principle seven Basically is the one that says you may get so good at producing quality software You may not need dedicated testers anymore and by everybody here's where it's the the semantics and get lost I don't mean everybody in the world Everybody on the software team Yes I have taught so many developers to be good testers. That is far beyond an exception For a developer to be a good tester. They're not all developers are great testers. Some are okay but Many developers i've worked with have become better testers than most testers. I know Yeah in principle Actually, you know what? You're short for him It's not I get it. I get it. It's not it's it's I see what he did there and it's stolen from me It's not exactly fair and it does I see where I see where it triggered but also Out of context from someone who's context driven a little bit weird, but it's okay. I love you but The principle does not diminish the testing craft Which is this final sentence there and even as written it does not diminish the testing craft No, and I was thinking about that earlier today number one Principle seven says we expand the testing abilities and know-how across the team okay, so seven You call it everyone can test A better one. It's too long, but it might be everyone Can learn to test or something like that? Right it's but that that softens it to regard it. I don't want to brainstorm I think this is one more i'm okay having everybody contest on the slide everyone can test on the slide But you have to add some context in the talk and I wasn't at conner's talk No, do I have a recording so I can't tell if he said that but as written it's like I could see why it would trigger but but again contextually we're saying that It should be the goal of your team to get a whole team to get better at testing I do not I don't care how good of a tester you are. I don't care if you are You know the embodiment of the craft of software testing and you're like that You're like your neil plugged into the matrix on software testing You know everything if you're the only tester on that team, you are a bottleneck So this is the thing it's like it diminishes if you're the only person doing testing you're a bottleneck I'm I'm I'm entering into rantville Right this principle diminishes the testing craft. No, it does not this this principle Increases the testing craft It is basically saying Like they're interpreting it as oh testing something anyone can do That is literally what is written there, right? But the way you're saying it is Testing is not on this high ivory tower testing is something Anyone can do correct So it's not It's not diminishing it in my view. It is strengthening it. Yes now more ideas to the party. It's strengthening You're absolutely right. What diminishes the testing craft? Is the testers that hold on to traditionalist? Approaches with white knuckles. That's what diminishes it They they sitting in their stupid codependency safety net loops Sitting there patting themselves in the back not realizing that at lunch The devs sit and talk and go. I can't believe I got this guy to do this fucking work for me right, it's like the as I've mentioned before My humble opinion is that in the old? traditionalist view of testing Our number one value proposition was to be the scapegoat for the orc. Absolutely Oh, I can tell you by the times like a bug was found after release and and the and this actual same test manager I'm talking about and I Sat in a room and got yelled at by the dev manager. Oh, yeah. Yeah I've told you a story before where um uh Where I had a dev lead come to me And this was in the middle of our trend. This was in the middle of microsoft transition I had I had joined the team after the transition And I was set up to partner with them To do some work. I wasn't a dev but I wasn't a test in this role And they came to me and said Hey, why wasn't this bug found before? And I looked at her and I said well, I I don't know um If if if you really don't know then you know, let's pull up your unit test suite and let's figure it out Basically, I very little little passive aggressive. Uh, I very passive aggressive go Like why are you coming and yelling at me about what's something that is clearly your problem? Everything we've talked about here on I I totally agree with and actually connor geyser as well. I want to just talk a little bit about Um, I again, I haven't seen his talk yet Uh, but he was interviewed about it a little bit for info queue And I want to share a little bit of that article because I think it's a really good How to deaden him a really good grasp of extension enhancement of modern testing He talks about uh, the three S's and the three C's and he wants testers to move Toward the three C's and away from the three S's And the three S's so these are the things testers are moving away from we've already talked about first one's a safety net Stop being the safety net The next one is solo that solo knowledge that that single point of failure again neo I know everything about testing. I know the product only I can make this work moving away from that towards collaboration And then being static this is holding on with white knuckles be adaptable Embrace change is what we talked about in the very first couple a b testing podcast No, we've actually talked about all three of these in this episode. We have we have because they're all here So anyway, these are this is but it sums up everything we've talked about So yeah, these things move away from those testers move on stop being a safety net stop being a single point of failure Adapt and change stop holding on and the three C's We've also talked about coaching I have coached developers hundreds now maybe thousands to do better testing Principle seven collaborating working together not making devs cry working with them. We're on the same team We're trying to make quality software together Principle four And change which is principle three Uh, yeah principle three And he says uh, Connor says that testers are often the training wheels for the team Which are like we need to thinking about how can we remove the training wheels? This is really principle seven's about how do we get the training wheels off the team so it can be fully independent? In producing quality software and there's some other really great terms and there it brings up accelerate which is always a way to get to my heart but really Fantastic insights. I mean this is somebody who gets it and gets what it means I mean some people probably look at the principles they go. Oh, yeah, okay And some people look at them and go. Oh, I hate all of these. These are dumb. They're not in fact someone on uh, linkedin said hey I read these And they're not very modern and they're not about testing either and I know they say that but still it's like um What conversation are we having anyway? Uh, connor just just nailed it. He nailed the essence of Of why we think about this stuff and the principles just came it isn't like we decided Hey, we're gonna write some principles and figure out what they mean We just tried to capture so the principles God, when did we first start talking about those in the 70s 80s? I mean episode numbers. Do you remember? Uh, maybe it was earlier good. We started going I think 87 was our deep dive. Oh my gosh, so It's a summary of like everything we have been talking about like what are how can we? Take everything we've been talking about and sum it up into some things that are communicable communicatable And that's where they came from All models are wrong. Some are useful. These are helpful uh, and I think Anything you disagree with look at both sides. Anyway, go ahead brent no, and and connor even in the the thread All right, one of the things we talk about here connor Really has simultaneously represents our content very well and he's actually morphed it into his own version that is is Fantastic, right? He's in that same twitter feed. He hashtag healthy discussion, right? That's that's the whole point. Yeah of this is to encourage a collaboration even as Even on the the principles, right? I was thinking about Right that same person that you just said when we say it's not about modern it's not about testing Right. Why did we give this name? Well the original reason is because it was a particular set of people we wanted to target and that was one of the thoughts I had on On the problem nowadays when this came out We were we were facing a community of testers That for whatever reason saw change was on the wind right and microsoft had gone through it Part of this was to attract the attention of testers and get people to understand No, there is this is not a negative. This is absolutely a positive Like don't fight this change, you know swim with the current um But it does occurred to me People coming into the test industry now who may not Have a view like the drama around these changes around testing that's dramatically gone down Like the last news report I heard was like salesforce Dropping all of their testers and that was like five years ago. Yeah And also worth mentioning and we should really post these somewhere. Maybe i'll put them on modern testing org, but That'd be a great place ago. We yeah, shut up We um, I remember do you remember when we kind of rewrote and I wrote them down one thing I posted in our slack Yes, um the dev the the modern testing principles that don't include It's about the team not about testing I don't know if they're modern testing principles 2.0 or some other principles, but we did think I mean most of them stayed the same But we did things like change principle 7 2 we expand abilities and know-how across the team understanding This may reduce or or eliminate the need for dedicated specialists, which is true for anything Like you're gonna hire like give the example from from my work often teams ask me across unity Hey, we need to hire a dev ops engineers for our team Can you help me with the job wreck? I go hold on Why are you hiring a specialist for your team? I said well, we need to know how to deploy this stuff and blah blah blah I said we have you build it you run a culture my team Gives you a good paved road to make that easy and they'll give you everything you need to get it up and running but In the long run When you have a specialist you're going to be in trouble like what if they go on vacation and you rely on them for everything Oh, well, we'll hire two Okay Let's let we're gonna need to sit down. This is now going. Yeah But you don't you don't appear to be learning from the speech replace tester with dev ops It's And it's the exact same years ago as this behind me for now dev said well I don't know anything about testing can't figure it out now. They're telling me. I don't know anything about kubernetes So it's okay. We're gonna teach you it's not that hard and I Fully believe like we can't scale and give everybody their own little and imagine the chaos that would happen If I we had 200 Embedded dev ops engineers around the company air quote because dev ops is a culture not a role, you know infrastructure people Implementing various flavors and different things and in different ways with no consistency across it would be an absolute mess But specialists you could hire a database specialist a perp or perf specialist Sometimes you want to do that, but you want a generalizing specialist so that they're not a bottleneck for the team and so they Don't when they work themselves out of a job, which all of us should be doing, you know frequently They have other things they can do I I think specialists are fantastic For sort sort of outside in consulting Unless you have a large enough company, it doesn't make sense to to have it in your organization I've had similar similar issues like I had a I had a pm Come to me About a year ago and he checks in every three months to see if i've changed my mind. He's like brit I am going to get you eight heads I'm like, okay neat right that would tremendously grow my team and tremendously grow the the type of scenarios and impact my team could have why and it's like oh well, so we have all of this data stuff and We want you to use these eight heads to build us a data warehouse And a bunch of power bi dashboards and and data movers Why? Why? Because it's too hard for pm to do and I said I see Thank you for your offer. Uh, I'm I'm going to kindly reject it and they're like Like like they were surprised. They really thought like oh I could get you eight heads like that, dude And i'm like, yeah, no i'm not building There's no career for full-time power bi builders in my role Right. I'm just like no like hire a vendor team manage it tell them to do your stuff. Right? Like Like it's just that simple now and I said However, if you want to solve your your actual problem Right instead of building a data safety net then i'm open to talk and He of course has clarity and I said your actual problem is The pm role is changing and you just told me your Your pm organization doesn't have the basic Skills to thrive in the new world every pm should be able to build their own power bi report to judge the success of their features Power bi is not that hard and if your pms don't understand the data Then I'm gonna i'm gonna tell you they're producing incomplete features Yep, specialization bad Yep. All right, man. I gotta go rest my voice. I've had about all I can take for the day All right Oh, maybe in post-production I can Like there's like some fancy filter I can use to fix my voice Ooh auto tune awesome No Go please go go uh, I swear by this gargle with with salt water and then And then find some nice honey to Soak your throat in and there I mean the stuff made by bees But you could choose any version of honey that you would desire. All right, I think Mine comes in a bot my honey. I think it's in a body that says quervo Okay. Yep That may work. I'll try some of that If you if you do enough of that, yes, I can guarantee you the pain will go away There's no pain. There's absolutely zero pain I feel 100 fine. I just lost my voice a little bit of a cough Gotcha All right. That is it for this time. We'll see you next time on the next episode of Ba ab testing ba ab testing. Yes Bye Bye all
