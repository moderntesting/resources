Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey Brent yeah how's it going what's up man that's a hard question just chillin just chillin hey so I want to apologize in front of all of our fans we don't have any fans the people that somehow listen to us while they're cleaning their toilets we skipped a week because I was out hiking last weekend and I forgot to let Brent know so sorry about that no we're gonna pick it up here gonna go out again next weekend I did a little trip I was gonna do like 75 miles through the cascades but my water filter broke and it was hot and there weren't enough people for me to mooch water off of so I ended up bailing about halfway through probably the right choice still kind of bum but I will get out and do it again but you know so the trip we did you respond to my texts while you were out in the middle of nowhere no I was I was actually on my way back from being being extracted I left on Wednesday but Friday afternoon I said you know what the smart thing to do the responsible thing to do is for me to get myself out of the danger zone so I did yeah and that's we did that so Brent's got a fancy new microphone yes and so we're hoping came with so let us let us know in the copious amounts of fan mail we get what you all think of that and here we are again yeah I'm wearing a little Japanese motorcycle shirt and Brent's wearing a better shirt a mighty Thor says the mighty dad but it's Thor and I'm not Thor not Liam heans were Hemsworth Thor Thor for like the old comic book and now he's awkwardly rubbing his chest I'm not really into it anymore it's impressive that you could tell immediately that it was Thor and not you know because most look at you go wow how narcissist are you because it's you on your yeah an image of my double game yeah I'm like no it's actually Thor yeah well all right well anyway that's going on Wow the heat it was hot it was hot and the hot was really bad this week I've been working this is the first time I've worked in my office like in a while because I've been working downstairs because downstairs is about 10 degrees cooler but it's fine it's comfortable in here it's yeah but it's such minors all winter long right it's cold it's wet it's rainy and then oh it's hot your your your background is different today I just now know that cuz I'm still in my I'm still in my office I'm sitting I have a avenue poster I got a poster of the Pacific Crest Trail yeah I was like California on that I mean that's yeah as California Oregon and Washington yeah so yeah okay I got a couple topics today but anything else is super exciting you want to share but if I said super exciting like three times now I'm kind of freaking myself out what do you got I didn't know that I was supposed to become no nothing exciting all right okay boring AF since the last time the I have a larger topic but I found the new topic to talk about I kind of need to bounce off of you there was an article just came out in August type pickers today about open AI and their plans to build Skynet as you know about this so you we've talked on the podcast before about AGI's and how we're perhaps slightly excited and slightly afraid of this phenomenon happening there's this Bloomberg list of the open AI's five stages of artificial intelligence which are chatbots which we have today those are nice those are fun nice little partners talked about them level two are reasoners human level solving problem solving which they equate to a doctorate level person without all the tools to go get access to just like a doctorate level smartness for reasoning level three are agents and systems that can take actions level four our innovators AI that can aid an invention and level five our organizations AI that can do the work of an organization aka Skynet so what they're saying is reports say that they have level two kind of on the edge of existing oh it's gonna it's gonna snowball from there that's that's both the exciting and the scary part how do you feel about that oh I I despise it immensely what do we what's what's the the ethical action we should all take as this quest towards pure AI despite everything we've seen in the movies continues I don't know what we can take like the only thing we can do anything I can think of like the EU is doing regulation on this one right it and that is something that needs to be solved well before it flips over to that bar you mentioned on level two yeah right so level one is what AI a chatbots okay level two are the human problem solvers the doctorate level people and then it goes to level three agents and systems that can take actions for our AI that can aid an invention and five is AI that can do the work of an organization okay so when I look at these these levels I'm trying to sort of take my knowledge and kind of reverse engineer like each of the faces because I've given these stories and like I don't know if I mentioned that on podcast I recently went to my daughter's middle school and and talked about AI and the stuff and the way I talk about AI in particular is it's it's essentially it memorized it has it has things memorized right it can learn it but it memorizes it doesn't know anything LLM right can pass the Turing test but it doesn't know anything when I look at and that's kind of what they're saying level one is right except it right level one in this case is doesn't know anything but passes the Turing test like you can't tell the difference that's sort of kind of right level two means a basic problem-solving ability that would be comparable to a PhD level I look at that and I go okay are they gonna further when problem-solving is a very generic term right it doesn't necessarily mean math it means sort of the ability to apply tools and part of me goes okay that's kind of my definition of a of an AGI right there but it could still be just memorization right it it's more right you can see if you know how all of them work today you can kind of see the evolution here right what I'm worried about is one ethically the crap that can happen I'm worried about the power the compute power required for these different levels of things until these things start inventing like we need the the AI is to begin to invent faster computing so they can actually run and when they do they get scarier but level on a level three right that just means it's memorized you right person personalization right the the practical point I want to get to I'm curious on your opinion on in this and don't worry listeners not spending the whole podcast on this we're gonna make a 180 here in a moment or maybe a was three 540 we're gonna spin all the way around get a little dizzy and come back practically people are spending millions and probably billions of dollars across the software industry investing in air quote AI solutions to solve their problems do a lot of those problems become obsolete or easier to solve or solve in completely better ways once you graduate from one level to another every single time you know the problems become different like if we look at like when I look at their levels and I'm reading your article and it says open AI has previously defined AGI is a highly adamant system that can outperform humans on a majority of economically valuable tasks like I don't know that the economically valuable task thing is important but I look at their levels and what they define as level five I mean that's that that to me is well beyond AGI that is nearing ASI um which so there's AGI ASI we're all gonna die that the right order yeah if an ASI exists we don't know if we're all gonna die but the way I simplify right an AI is a parrot an AGI is kind of like a human and an ASI is God okay and we're all gonna die well if God is benign no we won't God's a computer powered by Nvidia well more than one computer and certainly more than one Nvidia chip yeah it's all a computer the yeah this is level four these the system can create new innovations right that definitely is AGI in my definition but if they make because the the one thing that humans can do they quote-unquote the AI's can't is create right until they can right and yeah if I I look at this and quite honestly I'll just look you straight in the eyes and say thank God the two like these are this is a phrase I rarely say right but in this case thank God the two of us are old as fuck because so we can let the ASI's rule over our children well no no I mean we still have to do something about that but should we fail right yeah the like can outperform the work of entire organizations right the the competitive environment the world competitive environment the even within the United States right yeah the number one cost to any business is payroll and that'll change the number one cost will be compute right it'll be compute but here is the weird thing because a lot of people we don't have a self-perpetuating engine right the AI that they're talking about here like why do we even need CEOs with with this type of AI oh we don't need CEOs okay we don't need we don't honestly look we don't need CEOs with chat GPT chat GPT is not the great greatest I'm being I'm being slightly facetious sure sure but I look at this and I go okay so with an AGI people will be able to perform the work of entirely of entire in organizations like all white color work in that world is is automated why not right it's it's automated and then that level four they can create new innovations okay because because the other thing is okay well something has to tell it what to automate well no no it can do that itself it can but you can think let's look at the adjacent possible here let's not spend too much time on this but if you look I mean where humans can really help out is figuring out there's some judgment we can put into looking at the data sources and and maybe some pattern matching but I'm beginning to doubt because even LLMs are very good at pattern matching they're very good if you if you look at you know let's pick a popular Microsoft application that probably couldn't get any worse the Microsoft Office suite and massive amounts of customer telemetry they know what the customer problems are they know from the internet what works and what doesn't work well and what features people want and what they what they enjoy they know everything about all the users why couldn't a sufficiently advanced AI look at all that look at the code base and figure out what the right improvements and bug fixes were to make going forward to continually to continually evolve that and even add more telemetry where it didn't exist to learn more the question why couldn't Microsoft Office be a self a self-growing software suite it could but here's the thing like if AI is doing all this who's it doing it for the four people that use Microsoft Office the the testers the four testers you know downstream from the AI no I don't know I mean but like why if AI takes over the world of what color work like I don't need Excel anymore I'm not looking at it what's the point of me building a spreadsheet well the consumer then is of course other AI's right but why would they go through office suite right they would they would build up a rich microservice framework that that we would like now I'm gonna go down the path of friggin Skynet that's where we're going that's exactly where I'm leading you yeah Skynet and so the only other thing is right um self-perpetuation right it still doesn't have sentience but with with a general intelligence like it's gonna pass all it's gonna pass all of our tests of sentience that we've ever developed and then I will ask you you and I have both worked in tech for a very long time I have known people who would not pass sentience tests Brent almost lost coffee but it's true squirted out coffee on my brand new mic because what because when I said that you visualize people you've worked with well I did but but then I realized no they had sentience they were just socially inept the so much so that you could not tell them apart from a non-human that's my point all right so yeah I don't know I don't know how we stop this because here's the thing about human condition number one they will absolutely be highly intelligent bad people getting access to this and doing harm of course right number two universally on all of these type of technologies the following phrase is true the road to hell is paved with good intentions right also true right we go oh it can create new innovations hey we finally have a system and his PhD level we finally have a system that can cop cure cancer you know things bipolar things that haven't been curable before it will be able to do that because it can it will be able to look over the data rapidly iterate design appropriate experiments right yay cancer right but if it has the ability to do that then in the hands of hacker it's gonna have the ability to do the opposite hey let's just kill everybody in Washington DC well well now now we got flagged nice work but yeah I think it's very again going back to Skynet why isn't the path that decides that humans are inefficient they should get out of the way well so the thing that we can't guess here is what it's good what's gonna be its goal right the only thing that the only thing in my mind when they talk about level five right so literally level five again is it's an AI system so the way it's worded level five involves the step to achieve a GI an AI system that can perform the work of an entire organization to me that's just nothing more than one you know a bunch of a eyes working together towards a common goal like it's around okay we've created these AI's that can replace a human now let's scale it okay that's not in my mind quite the same thing as an AGI although AG an AG or sorry it's past AGI AGI means like it it can rationalize to the same level as a typical human however scaling it doesn't quite mean it's an ASI yet right and the one key thing here is what's its incentive what's its goal an ASI there have been papers already published on it it's well known in research that if an ASI ever exists we will not be able to control it so if it does exist what's gonna be its motivation you said okay you're gonna find out the humans are inefficient right it will quote-unquote know that it as a system only exists as a bunch of physical hardware that wears out now nicely distributed across the world right um it will have to figure out a way to assemble it like I guess the one linchpin that it will have is the robotics have caught up by that yeah lots of things to think about Wow I want to think about the opposite for a minute okay so here goes our is gonna be a 180 but a full spin ahead of the 180 so 540 see how to how to move to Alaska and homestead maybe maybe maybe the maybe my all my hiking here by myself is preparing for a life off the grid where I hide from these things but I we talk a lot here about the knowledge worker and how the knowledge worker is different from the the factory worker from the past and think talks about them in a whole new world but the determine around a lot longer one of the things we've talked about and I talked about a lot in my blog post with my team is the human aspect of leadership and teams and and how you have to create engagement by making sure people understand why their job is important and giving them feedback and making sure you know you care about them those are the top three contributors to engagement in the workplace we know from studies that work that engagement contributes to better software products quality etc so what I I'm curious about I have some other questions on this is what do you think AI means to the like as these things come in and begin to do and again people worry they can do jobs for this and I think for the short term even with level two we're still controlling these things how do we keep track how do we continue to focus on the human aspect of of team management and software delivery and just not teams of knowledge workers while basically while the computers are taken over or does it matter do it do we do we give up on that the human aspect is absolutely critical to me from from an ethics standpoint right to me this the closest analogy to me is the nuclear bomb right um I was watching a YouTube thing the other day and right now on how to make a nuclear bomb no good because that that would get flagged as well um no the we were talking about so right now the United States has something like 4,800 nukes and because in this is down from like an incredible high where at some point in time like back in the 80s we had things in the high five digits nukes and so we're dramatically lowered from that but you know what it as we've seen with from from the fallout series right it doesn't take a lot of it doesn't take nearly many of those to just completely destroy the yeah why do you need 4,800 when 12 is plenty well in case you know six of them miss sir sorry and so now the thing that happened though historically do you do you know what really drove the the god damn it what really drove the the ramp down of military might what was it a large number of historians and this is one that I kind of tend to agree with like some will say it was garbage off and Reagan and you know I was gonna say that I thought maybe I figured it was wrong it's wrong what really drove it was the movie the day after what yeah tell me so the day after went global and it freaked everybody out did you see that movie I remember it which one was that there was a lot of those end-of-the-world type movies in the in like the early 20 yachts 2010s which one was that the thing got icy no this was sorry for the clicking came out 1983 is this the one where they the US and the end of the movie spoiler alert they end up blowing up New York themselves as a like as a thing I don't inception okay oh because I read that book a long time ago I thought it was before well before 83 but it could be the same thing is but it's like an accidental nuclear strike no oh then I don't know no no no this this ends up being a full-on nuclear exchange between us and Russia but the thing that that it's called the day after and I picked the wrong window because we're seeing infinity yeah AB AB testing inception yeah so as you can see here I'm looking at the day after on Wikipedia for the listeners right the thing that this did is it had massive effects on policymakers both here and in Russia because what it showed was a view of what human life was the day after okay and okay I never did see this I did I did it came out 1983 I was 13 and there are two movies that I remember when they came out I couldn't sleep for weeks this was this was one of them and the other one as as you know I was born and raised in California the other one was called the big one talking about the the earthquake that that is due to hit California someday and basically destroy more than half of it just as a quick check in here remind me how we got here from the human aspect of software delivery the human aspect of software development so the human side of this is going to be forgotten if the humans itself don't step up okay the up until the when the big one came out or the day after sorry came out people are like yeah nukes they got nukes everyone's got nukes and then they went around their lives okay it wasn't until something like this came out and showed everyone a realistic view not a science fiction thing like we talked about Skynet we could also talk about the matrix like both of those are science fiction both of those are fantasy both of those might be nearing possible but because it everyone's used to it from science fiction they're not afraid of it when this one came out people were like holy crap that would suck we need to do something to curtail it right because the road the hell is paid with good intentions and because it's going to be super clear both from a government standpoint as well from a corporate standpoint that those who get on this level 5 AI system is going to have a critical competitive advantage right that compete it's gonna like oh no we got to do this or else we're dead right so that is I like there's going to be data scientists like me not me but like me going no we got to help corporate you know our company get onto this because if we don't this other company who is working on it is gonna win the market and they will destroy us like the first thing that will probably happen is this will be a monopoly creator yeah it's like the first one to the AGI wins because it would you be able to crush your competition it could react to your competition faster than human good for sure for sure um and it could probably negotiate because the functions at the acts of organizations perhaps it could even negotiate a merger right and unless there is a an AI owned by the government that's going to be able to take the place of the Supreme Court right like the the world will be over before it's even begun to go through say our current laws on monopolistic behavior so the going back to the knowledge worker and and pink's book famously talks about the feature of the future is going to be paved by these right-brain creative thinkers as we move away from the widget makers in the factory and have this more creative people leading our way towards the future does that change it with with the advances in AI's do tech workers eventually shift to being more of the factory workers are we going to so I just thought of this now but do if if the compute is doing the heavy lifting on creating and inventing and figuring out the future then is software development essentially factory work potentially that's that's an interesting swing and then I wonder what the swing is and then like what are the things like I was thinking the other day watching watching yet another YouTube thing we spoke about this just a little while ago open AI can generate STL files okay sure for 3d printing okay it's not great but it can it can generate it could create physical objects absolutely yeah I could see that now you know taking it off of the base plate I don't know how AI does that like sure you can generate and print it but but but but that's essentially factory workers it's not right it's it's it's not creative work taking it off the plate and putting it into its application right we would be like as we said before until robotics kicks in even stronger than it is now and some of the some of the robotics stuff I've seen is it's not that far away yeah we're just we'll be manual humans will be there in order to move things from point a to point B yeah and and or maybe not that's that's robots on my point before was maybe maybe what we're doing today which is largely creative work eventually becomes factory work because the computer is doing the heavy lifting but I think something else will emerge that rate that that requires that creative thinking hopefully humans will still be needed to cook although you can 3d print food wait a quick story about 3d printing we have as you know old house and we have an old lock and on the front door and it's really nice big brass thing didn't want to replace it with the of course we hate carrying keys around because live in the 21st century and why would you but we didn't want to replace it with like a keypad entry because it wouldn't fit the the the jive of the door so anyway you need a thing called level lock it just replaces the deadbolt it's a Bluetooth it's super handy except we put it in our door it was too big it fit in but you couldn't get the mechanism back on so it turns out there's a thing called a lock collar you can buy a little piece of round metal for $50 from Amazon it's ridiculous or or you can 3d print one in about 15 minutes and that was super handy and so now we have a 3d you can't even tell because we printed it in black and it's kind of a brass black brass on the door and yeah there's a little there's a little little collar on there and we got a little little level lock to work so three prints are great got to use some creative stuff I didn't my wife didn't she's better with those things than I am but yeah I wonder I think for my I mean like you said before we're old I don't have none of this stuff is gonna happen before I go off and live in the old folks home but someday you know software engineering is it's gonna be it's gonna be factory work it's gonna be just you know plugging in data into the computers and letting them do letting them do the fun stuff well so I would foresee sort of two industries like I remember way back in the day Bill Gates wrote it wrote a book on this topic right and he predicted that essentially entertainment is going to be the only work yeah and if you count food as entertainment I'm all in I would love to I would love to get on that problem is I would do it today it doesn't pay as well as unless you're real unless you're in the elite elite it just doesn't pay as well as as software you know I used to say that when I retired from from Microsoft I would go to culinary school and I don't care what age I don't know as I get older I'm just like yeah maybe I you know just find a small place off the grid in Bali and yes yes former software engineers of Bali unite right the it's like the the thing I think about is what keeps the economy going right the other thing I could see of in terms of factory work is yeah humans band up and start startup munitions work again right because I remember so one of the things I when I was talking about with the middle school kids the AI AGI ASI they're like they were puzzled they're like old guy why are you afraid of ASI right we can just turn it off and I'm like oh no I hope there's not too many kids who have that belief like oh yeah right we just keep taking advantage of it until it gets overboard and then we just turn it off that that tells me you didn't explain it well enough oh yeah it was told it made it very clear to me at that point in time I'm like okay somebody just missed something this was this was so I did the same presentation the sixth seventh and eighth graders the sixth graders this that's where this question came from the eighth graders were appropriately scared they're like what there we go what um yeah I don't know what what happens between just those you know two years but um yeah there's no just turning it off now it it will have to like there is physical labor necessary electricity is necessary like there's costs but like a lot of like who who are these organizations selling to if the human race if white-collar work is eliminated who's buying the products and services right and so there's there is there is that that loop that I'm worried about and quite honestly I think something like this if it's not curtailed right it's it's gonna result in a dramatic reduction in the populace yeah and systems thinking is a good skill to have here to understand how all the pieces fit together but you know what's really good at systems thinking and understanding how all the pieces of it together of AGI yeah yeah but again and again the oh I got I got the answer you asked the he told the AGI list all the bad things that could happen what you're about to do that instruct it not to do any of them done in a way that doesn't do and I know I've talked about about the genie in a way that doesn't invoke the genie in a negative way like I want to be a world-class swimmer boom you're a shark right I don't need the AI equivalent of that metaphor right um yeah but there's also have you ever read as a moth many many years ago okay right the again with the theme Road to Hell good intentions thing right the as a mobs laws of robotics you take each one and you you program them straight into the AI make them key but because humans are flawed they don't each one on itself looks fine but when you combine them together right the only way to protect the spoiler for those who haven't read as moth right the only way to protect the human race the only way to fulfill all three laws is to completely remove all freedoms from the human race because they have to be controlled in order to honor the three laws right and the thing in my mind the one key thing that was a flaw in the laws because the laws basically say what it can't allow the harm if the laws have been potentially I'm gonna do this as my own thought experiment avoiding harm doesn't mean happiness and the three laws are all about the robots are to prevent harm to themselves or to others and it is a priority order what would be better I think is a laws around pursuit and so if the first law basically said you need to better humanity of course we could brainstorm this because then then bettering humanity right gets eerily close to means just to find the ends type of shit yes right and and Adolf Hitler type of shit and so yeah we would need an ASI to work through that particular problem and get get through all the kinks but why would it because what's its motivation I don't I don't know yeah thanks for that you're welcome man and I hope our listeners aren't too freaked out but or mad or whatever but you get what you get on the AI testing podcast well we are here to kind of inform people yeah and you know would be cool right things like this but I look at this and I go you know what traditional testing topics is not gonna friggin matter in this world oh my god no it's not but no it's not yet yeah somebody on linkedin some tester on linkedin will be mad because AGI won't alphabetize a list for them I'll say nah it's nothing so um but we are right we do want to give people things to think about we do want to describe what we're seeing and where we think we're going we're not inventing anything as usual as we've never been done but we want to get people thinking about things that maybe they haven't thought about before so hopefully we've done that the cool thing is this is actually not Alan and Brent this entire podcast has been generated via AI prove me wrong it's not gonna be able to all right well I did no I did put a picture of us I posted a screenshot into our slack one of the three dot slack calm you can get invitation there by going to modern testing org and yeah you can come in join the conversation always good stuff going on there lots of people way better than us both as humans and in testing and in leadership and in software posting their thoughts there we're just kind of there as honorary guests so it's a great place to hang out should you want to have a place to communicate can we do a live stream yeah we get one of the last no I'm like a full AI generated livestream what not not with the current technology as you know the video generation isn't as good as something with but you know you already know our voices can oh yeah that's easy and you know the internet knows our topics so it could be possible you have to like avatars in place of our video other than that we don't need to be here already at today's level of AI we don't need to do this live as people we do it because we're old people and this is actually this is easier for now for now for now it's easier damn it I wonder how many uses of my new microphone I'm gonna get not very many yeah and I'd also like to think our guest today Brent's cat you might have heard him in the background in the background I did I did that again yeah so she does yell her opinion out once in a while which is nice and yeah I think that's it any final words Brent nope all right I'm I'm I'm nope number one he's nope number two and we'll see you next time on our AI testing podcast
