So I'm Alan. I'm Brent and together we do something called the A B testing podcast We've done it for a couple years now pushing two years almost two years and Just for fun today. We're going to take a recording of this and make this episode 29 of our podcast and Evan will send you a link. I'll edit out the parts that are that Brett will be probably inappropriate at some point So we're gonna cover that Honest, I'll be honest. Yeah, okay So the way we do our podcast is the way we're going to do our presentation today You don't see a big slide deck behind us you see some things we're gonna talk about about surviving software in the Being software engineer in the 21st century fancy fancy title to get you here Although I know the pizza is what you got you here We're gonna talk about we talked about a B testing and cross that off We'll talk a little about what's changing in software engineering then we're gonna talk a lot about how you survive and adapt and change and the process is people in tech and then most importantly We'll take questions at the end, but even most er No, yes Good thing I can edit the podcast right even more and more importantly is that this is gonna be totally interactive if you You don't have to wait for the end to have questions Given that we don't have slides to go back and forth on and we just we have notes on things we want to talk on but if you like I don't get that or tell me more about that or In my group we have a situation close to that but it's different what we do here totally interrupt us and After we're done yelling at you will answer the question to our full extent work for you, right? Yeah, that works the you shouldn't you should feel welcome to interact, right? We have a list of topics both Alan and I could probably do for every one of these bullet points I think we could probably do a whole day talk mostly brand. He talks a lot. My job is to keep him in line. I Do blow VA? I apologize So If we hit on a topic that seems particularly relevant like speak up, it's okay. If you want to go deeper, that's fine Well, we'll go broad across this space as we go through it But we encourage interactivity Alright, so if you want to talk a little bit about do a plan here. What's going on? Yeah, it's right there Red my also our podcast is very low budget and we refuse to prep and we're well known for Ad we actually prepped very well Brand has a nice list here again My job is to fold three fold one give you some good information To keep Brent in line three give Brent a bad time any chance I can And he does all of those quite well. So shall we start by enumerating kind of what's what's different? This like 20 years you've been so let's let's talk about ourselves a little bit. I don't like talking about myself Okay, I'll talk about you. Okay. All right, so Both Ellen and I have been in the software industry for 20 plus years. I'm not as old as I look He's the way around he's older the Most sorry, I'm gonna interrupt you. Yes I When you should that one just for those that maybe didn't hear the question was what were punch cards like There's a certain gesture I could use but No, I've been doing this for 20 years I'll jump in so You all mostly look pretty young some of you probably weren't born in the early to mid 90s 90s kids raise your hands Yeah, yeah, I'm old. So when your parents bought a computer in the early 90s it came with some music software All right No, actually you had to buy a sound card separately So it came with some software from a company called MIDI soft and that crummy software. I tested it That was my intro. So I was beyond punch cards. I got to use I was pre win 3.1 I got to use Windows 3.0 with multimedia extensions and that was my beginning I joined Microsoft about two years after that and I've been there ever since all right brand blah blah about yourself. I'm done Good question, by the way. Yeah, fantastic question. Let's have some more of that In on the podcast like he he does use those hand gestures just interpreted it as your number one That's that's what I do So we've been in this 20-plus years the majority of the time we've been wearing the the title of test Alan's been test director Up until about five years ago. I was middle management and test and Then Microsoft began to go through a transition. Okay You want to talk I was gonna but I'll stop okay Alan and I during that period of time even up until the transition we had been talking about this transition I think what three years before it actually pulled the trigger because a lot of come it was happening in a lot of places It's been sort of a slow wave across the industry. So it has as part of that Microsoft not only went towards unified engineering model, but they're shifting much more towards using agile practices Yes, and in a lot more Data stuff so five years ago I transitioned into a dev role into Bing I was a dev manager and not that team And then a couple years later I've now transitioned into a data scientist role. I'm currently a data scientist manager For the Azure compute team at Microsoft Also in that same period of time I've gone deep in in agile. I am a certified agile trainer I We don't like neither of us really care about certifications, but it does give me permissions to train other trainers And Alan does stuff too I give a lot more detail. So no, but you know, the data scientist is Anybody it's a statistician who lives in Silicon Valley But all right. Yeah, so Brent talked about I'm gonna move on a Brent talked about some of the Stuff he's doing some of stuff Microsoft is doing but It's important to think about why teams and companies and organizations are moving to using more agile stuff and and maybe unifying engineering teams and blurring the lines being what Devin tests do and a lot of that is because people see the value in shipping faster and And I'm a big fan of a book called the lean startup you guys read the lean startup anybody I know Evan hasn't cuz he doesn't do anything but There's I promise Evan. I give him actually five jabs today who in here was on Evans interview loop Nobody. All right. Okay. Can we talk talk later? Yeah I There's a lion I thought horribly paraphrase from lean startup But you just don't get value from your engineering effort until it's in the hands of customers So if you can do that Get get customers your software Faster in a safe way where you can roll back if you screw things up and in a way but you have the potential to learn from them there's all kinds of good things that come from that and So I guess that drives a lot of the why on getting value to customers They stick with your product longer because you're getting continued upgrades and value All kinds of good things happen. What are some other reasons? So it's not just speed Also from from Reese's book adaptability so it's A lot of folks view agile as about oh, we got to go as fast as possible It's that's a wrong way of looking at it You have to be as adaptable as possible and when you are you end up going fast as possible Okay, it's an important distinction Adaptability right now is a huge business imperative in in any service environment your competitors are Very likely, but let me put it this way. So you guys who's your number one competitor? Someone speak it out who? Zillow, okay. I've heard of them. Yes How long how much time does it take to some are for one of your customers to come to Redfin and Decide to go to Zillow Even even that long Right, right. So I hope this is going somewhere switching what the switching costs in an internet enabled service world is Like that so you have to constantly stay on track You have to constantly adapt to what is the value that your customers are getting out of your product The World that we used to live in 15 years ago Where you could win by being the first to market doesn't work anymore you could win by Microsoft strategy used to be We had a whole lot of money. So we would let our competitors go find the successful market and Then we apply our resources and then go steal it from them, right? So we didn't have to invest in their indeed Hey, didn't you work in Bing? How'd that work out for you? It's still ongoing But I was the last test manager for the the Zune PC client how about workout for you not quite as well. Did you work on Ken also? Actually, yeah, I did No, so Ken the Ken product unit had been dead, but there was one deal we had with Verizon I ended up being as a test manager at the time I was actually the last person to do a test pass on kin because there was no way I was gonna have any of my team do this Kin I'll paraphrase and put up on the internet a Can I call it a failure? Yeah, I a colossal failure We actually ended up making money with Microsoft's gonna make this phone for tweens And they're very excited about how lots of cool features and it made it almost a week or two in the stores where they pulled them All in it was essentially a smart dumb phone So it was a dumb phone, but you could still do some things you could go up on the internet You could do some email, but the big deal was at that time a tween could go buy it for 40 bucks right Completely failed. All right Quite a history there. Are you gonna screw up Azure to know? Okay. No The other thing so if adaptability is a business imperative Then one of the problems is that the traditional methods the the waterfall methods the the engineering methods Invented say 20 years ago no longer scale if you are competing with your competitors on Features on a day by day basis. You can't afford a month-long test pass Okay, just simply you can't When I went to being That's where I took my job job When you shift to a world Where the the scale of the problems that you have go a couple of orders of magnitude bigger Then you have to start inventing new techniques right in Bing We ingest thousands of data feeds every single day the size the number the shape the schema changes every day In in addition to that we have all of our developers within 15 minutes any single developer can check in and it goes to prop within 15 minutes and Any developer can do that within the stack? We have multiple layers in the stack and of course that can change at any moment and In addition to that it's Bing. It's a search engine. We have a machine learning engine in the background That's also trying to take customer input taking the new widgets that Individuals developers have put together and combining them to create a UI experience that changes every refresh How do you test that you don't you can't? Bugs in Bing are completely worthless you file a bug in Bing a dev will come to you and say why are you doing this? I can't act on it What what then becomes more valuable is the patterns data analysis data analytics? Understanding when is this when is the system making these changes? That's fixable bugs Again you could have a bug in one refresh you hit refresh it goes away But the pattern that caused that initial bug is still in the system. That's what has to be rooted out like the What are you looking at me for you're in the middle of a story? I'm babbling a lot I'll go to the next thing then the other thing I would say that is a big shift I'll go I'll just finish this off the other thing that I that this is how we roll Another thing I would say is just there at my watch in a minute is quality Quality the definition of quality changes in this world like in the world where bugs don't matter What matters? right There's a phrase that I use now. I don't I no longer refer to bugs and quality as synonymous I talk about quality and code correctness quality is a Subjective point of view if you have a bug in a feature that no customer has ever used or does ever use Then it has no impact on quality okay, a piece of software that everyone uses is of higher quality Than a bug-free piece of software that no one's yeah, and that depends it Given you know because there's like if I asked this room I get probably a hundred definitions of what quality is but if I use Jerry Weinberg's which is quality is value to some person Can I get done what I need to get done? you can have Pretty high quality products that if nobody uses them you're not nobody's getting value from them or all of the elegance How many have iPhones do you love your iPhones? Do you love iTunes? Really, you're like the only person ever That's weird so but what else you gonna use right? soon Didn't they deprecate the software so even if you have a zoom you can't like doing with it because we still we haven't exceeded the time limit on the devices Let's go for bureaucracy. So What were you talking about you were babbling about something quality? Yeah, it was me definitions. Yeah So I'm reminded of I clicked in I am I am approaching 50. No, I'm beyond Weinberg. Okay, there's in Brian Merrick in 1998 somewhere in late 90s introduced what we called the agile quadrants which in these books called agile testing and more agile testing Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin talk about a lot which goes to your point which is when you think about quality you have Engineering quality on one side and you have a customer facing quality over here They're different and you also have technology facing and customer facing kind of going the other way without me drawing everything out Your customers don't care what your code coverage is. They don't care how many tests you ran They don't care how many failed and how many passed they care about Do the experiences provide me value you think about all the different things that cover what quality is and things we've done in testing and in in Author testing out of not something just testers do but like unit testing very much in that technology facing Engineering facing quality right good unit test. It could go coverage make sure they pass kind of that other quadrant way up here You think about performance testing reliability even monitoring is up there Those things are a lot closer to measuring what the customer perception of quality is but at the very end What's the best way to get the customer perception to quality? Measure from the customer right we can try as hard as we can as as engineering teams to go okay, this is going to be the customer perception of quality and Brent's a Data scientist so we can probably predict What the customer perception is going to be but that's certainly part of a big part of my my challenge The so is there anyone here who's agile trained raise your hand if you are Just just brand to one person know that all right What are you all right now a couple of the people stepped in do you guys know about the pop and dikes? I don't marry Yeah, so her husband Tom in terms of his description of quality. I'm very very fond of it Or it's not new description But a quote he said everyone in software engineering needs to remember that no one ever in the history of time Has ever wanted software? No one wants software. Okay, what they want is their problem solved Okay, software is a means to the end bug correctness bugs May or may not be a means to the ends if they get in the way of their problem getting solved, right? the to continue on with less so what's changed there's So we we talked about there's a lot of new engineering methods Waterfall thankfully is slowly dying, but it's it's holding on with waterfall is awesome We didn't need to hire testers till the end the docks always got done because we couldn't go on until they were done So it's great. Yeah, I know what you're talking about When you shift to this dry sarcasm it just bothers me The you know what bothers me like an interrupt It's like I think in some vague power play you scooted your chair farther forward than mine I just noticed that I just wish the chair was a little bit lower No, I'm using this as a desk me tired of holding it. Well stop looking at it the So there's there's lean Lean and fast agile methods That is a new engineering model. There's there's safe Kanban scrum There's about ten that are really popular. These are really coming in and helping businesses to be adaptable in addition to that. There's two key New engineering roles that we now see in sort of my you know Don't you think that and this is actually being a real question that I'm has to be brewing and somebody said Don't you think these all these processes and names kind of almost get in the way sometimes I think people get so stuck in trying to go Oh, we're gonna do this process and they get married to the process and they forget that they're trying to make software to solve Somebody's problem. There's the process is help. I mean if you want pick one there is a bit there is a There is a bit of that of the the monkey's experiment. Do you guys are aware of the monkey's experiment? You will be in a minute. What's that? No, not that one That's a Shakespeare or something or other The monkey's experiment in a nutshell is essentially they did an experiment years ago They got I'll just make up a number. Let's say five monkeys into a cage. They put a ladder and a bunch of bananas Okay, I like this story. I'll let it all what they did what they did is Monkeys of course like bananas and so they'll go after the bananas climb up the ladder and acquire the bananas What they did though is any monkey that did that they would spray it with cold water okay, and Monkeys don't like cold water and started getting trained at going after the bananas was an upsetting experience Then they changed it then what they what they did because monkeys still try they really like bananas Then what they did is when a monkey went after the bananas they would spray every monkey But that one right the first one was the first Stimulus was to train the monkeys to get them to realize hey, there's a punishment associated with going after the bananas Now they shifted to oh and by the way That punishment that you got used to avoiding Now if someone else goes after it, you're gonna get the punishment. Okay monkeys Didn't like that and they very quickly got trained to Beat up the monkey that went after the banana. They didn't want to get squirted Then what they who wants to get squirted, right? All right Then what they did once they had that is a stable behavior inside that cage They swapped out the monkeys they would they would take one monkey out put a new one that's never experienced it but they didn't change anything so they put the bananas in and The old monkeys would if that new one went after the bananas, he'd get his butt kicked They kept on doing that until eventually none of the monkeys Had ever been squirted with water But the behavior persisted and that's kind of the same thing when we talk about processes It's you it's it's an encouragement to Sure, you're used to things Think about why? Does it still add value and in the environment that you're in today? What can you change in? Terms of the names like again as an agile coach, I would say The first thing you should do if you don't have an agile coach in-house if you don't have someone who understands this topic very deep higher one It is hard to just shift it is very easy Agile is actually a much harder practice than waterfall waterfalls very structured do this then this then this then this Adapting means you have to know when to change When to change when to say that rule that we had last week is no longer applicable here So how many have ever like to have tried to change something and work like let's let's change the way we do X Anybody ever how many of you have heard? The biggest resistance was but that's the way we've always done it It's there it's it's a Name for that but I don't know my name is I don't like it But it's it's common and you that that organizational change part that convincing part is a big challenge But people can get really stuck in that's the way we've always done it. I've heard it, you know at Microsoft a few 100,000 times there's there's a phrase right if it ain't broke don't fix it if you think it ain't broke then my question would be How are you measuring that? Okay, you want to kick stuff I don't even know where you are on your little note list I'm done talking about the I got my list over here. All right, do you want to talk about kind of what's how you survive this stuff? Yeah, so I should talk a little bit about what I'm doing now and that may kick some of this off. So We're changing Microsoft a lot of teams doing unified engineering big fan of it. Oh, it's like it like so You know if it's the name I use because I hate the term combined engineering that Microsoft uses Just means we have a software engineering team not a separate dev and test team A lot of teams are going that way in various different flavors like Windows has check this out Or the operating systems group they have engineering teams or software development teams, I guess and then Because we got rid of testers. They have quality teams who Do Not as much They do mostly some data analysis some to let adding metrics measurements to the code User experience testing etc. Perf reliability those things all happen there Devdiv has this developer division has the same thing Where they call it the E&I the experiences and insights team does sort of the same thing So if you're a developer know if you break something you break you fix your own stuff the intent of the quality team is that they would focus mostly on Customer focus purely on data science analysis telemetry It is the illities And that the development team would own testing You know most of the testing of their own code, but I won't say they've done that transition particularly well yet Not windows. Yeah, so I was in windows for a little while by I like to say that my Two and a half years in Xbox was the best five years of my life and that my two years in Windows was the longest five years of my life. Oh, that's gonna go on the podcast. That's cool. All right, so I Which makes you what 60 months ago? Brandt you're number one. Yeah four months ago. I joined a team that was all engineers all developers all former developers But they were smart about it. They wanted to adjust an engineering team for the devs own their testing But they realized very early on hey, we don't know a lot about testing We're not so good at this and I'm sure there's a lot of stuff We're forgetting letting through the holes. So my job is to be the quality guy on this team. So I'm the combination Test manager test architect release manager probably something else. I wear a lot a lot of hats the team Small team Microsoft size probably huge everywhere else. It's about 65 engineers Evan knows that small for Microsoft And my job is to make sure the developers know how to test so they have the right coaching and training to do that The developers own all their own testing all the way up through integration testing including some performance from reliability testing And then I have a handful of vendors we use for some extra customer focused experience testing and for some extra stuff, so So my role has been to be part of an engineering team. I'm a peer with all the other engineering leads on the team so we have a director of development and all the engineering managers who run the different feature teams and I report to him and So it's been a good experience and working in an engineering team figure out how What it means for a development team to own Testing their own code and sort of some of the challenges they go through and doing that I think one of the reasons it works for me is Brent and I have talked a lot about this idea of Generalizing specialist or specializing generalist meaning you guys know this term. Have you heard it before? I was gonna talk about it. Shut up So it means I've described my role for a long time as someone who does you know is a little about a lot and a lot About a little meaning I can cover I can I can really kind of help out a lot of different areas There are some areas I go deep on and the areas I tend to go deep on may It may change depending on context when I joined the link team It's called Skype for business now, but they had a team a very junior test team who were doing a lot of Manual tests all day and didn't really know a lot about test techniques or they just needed a lot of extra work So my job on that team, I just left engineering excellence where I was a sort of a trainer and a coach and a consultant So I went into that team and I spent about a year and a half Helping that team become sort of better rounded testers only had approach automation throwing out most of their manual suite because it was useless and Kind of turning them into was a I thought a pretty well oiled team Then so but very high level kind of organizational change and training kind of stuff then I went to Xbox where it was We need someone who knows see really well We can write a lot of tools and test tools and things to get Xbox one out the door So I did that for two years and it was a blast And I'm doing sort of a and I did sort of a combination of that on the but that my transitional team in Windows I'll help us call it the transitional team. That's better and then I'm and then I'm like I said I'm doing sort of a release management quality architect sort of role in this team. So the the line that runs through there is I think no matter how your Engineering team or your development team or your team is put together You need in addition to people that can just crank out good code because you always want some of those right? I won't ask you to raise your hand if you're really good at cranking out good code We always need those people but you also need people who can plug holes once I changed my my LinkedIn profile at the hole filler and Because that's kind of my job. I've told all my managers I figure out what's not getting done and make sure it gets done Whether I do it myself or work through others to make sure it gets done So my role is to recognize what those holes are and then get them filled. Oh, and by the way, I have a tangent We were famous for our tangents Do you guys get like a lot of unsolicited LinkedIn recruiter mail? So I know how to fix that Change I changed my LinkedIn title to generic employee. I don't get any more emails That one's free. You can do that So you're gonna add something. Yeah, I want to shift a bit deeper, right? Cuz um Alan is in a unique situation his last team change right most of the teams that we go and talk to Are in transition they already have say Dev test p.m. And they're trying to figure out how do they move into sort of a more of efficient team model, right Alan got lucky in my humble opinion is that you started off it was a lock It actually wasn't he was looking for he was looking for the perfect job for him Is serendipity What's the quote about luck that says luck is I can't even paraphrase it Yeah, something like that. Like I was ready for luck to strike me so I Think straight I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna anyway. No, I was gonna go back to So one of the experiences after I left Bing I was instrumental in helping the SQL server team Go from sort of the similar point that you guys seemed like That you guys are at now where you have these combined roles or not combined separated roles. How do you merge towards? More efficient team for lack of a better word There's a lot of struggles Dev for example that will constantly ask well, what does QA do now? Yeah, even when QA knows what they're gonna do now and explain it they still ask this question because one of the biggest problems is In essence a lot of deaths and I'm sure it's not here but a lot of devs for you testing as Menial work, right? Why do I have to do that? It's below me. Okay and It's really not but you actually had a quote Piggyback off of the the quality speech who owns quality the Twitter that you did a few months ago I don't know what you're talking about fair enough You said something if quality is The customer subjective value something something something then who on the team owns quality Producing that if quality is producing value to some customer then who on this team owns quality Right. All right rhetorical question everyone owns creating value for the customer, right? I'm sure I said that I don't remember it was on God you're old The So dev goes through a transition period if you guys choose to go with this sort of model tests will go through a transition period I am a huge proponent of of the unified Engineering model I am too, but I don't know that it matters and I'm gonna interrupt cuz it doesn't matter as long as the roles are Efficient and working together the second the roles become silos Dev throwing stuff over the fence to test that's the exact work I think the key is that engineering team is regardless of what you call yourselves I was talking to Evan earlier and and Everybody's just get to make up their own title because titles get in the way sometimes of engineering you think oh you had You have this title whatever it is. And so I don't have to give you the time of day But I remember in when I worked on Windows CE That's an eye roll for people that missed it. I helped this is probably 2004 I Trained our dev team to write unit tests and This is new to them. It's weird because Developers about every other company in that time period were running right in their own unit test But it's this brand new thing for these Windows CE developers. But the weird thing that happened was I Developers come to me and say hey if we're writing unit tests, what are the testers gonna do? I thought I can explain this and the reasonable question What scared me more is when a tester came to me and said hey if the developers are writing unit tests, what do I do? And oh, that's an interesting way to look at that But when I think of my career I spent probably the first at least Five years writing unit tests. We played this game of Codependent ping pong I call it where the developer gives me some code and I quickly write a little test for it to prove that it's broken and I feel good because I found a bug I'm validated. I give my code give the bug to the developer goes. Oh, thank you for finding a bug Thank you for being my safety net. That's great. I love you and he fixes it and then he gives it to me again I go I Put a little more time on it and I find another bug I go that's great He fixed it and I found another bug. I feel more validated here. Here you go again. He goes why thank you This is great. I love you more and this goes back and forth and It's really Maybe the codependent metaphor is too far of it not too far off But this ping pong when you think about efficient software, it's really inefficient to do that, right? So a couple things come out of developers Writing a lot of their own tests is one I'm a big fan and I'll say everybody asked this a big fan of test driven development and especially Even more behavior driven development. I'm talking about what those are in a minute for this You guys know these I said I just talked about these in a minute for those you don't know what they are But I said I wish I said I'm we're I'm there already know Okay That was Brent's attempt to giving me a bad time so Keys here. It's very efficient for if I'm gonna write this code if I write some tests for it before or while I'm writing it Make sure it works Developers that write begin to write good unit test End up writing more testable code Because a lot of times I'm sure developers in the room have done this like I'm gonna write some code You think I'm gonna write a test this. Oh shit. I can't test that They go. I'm gonna refactor this which end up with this better code in the first place Because you have to write testable code from the beginning and that code ends up being more usually more maintainable Let's roll out the people yeah Yeah, so That's a good way and I take that one go ahead go ahead yeah, so better to have two minds yes separate no, so Huge proponent of pair programming where you have two people looking at at the same time But the the trick with TDD The the the brilliance of TDD is you test your code first? So you writing up the test cases that need to pass before you write the code Since you haven't written the code yet. You haven't yet been Perverted by the assumptions that you're about to write so one of the things That I did and then I want to piggyback on this and and that that's a great question because that ends up being One of the challenges with the shift when I went to Bing I told you I went into dev This was at the time where Bing was going with combined engineering My team was 50% dev and 50% test is this a long story no okay the testers ended up being the Better developers in the world where we have to ship every 15 minutes right the the because the Turns out writing code in in small chunks Is not that hard if you have a rock star? dev architect on the team and say you need a You're using an n log n and union log or a O of n algorithm You you need to have the ability to have that second person to go and ask you need to be able to do knowledge sharing But other than that the 80% of the coding problems anyone can do But the thing we're testing it up being a huge advantage is they already understood the value and how to test it ended up What happened is my team first came first were very polarized Had a bunch of devs that say we're specialists. We are the ones that own this code up and down the stack But we're not going to do our testing because we own enough complexity and I said Honestly what I did is I ran my team if you guys are familiar with Kanban I ran my team with a Kanban model as highly transparent. Yeah, and You only ship in two week chunks. Okay, so anybody does something wrong? it's only Two weeks of one person's code that that could have an impact and it's very easy to react and and repair But what ended up happening is is I I didn't force these guys to shift I forced them to communicate be transparent walk through the board and as they went through that as everyone was transparent These guys were realizing that the testers were getting their stuff out faster. They were getting more features done faster And then they started shifting right once the team started sharing knowledge The people with the super awesome very highly specialized algorithms started leveraging and learning from the test guys and once that Tests are that knowledge learning goes Then this team becomes a rock star. I when I left being I'll close with this when I left Bing Alan really wants to interject something When I left being I had one of my peer teams came to me a PM came to me I had a team of seven at that time and he said Brent I don't know what you're doing, but your team of seven is kicking my team of 30s ass and I said we should meet because I know what we're doing. It's not magic. We just think about it in a different light Go ahead. Let me give you also a sort of a pragmatic Answer to that from my recent past we had a Bad bug in our product. It's not released yet. So it's tough back gonna be right? but our VP was pissed so it was that bad and There's like how is this and I got the how did we miss this? How did this get through and it turned out that? Developers who are learning to write tests like our team was they're very they were really really good happy path tests Our product as long as you use our product as expected No, it's not even close to the edge stay in the middle of the room. It ran great But it wasn't until then that hit me because I'm doing all these hats that I realized Oh, yeah, there's a whole bunch of other testing. I've been doing my whole life that we're not doing yet So what I did there easy thing I met with the engineering managers and people on their team little half-hour meetings We did a brainstorm made a mind map of all the edge cases and things like that looking at quantity if you want I mean you're thinking about We'll look at places where concurrency that can happen places where large amounts of data can cause a problem Things like that, you know look at you know non English characters or if it applied etc and all those things that were testers are traditionally really good at helping the deal don't me just think about those because one of the things that a generalizing specialist does that maybe a pure specialist doesn't do is we go into the the 10-foot level and dive in and then go back out at 10,000 foot level look around and kind of see how stuff fits together so Yes, it is You could say that you're biased to your own code But you can there's plenty of ways to get help on that because I think I know plenty of developers who are really good at testing Their own code. So I think it's certain. I know for a fact is certainly possible and for those where it's difficult I think it's a learnable trait. It is absolutely learnable trait and then there's always the model of pair programming Although it's much like my experience with TDD and in helping Say specialist devs learn it's much like The speech you can lead a horse to water right it they have to be motivated to want to drink from and if they're not It's it's it's going to be a hard-fought battle. The other thing I'll also share around TDD No, I want to highlight the benefit Evan has a question Okay the other thing about TDD or doing this test having the test and their developer owning it and When not with a model where again within 15 minutes it goes to prod it creates a Sense of ownership on the individual first and foremost if they're checking within 15 minutes can go to prod Then they don't have to worry about the blame game of oh, no My fix is fine is that you didn't integrate right? Right. It's there's their control of their own destiny and as they learn So I'm a big proponent of balancing the preventative and reactive measures and as you learned where your preventive measures weren't working You add tests and as you add tests you realize oh my god The way I've written my code makes it a real peony ass to add tests. I need these tests I'm gonna refactor my code and what I've what I have noticed that every team that goes into this That that code gets refactored into much more maintainable much more testable patterns across the entire team and when you have That type of code your ability to produce new features and change features starts to go like this getting in a rhythm is is Actually key. I think ever you don't know what the customers are going to do so Oh, actually, that's a that's a really good comment The comment was repeat what the question was the question was if customers aren't going to try those crazy things Why bother testing for them and it goes back to the comment earlier? But if a but nobody finds a bug does it affect quality? I Don't think is a real reason to go super crazy on the edge cases But like there is a particular object we could pass to a message as long as we had one or two Which was the normal usage case? Everything was fine. But when someone added four of those or five of those everything broke So that's not really on the edge. So a little bit beyond the center happy path It gets to a point this is gonna lead into what I'm gonna force Brent to be the next section Which is there's a comment. I heard probably seven years ago, maybe a little longer at a GTAC conference in San Jose a Google test automation conference where says sufficient monitoring is Equivalent to testing. So if you have the monitoring in your system to know when Every failure has happened to get and get the right alerts on that and know what paths are being used and what's happening there Sufficient monitoring to cover all those cases Can replace testing? I want to be careful with that one though. I need say that I'm trying to tee up here Go bright. Right. So you guys have heard I'm sure by now this concept of testing and production Yes Okay, it does not please dear God It does not mean take your test suite and turn them into monitors that are on production Okay, it means you do need those monitors But it means you're looking at the the you're using your customers as your testers It means that you have a much alone statement to write people freak out about that. No, okay. Go go go Customers are fantastic testers. They are that and this is a point I always make for test reason go I am the voice of the customer. I am the customer advocate. I am the customer and you're not That wasn't very nice But yeah, you if you can use the real customer as your proxy for the real customer Yeah, it's always gonna be better off than using a proxy for a different proxy. Do you guys do flight control here? Yeah, so imagine that you have a whole bunch of monitors that can tell you What's your name? Kevin, okay. So Kevin just did a check-in 15 minutes It's now in prod. How does Kevin know that he just broke? All redfin customers in Georgia. We have monitors that would allow you to know that in that type of world Kevin kind of needs to know that right we need to have the ability to detect that something that the business values Just is on the floor now So flight control also known as exposure rings is what you do is you? Take Kevin's code you put it on Call it exposure ring you put it on a segment of your customers say only a hundred people Can see Kevin's code and then you have important signals if it passes those signals Then you broaden it to an order of magnitude and you keep doing that until there's Some some threshold where it's no longer value to keep just flip it all along right When we talk about tests in production really really at the end of the day what a test case is for is to reduce business risk That's the whole point you can do some of those things you need to do to do it preventively It would not be a good idea for Kevin to do something Where he checks in this fix and then anyone signs in and it deletes the customer database. This would probably be a bad idea Right, but he has a unit test for that. That's all right, right But he should have a unit test for that and and some mechanism as part of that 15 minutes to prod Should be in place to check that no one can take out the entire business Then things like okay, someone just signed in with some weird character right that you can use your telemetry and you can use a a reactionary process to Get that going Google for example, one of the things Google does they used to be well known for shipping crap All the time. They were always in beta. Okay, and I used to have arguments with people at Microsoft He's like, oh, they're always in beta. They don't ship high quality They're a fat Okay, they're not a fad. I had actually these arguments and I'm like, you know what? Their stock price and the number of users does not align with your statement Right and the only way to make that for that to make sense and this is still in one of my test gigs the only way to make sense is that bugs don't necessarily equate to quality or Perhaps what's more important is? As a business you're working to not prevent pain but minimize overall Pain and what Google is masterful at they instrument everything So they have a belief a set of hypotheses. It's like we think these are our Catastrophic we're gonna pretest this code's not gonna go out but the amount of those test cases is not very large Much much much smaller They'll use exposure rings. So look at that instrumentation and they'll go. Hey looks like We have more than we expect of people from Georgia That's not are getting sign-in failures. Perhaps we should investigate that and see if we revert the code so if you think of the purpose of tests is minimizing business risk and you think about customer value as Increasing it then you then you have the liberty to start applying sort of an ROI through to How you are doing everything you can use ROI to reevaluate your processes reevaluate your practices the The other thing Google is very good at is they can they can make a decision to revert the build right as I talked about It would not go to the next exposure ring or yank it out. No, this is a bad build. We just destroyed The experience for a hundred people in Georgia, but they can also go. Oh, it's not bad enough to stop it from moving forward But it is bad enough We're gonna get this Fixed in in the next iteration and their iterations are either one or two weeks long One of the things that I will say is that a huge time saver something. I'm very proud of In the last five years. I haven't had a bug database because I deal with it in real time I I First got test clean. I first got bug clean then I started a cadence around shipping Small chunks because if you ship large chunks, it's really hard to disentangle But if I have someone on my team of seven and each one is going to ship something new on a daily basis If I come in the next morning and it's on the floor It's really hard are really sorry really easy to fix it because it's one person's one code He might even be able to because the complexity is so small. He might even be able to fix it in line very quick QFE as We go through that doing it. What QFE mean quick fix engineering release. What's the equivalent here? How fix? the I forgot where it's good. I can I can take a turn so So I think we probably want to wrap up here and then take a bunch of questions I think I think we want to get your questions and try and make sure we can adapt those so start thinking of those now What works for us is I can go back to pragmatic our product hasn't shipped yet, but we're I'm thinking hard about the plan to get there And so we have you guys use continuous integration server you guys are shipping often so we use a big fan of this this is where you catch all the all the kind of devastating things that could happen you never want to get into a flight and You're not really reliable tests there because we gate the build on these we gate deployment on these so it's like someone submits a change It goes through this gate, which is a build unit test these all these other tests these their protractor tests running against the web page If all those pass the bill gets deployed to our continuous integration environment, and that's updated all the time So there's always a build out there with the latest check-ins in it. So that's going on all the time and then What we're gonna do I know you guys are working on shipping much more frequently But we're just my team is gonna start with one release a week So and the good thing that happens from that is our team has been doing sort of for term on agile transition I joined the team in the middle of their their love of what I'll call Scrummer fall Which is we have a full week iteration? Where there's some planning at the beginning and then the devs right and bunch of Do a bunch of work and I make sure they're adding tests But they still create a bunch of debt in there in there and then they try and cram in the rest of the debt at The end at the end of that four weeks have a really crummy product that stabilizes the first week of the next iteration Being transparent it's not perfect But by moving to this by we're gonna shift to some internal customers coming up soon and by moving to that model I got everyone bought off on shipping once a week Which means whether they want to think of things as a four-week iteration or not I can now in caps things kind of line up into a weekly rhythm and that's when Brent mentioned that earlier I really clicked on that is having a shipping rhythm is really important Teams can adapt to that like we know we have a one-week rhythm where you know, we're doing a bunch of validation on Monday and the bill and we do some self hosting dogs But on Tuesday and then we promote to production on Wednesday and then features are finished up for the next thing Thursday and Friday And we start all over again. It's very nice so we can crank that up that Speed up as needed but it gets One of the things I'm looking forward to in that is like Brent said I don't Well, first of all, we have a bug database and it's populated with more things and I'd like right now But we're gonna I'm in the back of my head to put about Organizational change my plan is Little by little without the team realizing it because I'm not even gonna tell them they're doing one-week iterations it's just gonna happen and a little by little we're gonna become a little bit more agile and and eventually I It's gonna be like the perfect team for me. I'm trying to mold them to be like what I want I want to be clear though Clear all day. I'm gonna try now My teams I saw we don't have a bug database and I've haven't in five years, but that doesn't mean so My teams still have developers in them and they still are human which means they write bugs So my team still writes bugs, but the way we treat bugs is when we encounter a bug That we have validated as customer impacting that we have a process. We call it the swarm process Any bug that comes to my team the whole team jumps on it and that thing is gone within 48 hours So bugs we viewed not only something that's harming our customer, but it's harming the overall Process And quality of not just the code but everything so I'm an efficiency geek and I mentioned earlier the the codependent ping-pong game which is very inefficient and also it's very inefficient and But by the way that that cost of a bug curve, it's mostly a myth don't draw don't draw that ever Holding on there is a cost accruing debt So if you're gonna yep, that's a great bug. We'll get to that when we get to it. That's inefficient It's so much more efficient to go. Oh, there's a bug. Let's fix it Let's get it. Let's we don't want we don't want those when you can get to that zero and there's a transition step To get there doesn't happen all at once. I've known teams that have gone through this and you kind of go for Okay, let's have and what I'm doing right now is we have zero bugs at the end of our iteration usually it's about two days into the next iteration and Eventually, we're gonna be at zero bugs every Friday for the weekend Our sappin and now eventually move into zero bugs all the time. I was planning my head all worked out There'll be bumps along the way But this is this is where I want to get to but you can't just go to the team and go That's it. Everybody fix all your bugs. I'm not gonna have anymore I think that's a typical I my team customer impact 100% my my team fixes a hundred percent customer impacting but so what we will do though is the bugs where Hey, if a customer does this sequence of clicks at exactly midnight on February 29th it using a by dye character set Yeah, I will make the call that that's That might be a bug I can look at your code. It's absolutely bug We're not going to fix it until we have proof. There's somebody impacted I'm sure a lot of people in this room. I've worked on products have had multiple multiple releases and I'm sure a lot of people in this room have bugs like we don't want to fix that But we're gonna hold on to it because we may get to it next time then next time rolls around and you go. Yeah We're gonna do that next time and you end up with this bug. It's like 40 years old Okay, four years old but and it's like yeah, we're gonna get to that note. That's one thing that I'm very adamant about and it's My bug triage like this is customer impacting. Yes, we're gonna fix it and we're gonna fix it very soon But we're not gonna fix it at all. So and that's the thing I want to I want to get a couple other things number one We won't fix it if that bug comes in the February 29 scenario. We'll go. No, it's fixed Okay, we track all of our bugs as tickets on our scrum board. Okay, I will take that ticket and it goes the trash I'm going to completely from here on out ignore its existence if it comes up again I'll say okay that we have customer impact now Hey, and if the answer is still no it's gonna go back into the trash. Would you I have a Would you Could you would you could you dr. Seuss on a boat with a with a boat add? I'm gonna go add a little bit of instrumentation here So I know if this I'm gonna track how many people February 29th at midnight are are are entering but yeah, yeah, absolutely it's so Me that's what I most bugs where I would have with with one of my reports isn't gonna be so Hyperbolic right it's going to be hey, but it could if this this and this and there's this other thing And there's a reasonable expectations could but we don't have any proof that any customers encounter that I'll say you tell you what Go refactor it go ahead and add instrumentation We're gonna keep the code the way it is But if if you're proven to be right I want to be able to switch on a dime So make sure that the code can switch And you can go the other way on that too. So imagine I'm gonna this is purely I'm gonna make up a bad example That's what I'm best at like say you Somebody comes says hey look I found this bug where if someone searches for a house that has an odd numbered address In a state where the abbreviation has an a is the last letter and it's over a million dollars This weird thing happens to the page or something bad happens again totally made up not a great example But ideally you could go you could you guys fixing it's gonna be a real pain like okay. What's the impact? Ideally you want to be able to go to your data that you've clicked it from your site and go how how often does this happen? How likely is this to happen and use data to help you make a decision on on the customer impact of that as well Yes, and if you have that data, then you should be able to align it very readily to what will be the business impact Because you also have if you have that data Then you have the data of all the other type of bugs and now you have the ability to sort of work through Customer impact in what's on this parade order or the 8020 rule the other thing I also want to bring out around this process that really makes things super sweet at the end of the day is It's really it makes Bug-free code or bug ish free code is much easier to add features to Much much much easier Yeah, and that's what the business is really valuing I've been preaching that to my team as we knock our our bug debt down is that you guys we forget ship once a week it's much easier to give value to customers if we're doing that on top of a stable code base and they all down their heads and Slowly too slow for me whittle down that debt. Okay. I think we've covered pretty much. Oh, we've everything We've covered more you don't get to bring your little note sheets anymore I'm still bringing them. All right We do some questions. Yeah, please. Yes Yes, so I like to think of that sort of like a two-axis. Oh, sorry Wow, they're watching me closely So how do you how do you differentiate between the bugs that are minor but a lot of people hit and they're and the kind of the Really bad ones and I like to think of bugs on that that to access Scale of like how many people does it hit and you can get that from data and then how bad is it houses severity? So is it is the the crash that only happens at midnight? on the February 29th when you're entering bite-eye characters versus the Cursor that disappears for five seconds for every single user using your page One is not very severe, but you really want to fix it it In my current team. One of the things that we're working through is something that we're calling a pain index We have every team. I think I've been on at Microsoft has built a pain index Yeah, I'm gonna build one. All right, cuz it's never been done before no But I get to do it data science II way not a god old-school test way no spreadsheets this time Gonna use our if you think of risk You're number one too well if you use if you the biggest thing about risk Right is how frequently does this thing occur and then what's the severity? So all sort of impact statements it can be measured by frequency and severity now you guys got to transform or translate what severity means in terms of An impact to the business or the impact of the customer now I'll also tell you the more you can make those things synonymous The more you are measuring the business in terms of impact to the customer then the more this really flows I had the Talking about the glory is again when I left Bing I had the ability to in essence When I was doing some of the the data science stuff that I was doing in Bing I had the essence the ability to tell individual dev teams the consequence of this bug yesterday by dollar signs and once we had that and And the ability to sort of argue through that no that wasn't just a random number generator a Dev started engaging because no one in this room wants to make unhappy customers But a lot of what we do is based off of an intuition a base off of belief Well, this would really impact me if I was that guy in In that situation on February 29th. This is how I feel empathy is high the data allows you to get much more accurate and get to the Truth and the once you get closer to that you can really iterate faster So I believe the answer to the question was yes next question. Yes so what about the this is actually a Tailor onto that question, which is we do with the gray area bugs that are like this is wrong But you know the devs to the hopefully just the dev team doesn't have the only choice on what gets fixed Here it should be for my team We have a design team that would make that call and my design team is Massively anal so that bug would get fixed all the time. So ideally, you know for me it's It sort of depends on the team culture and what you're building but the way I think he was addressing it is great I think we all know how to solve any decision making in any sort of command and control structure So you had a design team? Well, they're the winners. Yep How do you do to have the customer be the winner? So, how do we make the political decision to fix all the bugs design team files luckily the design team fixes in themselves They own are they not only design but they actually know the magic of CSS. So yes So the question is do we have any experience in property based testing using some tool? I haven't heard of right I'm not familiar with property based testing and I'm pretty sure that we understand what you're talking about but not in the way your phrase there Oh, so test generation libraries not necessarily fuzzing but test generation like for for any sort of test data Yeah, I use a tool a colleague of mine. I wrote when I worked in engineering excellence work with a guy named The BJ Rellison who's one of the authors on the on the book I wrote on One of the books you can buy no don't buy them like That was that was like Google AdSense just popping in and put that ad there He wrote this tool called babble, which I believe you can still find on his website But it generates strings in any language So I use like that and it has an API as well and I use that today I also use a tool believe it or not that James Bach wrote called pro clip and pro clip is an awesome tool For it'll generate any length of string you want and with this idea called counter strings It's actually a pretty nice tool for figuring out what the limits of entries are etc. I've It's a pretty easy way to I showed dad like it's not that big of a deal But you show somebody who hasn't done testing before and they go. Oh my god If you put a long string in my field it breaks who would have thought of that Yes No You definitely have to so the question was no sorry when you go 15 minutes to prod you probably can't build and test everything So what do you do? How are you guys doing it? I can explain go so I was asking you the question one of the things So first off you you if you can leverage the system and it turns out in Bing We are able to go massively parallel And and a lot of the machines in Bing the the production machines have idle cycles So we're able to capture those idle cycles and turn them into a parallel test bed Okay Certain but the the other thing too is if you're gonna be live in 15 minutes Then you need to have the data that you can react to much sooner than that so that you can make a decision It's going to go So but you want to have an opportunity to make a decision to stop it And it's not always going to go there are certain Monitors in place that will stop any flow, but anything that's decision-making it's up to you You have to think differently around how your code works The the the best example is any build And you can do this whether it's a big service like Bing or it's even an on-prem product if you think about the concept of an RTM build and You you make a commitment you change the architecture in the process of your team and say we're gonna have a build that is always RTMmable and one of the things that I actually tell people Ship releaseable releasable. He's using weird words. Just ignore It may not map to to this world, but hopefully you'll follow So if you have a build that is it's up to the business team whoever owns the business team Hey any build in this branch You guys can decide the ship at any time. You don't even need to talk to engineering, okay Then you have to then create a new incremental process such that you incrementally enhance that bill Right now I encourage this process because you don't want if you can get to a point where engineering Isn't part of the call of whether or not it ships Then engineering then becomes a little extra diligent around making sure that they're safe because This could be shipped by something that's outside of my control as you do that incremental then you do incremental testing so you you compare your bits to the RTM bits and Then you can use co-coverage you can use standard tests to really pair down What needs to be done and then if you then further enhance it with sort of an exposure rings with these monitors you really Pair down the amount of proactive testing that you need to do to achieve the same degree of risk prevention All right, let's do That's a decision you can make so if you're making it Yeah, so if you're making a claim that like what's different RTM and broad basically and you can you can make the same thing RTM is for users like me who shipped a lot of products before the web existed Yeah RTM and We had to we had to ship our code to some Factory and who knows where so that they can burn our code on discs. Okay That was the version of shipping to prod back in the day All right, their eyes tell me their butts are tired anybody had one last question Yeah back here I've heard from you So the question is if this is actually a good one to close on if agile is about adapting and we talked about people being resistant to change Don't those work against each other and the truth is is you're absolutely right, but people still are resistant to change it is people get set in their ways and anytime there's a Sort of you want to do something differently there are people probably like you and I am brand to like yeah Let's go first. Try this out and see what works. I really believe in trying things out Do a little bit of a time see what fails learn from that try something else There's there are other people who are and we've worked with them I'm not gonna point them out in the room Evan told me who they were beforehand but some people who are like I'm fine the way I am I don't need to change we don't need to do it differently So you have those on both sides and then you have people in the middle who are kind of just kind of waiting to see What happens? Yeah, whatever wherever you guys go. I'll go I'm going for the ride and So you'll have 20% on one side 20% of the other and then everyone know what the numbers are But yeah, it's you anytime you're making some sort of change even if it's about agile which is about being adaptive. There's You still have a people problem is another Jerry Weinberg quote I like says it's always a people problem and you always have to figure out how to What the motivation gonna be to get people to change some people are very much driven by data Some people are driven by you know more intrinsic things like simple just excited about Big fan of the Dan pink work talk about change Dan pink says that people are give people are motivated by progress So if you can show them with this change like oh, we're moving faster and cool things are happening Then those naysayers are slowly slowly jump on board You have to have a seed in which everyone agrees Like if we are all deciding that hey, it is valuable to the business that we ship every hour and And it's going to affect income growth something that the business values then Yeah, a lot of the adaptability can come into play but a lot of people Honestly don't believe in adaptability, I don't know if that's going to be here But they don't see it and they don't understand that value in addition to that Alan has this I'll let him decide if he introduces you to definition behind fragile teams, but you've all you've all encountered those teams where hey We're gonna be agile and then the person who's leading that agile transformation basically They read the first chapter of the Schwab book and then decided oh they get the rest of it and then they deploy Part of the concept that they picked up and and the rest of the stuff that they messed up or haven't fully absorbed And then and then discover Oh agile is a bunch of crap. It doesn't work It was primarily because what you did Wasn't agile. So when I probably go deep into fragile, but fragile is when you Just pick a few parts of agile and then try and go with them and they don't work for you But I one thing I want to make sure I mentioned before we close is Elizabeth Elizabeth Hendrickson. Thank you. Yeah, sorry Elizabeth She has this quote which I'll get all horribly paraphrase about agile the litmus test for agile is frequently delivering Delivering frequent customer value at a sustainable pace If you're doing that you're probably agile doesn't matter if you're to the book on something or far on the book But if you're too busy, it's really easy to get stuck in the process Like we've probably looped all the way around where we started But frequently delivering software at a sustainable pace and that has doing that May cause you to change some of the things we talked about today like how lines are blurred between what Devin test were forever and how Engineering processes work and who owns what how to gain those efficiencies to get that frequency that you need I I am also Don't encourage any more of the usage of the turn agile even though I've used it a lot here I definitely prefer adaptable agile means is highly overloaded It means multiple different things I May or may not those of you who are agile experts You may may not agree with me in terms of let's say a specific debate But hopefully would all would agree that adaptability is really what's critical really what's important and there's different Techniques and tools to get there. Yeah, one thing I learned from Brent was on the spectrum There's you know waterfall was a predictive model and then there was spiral and some forms of agile What you're kind of in that middle ground of their iterative models scrum is an example that so it go from Predictive to iterative to adaptive. I think the the right way to make software especially web software in Least for this decade might change ten years from now But I doubt it is to make sure you're adaptable make sure you're always learning From your customer always learning from your engineering practices, etc Anything else? All right. No, I think we've closed out. Okay once again, I'm not Brent I am. All right. Thanks everybody. All right. Bye guys
