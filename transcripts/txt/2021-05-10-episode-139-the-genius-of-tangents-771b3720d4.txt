Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show live From our my house and Brent's office. It's the AB testing podcast. Hey Brent. Hey, yeah The same place we've been for the last 14 months actually several of those you were in your house I don't remember the last a B testing we did together, but maybe it'll happen again Sunday. I am half Vaccinated as am I I got my first shot. I got a Moderna shot on a Monday I felt a little foggy a little tired on Tuesday But other than that I was good except for feeling like someone hit me in the arm with a two by four. I beat you by one working day Got my Pfizer shot last Friday no No symptoms except for again the two by four thing it basically Massive soreness at the injection shot just like any other vaccine I've ever had although a couple days ago, I started experiencing Stiffness. Oh, I thought it's gonna be superpowers because I can fly now. Oh Dude, not very far. I can fly about four feet But you know, I'm not sure I'm not sure I could do that before I was expecting Your your superpower to be to communicate with wildlife particularly grizzly bears Oh, yes, you missed it in the pre show Which you don't get to hear because it costs money. No nothing costs money here. But in the pre show Brent compared me to Grizzly Adams which much of our demo some of our demographic may remember some may wonder what that is But we'll let you Google that Yes, and I will tell you For those who aren't able to see the live stream. I will tell you. Oh My god, is it similar? the the the the We a couple episodes ago. I don't know Several episodes ago. We started talking about that the B in a B testing is about to refer to Alan's beard And if you go to our slack group at one of the three dot slack comm there's a link to sign up on modern testing org you can go to the Alan's beard channel there and Occasionally get an update on the state of Alan's beard and I am I am Claiming that is just just a short term amount of time before Alan's beard asserts itself and makes that happen of its own We are maybe a month or two away from the beard reaching a sentient Proper. Yeah You are one of the three if they get to it before you should post a picture of Grizzly Adams in the Alan's beard channel just to see if like separated at birth I remember watch that show when I was kids so vaccines good We've all heard that like basically 90 plus percent of the time that second shot is gonna kick your ass to some extent Yeah, I've heard that that's especially true with Moderna I will have my fingers crossed for you Alan and anyone else on Moderna I have I have preemptively marked two days off after my shot just in case And then there will be so my second shot is is essentially conflicts With our podcast next time around so we'll we'll have to do some schedule You can move it we can push that a week we can do other times I'm usually free in the afternoons because I work I Most of my team is in another continent, which reminds me I've been reading a book called the culture map just FYI for any of you that works with a global team you know, I've been doing it for a long time but still some insights from that book and understanding the difference across a whole bunch of attributes of Different cultures and just maybe a quick little book report what it does is it takes these eight or so attributes of communication and Then puts different countries on a scale whereas What seems really strict and rigid in one country may seem like chaos in another country Just so it all depends on your point of view of how you how you communicate for example You're probably aware of this but English being the Hodgepodge cesspool of a language it is has like two or three times as many words as a lot of other languages and What that means is we can be very in English. We are very explicit usually in our communication Whereas in languages with fewer words The subtleties are between the lines communication is much more prevalent and just being aware of that and how you communicate With people from different cultures is very important. So very insightful wasn't even on my list of things to bring up But that's what happens on the AB testing podcast Yeah In case there's a new listener I'll let you answer that but no I won't Alright, fair enough. I was gonna say you could answer that in a moment But just for any potential new listeners and we had a listener by the way who started from episode one and listened all the way Kudos to that guy. I think it was a guy now now I know I Mean I I offer my deep D I'm impressed on the other hand. Yeah, some of those it took us a while to figure it out But why is our podcast called a B testing? Well because the officially I think the checking meme started after we did the the podcast Should have been a B checking Yeah, just think of it ABC. I mean the t-shirt writes itself a is for Alan B is for Brent We don't know what testing is checking is for No You know what? Let's change it because a B checking is ABC Dude, I literally like 30 seconds ago said that like no, but I I did that thing where I what's it called when? See if you were a woman and I did that there's a term for that It's called he peed in no mansplaining is when I explained something to you that you already know Heeding is when I repeat it from you know being oh anyway I'm just it's not that I'm I don't have respect for you. Well, that's actually it. Never mind Yeah, ABC so and we're really not about testing which The only thing I worry about and in fact if you're listening I don't even know if getting more reviews or we have a lot of reviews and in the stores and we're very well rated Here's what I worry about. You know, we do this not for the fame and fortune we do this actually It's still to help testers and people from tests understand how to navigate the new world that is Unveiling quicker than some people like in front of them but I feel like there's a whole world of People in software development and agile team struggling to figure things out and all over the place who would benefit from our podcast but Maybe don't listen to it because it has the word testing in the title I'm not sure if that's true or not, but what do you think how do so my question is? We have we have a solid pretty consistent thousand ish listeners per podcast So thank you all of you It's really only three of you at a time and thank you for logging in for different IP addresses and and fixing our stats but I Feel like we've finally gotten to a point as we begin our 139th episode where we can Recognize that we provide value to a maybe a larger audience. So I'm gonna shut up and get your thoughts. Yeah I'll tell you the the thought process for why it was a B testing. It was rather Alan and I Were thinking through names. I Don't remember any of the other candidates we had Right, but I was thinking through. Okay, what is our desired audience? What is our expected audience? What is our desired audience and where Alan and are my interests am? for me a B testing Really resonated because number one, right it it Covered are you and me and sort of the expected audience? but number two It covered kind of where I thought at that point in time we would go Go really deeper in then we really really have It opened the door to sort of bringing in data science topics as well as Just sort of a B testing by itself is a really great modern testing tool So to me it was just sort of all the different check boxes got marked off with that The only the only flaw we've seen so far is In order for Alan to get rid of me. He has to find a good Co-partnered with a letter B But then the one of three even stepped up and you know That people can change to name right they pseudonym is is Is very cheap to advertise on right right burzy? Okay Okay, just curious on thoughts are that wasn't again also not on my intended topics one thing I wanted to mention and I should have put this in my five for Friday. I was stupid. I as mentioned before I have a new Mac M1 total subject change and As maybe I mentioned at least in five for Friday. I have a brand new big-ass monitor 34-inch ultra wide They're actually from this century my last monitors only had VGA and DVI inputs So without an adapter, I couldn't connect my Mac and it wouldn't be great refresher resolution So now that I have a proper monitor from the right decade I can have both my Mac and my Linux machine plugged in and they both can run 4k on this monitor Which is great, so I'm using my Mac more and I thought about getting a KVM I had a separate keyboard for my Mac which I was using me adjust my little bouncy ball I said on quite a bit, but then someone on slack again. I forget names, so I sorry Recommended this product called synergy, which is a software solution Do you write at Microsoft remember do you still have what was the thing called with all the tools toolbox or yeah? Code is that called toolbox toolbox interestingly without any input at all for me or anyone from Microsoft at Unity We now have a site called toolbox with similar things But anyway, there was a thing on toolbox called magic mouse which lets you share a mouse between Between systems which is really cool But this is keyboard and mouse you can share between systems via a little teeny little TCP server And it works really really well you can even cut and paste between operating systems The two machines you're using are your laptop in your home computer yeah Yeah, as I mentioned last time I'm not spending a whole lot of time on my laptop Yeah, my laptop kicks butt the new MacBook Pro M ones they completely rule from my middle son for graduating high school as well as to sort of prep him for going to your alma mater actually We bought him a Dell XPS 17 and it's so it's a 17-inch screen and I'm like why didn't I buy two of those that thing is sweet It's so big it's so big okay, yeah, that was that list although honestly the answer to that is at this point in time Like it I'm so trained. I'm like no I don't buy myself a laptop. That's works problem Exactly exactly you know I feel like we could almost do tech recommendations But I I feel like the kids out there know more about the new tech coming out sometimes So I rely on my Twitter followers to make it like I had them give me monitor recommendations I had to help me figure out if I should get the the 15-inch Intel MacBook Pro or go with 13 inch M1 and I'm super happy with the M1 things like that Anything else going on we should cover we have a mailbag and something else. I forget. Oh yeah anything else I had two topics. You know what they are anything else you want to cover before we dive into those 15 minutes into the podcast No, I'm good. I think it's important that our listeners get to know us and what's going on in our world Before we start talking about stuff that they probably don't care about as much which but which is occasionally informative Wow so those Like I'm staring at Alan and he suddenly shifted to like full-blown empathy mode in his body language, so So I'm not accustomed to it normally I the the face I look into is filled with anger around They don't call me angry weasel for nothing so okay. Where's this going? It's a trap. I've seen see the trap coming always a trap always yeah, okay? Hey, I wanted to follow up so a couple episodes ago. We talked about personality types and by the way Ray Dalio the author of principles one of my favorite books his company, and I forget the link But I just they have yet another Personality test which I did It's fine But I'm discovering of all of them as I dig into it and pay attention to this stuff And not all personality, but these little tests the working genius is is Giving me more and more value I'll tell you why in a minute But can you remind me of what your top two and bottom two are if you have those rent? That would be the two working genius and the two working frustration that is correct Thank you for digging out the right nomenclature for me Yeah, okay my two working genius our invention and discernment oh Yes, I could see that and frustrations Enablement and tenacity Okay, so that's good to know so let me as I dug into this more and thought about how this works And I had some licenses that I had some of my team go through it's been a little Enlightening if you think about how these work so the geniuses are they spell widget wonder and invention discernment and galvanizing and enablement and tenacity the cool way with the way these work which I didn't mention last time because I didn't actually realize it is When you think about how we make things Whether it's software Processes or whatever you start with wonder and invention You ponder things you figure out. I wonder if we could do it this way I wonder the way you come up with a good idea is come up with a lot of ideas or the bad ones out Wonder is are great at that They just throw stuff out there with the full idea that we're gonna get some stuff torn apart and then invention is what are these new? ideas, but we don't go straight from there to actually implementation there's That there's these middle steps of discernment of breaking down the idea making sure we're solving the right problem for the right people You are a discerner you enjoy Figuring out if what people think they want to do is the right thing and and making sure it's solving the right problem for the customer This this brings you joy. It does Very common phrase That I now use because as you know, I talked to lots of executives here at the company I will go to them and say I hear what you want, but it's my job to bring you what you need Yeah, I say that all the time too because I am also a discerner and sometimes they're the same thing sometimes So in the middle there is discernment and galvanizing and I sit right in the middle I just I'm able to break stuff apart like you do and I like to get people what they need versus what they want and It brings all that I can't do all of it Anyone can do all of this stuff But if you do the stuff that are in your frustrations, what I'll get to in a minute Eventually those kind of wear you out if that's all you do. So I live in the middle I rely on other people to In wonder and invent not that I can't wonder an event not that I don't but the things that give me the most joy are Making sure we're solving the right problem and then getting everybody rallied around solving the problem making making the team Understand what's important about what they do. I like when you go to Dan Pink's autonomy mastery and purpose I love bringing purpose to the work. It gives me joy If I feel like I can connect people with the work they're doing in the project we need to get done That's that's the kind of stuff. I like doing are you saying that your? To you didn't remind us of your I did I snuck it in there. It's it's the middle to discernment and galvanizing So discernment we just go galvanizing is getting everyone together on solving the right problem and your bottom my bottom two I believe are not one oh, it's a invention and tenacity and What it means is I can get people rallied around the project and again I've had tenacity before I can just I'm just gonna go crank this workout. So enablement is Giving you the support you need while you're doing the work and it could just you know I can do that and I've done that a lot. It doesn't bring me as much. It doesn't bring me joy if all I had to do is Get in the trenches and do the work and it could be just how I've changed over time But doing that enabling sorry not enablement in task of the enablement in my yeah enablement Sarah tenacity is in my middle So it's enablement and I was looking at yours enablement and invention I don't I Don't invent things often, but I love to jump in as things are invented and do the discernment so with you with Enablement and tenacity at the bottom Those are the both the things at the end of the building stuff So you start with one dimension you go to discernment and galvanizing and then there's enablement and tenacity So it sounds like you know, I know I've seen you do those things but what this says is that Those things don't bring you joy Gettin yeah, it's it's The thing with working genius here right they're talking about so you use the term joy for other folks Sort of derive energy from Would be another way of expressing it. It's not a negative thing. It's not that I suck at enablement or tenacity right absolutely, right it's Which doesn't mean I don't suck at those two as well, right? It's not making a comment on those on those statements is basically saying it's it's far more likely to be a energy drainer than a energy Refiller correct and the so the addendum I want to add it on today add on today And if this is all new to you, please go back and listen to a couple episodes ago We talked about this but what I didn't get before I thought was worth bringing up Is that the way these fit together around getting a project from inception to customers? Is this working genius? So you start with one dimension you go to discernment and galvanizing Is that these are leadership attributes of course and then enablement and tenacity is just getting that work done So I wanted to bring that up because one I learned that and thought it would add a nice cap on to our previous discussion but two It leads directly into a question from our mailbag Insert grab insert sound here if I can find it crap. I have a new computer I may have lost it just a second just in case I have to do this again All right, so the question from Sean It's been a while it's been a while welcome back welcome back Sean says topic I think might be interesting and Sean we think it's interesting too So you're you're right is walking through the life of a feature from inception to production whether in a fictional or real process to illustrate how collaboration works how you see roles on a team and what a team without Dedicated testers look like a lot of details here Alan mentioned in last episode that development is collaborative Of course and on a team without dedicated testers other developers may test the code sure everyone everyone tests It doesn't need to be the person to develop doing it all the testing. I agree. I agree I remember Brent saying previously that he asks about test process and data proving a feature works Yes, that's part of it that whole everything is a hypothesis. Everything is an experiment approach Yes, and then I'm sorry I'm adding too much stuff here all makes me curious how you might see a feature from beginning to end who might work on it Handoffs or whoever might be described from story writing to design to engineering release and monitoring I know every situation could be different, but what is an example of a process? Do you think works well maybe with comments and other ways I could work well Or what wouldn't work well any sort of handoffs never work well tell you that right now But let's talk through this we have I think we can make it we have like a half hour I think handoffs don't work. Well, I think handoffs are often often cause bottlenecks Yeah, it's it's interesting and I'm wondering if what I my team does right because We do a lot of I don't even know what the term is So intermittent pair programming Where it's essentially there will be? Folks working together then they'll separate then they'll come back and they'll separate right? It's essentially it's spontaneous V team of two I maybe that's another way of calling it. Oh cool Handoffs don't generally work. Well When it's a situation where you're also You're also hand in handing off out of the blue an unknown context Right. It's essentially Alright Alan. I have this spreadsheet that I just finished doing I need you to Successfully cluster the data together, you know, I'm making crap up because I'm looking at my other screen with this spreadsheet loaded Okay, I could see that I was thinking more of what I thought hand I thought Throwing stuff over the wall kind of handoffs versus that's a collaborative handoff really right. So let's Okay, so It's the nuance of the handoff non collaboration Is a bottleneck that all agree with? Okay, so let's start and I can pick it probably both have several stories here But let's kind of walk through a fictitious example. So But oh boy my first my first inclination before we wreck it is a suggestion to Sean to go read the lean startup because it probably I imagine where we'll be stealing liberally from Rees as we talked through this scenario. Yeah, there's there's actually another book I read And I forget the name of it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that one's really good. I read that a couple times Actually, you might have it's very old But it had to do with what do you say a man you saying I'm old Well, yeah, you are. Okay. I mean Yeah, you you know that But I'm still kind of I'm still kind of dealing with the segue from the last topic because I as you rightly call it out It's not much of a segue. It's more of a tightening of the focus I'll bring up that that I'll use that as a teaser and if I can tell that story later In context, I will you'll completely forget the story in the next two minutes. It's alright All right. So let's start from idea Let's say I have an idea for a new product or I wonder or something or a new feature So, oh, let me start here. There's a better way to frame that How do you figure out what the next feature is you're going to deliver? Well, you start with start with a Need gaps in some fashion. No, no, no you start with Things you think that would be cool to do I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Do you? Well, we both know sadly some people do that's some people do and that's wrong it's Ideally you understand or have a way to understand what the biggest problems are your customers or potential customers are facing Yeah, or like you said you just you just fully own the fact that you are the second coming of Steve Jobs And then you do whatever the hell you feel like did I tell you about the time at Microsoft when one of? Someone who is no longer there was a partner test manager who is known as a buffoon He reminds me of Mike Pence actually, but he compared himself to Steve Jobs and meeting I was in Like literally said well, I Steve Jobs has ideas and I have ideas are the same So what so in reality? I like to start with what's the customer problem? We're trying to solve and hopefully it's a big one or one of the biggest ones I like to start with the problem versus the feature idea and then I refer to Weinberg which is until you can think of at least three different solutions to your problem. You don't understand your problem well enough yet that I agree with the And In even further I'll tell you the three I'll tell you what the three different solutions should be the one that is the low cost high risk the one that should be low risk high cost and The one that is right in between I get that I get that Do you actually I mean you're laughing but do you get the? The wisdom behind no I do it's it's it's a flavor of the Quadrant used often effort versus impact Yeah, I use that frequently, okay But it but they may not all be that way they all they all may have different trade-offs that may not be that may be More subtle than the impact versus effort But the important thing is is you don't as you know, just don't fall in love with your first solution So who's involved in figuring that stuff out who's involved in effort and impact and problem solving in the generic sensor in a Modern in a modern sense in a modern sense in a world where we live. So it's it's I was gonna say the whole team, but that's that doesn't even cover it because The the problem statement could come from user research as part of UX. It could come from marketing It could be product management Could come directly from customers through a series of forum posts or scathing articles. There are lots of ways for you to understand that problem, but you you won't understand the effort impact Quadrant until you get your development team involved understand because a lot of times you really can't understand Which solution is most feasible and viable until you can get people brainstorming about the different solutions Well, yeah, but I think you're you're not at That phase yet. It's right. The very first thing is is how do you know? when To even bring it that idea to that forum. I Guess I'll be the first to bring up the the Eric Ries story, right? It's essentially In lean startup. One of the things that he talks about is how they very deeply Began to invest in What Eric Ries now will proclaim it was a just a fundamentally stupid idea right, um But it's very easy to get spun up and believing that you have found a an important gap and Work through that right if we do if we use your system the widget ordering like Wondering is hey, where is their great potential? So they got to that phase they basically said hey We think it's gonna be absolutely Fantastic to do blah blah blah blah blah blah and there's a lot of people who are doing that and and you know you just have to watch, you know three episodes of shark tank to get a good sense of the diversity of of How people will come up with with new potential and and even Stand behind it now the question is in my mind in in them and that's always happened in in throughout history like you and I have talked through Like how many times in the old-school Microsoft did we go and see a requirements document? that You know was was either unfounded by any sort of customer statement Or or very loosely founded. Oh Darn often. Oh my god. It just drove me crazy. Even when I didn't know what was better. I knew it was wrong right Right. Yeah, and back then one of the challenges were Was we really didn't have the ability to To do anything differently right, so this this this person did two-hour call with a customer and That entire deck came from that call right from one Customer right, but we didn't have the ability to scale customer feedback back in those days, right? Right. Okay, because we didn't ship anything told True again, so okay, so we're vetting We're figuring we're doing a bunch of work up front to make sure we're building the right thing Let me fast forward a little bit and say we feel like we have what's called product market fit Okay, what happens next and who's involved? So are we to the are we now to the let's figure out exactly what we're gonna build to solve this problem? So if we found product market fit is it let's say we've selected the best what we think is the best solution Actually, we see we see even experiment solutions Yeah, have we already discerned solutions because I think the first thing like wonder is the exploration of opportunity That's how I view it. Yeah. Yeah, so you're right. We need to discern the solutions It can't like I said, it's more it's usually more subtle than just effort and impact if there's like a There's a low effort high impact. It's just we could probably just go forward and try it, but it doesn't always work that way I just realized my dog is laying on my foot didn't know she was there great back on back. Look a squirrel Okay, so I like the idea of discerning solutions again A lot of companies fall in love with their first solution a lot of feature teams We're as discerners especially and as disciples of the lean startup we say BS to that So we want to discern the solution. Let's talk about how that happens. Who's involved in that? Discern we got we skipped over invention. I think invention. I mean No, no, so the very first thing so wonder so this is actually really cool I did not play I knew there was a segue But you are actually tying this phase of working genius directly in here, which I kind of love some let you keep going And I'll remind you My working genius is invention and discernment. Okay, so I in some regards. Yeah Because I don't really care about about about that first part I want to get to discernment and galvanize But anyway, go on so wonder I go back wonder is is around The the gift of seeing an opportunity and a need And it's a gift. I I wish I could load an example But have you ever sat down and briefly thought hey, you know this particular something or other Sucks, how come they don't make it this way? In I wish I could come up with a really good example here. It's something actually my wife does quite often She she will go why why doesn't yeah, anyway I can't even let any of her examples at the moment the closest example I can think of is back in the day Do you remember magic cards with did you ever get sucked into magic cards like magic the gathering? Yeah. No, I never played. Oh so Literally 90% of my spare income in college went to magic cards. Okay, and What I would do is I turned it into business. I actually created this whole Offline auction system where people would send in bids and I did it on Got news groups like this was before the internet and I had generalized it But you know what? I I was thinking of I had a need Okay, I had a need I had a full end-to-end bidding system and in different types of bids But I don't have that gift of wonder so it never it never immediately inherently Registered that hey if I generalize like the the money I'm selling off of these magic cards is Less valuable than if I found a way to generalize this whole auction site Yep, right and that was the thing that Amongst other things the the other thing is it's not on here. I have the vice of being completely lazy But that was one key thing which is why you're not currently talking to the CEO of eBay because I Didn't think broader around that potential Okay, so it never occurred to me that there was a global need on that one Once you I've identified a potential need then then how do you generate ideas? How do you generate solutions to that question is you bring in domain experts and you have a Brainstorming session you do not and ideally the customer is part of your domain experts yet that yes right now In in in in some models they call this feasibility analysis opportunity analysis That's where you going through and you say, okay How do you take this thing and understand the pros and cons? What would be the constraints out of the solution? There's many a times where I'll come to you Alan on certain things You can you go I don't know the solution and then with a few precision questions I can really understand that well at least you know the constraints on on that solution So if there is a solution, it's now not this big grab bag of thing It's got to be in a much much smaller space Right. For example, you may say hey, I need a solution for something But I need it in the next two weeks. So anything that's gonna take longer than that is not going to be a solution Now now with that constraint you can bring in people and say okay, what can we do? within this time period on discernment intuitively and instinctively Evaluating ideas and situations that is one of mine And I don't know that if I say so there certainly I don't I do it intuitively. I'm gonna in I'm I'm an end But instinctive I don't so this one I I'll say for me. I am very able to sort of very quickly I think of it in terms of the strength finder. I'm an ideater Okay, I see how I see all the dots and I see how they're all connected Let's tie all this to how a team does their stuff So you need to you need to vet the ideas discern the ideas and figure out I'm gonna fast forward a little bit because we do need to take time to figure out which is the best solution I can Bend on time it can depend on customers and market and other pressures Lots of things can influence Which decision you choose? in in terms of Modern testing and in tying it to that the process of discernment I'll be super tactical on this You get the right group of people together you identify what are the three MVP things? You then prune those down because no one really fully understands what an MVP is They always turn it into a friggin beta. Yeah, absolutely. That's true and they go Well, all we want to do is what is the cheapest thing that we can do to sort of test these things out? Yes, and that's that's a 100% Yes That's what you have to vet it down to is what is the least amount of effort we can do in order to get Feedback that will tell us whether or not we're going in the right direction Right and yeah, I totally echo your people Bastardized the MVP term into something much much bigger and it drives me freaking nuts They just don't get it and makes me angry when it really shouldn't so no it's because they overload What the point is? Right it it's not an MVP's goal is not To generate customer happiness No, no, it's it's getting to generate Learning right generate learning. So now We figure those things out Let me know if I fast forward too much But yes, absolutely part of discernment should be breaking it down and then part of that if we go through the working genius stuff is Getting the team aligned and I'm gonna repeat something I've unfortunately had to say in several different conversations this week is that alignment is not consensus and Get the team aligned on What what they're doing what they're trying to learn they get it Intel you this goes with the rallying cry and tell the team under team 100% asked to fully understand the problem of solving and Be aligned on the solutions are putting in place and what the plan is in order to do that. So that is Everyone on the team if you have a dedicated tester testers are generally people with that testing background I'm not gonna say mindset, but that testing background are very good at discernment generally They're good at asking those questions and figuring things out. Maybe not as good as getting everyone aligned, which is galvanizing Probably why maybe it's cuz I'm a galvanizer that I work on alignment so much now. I have to go ponder that later Okay, so anything else to talk about there before we get into Really the nitty-gritty in the last 10 minutes here, which is all of the implementation of this stuff and who's involved How do handoffs work those sorts of things? Well, so I kind of go old-school Agile on this is that you You sort of create an assembly line of the work and Part of part of that work advancing forward or are essentially spot quality checks If you think about acceptance reviews Generally in scrum you have an acceptance criteria either generated or negotiated with the product owner When the scenario is complete there should be some form of an acceptance review, which is Essentially, okay. I now have implemented what I thought we had agreed to let me validate that It was what we agreed to yeah, I would go back one step. I think yes, you do those things But it's important also This is where if you have a dedicated tester they'll help but if not it has to happen Anyway, is you need to think about all of that validation and testing as part of planning We make our teams think about a test plan and you can make them think about testing How are you gonna know this is gonna work in production up front? This actually goes going back to Reese. It's What asking that question? How will we know this is successful in production? Right, it's essentially it's essentially asking Before we begin How do we know if it's if it's working or failing? Yeah, and what and ties into I mean, there's this really old-school thing failure modes FMEA but the idea was to think about all the ways your application could fail before you shipped that that FMEA is Super old-school and super heavyweight, but there's a flavor of that you need to do in addition to Success metrics is how are we gonna know like just thinking about say I'm shipping a new Website that's a good generic thing before I go live I want to get an idea of how I'm gonna scale for load just in case people actually go there Things like that just being able to think about those things upfront as part of planning That's a new thing for a lot of developers who haven't Been in a team where they didn't have dedicated testers before So that's where if you have one you can help out but over time and I've seen this in many many many teams It's not too hard to get a development team to think about those things, but you can't forget about it either Yeah, the other thing with handoffs like in terms of handoffs that the I mean it's essentially It kind of goes back to the sort of the stakeholder thing. Are you handing off because? Hey in terms of what needs the additional polish that needs to be added is best suited by a different set of experts or Is it is the handoff really lightweight and it's more of an inform or an improve much like the story? mentioned around product owners the I'm thinking through I'm reading through Sean's question again and We've kind of touched on answering so sorry Sean, but you know, this is what we do here Well, we got five minutes left. So I'm wondering maybe we can go succinctly through like the thing that I this all makes me curious How you might see a feature from beginning to end who might work on it Maybe handoffs or however it may describe from story writing to design to engineering to release some monitoring Okay, we've talked we've talked maybe a little about some of this but not maybe not the best Yeah, we kind of did a piecemeal We did we covered some good stuff the a B testing podcast Come to us for a tangential talk. We got that one nailed from story writing right in Initially that once that to me is it's very customer-focused. It's And this is one of my challenges that I constantly see is it's no it's not about the work The story needs to be about the outcome How do we know we got there and who cares what's the context so completely agree with story writing then from the story It says as Alan and I just just sort of I'll say detailed with double quotes Okay. How do we decompose that? How do we generate? What are the alternatives? What and with a heavy focus on on lightweight in my humble opinion because the one thing that's The one thing that's missing from Sean's Discussion because he talks about story writing to design to engineering to release some monitoring in my humble opinion There is a bunch of sort of the the loops through the system. I Mission accelerate the achievement of shipable quality Shipable quality may not be achieved in the first time the code goes to prod right? It could just be a a an MVP that's missing a lot of things a lot of Solidification because you're really just trying to determine is this idea something anyone freaking cares about? But then you'll you'll go back to the drawing board add add additional hardening or or pivot entirely to sort of Submit the direction that the the idea came from Obviously monitoring needs to be in place That I think is another tool for answering the questions that that we just talked about is this is this anything cares about? Hey, we we operate under certain assumptions that So, for example, maybe we didn't test if it can scale beyond a thousand concurrent callers and We're suddenly way more popular than we expected Right. Obviously, I would want monitoring in place and I would have a discussion around Hey, if for some as an example if for some reason This exceeds what we tested for I want to monitor in the system that comes and tells me that I need to be observing this near real time because we May have made a decision to ship it too soon Right if if we tested it for for a thousand and it's a million callers Right. We may want to roll back True true One last thing to touch on I think and maybe we have to take some questions on this and answer more detailed questions These open-ended questions aren't are not good for a be testing, but we do get some we do generate more questions from those which is good I've been thinking like ever since I first brought up I but I questioned handoffs I think it's worth just doing a quick recap on those because we do believe in teams of specializing generalists or generalizing specialists and Often whether it's a testing special or some testing background or performance or database or any other specialty Which may live in just a few people on the team Avoid the throw of the wall handoff. I think what we try and do on our team. We do a lot of pairing when we have expertise Because we want a collaborative handoff and I don't even think of it as a handoff when we need a bunch of We need to make sure that networking is set up correctly for a new GCP cluster Jesus Christ Welcome to crazy world Collaborating with a network engineer on the team who has some expertise there It's a quick and easy way to do that versus and generate some learning on both sides versus just Giving it to a network engineer and saying hey I need this do this for me because I don't like handoffs like that they when I think a handoff should be a collaboration between the hander and the handy There may be places so there was guidance that I learned and I'm trying to figure out I'm looking at my bookshelf. I don't see anything there. But one of them One of the places that I learned around there is a role for specialists, right? as the name might State it needs to be something special like security Deep security is a specialization and if you're in a business where you need that Right, but the one thing to be cautious about is by its nature Handoff to a specialist is a bottleneck, right? That's that was my the moment of my cringe earlier fully agree. We're on the same page, which is weird But you know sometimes unavoidable, but it might be necessary and the way you account for that is Is essentially you look at? You you then have to figure out how to optimize that particular bottleneck And in terms of your end-to-end plan, you're gonna have to think through okay. How quickly is that bottleneck? Getting through it sort of independent queue All right. What does that mean for our timing? How do we how do we change our scope? How do we go with a different solution in order for me to make sure that the end-to-end thing? Reaches market while there's still a viable window off of opportunity Anyway, yep, so anyway lean startup regurgitated. We'll call it that fan test ago With some nuance in there. All right, we should we should call it a day it is or call it a Friday Or wait call it another lonely day. You can go your own way, Brett All right fantastic Again showing my age Yeah, all right. Well, I'm Alan's beard and I am Alan's beard's predecessor The wit on you is amazing. All right. We'll see you next time Bye
