Welcome to AVE testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show We are back. Yeah, how are you man? Hey, it's summer Depending on you know what depending on the table depending on Guess where you're at. It's either summer now or summer yesterday Yeah, it's by the time you hear this it's summer for everyone. It was summer a day or three ago for everyone Yeah, I was yeah, so that's our weather forecast. That's the weather forecast section So many stories on I have lots of feedback about the podcast. I want to share. Okay You ready? I so I don't know where to start I was gonna let's do that first and then I'll talk about what I did and then I'll talk about what we're doing And then we'll weave in some AI and by that time we'll have done nothing for 45 minutes and we'll end the podcast It'll be great so Seems like we should have a theme song for feedback like we We know it You know what we embrace it and here's the deal. I was talking with my ever supportive family this week, okay, and None of which who have my wife accidentally listened to part of an A B testing pod. Oh Let her know that nobody else has heard Sorry of an A B testing podcast and we're talking about it with my son at dinner the other night And you know, I have friend I have friends that listen and they like it. My wife says like my son asked I think my wife said you knew dad has over 200 episodes on his podcast Because that's great. What's the podcast about and she looks at me and I look back at her I said, it's kind of hard to tell It says it right in the intro Whatever comes to mind that's what happens if you skip past there And whatever comes to mind it is kind of what we do but the reason is and she's not listening to this one so and Anybody that's already given up on us isn't listening also. So just to satisfy my own ego the reason We discuss stuff like this is because in these discussions as where the nuggets come out Brent and I did not start this podcast ten years ago and start building modern testing principles and talk about how delivery was changing over time and try and Find ways again. We don't event we find ways to talk about what's going on in In those discussions We have to have the back and forth and me making fun of Brent and Brent calling me names and show me I'm number one and in that we find the nuggets that are worth listening to and finding out that we can build on for the Next recording so this is all for us because we're good at kind of balance and stuff with each other and figuring stuff out and going from there and Eventually coming up with some ideas that some people kind of like Brent disagrees no We go wrong this is the last episode of the A.B. Testing podcast we're breaking up B for that A will be Sam for ADHD and B will be I guess random brainstorming with whoever Alan finds The yeah, no, I agree with everything you said just got on smart then just without the heavy tinge of like self-esteem issues like No, dude, have you is it your first time meeting me? Oh Wait, no, just podcast podcast Alan not have self-esteem issues. I Did I let the other Alan leak in I do not Apologize in any way shape or form for what we are like that's I mean it is what it is No, and it is what it is on purpose and I would fully understand it would be it it's gonna be a hard podcast for some people to listen to and I'm speaking to what's the opposite of the choir cuz I'm speaking to the people who are not Listening to this episode because they chose to opt out at some point and that's totally cool opposite of a choir Like preaching to the choir or what's the opposite? Well, so if your patients acquire Right, I guess not Because it's not preaching to the people in the pew because they're still listening it's kind of like when the when the One kid gets is really rowdy in class and gets sent to the principal's office Then the teacher punishes the rest of the class Or when somebody's late for work and everybody gets in trouble those sorts of things like it's the wrong. It's the con Anyway, I have to do the podcast and doesn't matter It's not a captive audience. Okay, you're correct. Yeah, you're correct. The Point is that I wonder if my little pop filter worked on that I will fall find out in the recording now that I don't really edit anymore The point is that we have to Discuss and meander because if we don't do that, we'll never find the great ideas now We could you and I could just talk not recording for Hours upon hours and then eventually like once every four months collect our nuggets into one Into one little thing nuggets are diary Yeah So that's that and let's move on to a new topic. I had something else to talk about. Oh, do you ever write? Just stupid code because it like yes, of course you do because you're like me and you hate an efficiency Can't resolve the idea of stupid code. I know I Give you an example. I'll give you an example of the kinds of things I do because they're kind of fun well, one thing I do at work is I Probably shouldn't be writing code in my position But sometimes I like doing some little things like querying github API to find some things out because I know I know Python and graph qls that are etc. I Don't know if I told the story on the podcast before but My son is very anti big company refuses to have a Google ID on his computer Does not want the tracking him and yet we need a way for him to View and add to our family calendar Now I can give him a link that allows him to view what's in it read only But I don't have a great way for him to add things to our calendar without a Google account. Okay, you follow him I am and so Huh, I got an answer. So Google has this thing there It'll probably shut it off at some day because it can only lose money. Are you familiar with? Google app script. No So Google has this app script thing that integrates with their apps and you can just write stuff and have it run basically as a Cron job or on a trigger to do stuff and I wrote one that looks for Males coming in sent you I could give the address but an angry weasel comm address and when they come in there Can they come in as calendar invites or they're rejected when they come in? They're parsed and added to the shared calendar. Okay, so pretty easy to do works out great He can just put as far as calendar he invites this address and it shows up It's great and it just I just got an error. It just started failing which means that Google changed something in there in their app script Api, so I have to go fix that I was just fixing that when you showed up So anyway, I write so many little things like this Like I kind of enjoy it because I don't get to really write code as part of my job anymore And I'm far enough removed. I probably shouldn't but I do like little hacks like this So do you have any little fun little hacks like that, Brent? I spend a lot of time writing Code, but I make sure Like the difference I guess I make sure the difference between the two of us in this case Right, um is I can still make sure that the code that I'm writing I'm not critical path Right. Yeah, there is a lot of So like in my particular team, I think I've made some this before and my team's improving Rapidly, but I mostly have a team of data scientists But we are a full stack data science team meaning We build our models, but we also build the services and and ship those services that use those models right, and so that means Unfortunately most data science programs Don't train on oop don't train on Hell don't even train on C. See anything C sharp C flat C anything So and in I have Spent time in dev so a lot of the times Like I'm spending time refactoring code Which I enjoy because I I absolutely love fixing broken things I was telling one of my my ICs today who who got so inspired that he went back to he's got his PhD in I Forget the official title, but it's essentially in supply chain management So he's well trained as a data scientist, but that doesn't teach him coding and he's decided He's gone back to Illinois University to get a masters in in In computer science and I'm like right on Anyway, I was telling him one of the one of my measures of a good versus great dev Have we ever talked about this? No a good developer writes code a great developer Deletes it. Oh, maybe you've held that before. Yeah, but that's that's not universally true There's some nuance in that answer. Yeah, it's I mean No of all developers write code Like my to me a great developer does delete code I completely agree with that one and it is hyperbole but just because you're right good doesn't mean you're a good developer Like that's the only part of that little cliche thing. But the whole point the punchline is Deleting code is a bigger art form in my view than writing it And I think it's knowing which code to delete. It's understanding. There's a lot that goes into that. Yeah, that's There's some missing parts of the story. We all get what you're saying There's it's about refactoring the designs of the things are cleaner like number More often than not the things I'm deleting are duplicated code or oh if they had designed it this way Then this whole other function wouldn't have been needed right up. But yeah, I'm not doing So I do a lot of refactoring after the teams got going and I use that as educational moments But yeah, yeah, yeah way back when I worked on teams, I did a little bit of hands-on stuff But I always pick what I always described it as do the important because nobody wants to do unimportant work do the important but not critical work and if it ever becomes critical and I haven't finished it note that in advance and Pass it off, right? Right, which I've had to do a couple times. I can probably do on Xbox once give your heads up to to the victim to be Yeah, and we had a pretty good collaborative team there. And again, I always create I Somehow I create little utopias of folks that work within chaos and we did that there so it wasn't really an issue there is one of my old employees by the way, we keep on connecting and They said we should get together and we go to get together and then kind of the our message dies and he never follows up So Dan if you're listening, we're supposed to hang out sometime Something else I was gonna tell you Oh Have you heard of modern testing? modern Right you're such a So I Know one of our listeners Asked me to give a talk at a Leon asked me to give a talk to their company just remotely We had a the Juneteenth holiday here. So Wednesday morning I gave a little webinar to a bunch of folks at his company in England. I talked about now it was interesting. I Don't like I don't give that many talks anymore. And I don't know what to talk about anymore because I don't know in a way. I'm tired of modern testing principles, but I'm not tired of them and I want to get to that So this podcast is looking for a topic. It's modern testing principles. So it's really nice He gave me like it'd be go for our company to hear about these three principles three and three three of the seven Oh three three of the seven principles. Yeah, and When I kind of put it together, I realized they went together Kind of well, and it was principal one are which is Brent Businesses everything. I mean I'm paraphrasing Yeah, yeah, this is everything so our priority is improving the business. Yes I believe it was then pretty which one is the acceleration principle we accelerate the teams now. I don't even know three three and then six we use data to to help to We should memorize these we use data, you know data that good Brand either. Yeah, we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and close the gaps between product hypothesis and business impact Yes, you with me now one is already Continuously accelerate. There is no accelerate. So can you do some for me? I think is what you're talking about because accelerate. Yeah Yeah, so what I found when I put these together was that They're all kind of about you know, we improve focus on improving the business We work on it and we can't do enough there. So work on accelerating the team so they can move faster and then data for decisions It really comes down to those three principles by themselves are a lot about the feedback loops Yeah, lean thinking and theory of constraints especially are about they build on improving the business and we're trying to Increase the feedback or increase decrease the length of the feedback loop increase the efficiency of the feedback loop And then when you're able to use data to understand how That gives you the way to quickly like super quickly understand because you deploy a little bit of a bit of a thing and then You can get feedback right away if that thing's working for a customer. Yeah, it's it's It's interesting you just bringing it the three and I'm looking at this and I'm like, okay And now looking at NTP with a totally different light, right? I'm like, okay Like if we just had those three Right. Let's say monetize some vegetables were just those three Now I'll tell you I'll tell you what happens when that happens, but you go ahead and with your thought. Oh, okay No, just tell me because well, right once once the police officer and Oh Do you hear the sign? Yeah, I'm being arrested so what I found when I was going I did those three and talked about them and then I realized I was putting together my presentation is you know, we had somebody pointed out many many years ago that The principals were very close to or had a lot of overlap with the three ways of DevOps from Jean Kim Don't know if you remember those at all, but no it those three especially But I talked about the modern testing principles being not that modern not that much about testing their delivery principles and they're very good delivery Principles, but the three ways of DevOps from Jean Kim's I think it was in his first book on DevOps Probably I think it predates Us I think it's 2012 2013 that came out. But the first way is systems thinking Which is seeing in his case seeing Development and operations as one big thing not as separate things being thrown over the wall The whole idea behind DevOps was get rid of the wall between Dev and ops It's all about delivering value to the customer. So system thinking see the whole thing right in there And this was the key thing because like the the wise guy The sorry, I don't want to say that way the guru in Phoenix project kept on talking about oh You've just figured out the first way Yeah, and because same author same is it's a way of putting that in there right and then The the second way is to amplify the feedback loops Make sure that they're apparent and obvious and we're trying to learn we deployed ops we learn comes back to dev We learn more we give it to ops to learn more and give it back to dev learning and cycling And then the third way is a culture of continual experimentation and learning. Mm-hmm And I just found it interesting How well those those lined up with especially principles two and six it's a lot about let's make sure well one Systems thinking is we focus on improving the business the business is the system Three whichever one or yeah three continuous improvement That's amplifying the feedback loops and six is a way for us to enable continual experimentation It is hard to do continual experimentation if you don't have the speed of using data for your feedback loop, right? In the know there I might with you like like it even says in in Principle like close the gaps of being product hypotheses if you mention the word hypotheses like you're You're thinking about experimentation Yeah, yeah And so anyway it I it popped into my head when I was working on the presentation because I haven't looked at it in a while and I looked at it and was kind of Pleasantly surprised maybe blown away is too hard, but very interesting to see how those line up So there is a nugget of takeaway That you all can take who are looking for valuable content in the EAB testing podcast. Yeah, it's interesting before you vote Jean Kim I was thinking of our near to right and And you could take the same three and In kind of plug-in right here and said but the thing is actually I guess that shouldn't be a surprise right because angel and lean It had a lot of different folks with different voices in a different view points all very much In alignment with each other but different language around how they explained What it was about right? Um right, Brennierdson Is fantastic like he was very quantified like I nearly got his his chapter around small batching Memorized like that was like how he described why you do small batches Which in my view is is in alignment with continual learning? Yeah, his whole book is around flow and systems thinking like he he would be a massive Yeah, it all fits together and what it comes down to Dear listener is remember Brent and I Don't really have many original thoughts But we bring in all what we know and kind of regurgitate it in a way We think makes sense to our audience So the number of the other four there's two things I'm thinking about now with MTP, okay, I Kind of wish we had this insight that you just shared like what is it seven years ago? Because now I kind of want to find a way to slightly rewrite principle one Dude, we can rewrite anything we want. No, I know I know that like it's ours You wish you would you wish you would have gone back in time kind of like in Deadpool 2 and When Ryan Reynolds goes backs and fixes the whole Green Lantern crap. Yeah No, I'll start thinking about this because I like our priorities improving the business like when we originally wrote that at least What was in my head was? We need to get testers Thinking about the system not about their small part like If you got if anyone listening to this podcast still believes That it's testers job to provide information. I really have to wonder at this point in time Why you still listen number one number two? Like you got to realize that that point of view is now Absolutely. No longer mainstream. Well the things we were trying to remember going back to the context on this It's probably good to go over this once in a while is that We were trying to help testers at the time navigate into this new world And we were clearly saying if you keep doing what you're doing now If you were your jobs at risk, it's not Unless you keep on doing exactly what you're doing now and hope it to keep working Testers have always been good at systems thinking so these were not reaches these weren't like here's your career change These are things you're capable of doing now If you do them you you are safe your job is secure. You will stay employed systems thinking super important and I get and I have been Messaged in and a little passive aggression from the world that I've talked about it before is I bring a principle one That's that's ridiculous. We can't improve the business. All we can do is provide information It's like maybe in 1994, but thank you very much And you know what if I knew what I knew if if I knew back then what I knew now I think I would have fought that too. I think so too, but There were different constraints right there was a lot more things we had to do proactive the feedback loop was a lot slower but You know, I honestly believe that the role of Q of QA being information providers was always wrong it is Absolutely wrong today. I think you know, I used to talk about this and just felt very Passive and the way it always felt to me. I want to get deep in this people people really feel this way those people don't listen to the podcast so it's fine, but it's It's like and then what like that's really all that's I mean, okay has always been my feedback on that even going back to Lessons learned in software testing which honestly has some good nuggets in it. It's a little repetitive It's kind of funny in some places purposely I give them full credit for that but providing information now No, no, no It's never been correct. It's never been correct like My very first podcast like not podcast but blog was around now our job is to remove risks from the system Right. It's not but we don't own the decisions Then what's wrong with you own the decisions Like we we we've agreed we shouldn't be owning the decision to stop ship or not But it is our job to remove to remove risk from the system Yeah, why can't why can't why are we where people trying to be information providers? Why can't you be part of the decision making progress? How come like I would feel so Unempowered if my job was say Brent. Here's everything I know and I I'm not I don't I don't have an opinion because it's not my job. Please make my choice for me It's probably that and I'm sure you have the term Memorized but that that bullshit was a cognitive distance or whatever the hell it is. Oh Critical this is yes, this is why developers can't test they don't have critical distance. Well, I'm being sarcastic It's also probably why we're just information providers because no we can't make the decisions around What's good for the business? No? Anyway before we get to like right now I'm thinking Principle number one somehow needs to term systems thinking in it. Oh Yeah, okay, right I like you want to take up like right well, let's do it later like right sure I'm like it's short and sweet. It's the only one of the damn thing that's sweet. So like Adding systems thinking is probably gonna triple the number of words But I wish it were there Yeah, but when we look at When we look at how these work today, so make these are apply these to the team like we wrote these as the Tester trying to figure out what to do is your audience Today, they're kind of a message for the team This is how you deliver in a way that won't get you all the way back to 2004 So it's the team's priorities improving the business now if you consider yourself to be in this separate little silo of testing and Even then you should have an opinion but the team like can everyone on the team have good systems thinking Yes, I would hope so Why don't they? I do believe systems thinking is trainable But I do also think But from my experience there there's there's kind of the forest people in the tree people like the people who kind of see the forest and people who see the trees and And I do think we need both I don't think one's better than the other because I like if I keep this awkward metaphor going the tree people are very good at the details Whereas the the forest people are good at the abstract and the strategy but suck at the details like for me Devils in the details is the bane of my existence. Yep. Me too. It drives me crazy we're doing but as I were doing budgets right now and they're in Excel and It's an absolute madhouse of chaos and I look at it and I just cry I Curl up in a ball and I decide to try it again another day that I understand The other thing you might try is drugs delegation That that also works as well There's such a you may know so there's I can say this fairly there's a lot of hierarchical Non-transparency so some of this stuff I cannot delegate because I'm told not to delegate it because there's fear that someone may see something that I'm supposed to in the budget and So yes, but normally absolutely delegate. This is right. This is what managers do and Once again, the podcast goes all over the place. I'm gonna reel it back in in a second But we I mean any manager like you delegate the stuff that not just you don't want to do But the stuff that'll help somebody grow and that they could actually do better than you I have a couple directs who do some things Made most of my directs do so many things So well that are things I can't do. I'm very very fortunate. I To me this is the lesson of strength finders that I walked away with right? It's essentially I'll tell a very quick story. I probably have already told it before one of the strength chapter 27 One of the one of the strengths is one called communication Okay, and I was once on the team that we had did every manager had to send a Weekly status report. Okay, I Would rather shoot myself on the head then sit down and write status reports, right? Because the are I am so this is one of the things that lean and agile has done to me I am so ROI focused Unlike no one reads these I'm just invest I'm just investing in it. I'm doing it because I've been told I have to The only thing that I can tell from the past experience is that the only thing is done with the status reports is that My management chain knows who's done it or not like there's some tracking system in place. Okay, and so One of my IC had communication And I this was early on in my my journey and strengths and I read it but the book what communications about and I Connected the dots because that's one of my strengths is connecting dots and I said hey according to this This guy might be good at it. Number one and number two love doing it Okay, whereas I have always like the other thing I do Is I take on the bullshit work that has to be done that no one really wants to do So like I okay, I could delegate the status report But I hate it and I'm not gonna pass on shit work to my people who's trying to do things that they're proud of But yeah, I wouldn't talk to him. I'll finish the story. I wouldn't talk No, good. I have a follow-up story as we continue our trip to tangentown. I Wait to him and I said Hey, his name was Renee Renee. I hate doing this. I do it because I'm told to do it Would you like to take it over I didn't delegate it to him I asked him would you like to take it over and I even explained to him why And he looked at me like I Just offered him the best Sweetest candy that could ever be given to anybody ever Okay, and he's like He no thought process about it. Yes. I want it Okay He started taking it over and it is the only time in my career Where I had external teams that I had never heard of before Asked to sign up for my goddamn status report That is the stupidest damn story in the world no I get it I get it and I don't really like them I think But I have an interesting story. I want to share as an alternative A lot of my team just post some recaps end of week recaps in slack which I can catch up on I don't require them to I have Jira. I talked to them. I could figure out what's going on I can get answers everything. I need to know it's it's it seems more like Box checking than anything else one thing my last manager did at Unity which was actually fun you know, I blog every week and I like to write and What he asked me to do and I'll I save the doc I'll scroll back I have a hundred page doc here I didn't write all at once but He just asked me to write Once a week Send me what you're thinking and like organized like I called him my my org name organizational notes and it was Sometimes about things going on on the team some things about something on our leadership team thoughts. I had about strategy or Whether it's organizational strategy or product strategy But I just every week I would write a list of top-of-mind topics and he would read it Every week and sometimes it'd be often but not always we stuff that would be discussing our one-on-ones go a little deeper into But it was more about it was less about Well, I think the difference is it's fair to say this now that we know that I have a job that's a little weird, but okay is I was in much more of a leadership position there and a little bit more of a management position here if that makes sense and so a lot of our discussions around the Moving the company and how can we do this and how should we work here should be what what? What organizational changes should we make across the org? What products should be billed? What things should we go invest in potentially buying or I bounce head like when I had org change ideas I could bounce them off of them. We'd have discussions. It was a good way for him to kind of know Just it was like we had a 20 minute Hallway conversation about something that I thought was super interesting during that week and that sort of thing I like doing I hate status reports and I Don't like them. I don't ask my team for them But I do like the idea of I haven't asked my team for these either. I'm kind of more Making sure the work gets done. But this idea of organizational notes was was pretty I Could just finish what one last thing before I forget is as I mentioned before just kind of capital up here It's one of the docks I saved when I left It's I just added to the same dock every week so I could keep my progression so I have little like this hundred pages of of notes that I sent him and It's it's I just kind of scrolled through our talking. I forgot about it. And it's You know, it's it's interesting. It's how I you know, you know, my leadership style of planting seeds It's how I'd plant seeds with them here. Here's the way I'm thinking about reorganizing the team I won't mention this again for another two months. But now it's not now it's it's in a cell in the back of your brain anyway, go No, so I like that. I don't know that I could do that with my manager because It depends on the manager a lot of what they want They don't want a wall of text like I'll and Steve. Hello Steve. Steve wants to be on the podcast sometime I'll let you guys talk but Steve does not want a wall of text Steve wants Steve wants little nuggets and that's fine. So you have to do it Luke at unity He wanted a wall of text. He was a thinker and he was not that Steve you're not a thinker People people want their information in different ways. I'm gonna shut up. Go ahead I'm more of an alignment. I think with Steve on this one with with my reports. I don't want a wall of text What I want to know is that you've thought about the agenda in that we have something useful interesting and or important to talk about like for me it's around Getting my people to be proactive around how they want to use their time with me I don't want to read at the point of a 101 is to talk through it and have an interaction and Part of it is for me to be a mentor part of it's me to be a manager part of like status Like I've I've explicitly told them like I don't want status reports. I don't want them even in the our 101s right because we have a daily stand-up I have a Separately scheduled office hours with with my team like status that I need to know about I'll know about But I like this idea of What's on your mind now the thing the thing I would like to do Because if I were to say it that vaguely They would probably think of it as again agenda items for our 101 It depends it depends on the manager in the relationship and it's gonna be different because on both people It's gonna be different in every single case I know Luke asked for this of all of his directs and I'm probably the only one that did it regularly I know that a lot of people Luke would send them to me to show them minds they get some ideas So it's just I like writing and I like writing in paragraphs and prose far more than bullet points So it worked out really well for me. Yeah, and so that worked it was the right combination and You're always adjusting It's like it is a how the hell do we get from modern testing principles all the way to manager employee relationships? But here we are, but there is a lot that's important and just you just have to figure out what each other want to move forward And that's it's an art but we everybody does it 20 or 30 times in their career and it's fine Just recognize that people are different strengths finders people are different. They want different things. They're motivated by different things They enjoy different things and they hate different things Don't as long as you don't think immediately assume this is where Myers-Briggs versus well just don't assume that everyone's exactly the same and You'll be fine and I can even tie that back to make a big loop and get back to AI which we haven't talked about It's been 45 minutes. Oh my god. If you can get all the back to AI That's the problem when you have AI right pros AI. There's no human element. It's like you're It's it's good. It's kind of good. It's accurate But it kind of doesn't look like something a human would write yet I don't know if I agree with I do agree you do I do you do agree with your own statement? Because I use well, you know, we use chat GPT and the thing I wanted and I want to add a whole thing I asked before I'll just shut up in a minute here But I was trying to weave it back to AI but it's far too late We have to close up in a few minutes But the the people are coming in from the street to figure out what's going on. I Asked chat GPT before we started I did I use the Allen bot that Jason Arbin made. Thanks Jason and I can't find the window anymore. I have so many tabs open and I asked it for some topics So what are some new and interesting topics Alan and Brent should discuss? On the A B testing podcast and we're gonna do this next time and then I'll get all your thoughts because I've used like 80% of the recording time on this podcast It said given the wealth and experience and evolving perspectives of Alan Brent in the field of software quality a fun new and relevant topic for the A B testing podcast could be Worth the drumroll sound effect. Good. It's good. The role of AI in modern testing hype or hope It which is a discussion and a talk I would never give we haven't done that I do I do want I think there is strong potential for AI in testing and the strong potential is in none of the things people are talking about and How's that for a teaser? Brent what's on your mind? What topics can you remember from this podcast? AI The one from 30 seconds ago nice nice work. Give me one second. I'm trying something out right now Brent is Well, we're talking before well, he's trying that we were talking before the podcast started and I Brent stood up to go get the door He's wearing pajama pants cuz it's Friday, you know, it's we're working from home Friday and I'm wearing shorts because I took a little break to go to the gym later and I Learned a phrase. I think I might have shared this before we're sharing again For those of us that work from home and we wear shorts and sweats all the time and then we decide we're gonna go out In public we have to put on our hard pants That I completely understand and everybody knows what it means as soon as you say it even though it's a made-up board I love it. I gotta go grab some hard pants. I'll be ready in a minute. I often Forgo that just to be quite honest. I'm like, you know what all of the naughty bits are hidden. I'm going outside screw it You know, I'm trying to look good Hey, if you I do have one thing I want to mention at the end here once you're done here with your little chat GPT thing which is providing no value right now. What's the thing you want to mention Brent? Oh Okay No, you you so I'm an ideater like the strength stuff, right? Am You're an idea monkey Which means I connect the dots between things and when Alan says oh I can't write it like a human being and we we had just briefly talked about Myers-brakes. I'm like, oh I have never tried But what I just did is I said, all right summarize AI and testing and it wrote a bunch of words And I don't really care. Okay, but then I said now rewrite it as an ENFP Okay, and now actually rewrite as I am TP that's both of us. Oh, yeah Riveting Now what would be interesting in pattern matching and maybe I don't know if a gen AI could do this or some some graph paper But take all of things strengths finders working genius insights Myers-briggs plot them all because we're different we're the same on a Myers-brake but different everywhere else kind of map the the Communication work what and what Alan enjoys DNA So I Whoa That's getting another homework assignment. No, no, that just registered like for me like so You've made fun of me on this in the past like straight. I have Myers-brakes I think in a general sense is actually really good Strike finders as you know, I think it's a lot better, right? What was the the the big big five big six is another one? Yeah, right and I'm like What fun for for me on this one is? Okay, if I had Alan Take all of these tests and then I betcha I don't even need to feed the data on it because I bet you open AI already knows I'm like, whoa What could I do with that? Yeah, it knows it like So now I have your test. I just Narration what it knows is Brent types in what is ideation and it kind of explained it in the whole Strix finders way Can I go? Yeah Like the fact that it knew I didn't tell its strengths when it pulled it up like it knows what I'm talking about well, except it's a Anyway Ideation kicked in I haven't gotten to the end result but my Ethicometer just triggered. I'm like, oh shit if I had that plus open AI I Bet you I could do a lot of really cool, but also a lot of really dangerous things Well, there's some there's again there's power in knowing What how that people are different from you and how to work with them and what motivates them There's a bunch of different tools that let you figure that out Some tools are about figuring out what you're good at Which is also what gives you energy some are purely about what sorts of activities Give you energy or are difficult for you to do about figuring out what you what's in your wheelhouse dial it in as a manager It becomes a cool orchestration device. So all good stuff. We've talked about this stuff before we're running out of time We did not we got to get out of here Brent. This is all good stuff We forgot to mention last time and we will not do another recording in June But I did want to call from a be testing a happy pride month everyone. Oh, yeah Yep, I think I Can cut this Brent if you want, but I think it's no for Brent and I we both have gay children and we're We love them just as much and they're awesome And I'm happy we live in a little bubble of a part of the world where they're they're safe doing that It's not that way everywhere in the US or in the world.
