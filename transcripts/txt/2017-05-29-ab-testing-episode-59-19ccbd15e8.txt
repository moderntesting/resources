Hey everybody, Brent is at a loss for words, but he is in the room with me. Hey Brent, you okay? No, no I'm not. Hi everyone. Hey, what episode are we today? 59. We are here at episode 59 of AB testing. Welcome the three and welcome new listeners and welcome all. We're an inclusive podcast. Don't you think? I do. So I was in, shoot, was it just last week? I spent all of last week in beautiful Copenhagen. I am so jealous. I blogged about it. Although I was in beautiful Copenhagen, I spent most of the time indoors. The full story is on my blog, plug plug, but we have an R&D training week and I attended. I haven't written C++ code in a long time and that the assignment was C++ and I wrote a lot of code and damn it if I wasn't gonna work till nine or 10 at night, every night, making sure I could finish the assignment to prove that I knew what I was doing. If I was successful, I wrote code that solved the assignment and did it very quickly using multi-threaded code and all kinds of goodness and then when I looked back at the code after I was done, I realized I wrote some of the crappiest code in my life. That worked. So I lost sight of the goal. Maybe the goal was to finish it and learn and I got the meta winnings out of it. I learned a lot how the Unity engine worked and I was able to make it work and if I wanna be optimistic about it, I'll say I wrote a prototype. If I were to do the whole exercise again, I would focus more on writing a lot of tests up front and doing more of a minimum viable product approach like I normally want to do, but I'm normally not programming something in a, it wasn't a competitive atmosphere yet it was. There were 15 of us and I didn't, I wanted, there were some people that knew what they were doing and they were getting ahead of me and I wanted to catch up. I was actually just taking your whole thing and thinking of it as a analogy for why waterfall sucks and why the scrum sprint model sucks because what you just described is exactly the code I see over and over again when someone's given something with a deadline that doesn't include. So maybe the difference is that I looked back at my code and said holy crap, this is shit and a lot of people would just go hey it works, ship it. But there was more to this. The point I wanted to get to, you can read all about that on my blog, it was a fun exercise, I'm glad I did it, very educational for me, I feel like I know so much more about the engine side, I focus on services as part of my job, so it was good to figure out how that works. I went through one of the tutorials in preparation for this, to build this tanks game and just amazing what Unity can do. I never, it's, I know I'm just scratching the surface, there's an amazing amount of stuff, but the point was that I, in this weird world of today, that sounds like the intro to a bad tech article, in today's modern world of engineering, it's like shut up, I posted the blog and my blog sends little ticklers to Twitter and to LinkedIn and of course all the replies to my blog post are on LinkedIn, because that's the way the world works today. And yeah, so there are no replies to my blog post on my blog site, but because when I post to my blog, it posts little tickler to LinkedIn, people replied and discussed it there. And then, I'm gonna make a long story longer, there was a discussion about whether developers could test their code and I said sure, developers can test their code as long as they wanna remain employed. And so I said well, somebody came in and, for lack of a better word, and I am a white male, so the last person that could really use this verb, someone mansplained to me, that what I was talking about wasn't testing, it was checking. And what developers do with their code is checking. And so. Wait, wait, wait, wait, I know where you're going. No, no you don't, no you don't. Well, I don't know where you're going, but I already have a rant sort of built up in my head or a suggestion, so before you add too many of these things, I'm old, let's close one out. All right. What do you think would have happened in this assignment? You said it was an assignment, okay? Correct. I wanna change that game. So the game I'm gonna propose is whatever your feature or whatever problem you had to solve, winner of the game is gonna be defined by who first wrote the first code, okay? But the game works this way. The assignment as you've defined it, as it was laid out to you, whatever the heck it was, you can write this solution in C++. But you tell everybody up front that this is due tomorrow. We're not going to tell you the next phase, but this competition is two parts. Tomorrow, everybody's name's gonna go in a hat and everyone's gonna get a new feature and you're going to have to add that new feature to the person's code who you draw from the hat. Okay. The winner is going to be assigned to the person who first wrote the code. That may work in a different scenario. What would it have done last week? This whole, the meta points I got out of it, which was grepping through all the code to learn how the engine worked, my hunch is that is the true goal of this. Yeah, I don't care. I do because I don't wanna get too much into details, but the assignment really was to one, write a component that will take, that will put an action on any game object in the game. It's write a component that you can apply to any Unity game object and have it do this thing. Again, don't wanna give away details in case Unity people are coming up. And then that one, supposed to test it with like 10,000 objects and the time was for all of us right around 800 milliseconds. Fast, but not game fast. So the idea was then is to multi-thread this using a job system much like thread pools, actually almost exactly like thread pools on Windows, but cross platform for threading. Learn how to use this brand new job system. Not documented, but very well documented in header files, not documented in words and examples. Yep. So in doing that, in learning how to use this, the first part was fairly easy, just doing some math. Pretty much everyone had that done the first day. The next day's assignment and the next couple days, we would have classes in the morning about all kinds of different stuff, but the, was to continue to iterate and refine this using this job system to, one, to really, the goal was to learn the job system, maybe it was the primary goal, maybe secondary, with the parallel goal, I'll say, of learning how the engine works by having to grip through all kinds of code to figure out how what you're doing works. I get that. And I also get where you're coming from, yes. I think it teaches code maintenance and writing code to be maintainable if you have to build on top of somebody else's code. If you knew. It's a different exercise. If you knew, and I get that. I'm just trying to, I'm trying to address the, you solved the problem, screw you devs, I can write C++ too, get that, pat yourself on the back. But the, it's not anything that you would check in. It's not anything that you were proud of. So what I'm trying to think through is, how do we change the system such that you would have naturally said, no, I'm not done until I know that the next guy that's picking up my code is going to be able to move forward. So ask me a different question. Ask me how I would improve the exercise for future people taking it. Hey Alan, I have a spontaneous question for you. You are so damn smart, Brent. Yeah. Ask me anything you want. Anything? Yes. Anything? Whatever comes to mind. How about, how would you improve this exercise in the future? Well, thanks Brent for asking. It's something I've pondered just a little bit. I think I spent a little bit too much, and some of this is worth it. I think if you've done any amount of coding grepping around the internet and trying to find little samples of how to do things. There's some learning in that that goes beyond just coming up with the right solution. But I feel like there was a little bit too much of that head banging against the wall, not sure how this to work. I would have loved a little bit more documentation to accelerate, still make you dig around a lot, or at least examples of other code doing something similar so I could still have that learning of grepping around the system, but made a little bit more progress. And I would have loved if the goal was to, at the end, your code is ready for check-in. Meaning, not only is it complete and you think it's ready to be reviewed, but it has tests written for it and you feel like it's robust and solid and everything's done for it. We had a couple tests that were written for us as part of the framework, and we could have added to that. I never got to that. I could have written them first, then I wouldn't have finished, but I would have loved to, given my background, written a whole bunch of really great unit and integration tests for this component to prove its reliability, to prove its performance, along with being code that, I feel like this is code that really, really works, but I couldn't get there. And actually, only a few people got to that stage where it was, in fact, they didn't even get any tests done. Nobody, I don't know if anybody that had, actually, there were two people who work on the engine full-time who maybe got some more tests written and had a working component. But I think it would have been better if the goal was to get, and that would have been more of a Unity developer workflow. How to get something ready to check in, go through a couple real code reviews to see what kind of feedback you would give or get and how you'd react to those, learn from each other's tests that they wrote, some things like that. So we didn't get to those because there was too much headbanging and just figuring out how to make the thing work. Yeah, so essentially because you got knee deep in an infinite onion peeling exercise, you couldn't really move forward until you completed the onion peeling exercise and you made a trade-off between onion peeling and TDD. Now the question is, and this is a common thing with TDD. TDD is intended to help you onion peel at the same time. And but when you add in this time pressure and you don't add in a requirement that once you submit this, this is no longer your code, it encourages this behavior. That's my own thing. And to be fair, there was no, some people, many people didn't even finish and there was no like belittling of that. The pressure I put, the pressure put on me to complete this thing and have it work was entirely put upon me by me. It was purely for my ego to show I could write, I could still write C++ code and I wasn't just some lame QA director guy showing up to hang out. Yeah, but here's the real secret. What do you actually think is the difference in your mentality here versus 80% of every actual developer engineer you've ever met? They wanna prove their worth. And I'm saying the square root of nothing. That's exactly the same. Now, the specific reason why you wanna prove it to yourself may be different. Right, and that's actually in my view one of the roots of the problem around this unified engineering model. In my team, we solve this because everyone's expected to be able to work on everyone's pieces of code. And so it forces, I don't have to create a gauntlet rules. It forces a normalization of standards. I'm gonna make a statement then I wanna pop the stack and go back. The statement is I think the exercise succeeded in making us learn a lot more about how the engine works but failed in making us understand how to be a successful engineer at Unity. Because it didn't go into enough of the things that you really need to do to write quality code. Yeah, it doesn't sound like that second bit was part of their goal. I don't think it was, but I think it should have been. If I were a director in Unity, I might suggest something along those lines. This was really awesome. I'd like to add another thing to this. One of the reasons I attended as a QA director of services to this thing geared more towards engine people was so that I could understand its relevance for people in our org or where we may want to differ. And I talked to our director, we have a director of HR assigned to just engineering. He's just assigned for engineering growth and HR things. He's an awesome guy. I talked to him actually even before I started at Unity. And we talked about this exact thing and it's definitely something on his radar how to tweak this training to work across the org. So we'll talk more about that. So popping the stack, once upon a time, an hour or two ago, was talking about how someone explained to me, persons explained to me that what I was talking about in these tests that I wrote for my code weren't really tests, they were checking. And then there are the checking testing folks. So Michael Bolton especially, James Bach isn't really involved on Twitter much anymore. Who says that I've never seen a case of someone correcting someone else. You guys are just making this stuff up and I see it all the time. So when I saw this one, I had the document, it's like I wrote a tweet for the record. I just saw this blah, blah, blah. And then I have never been in a longer tweet thread that won't go away. So many replies and replies and replies and changes of subjects and examples of defensive testing, examples of this thing and there's probably a name for this you can think of, but what's it called when your purpose on Twitter or social media is to just prove that you know more about something than those around you? Lot of that going on. And I look, I fortunately have a do not disturb on my phone. Called Blovey8. I have a do not disturb window on my phone from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. where there won't be any buzzes or anything. And I woke up this morning, look at my phone and I have little, you know you have new Twitter notifications. Sometimes there's not any and I don't care. Sometimes there's three or four. Last night 87, overnight. It's like oh my God. So the thread won't die. It just goes on and on. That's my checking versus testing. Has it breathed its own life or? It's gone in so many different directions. Twitter needs a feature to be able to remove yourself from a thread. Yes. I guess TweetDeck probably has a mute or something. Anyway, that's my checking versus testing. Why don't you reply to the Tweet and say take me off of this Tweet thread? Bedlam, bedlam. Hashtag bedlam. Yeah, I'm just like oh man. We've talked about checking and testing before. I do think it's valuable in terms of having to discuss sort of more precisely what we're trying to do with these different efforts. But my goodness, it is absolutely not worth a religious war in any sort. Well, it's obliviating. It's an interesting distinction. If someone had some long winded thing and says, the way I see it, checking is a blah, blah, blah, and I replied simply saying, the way I see it, some of my testing has binary results. I think it's a way for, and I'm not sure if it's, maybe it's because I watch testing threads more often or I think it's really because there's more insecurity among testers that many of them feel the need to express their knowledge. Like oh, here, let me tell you what I know because you probably don't know it because I frickin' rock. It's like shut up. So it's an interesting distinction that is not worth bringing up unless the topic is about checking versus testing. Otherwise, shut the hell up. No. Let's take a break to hear from our sponsor. This episode of A.B. testing is brought to you by Cobaton. Remember Cobaton? We talked about them in A.B. testing 57. So Cobaton asks this of the three. Is managing internal devices one of the best parts of your job? Doubt it. Check out Cobaton, your complete mobile device lab solution. Cobaton allows you to manage the devices you own. That's right, you can plug in your own devices into Cobaton's network and access the real devices you need from manual to automation testing. Cobaton empowers developers and testers to build great products faster. One of the things I like about Cobaton is that you can both run automated tests and connect to these devices and test manually to see how things look and make sure look and feel is what you are planning for. Manage and access internal and external devices all in one place allowing you to test on hundreds of devices and configurations. Identify and resolve issues more quickly with automatically created activity logs. Even centralize your testing history to increase collaboration across teams and locations. Cobaton does all of that while minimizing costs and enabling you to get your app to market sooner. Visit cobaton.com, K-O-B-I-T-O-N.com, slash A-B testing to sign up for a free trial and start testing in minutes. I'll post these into show notes but I have to tell you if you are building any sort of mobile solution, you have to be using something like Cobaton to get your job done otherwise you're swinging in the dark. I would have to say like multiple times where if I had to do browser compat or device compat, like we've both worked in the device spaces. Yep. With massive internal labs costing not just massive amounts of money in internal costs but also in real estate, that space that could have been used for offices. Yeah and you have to invent whole new protocol stack if you want to try to, like each device has a different means by which you try to communicate. It's a real pain in the butt and you spend 80% of your effort just putting the infrastructure together. Definitely, I would definitely, if I was in the space today, I would definitely be going and signing up with Cobaton. Awesome, so check it out. One other non-sponsored advertisement, I'm giving a talk, a keynote at the online testing conference, June 13th and 14th. I'm just on the 13th, I'm 7.15 in the morning. Left Coast time, that's 10.15 on the right coast. Do the math if you live elsewhere. And speaking about a subject that came up originally on A-B testing, which is the bazillion different ways you can do technical testing or be a technical tester without writing code. And honestly, what is a non-technical tester? Wouldn't that be what they would say UI testers are? I don't know, I don't know. But perhaps- The minimum wage kids they hire to test games? Maybe, maybe. Yeah, so I'll talk a lot about that and my opinions there. My talks, as you know, are always full of opinions. I will make sure I have lots of pretty pictures and some stupid things to say because I need to make sure that I can attempt to be engaging even though my audience is virtual and I can't see them. I do so much better, even as an introvert. I enjoy giving talks, but I find them much easier to do when I can interact with the audience. So these things are always a little bit more difficult, but I will do my best to make it entertaining, fun, and informative. I definitely prefer the presentations where we just open up, yeah, interrupt us. We love interaction. Yeah. Right? But if you take away the ability to sort of read body language, so much of my presentation style is to be able to quickly read a body language and go in a different direction. Mm-hmm, yeah, me too. That's gonna be interesting. It's always a challenge. If you have no idea if what you're saying is you've lost your audience, how do you fix it? I will just try and keep it entertaining. I've seen a lot of, I mean, it's boring enough when you go to an in-person talk and someone is reading slides, but I've seen online presentations the same. That is a snooze fest. I promise I will not read slides. If you've seen my talks before, I am famous for having about 15 words in my entire 40-minute talk on slides. So plenty of pictures of Brent, and no, maybe not Brent, but there'll be something going on there. So check that out, Online Test Conference. If I do my job, I'll put a link to it in the show notes. All right. All right, one topic we wanted to discuss with our remaining time today is something that's come up directly and indirectly, and it kinda leads a little bit out of our checking versus testing discussion, but I don't wanna call it the future of testing. Let's talk about what modern testing is. So Brent, what does modern testing mean to you? What is, let's start with that and we'll see where it goes. Modern testing at a very high level is essentially what? So we agree that the goal of a test team, a test asset testing, actually, let's first talk about, well, I wanna talk about their testing the process, not testing the discipline. So modern testing is, testing's role is to accelerate the achievement of shipable quality. Shipable quality, thank you for correcting my own quote. It's mine now, I took it. So if testing's role is at acceleration, it's the getting to shipable quality. In my mind as well, there's a focus around risk reduction, like testing is like an insurance policy. How much do you invest in it so that you get the correct amount of payback if something goes wry or prevention of a wry? And then the definition of modern in my mind is, what is different about the opportunities, what's available to us in terms of how software is used and produced in today's world versus the world that existed when a lot of these testing dogma were first created, right? The previous topic lit on checking versus testing, that in my view comes from that old world. Yeah, a lot of that old world is, I think, way too prevalent and in many ways detracts from the evolution of testing. There was a discussion we had on our, one of the three Slack channel, around this concept of tester as information provider. And it was a great conversation, thank you three for chipping in on that. I believe that tester as information provider is, I can almost call it passive, but it's a cop out. When I look at that as the role, the testing activity and role is so much more than that. I don't like the idea of a tester is, here's what I found out, you make the decision, I'm not involved, I'll just give you the information. I don't like that. But. I will actually tell you, because I am now running a data science team. Okay? You're all about information. One of the biggest problems, I interview a lot of data scientists, and I ask them, why are you leaving? There are two big problems. Number one, all I do is reports. That's why I'm leaving my current team, because all I do is reports. Okay? Number two, this is more relevant. I am producing brilliant insights that no one uses. Now this is very analogous to the test role. Very much so. If you are producing insights that are not actionable, that aren't actionable in a way that is business relevant, no wonder that you're constantly under attack for defending the value of your role. That is what I see in testing all the time, not just with this, is that testers say, well, management doesn't listen to me. And assuming that it's automatically management's fault versus you having the right information, the right argument, the right leadership, the way to influence them. I see way too much of this, oh, it's what was me, it's not my fault, nah, nah, nah. Right. And it sounds like sort of the same thing. It's like. No, it's the same thing. I've had, there was a guy that left my last team on Teams at Microsoft because no one would listen to him. This was a principle level lead. It's not no one's listening to you. I know. Your argument is not sufficiently convincing. There's so many things where like, I have seen testers long, well, you know what? I understand testing and they fall back on this, I forget the name of the bias, but there's definitely a bias here. Where it is clear that it's a positional argument. It is clear that of the people in the room, I know this topic more than you, so we should be going with my gut, not yours. And it completely ignores the whole system of how a business functions. Absolutely. Right, so what's the consequence of me going with your gut, not mine? Oh, I don't know. I just know, because the other part with testing, in the old world, a big part of testing, is the basis of our argument is essentially a logical analysis of right versus wrong, not a consequence to the product, a consequence of the business, or a consequence to the customer. And that one is the one I think that's the most important. Because so long we're spending all this time defending a customer that we have no actual proof if what we're talking about solves a customer problem or not. Correct. Right, so a big part of a modern world is in testing, is you combine an actual customer-driven feedback loop as you go through that testing. This is why we proselytize the active use of data. And even if all you got is surveys, if your management says, oh, I don't care about surveys, then you figure out how to fund and run a survey program within your own test org. Right, any test team that validates their ROI six months after SHIP by, see, I told you so, you should have listened to me. I am telling you right now, you are not doing a good job on arguing your ROI. So I could go on and on and on about the defensiveness of testers, but one point I wanted to finish, which I find interesting, it always shuts me up a little bit. In this, I think it was first mentioned in the Lessons Learned book, that testers provide information. When I say, but there's so much more, I forget that B&B also say that once you're doing any of these other things, you're not doing testing anymore. So they've, in a way, their definition has defended itself for saying testing is this very small thing, but someone who calls himself a tester may do many other things. I find that confusing. I look, I am the quality and testing expert for our organization. Yep. That is, I have to be that, which expands so many other things than information providing, or exploration, or verification. It's so many other things. So the definitions just diverge from the beginning. So whenever going back to testing versus checking, it diving into that school's dogma is just so distracting from what I'm trying to do. So now back on defensiveness, which I see a lot still, and I see it, it's job preservation. It is worried about what's happening next. It's worried about management not listening to me. And I think more testers who feel defensive need to look at another, back at themselves more and how they're interacting with the people and the environment they're in, than with blaming others for their problems. Yeah, I completely agree. So as testing evolves, and one thing I like, and I don't wanna completely pick on B&B, they say that many people can take on the tester role at any time, including developers, including product owners. So I like the, it's their backward way of saying, yes, the whole team owns quality. The whole team owns quality, and there's gonna be people who have different domain expertise. And that's where I see modern testing is, as I described it from my team, as I said, I was the quality testing expert for our organization. Everyone on my team must be the quality and testing expert for their feature area. It's their expertise. It's the depth they bring to the team that brings value to what their team is trying to accomplish. They're either writing tests, checks, they're writing tests, they're doing testing, they're exploring, they're looking at data to figure out how customers using things to complete that loop, not speculating for their team and helping others on the team do those same things. Uh oh, Brent's pulling his hair out, but he doesn't have enough. I don't, I've actually, I went with a buzzer blade number four. All right. I think about an old blog post from Whitaker, where the title of it is, all of this testing is getting in the way of quality. And I don't actually recall what he wrote about, but that title was what stuck with me. Right? So all of these things that testing, in my view, self creates, I used to have a similar speech on test harnesses. It's one thing that's interesting about the test automation space, that test has created so much language around these components. Like this is our logging engine and this is our execution engine. And there's a degree of specificity that kind of reminds me of the fact that the Eskimos have like 80,000 different definitions for ICE, right? Whereas you take these sort of oop definitions and you take it to a dev team, it's just like, whatever. That's just an object that manages a queue. Who cares? Right? Checking versus testing. Who cares? That is the thing that is important for every test team. Who cares? It is not me saying, I don't care, don't waste my time on this topic. I'm saying, if you're holding up this topic as something that's important and you don't know who cares and you don't know why they should care, you need to figure that up before you hold this as an important religious dogma. And what that means in your relationship to customer quality. And I like that. Yes. Because we forget that. We're so caught up in the activity and proving our value that we're important. And if you make the customer's experience or help make the customer's experience better, you've done your job. I always just about, before I went on that rant, I was actually thinking about entering into, you know what, Alan, I'm gonna just make your life easier. You as a director of quality and testing, you're gonna say, I don't care anymore. I don't care. You could unit test, you could not. I don't care. But you're going to measure yourselves on the rate at which your team and your code increases CSAT of the customers that are using it as measured by this. And I'm going to do, I'm going to judge you guys by CSAT over time, over calendar time. You do whatever the hell you want. And I'm willing to bet that you do something along those lines, the right amount of testing will suddenly start happening. I think too many testers focus on, I must do my activity, I must give you information, I must explore, I must do this, I must write a useless automation suite. All this stuff that, you've seen this before, and people, they generate a lot of activity but little value. And I worry that's happening with too many testers. They're generating activity versus value for the customer. No, it's even worse, because they're not associating that activity to value. They hold it as inherently true that this activity is valuable. And then when someone pushes back, they get pissed off and say things like, management doesn't listen to me. Management doesn't listen to you because you're not framing it in a thing that management cares about. Test is, from most management's point of view, test is a cost. Absolutely, that's why I think testing, rather than being these teams of people who are entry level, and one of my rants a few weeks ago was, in fact, I'll mention this in my technical tester thing, is we take what I think, and granted, I only have 25 years of experience in this, but we take the most difficult thing to do, maybe in software engineering, which is to write reliable, good UI automation, and we use that as our entry point for teaching testers how to code. How stupid is that? Quite. So I think the, talking about modern testing and the growth of testing, testing needs to be this specialist role. Specializing generalist, specializing generalist, but not that army of newbies thing. If you're hiring a tester, it's like hiring the performance guru to come in on your team. It is a... In the way software is shipping today and what we're doing, and if you're doing it right, testing, the testing activity is no longer, testing role, whatever you wanna call it, what we need from tomorrow's, and today's even, testing expert, specializing generalizing specialists, is... A systemic view. Yes, and not noobs. I think, honestly, you could see testing as this role that is grown into from your good developers. Yeah. Which some companies have done. They've moved their good developers into sort of what they call the QA role, quality architect role, and they've actually been a true QA role. Yeah, I actually... I'm off on a tangent, but the growth is not from getting lots of new people in, and this is hard for a chunk of the industry to see because there are a chunk of consultants in the industry that make their living teaching brand new testers some basics about testing, and their world is going away. Yes, very rapidly. We're out of time. I do wanna pick this particular topic up and go deeper in the next episode. We'll see if we do that. I mean, this is two weeks ahead planning and that's anti-AB testing. I was just getting around that, but you're right. Yeah. There is a whole bunch of other things I think it would be good to go in here and talk about. It may even sponsor, hint hint, some mailbag requests. Yes. So if there are topics you wanna hear about, let us know in a reply to the blog post or in oneofthethree.stock.com, and we will pick it up as part of this what will be a long, continued, and fun discussion.
