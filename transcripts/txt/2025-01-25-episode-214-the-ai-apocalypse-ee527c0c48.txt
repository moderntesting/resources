Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes tomorrow now on with the show here we are again hey Brent hey hey Alan happy new year wait no we did a show in the new year no yes we did well you didn't post it didn't I no what is wrong with me that you're just telling me this now yeah happy new year no I don't believe I still don't believe you we did a show in 2025 we have not dude you're lying I am NOT episodes what is our last episode the recap oh did we not do a show I did hold on we didn't happy f'ing new year bro happy I thought we did one did we record like on I thought for sure no no we had we had both you and I having to read jigger I am multiple times I am just not buying this okay I gotta look here now to we have not recorded a show this year you are correct holy cow it's been a long hiatus oh my gosh well somebody there the day told me that you can stop sharing your screen that they didn't tell me that what they told me was that you guys are slowing down I thought yeah we had to skip a few but man I didn't know it's been like a month so welcome back those of you that have been waiting refreshing your podcast app frantically trying to see when the next episode was coming it's you're hearing it now yeah I don't know when I'm gonna get it edited and posted but yeah I just looked at the stats cuz I'm like oh so we haven't done one in a month and then the one we did before that was a month oh well but before that was two weeks oh then a month it's a it's a good thing we're not paying per episode we're not paying we could do more small one thing we didn't do in the year in review anything like me entertaining oh no that we do every year this last time this last time we didn't do the whole like where are we gonna be this time next year thing oh we didn't track like did we do that theater before we did let's do that a little later in the year let's talk about the I'm not ready to look ahead we have my team put together a I can't even too many details a really good road map I can talk a little bit about this so we have I joined like many platform engineering developer experience orgs there's a whole bunch of big migrations going on for a year I've been dreaming of getting to a place where you know it would be great if we weren't migrating stuff or consolidating stuff we just kind of work on smaller more incremental things that help develop make developers lives easy year and we're kind of there we have a good road map for the year I feel good about it and then we had another big project it's half public so I won't talk about it too much but we have to do a whole crap ton of unplanned work to make a big company wide thing work so roadmap beautiful roadmap crumple it up throw it over your shoulder try to hit the trash can so yeah that's what's going on planning is invaluable plans are useless oh yes anecdotes from brandy anymore did I ever we went over the weasel laws once I actually have like 10 now I've done those before we don't need to do those again so um what's new did that was it stand to bring fun things to your it's 2025 it's 2025 we didn't say nineteen hundred and eighty three we said nineteen eighty three we can say 2025 2,000 to five stop it stop it if you probably say daylight savings time to with an s I think and I'm aware that that's wrong and I probably do and I think the correct solution is to just get rid of the damn things yes agreed so that we fix everyone's grammar mistake all right Friday Friday January 24th 2025 at 348 p.m. Brent and I have agreed on something go a be testing yeah um new Santa got me a bunch of cool games got a puzzle I got a drone I've never owned a drone oh it's fine on the neighbors no actually all I've done with it so far is charge the batteries oh nice how back though I think it went fine the red light turned green oh good yeah pretty prided there right yeah that's great all right most exciting thing I would say that I've done at least in in our household is that I fixed our 3d printer because because drama was beginning to which 3d printer do you have elegy elegy Neptune pro 3 okay don't know that one we have a bamboo and a couple of realities here why do you have three at least three mrs. mrs. weasel does a lot of 3d printing for for all kinds of actually good good reasons so is she uh are you guys like get your own back at sea market no no long story she's electrical engineer and design some casings and packaging for the thing she builds in 3d Britain she's a whiz with the tools if you know what I mean because this I have is a 3d you know Philip Phillips you yeah do you have those I don't have any I don't there okay I have them and one of them one of the things you can buy is sort of a remote right that specific remote so you don't have to use your phone or whatever 3d printed a faceplate to go over my light switch and then the remote goes there and said oh nice yeah it's a good use good use I want to I have a topic I thought of today this is probably gonna write about this in my what even you know what not only have we you know I haven't done my five for Friday I'll get to that later but I also haven't written I didn't write a weekly blog post last week I wrote every week for like except for when I was hiking gone on a hiking trip I wrote every week for like I don't know I almost every single week for two years and I've slowed down a little bit lots of stuff going on distracted blah blah blah but one topic I was gonna write about and I'll get to in a second is I'm after work into it so have you heard of AI Gen AI it's really it's kind of popular yeah I've heard both these terms yeah yeah so there's a thing from github called co-pilot which you may know about I helped you write code I love it because people are using co-pilot I am getting because I my team manages our github contract and deployment and turning all the features on center etc they're coming up hey we're gonna measure we want to measure the the impact of developer productivity by co-pilot I say and I say that sounds exciting how are you going to measure developer productivity oh can you tell me how to measure developer productivity and I look at them and I'm I most the time I'm very very nice and I ask them how do you count how many bones are in 10 gallons of mayonnaise and and then they get mad so my answer to that is triangle yes yes so but as we know and like I'm gonna go with a little bit people going well you can measure developer productivity via how many things they click on and you can't and measuring there have been articles about measuring developer productivity for probably 10,000 years since they invented words maybe not that long but close to that there is no great way consistent way to measure it other than I was like I was talking to Brent's like not paying attention you just have to ask people do you feel more productive is there's some things there's some correlation stuff you can do around bug rates if it's slowing them down they look at how long PRs are open there are probably are some correlations but it's it reminds me of two things one every company in the world claims to weaken took up our tools and measure your Dora metrics that the four big the key metrics but I'm gonna repeat the miracle look them up what those people fail to recognize time and time again is oh god stop it stop showing me Bing searches of crap what people I'm talking here I'm going I have the talking stick what people fail to recognize is that the whole Excel the survey that Dora does is based on well the metrics that from Dora are survey results not hard measurements are not putting metrics into somebody's report they're asking them how long does it take how long is your cycle time how long does it take you to fix a bug in production etc etc those key metrics that correlate with high quality are asked via survey so putting a metric system in place those things does not make you in fact shooting at those targets does not necessarily make you better those are correlations if you're if you're good at delivering software those are things that'll happen naturally now same thing with developer activity you have to ask people some questions some subjective questions around to get it you can put a few objective objective measures around it not going to get there so finally the question I'm getting this all the time like months and months and months of people either asking me how to measure dev productivity or telling me they have a way to measure dev productivity and I try not to roll my eyes it is the exact same thing to me as it was 15 years ago when people will come to me and say oh I've a question I forgot to ask you how do you measure quality it's not the same because it is it is because there is we talked about code correctness there's engineering quality which is one thing that you absolutely can measure the quality of engineering practices you can do all kinds of stuff on on incoming bug rates and and and etc etc but quality is the value to the person the other end right and but productivity so they're they're both things that need to be measured largely subjectively in no yes calling bullshit call it you'll be wrong go ahead no no community the actual community has defined both of these terms multiple times of God right um so efficiency and actually so I this used to be a thing in in my agile coaching decks I'm waiting yeah because people what's the big thing about combat work in progress work in progress why is that important so you don't over tax off cognitive load trying to do anything so once focus on getting things done not on doing things right so of course I am what is the definition if you're if you're maximizing doing things flow that's efficiency if you're maximizing doing things I don't know no it's efficiency so think about your your water heater I have a definition but I much work how much work does it do versus the the amount of cost all right so wait one of the challenges with getting teams to onboard to Angela back in the day I was they would always talk about but what do you mean if I go with whip then there's gonna be times where people are idle right that's by design you cannot go fast if you don't have capacity right a fully utilized team is very similar to a fully utilized freeway it's a parking lot right okay well productivity is essentially can be measured particularly in the Kanban world because in the Kanban world your ticket sizes are roughly the same size so productivity is the rate at which the team gets things from start to done okay so what you're saying now let me let me do two things to that first of all audience would you think of that all right so what you're saying is you guys can't you guys can't see it on the video feed but I'm I'm curtine thank you if you have if you're a mature team you can use some tools that exist within your system to measure some aspect of productivity okay so if assuming I get what you're saying I would argue most teams in the software world I can safely say it's about where I work do not have that love anywhere near that level of maturity in their project tracking and that does not work and but the other thing I want to point out even better is okay then why evidence number two why does the top hit for an article on measuring dev productivity via co-pilot the thing that they're asking about is co-pilot making more productive why is the study done by there based almost entirely on subjective survey questions well so there's two things that you would want to cover right if you're only fucking you want to know does AI improve the business and to what degree it is causing harm to your human resources right meaning hey if if we get happier people at the same time as productive people that's fantastic it is now here is one thing though that I will arm you to push push back on okay because is the productivity because it's making them more productive or because of a principle that I hold very near and dear and that is happy people are productive people that's again that is so engagement drives productivity as well it does it does and engagement usually measured via survey questions but yes sure and the thing is the thing is right for me from my personal experience with get hub co-pilot it does both yeah yeah and that's again that's that's an important thing to measure you can't measure happiness via how you measure happiness via metric mood rings you Oh Bluetooth mood rings of course on all the devs well so actually I'm gonna I'm gonna monitor dev productivity by how happy people are when they code the the rate at which college college hires suddenly convert to alcoholism I don't know that would be the other way around oh that's just not for the kids that's where the grown-ups do right no the so measuring it the best tool we have today is absolutely something surveys right you could do my bio metrics or some I'm being prohibitive yeah I will also call out right one of the and we've talked about it how to measure everything anything yeah and the name of the book and I'll just tell you he absolutely won me over he's he one of his one of his chapters is specifically on quality can you measure quality he stands by yes you can measure it via confidence levels ish all right I don't think you can I don't think there is a set of metrics that put this way what do I measure to measure quality the answer is it depends what do I measure to measure dev productivity the answer is it depends and it there's just no blueprint available there's no like quick thing oh yeah just measure these things will tell you if you're a director or not it takes it's it's like reading the end of the book first like yes it can work if a whole bunch of other pre requisites are in place but for the for the generic non-microsoft non like not not Microsoft Netflix Amazon Google whoever who actually you know I would say are more elite engineering than a lot of the rest of the industry or media companies for example they do they there's a lot of work to do to get to a place where measuring dev dev productivity is the thing that's gonna help you tweak your system it's like trying to put it's like no that's not what's that's not how it's being used today it's not about tweaking your system like did you see the report from from Salesforce just a couple weeks ago the one you just banged for me no that's a different one okay that was around how they measure productivity you have not seen no I don't think I've seen that it was like in the first week of of two thousand two five just bite me they stated that they are not hiring a single software engineer in 2025 and it is due to the fact that they have calculated a 30% productivity boost because of the inclusion of AI and their dev practices hmm that's a big bet it is a big bet and and honestly when people are like well what do you think about that and I'm like well I'm like you and I both actually he doesn't work there anymore but but an old boss of mine used to work at Salesforce I know how internally they operate yeah they're very they're very agile they follow very much agile practices um so I absolutely think that they could measure to a degree that they are confident about to make a decision like this and the part of the argument I'll concede before I want to go back and pivot based on what you just said is that again if you have a bunch of if you're mature and have a bunch of processes in place then you it's much much easier to measure dev productivity if all your stories are different sizes and you have constant interruptions and you don't have work in progress you don't have a fit it's hard to measure but so I'm mostly right I'll give you a little bit of credit one thing you said that the Salesforce thing is interesting and I want to segue this into the second half of our conversation is sure ever since Gen AI came out it's kind of like when automation came out for testers like oh is it good group of our jobs AI came out and we said no AI is not gonna get rid of your jobs people who know how to use AI may and now but what a lot of the people a lot of the people who were worried about automation getting rid of their jobs it did in fact get rid of their job that's what we're seeing with AI and that's what I want to talk about okay I think we're seeing I I don't I don't think it replaces everyone but it makes everyone else a lot more efficient and what does that look like like well I have my own dark thoughts about it but I'll let you leave like where what is AI going to do to the tech industry oh I think it's going to I think it's going to bring us all down from our high horse okay please expand okay so here's what I see happening today um and we haven't talked in January so yeah there's a bunch of things that I think okay number one there is a trend that I noticed in January I didn't notice the trend but I it's something that I have talked about on this podcast for a while but I saw a report that was talking about a trend that they had noticed okay and that trend was essentially data scientists are having a difficult time finding a job mm-hmm have I talked about that yeah well you predicted that like three years ago so I'm not surprised okay the the reason why they're having a hard time finding a job is number one because a lot of teams with with with Gen AI and other AI tools feel they don't need to invent something new through AI okay um but the one that's the most interesting data scientists the ones that are being turned away are being turned away because they can't code and so we're going to we're going to see the rise of the data science generalist or the T shaped data scientist can't they well specialists are always gonna be in trouble we know that right but can't they just use Gen AI to do their code for them to if I'm a data scientist and I don't know how to code oh no I just get my AI to code for me and I and I'm not the T shaped that was an interesting so there was another study and I mean when I come across these things I need to save them so that I can post them in the podcast you know what the tangent we need a sign of every tangent we should honestly we should have like a shared folder we just share links in because we'd have a much better podcast if we talked about like things people could go read to form their own opinion and tell us we're stupid but bank that go on yeah great idea great idea I just like yeah ten years too late but beyond we better late than ever right now no so and I'm not gonna remember enough of this but I remember what I remember AI in terms of productivity boost what what this thing I read called out is that AI in terms of predict productivity boost only is garnered when it's an experienced developer yeah I believe that they're not seeing it from junior okay and you what you want to share why you think before I yeah I think if you you you need the discernment that experience gives you to understand when the code you're getting is helpful versus unhelpful and choose to accept what and what not to accept exactly yeah I'm a smart man right you ask it to write code right if you're an experienced coder like using the code pilot helps you to get rid of the the the the trivial part like the actual coding right right it's like no my art is the design now build the design oh that's fantastic it's like a 3d printer for code right but but I'm an expert so I'm now code reviewing github and if you don't have the ability to code review github which is often the case with junior coders you're not seeing that productivity boost now what I see is happening now we see a lot of companies like Salesforce is not hiring another sw e right that I think is gonna backfire for companies unless the dream of an ASI comes to place and then we can get rid of us all because it is traditionally unhealthy to not have like a pipeline where you have new recruits coming in and old people yeah right yeah the so here's what I think is going to be happening sometimes those who have helped AI to succeed are gonna be favored more than those who haven't okay it's a because those who help AI to succeed are ones that are actively working in that space using AI building AI okay and that's whether or not you're dev or a data scientist like I see most of the world shifting over the next couple of years towards just using it yeah the I know you finished okay additionally those who could do both are meaning both sort of data science and I'm quoting data science now and coding are gonna do better than those who can only do one mm-hmm okay what I foresee is going to happen is high-tech companies first off they're there this is what I think is gonna happen is we're gonna see layoffs and firings continue but new openings created but at a lower pace getting than is traditional Oh interesting because you may not be wrong it just supply and demand right it's supply and demand so right now there's a glut of data scientists as a glut of developers how do you take advantage of that right it's essentially all right if you have a high supply and not enough to band right the price lowers so the average wage of high tech I think I think we're gonna see that fall yeah you kind of see that because I work at a media company who pay a little less than the tech companies for the same experience I'm seeing people come in looking to downlevel themselves quite a bit just to get a job so you can always see that happening in a way people are across that's not true where I live where I work people across the industry are taking lower paying jobs than they had in order to have work and so that why doesn't that just continue so my other question is that will continue for sure right for sure so but it also comes to a point like companies are gonna stop growing so as many are gonna downsize the question I have and there's probably an economic model for this do all the tech companies that need to exist already exist if or or just enable could this enable hundreds of more tech companies fill other niches to come up and take and build things they can do things with 30 people that might have taken them a hundred people to do I they're launched you know five years ago so I'm gonna tell you that's my hope right we can always dream no so here's the thing okay um and if we are absolutely 100% at the start of the AI age okay and it very similar to like the 1850s when we when they were at the start of the industrial age automation started coming in right and a lot of people got laid off okay and because they could not adapt to the age um however that didn't last long because the human ingenuity found new ways to grow right now that we have right if we think about Steven Johnson right we the industrial age brought about a new set of adjacent possible like a new set of things that are now possible okay so the AI age is absolutely is absolutely going to create a new set of things that are possible okay and I'm not gonna be so egotistical to say that human society has already discovered 95% of all the things that are possible that to me is just bullshit now the question though is will humans be needed to to obtain that next set of possible things that I don't know because we are at the beginning of the age I am hopeful that that our society will find new ways every other age we have gone through has resulted in the boost in productivity and abundance yeah as a population to rise and that certainly is a potential here it's a weird time and if you remember it may even on the last but no like two podcasts ago just like you know seven months ago whatever that was I actually brought up the like and maybe I'll get out of the tech side of tech at some point maybe I'll have to but I mentioned like I really you know I've grown really fond of the people side studying how engagement works and I you know talked to people who run you know not HR HR but employee growth those sorts of things you know I you know I worked on the career guides for a couple versions at Microsoft and built those I like all that stuff and and that part is probably not going to be AI replaced I don't know I think the people part maybe won't so maybe if I can focus on the people part that may be something that I do once I get fired from I think it's gonna be so I am like I mentioned last episode going through a divorce I'm sure it's there actually that's done it probably won't surprise anyone on the call that I'm seeing a therapist and my therapist and I talk about AI a lot and last time I think I upset her because she's like well Brent what jobs do you think are at risk with AI and I'm like oh that's easy not many just the ones that are dependent on oral or written language just all the other ones are safe but not entirely because there's a degree of empathy and interpersonal awareness and active listening etc that are required for for for engagement to happen I can't AI is not going to replace that you are aware so here's my fear you are aware of the studies that show things like social media has in certain culture changes have driven up the degree of loneliness in the world there is for example there is a male loneliness epidemic in flight right now today oh yeah yeah okay um dudes have no friends right a little AI that can fake empathy it's not if you're lonely dude it's not gonna take much to have that we thought we saw the movie her a few years ago yeah you could see that happening but I just there's so much context I don't maybe the figures of a lot I don't know I think maybe we are all screwed I'm trying to find a path where we are all are all just sitting at home eating bon-bon no the path that has to happen in my view oh there's two things that I I just discovered something else last week that I'm super excited about but I haven't figured out how to had to turn it into action I'll share the second the AI apocalypse will absolutely be done if ever community within within human society is destroyed or significantly destroyed right and in there even then lies our hope I would say because if the AI apocalypse begins to happen right humans will join communities around defending against it okay so we're screwed we're entirely screwed this just if if if a dude comes and offers you two pills dude take the take the green one um I'll just take a handful of them but there's one thing that I did you ever study a manual comp yeah you did okay I did too theoretically undergrad first time I took philosophy for selective I got an F in it the second time I got a D nice work yeah did not pay attention to it did not care about it I'm still mostly don't however I recently came across a YouTube thing on it and now I'm like listen to an audiobook on this one of the things that he felt very strongly was that human consciousness was the single most precious gift human society has ever had and he felt that it was immoral if it was ever used poorly so one of the things he he brought about for example that the means do not justify the ends ever particularly if the means includes suppressing any number of people's consciousness and I'm like okay so I've done I've been using open AI to help me understand how a manual comp would feel about open AI and it's starting to form up like what I view is like a lot of the responsible AI things are today or a discussion around what's ethical okay I don't what to avoid isn't sufficient I feel like we should be driving towards what's the maximum of ethical if if we like right now the thing that scares the crap out of me is how many data scientists exist in this world today who who are trying to build an ASI to see if we can wait what's the name of that guy the famous futurist like Ray Worsile or something like he apparently and I'm gonna murder his name futurist race Oh Ray Kerr Kurzweil okay Ray Worsile he apparently really wants an ASI because he thinks we need an ASI to exist in order to create the capability such that he can trans move his consciousness into the internet because he wants to live forever oh god and I'm like of course there are people like that right it's like no I need an ASI because I need it to do my bidding you dumbass like it's been talked about over and over again once an ASI is exists we will not be able to control it you won't be able to get it to do crap anyway Wow yeah like you're right so um is the answer were I mean what happens when I'm so here's what the other last thing I thought about in terms of where there's some hope okay as all these companies and countries go to try to race towards the first EGI in the ASI like why are they trying to do that in order to produce okay but as that happens what's gonna happen is we're gonna see might probably layoffs right unemployment rising so we have all these companies producing things but increasingly humans out of a job so now again supplying demand so we have companies producing a high in the amount of supply but there's no demand because nobody can afford nice things so what happens what happens is that these companies have to reduce their price now what happens if that price doesn't pay for the cost of these advanced AI systems that they have because they they all require compute they all require electricity right um and again if human society gets to the point where everyone's unemployed these companies fail yeah I even even the even the cats mad even the yeah no she's like that's a good point friend all right well on that beautiful note I think I'm gonna put some rocks in my pocket maybe go walk take a long walk into the ocean no I'll wait and see what happens I'm I have to think you know there's you studied systems thinking systems theory these changes are gonna happen so other changes that we have not anticipated will also happen and there'll be some sort of balance I'm not sure are those could be those don't may not be technological they'd be socio-economic they may be socio-political it could be any sorts of things will happen to make you know the world won't end but it's sure gonna change it will change in into your point like the number one law of systematics which is a key theory when they follow around systems theory and that is the number of problems in the universe is constant yeah so once this thing's come it's gonna it's gonna solve a bunch of problems but it's gonna create a bunch the only thing I tell people is very similar to what you and I were telling people when we started this podcast paying attention and adapting to the new direction is is the only thing right and I can tell you and burying your head in the sand and ignoring it and saying it's a fad is going to get you you know into a bad place you're you're gonna be the first in the unemployment line all right well let's call it there I'm sad Alan I am NOT all right let's we'll see you in a couple weeks to a couple months we'll see what happens on our recording schedule bye bye
