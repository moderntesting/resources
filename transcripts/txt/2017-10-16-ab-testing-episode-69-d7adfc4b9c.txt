Brant hello Alan we are back for episode. I don't know I have six oh 69 69 I had a six and a question mark up on the whiteboard it was really close if you had just finished the loop I just had to finish the loop got rid of the dot. How you been Brant? I'm doing super How's that for convincing answer? That's a that's an awesome answer so I have how about you? How are you? He's such a Worst co-host ever yeah, yeah, yeah, so I may have mentioned this before Great drink Is that the loophole if we just say may my dad is up there in years had a few strokes He pretty much can't do much on his own, but he says my brother and my sister-in-law about 48 weeks a year 49 weeks a year sometimes longer So it's the least I can do to offer to take care of him for a few weeks when they go back and visit family So I did that for the last three weeks I was I like hey he mostly just naps in his chair I make him some food hang out with him a little bit, and I worked from home. I got a ton of crap done I totally got cabin fever by not interacting with real people So much of my team is remote that only the local team Like it made any difference to not seeing me around yeah, I don't think anybody else even noticed but it's weird I I Don't know if I could do if I could be a remote work. I know companies like Zapier are Every employee is remote. They don't have an office anywhere, and I was thinking I don't think I could do that job long term I could do it on a contract basis. I could do it for a month two months. Maybe at the most but One thing I've learned. It's just I need and I'm an introvert But I do need a little bit of interaction. I think a lot Maybe just to get ideas or two I can't quite explain it yet, but you're in the you're in the knowledge trade and if you don't have Relevant knowledge to trade and that's give and take Yeah, it doesn't surprise me that you'd kind of go a little bit crazy I do think you know you've mentioned one or two months if you actually made it to three months you'd be golden Because I think it takes about three months for a pattern. Yeah, I would get a routine down One thing I can tell you though. I worked remotely once before this is deck deck not quite decades ago, but maybe Maybe a decade ago, maybe seven or eight years ago at Microsoft. I was Long story. I won't share, but I ended up working remotely for about two weeks at that time It was much much worse because slack or whatever you're if you're using Microsoft Teams for the Microsoft folks But if slack for everybody else just a lot more a lot more that hallway communication and like I said my remote team had no idea I was even out of the office, but We're able to say pretty good communication that helped about three years ago one of my employees Her father was ailing and she asked if she could go to China and Work remotely for a month. I said sure to this date The manager I had it at that time Still does not know that she spent a whole month in China And I was I was actually pretty damn productive my day was spread out was weird because I ended up working Probably worked That's probably near my computer 12 hours a day getting in an eight-hour day There's other distractions, but I got like just a ton of crap done So it's really good from that perspective, but I'm gonna ask you a question How much of your time do you spend doing your own tasks in soul-sucking meetings a? Lot But I forgot I forgot what a culture of meetings is like so thanks for reminding me How much and given that is the hard question to answer but how much of your time do you spend on tasks? Versus managing your team that can be one-on-ones with them or thinking about their career or the work They're doing what's what do you think? Ah, it all park it it Like this week. It's mostly on the task front. I would say in any given week. I probably spend maybe 30% on the The people career growth stuff because usually my time is spent between my people putting out Random fires one of the one of the interesting consequences of being on a data science team and I didn't realize this Beforehand, but one of the things that I learned is unlike so people want to treat us like a regular dev team where you build a six-month plan and If you don't stick to it you suck the that sort of philosophy that you normally get with a with a dev team but we have to operate at the speed at which the business needs to make decisions and So that model just friggin doesn't work And so a lot of contradictions we get is a lot of fire drills come our plot our way and we have to figure out How we can best effectively help make the decision Even though we lack the six months of infrastructure that would be ideal and then lastly Strategic thinking it in particular nowadays I'm thinking through all right What's the next low-hanging fruit that no one's really gotten into that's that appears to be a business Problem as well as how the hell do I shut down these fire drills? so depending on the week the my balance changed very rapidly On our mind the two of the three listeners still listening that that was just an answer to a ratio question But thank you 30 That's cool Just I didn't want to say just 30 because 30 sounds low and I wanted to explain why I get it. I get I'm just giving you a bad time. The reason I brought it up was I think I spent More time on I still had all my one-on-ones still help solve some problems outside of one-on-ones answered a lot of slack questions and I will manage your stuff, but I think I probably spent more time on tasks in those three weeks And I have in any other week at unity usually it's a lot more because then again managing your team is just a lot of Interaction with developers around the company especially in the Seattle office sometimes interviews and Just those other things there is a Story and I'll shorten it for the podcast. There's a story. I often tell my mentees. I can tell a story I'm gonna run to the store real quick. I'll be back. Yeah, I'm just So back when I was still a part of a dink family dual income no kids my wife worked at as a Apartment manager and she had Sundays and Mondays off So I went to my management and I said hey Can I have Sundays and Mondays off? and I kicked ass they said yes, this is generally the bar and One of the things for the period in time where that was occurring and I think it was close to six months I noticed that generally I got a Darn close to two weeks worth of productivity in one week And and so when I came into work on Saturdays There was no one there to context switch me interrupt me I would just grind it out and it turns out me me not being there on Monday Really had no impact on the rest of the week So I would get that's interesting. Yeah, just that one day. I when I was a sink single income no kids I would often Microsoft Turns into a ghost town The last three weeks of December as people realized they haven't used their vacation They don't want to lose it and kids get out of school. And so there's nobody there. I would work often Those especially that week between Christmas and New Year. Oh My yeah, yeah, the shit I would get done. It was I can't believe I Can imagine cuz I saw but I still can't looking back I can't believe like at the end of that time like oh my god. I did holy crap. It is really And my brain is younger. I could fit more in it's like it. I just had this The decision to work or not during the holidays is really a no-lose. There's no way to lose Yeah, yeah, I enjoy taking that time off now, but oh my goodness that was yeah If you have already done all of your Christmas shopping Then yeah, you should work That's generally not the case for me I need that I need the two weeks off because I Vare Generally in the middle of November. I'm like, okay this person that this person that this person that but then I Changed my mind later and I procrastinate and so then I need the two weeks This has occurred the last five years Play the tangent theme song now We don't have one no, you know what to me do have I Do I do We have a little backlog of mailbag questions, I thought we'd well three but I thought we'd talk about this, okay Alright why don't you get through question one? No not quite ready yet. Okay. It's good to be back having that We you may have noticed those you subscribing going. Oh my god, what happened to a be testing They haven't had an episode in a month. I took a week. We took a recording off last taking care of my dad. We are back Not well, we'll see. We'll see question number one All right. This is from Camille. The subject is how can I start work as a tester? And here is the message Hello, I'm 33 and working since forever in the logistic industry Few days ago. I came across this job offer as software tester. I started to I'm gonna fix some slightly broken English here. I have one thing on my mind I have to try and change my industry and become a tester. I found IST QB certificate and right now I am learning working and getting information about this profession wherever I can today I found your podcast a be testing that's us and listening to it at work one thing that disturbs me from your number 26 podcast Is that I have TQB is a not very good piece of knowledge for a good start as a tester Maybe not try it. We'll talk about that in a second I am planning to start from that anyway because this is big advantage in the market at least in my region and I'll have to Try and find some company which will hire me without any practice except certificate and some theory I have to find company company of people like you that want to be someone's mentor to teach me the best hire me That is thank you for the message Camille Can't hire you yet, but what I can do along with my buddy Brent is Give some advice. Yes. What advice would you like to give? I would like to say and Brent and I and as many others do we made fun of the IST QB test because it's a little the questions are a little on the redic side I think and There's not a ton of value in the knowledge what you need is the practical knowledge however There are many places especially in Europe where having that certification can Get you in the door. I do think and before Brent jumps in one thing I worry about is I'm My spidey sense tingles with the IST QB only because I see it I'm not sure if it's a benefit the testers the testers or more of a benefit to the people running IST QB who Charge a big chunk of money to take their class and you know the class T certificate. There's a little bit of Have some queasyness there that bugs me. So I Think the answer to that question is entirely market driven, right? You have more familiarity than I do on on the European tester Testing market we have several listeners that could probably comment to this hmm better If you better than I I'm thinking of you Patrick The thing is so from from outside looking in ISQ or IST QB appears to be a Barrier reducer meaning In in a testing market if you have this You can you can reduce the friction towards landing one of these jobs And you're right much more true in Europe although I think less true than it was a few years ago But still very true in Europe I rarely see a US job and never see a US job that I would recommend to anybody that requires an IST QB Certificate and I think even most American managers at least People running test orgs don't care They don't What we heard is 30 years old they're in the logistic industry They're considering doing the IST QB. I think you should do the IST QB Because it again it does from what I observe it is a friction reducer I'm going to agree it might so it's probably going to help you get an interview To the best of my knowledge it may even be help you get a job But the best of my knowledge is not necessarily going to help you keep that job Yeah, I would recommend I again I hate think I have the same advice as much as I've spoken out against IST QB I think in switching industries and getting sort of a basic lay of the land might be a good idea. I would also go Read I mean you obviously Have scoured the internet and gone to the darkest corners in order to find our podcast So on the way, maybe you found sites like ministry of testing calm Which have a lot of great information a lot of testers from Europe. It's headed by Rosie Sherry in Who's in Brighton? I should mention I'm going to Brighton in March. I'm excited. So In addition to the IST QB look and see what else is out there. Keep on learning Try things out. There are testing challenges talk to other testers find ways to interact If you have that seeking learning mind and you can use IST QB to get your foot in the door You might have a I do think it shot as a software tester. One of the things I do think So they the person's mentioned they're seeking a mentor in this space I would reach out to the Ministry of Testing That's much more closer to a relevant market for for them than We are yeah, I think it's becoming and in see if there's resources There's a lot of you know test meetups Maybe there's one nearby. There is look for meetups. Yeah, so I think you know, it was funny as little is 10 years ago Sticky minds is probably the best from ST from software quality engineering people that run star was probably the best resource for Testing information. It's still a very good resource, but I Can't think right now of a better resource for software testers Than Ministry of Testing that is not a paid endorsement Not even it's just an endorsement. I can't think of anything else. Of course They aggregate blogs if you want to just scrub to one blog feed they There's forums there's across isn't just like of course there's some traditional Testing talk there, but also some modern testing In fact, I should mention the reason I'm going to Brighton is to speak at test bash in Brighton I'll also visit the unity office when I'm there, but my talk you're gonna love it Adventures of a modern tester nice Nice, I can't wait. I can't wait. I got a little I got a little smiley writing up the abstract and submitted and I'm super are you gonna do crayon cartoons like that that one girl? Years ago with the dungeon and oh I wonder if I should check the schedule I own I own a Mm-hmm. It was her name. Maybe she'll be there. Maybe she can do the the art for you be great I actually gave a presentation to my team internally There's a weird thing I've mentioned before with off the air mentioned to Brent that one thing at unity that I love is I I Plant these seeds and the seeds grow very fast at unity. Sometimes a day later like we're doing this I said whoa. Whoa. Okay. Okay, it's fine Go several months back I was working on getting some of the teams start thinking about working from a zero bug backlog and how that would happen and I was gonna start with one team and show data and move on direction and then a whole office said Oh, we want to do that. Can you give a tech talk to our devs on how to do that? How to think about that? I said I can And I used a lot of hand-drawn pictures in it. That's for the heck of it What's up? All right. Let's start next question. Oh Look who's rushing things along Next question This one is from David on the testing pyramid in 2017 Dear Alan and Brent. Oh Okay What you mad didn't say dear Brent and Alan? No, no, no, it's not I was Quickly loading the testing pyramid and that's what caused the uh All right. Go ahead Go did it have to push the ponies out of your brain? Okay, you're Alan and Brent Because now we can run many GUI tests graphical user interface You need GUI tests at the same time hence get fast response Do you think this will eventually lead to more GUI tests and fewer unit tests? If the time will no longer be an issue, isn't the depth of testing through the GUI make it a better practice? No next question So So I understand the logic. I loaded up a image on I'm looking at lots of unit tests Unit tests of the testing pyramid. I loaded up. Oh yours is huge It says that the base is unit testing then component testing then integration then Then system then acceptance then alpha and beta. No, that's that's a stupid pyramid Yeah, the UI is not in here. I mean as I see why it's not in here The pyramid as originally drawn that that pyramid you brought up there. I like this period that one's stupid You're stupid don't even show that one. All right the pyramid is unit tests system tests at the very top of the pyramid GUI tests and what I Have stolen from Google considering how much Whitaker stole from me when he was there Is rather than call them unit and system and GUI? Oh this one I even think about them as small medium and large test that is the testing pyramid as Proposed originally so but for now Forgot where I was lots of unit tests Medium out of system test a small number of GUI tests Let me put it this way Now that I've talked about everything but the answer I agree with Brent which is No weird. I Don't care if you can run a gazillion GUI tests in a second Well, that'd be kind of awesome. But generally I don't care because GUI tests are no No, if you could run a zillion GUI tests in a second just imagine how many actual useful tests you could run in the second I think GUI automation is the most difficult to do right and trustworthy is one of the most difficult things to do in software engineering if you have The flakiness lives in the GUI tests and maybe it's not flakiness you can control Maybe you can work past it very difficult You want to write tests that you can trust that when they pass do you know the products working when they fail? You know the products failing furthermore You need a set of eyes on that GUI at least once before you ship anyway Maybe that comes from some dog fooding at the same time Just I see no reason I would rather investigate in those super-fast Reliable tests that live lower down the stack regardless of our ability to parallelize our GUI testing I even found that in and friends about to talk but even on we had on teams Oh God Well, there's the good news taught our developers how to write test automation and they wrote a bunch of really shitty UI tests that were flaky as hell and they wondered why the system was so gross and This system worked fine. Oh, we'll just parallelize those tests. We'll rerun those tests. We'll retry those tests We'll keep on running until they pass No, they're fragile And with that fragility you end up not trusting them and when they do fail it's a real product bug Maybe you don't notice because it's a broken window theory just no I do not support writing more GUI tests just because it's easier Brent. You may speak Thank you. So the pyramid as I have loaded it up says at the very base is unit tests then followed by acceptance tests Then followed by GUI tests now in this particular case I'm going to choose to interpret acceptance tests in language that we used to use which is the BV T's From my experience all of the bugs happen at the integration layer GUI tests sure you could write a whole bunch of GUI tests and If you had a full complete suite of GUI tests and dev does a check-in You will be able to fail a bunch of tests if they do a bad chicken and Dev won't have to do the unit test because you know that the test failed Now let me tell you a story Years ago about 15 years ago now I joined a brand new team. I'm not gonna mention the team It's now Yet another Microsoft product I worked on that no longer ships Not soon though Which is official now. Did you hear about? Groove dine Yes. Yeah. Oh My tangent size yes, it is a B testing one of my one of my predictions one of my rants from years ago Finally came true only after spending a few more hundreds of millions of dollars on it Windows phone is dead. I think that was announced several months ago. Maybe maybe Internally windows phone became officially dead to the public just a couple weeks ago, and I wasn't even happy or it's like about time it's like Like yeah, I told you that when I was working on that stupid science project. We should just stop making this thing This is dumb It was just it was some cost fallacy Yep personified and thank goodness anyway go on. So I joined this team and they had Run for six years Shipped three versions of the product and had never shipped with a hundred percent BVT passing in That six years time This was a hard problem to them. They did not understand what was going on Management thought automation was just completely useless because they couldn't figure out this problem and Again a BVT is a build verification test it is In today's world. It would be somewhere between an integration test and a unit test so More complex than a unit test less complex than a integration test Now at this point in time I had never ever ever ever encountered a team That didn't have BVT's Passing at least once a week and this is a team that had shipped three versions It's so funny. It's on me. It's 15 years ago, but yeah, it sounds like a lifetime ago. I just it I I Can't believe we lived through that without killing ourselves. I've noticed that as I'm getting older Time appears to be passing by faster. Maybe and this goes back to paraphrase something you've said Previously is I think today I worry way more about quality than do about testing Yes, and I've this is an example of that we were worried about the testing well, so The team was I asked to take on this as as a project. I found it fascinating Like it is somehow I knew upfront this team had way over complicated their BVT pass Like to the best of my knowledge up until then it was nearly impossible to get BVT's into this type of state anyway Shortening the story what I went and researched and I discovered Exactly. What was going on they had designed their BVT suite to essentially be what The person is asking us on on this question They had abandoned it so you can take the equivalent of they had abandoned their unit tests done only scenario-based gooey tests and They could not get their test pass to pass Why? because when the scenario fails There was always approximately 250 different check-ins that could have caused the failure Okay, and you end up Spending dev let's say the test is provably saying the products failing The problem is is it because you didn't define the failure at the moment the code integrated You end up spending about ten times the cost Undiagnosing the the problem So yeah, this this would be a horrible idea ignoring the fact that gooey testing or gooey automation is Absolutely One of the hardest things on the planet to do Reminds me of a story. Yeah So on Xbox one which was some little pockets of agile Encompassed in a big cesspool of waterfall cesspool is wrong. It was a fun project But what team was this Xbox one? Oh good We defined we're very careful about defining like What a BVT was and our levels of testing we didn't use the pyramid as a metaphor We could have but the BVT answered the question each level of testing answered a question the unit test answered the question Is my code ready to check in and the BVT answered the question is this build worth? investing any more testing effort on So we wouldn't even run the next level of test unless the BVT is passed wouldn't bother I use those questions. I had another set of questions as well and my set of questions were roughly equivalent to if this test suite passes is The next test suite have an 80 to 90 percent chance of passing as well So in other words, not only did I use it for a gate for things like check-in and things like that But I'm like no I want a super fast suite that says whether or not it's worthwhile to begin the next week And different levels of testing answered similar questions until it went to beta users So then recently recently being like maybe six months ago, maybe longer because I can't tell time anymore Noah Sussman Did a very clever thing which makes a lot of sense. He inverted the pyramid And did basically the same thing answering these questions If you look at the pyramid upside down all Basic functionality bugs should be caught by the unit tests these levels of bugs We catch here the only bugs that get to here are ones that have failed have somehow passed all those things I'll see if I can post a link to it. Yeah, so I Think we're both saying the same thing particularly in the world of the the modern tester, right? Calendar time is critical. You can't have your devs spending a whole lot of their time Just running through your end-to-end scenarios to figure out what the hell bug they just checked in You also can't have your automators spending all their time maintaining extremely challenging Gooey their automators. I don't know what yeah, I don't know what the crazy kids call these people nowadays. I don't know either I Ask my team to write please write less automation Help the devs write more that is the way to go. Thank you Are we done with that? Yeah, we made our point I don't think you liked our answer, but we're not here to give answers you'd like we're here to give honest answers I and I I understand opinions. I understand the theory but no I'd be too but running the regression suite is not the priority No agreed Okay, my stop writing automation post is Seven years old now Yeah, I think it's I think the way you just said it is the best way. I've ever heard you say it Because when you read it it sounds like you're anti automation and it's You're not it's no The people who write the automation should also be the people who wrote the code. I think so me too One more question this one from slack channel one of the three dot slack comm Contact me or perusee on Twitter if you want to get added, but this is from Danny thought the infamous Danny thought For an organization that is moving to doing testing in production How important is it to have a data scientist participating? Does a data scientist ensure that sufficient data is available to show whether an application is having problems in production? So really we have two questions here one Maybe easier to answer than the other as the data scientist Should you answer first or as the non data scientist should I answer first? I don't care Would you like me to answer? I want you to care? Like for me I'm in an organization that is moving to doing testing in production Yep, and I don't have any data scientists on my team We do have data scientists in the org that I can and will leverage as needed But there are some interns interim steps that you can do being Was just a little bit of math and statistics knowledge and the ability to use or even better yet The ability to use a search engine on the internet you can get by I think for quite a while In moving in that direction what you really need help with in moving that direction is a nice partnership with operations Or infra or devops whoever is building your monitoring system to figure out how you're going to Leverage that and what are the ways you're going to use that to monitor system health tests that run in production What happens when they fail to those fire alerts? Getting that built up in the first place is much more important than getting the deeper analytics that come from data science in my opinion When you're moving to testing in production, right the first thing that's gonna happen and by the way, I Would say a good 50% of my data science team my individual team is on a problem similar to this But it is entirely dependent on your maturity model on Where you are with testing in production testing in production It has two interpretations one is the the monitoring Stuff that you're talking about the other is The a B testing paradigm I've seen both of these things Classified under testing or production on a B testing Yeah, you definitely want a Statistician to help you with the hypothesis testing. Mm-hmm. There's multiple flavors of data scientists. Do you need an ml for this? No it's its basic stats for testing in production from a sense of Monitoring do you need a data scientist? No you can get away For a long time without one will one having one help accelerate and help avoid several problems Yeah, it will one of the most common problems once you go to testing in production The first problem is signal to noise ratios. How do how do we set these thresholds? The the first practice as you set it to be static values but then you realize oh crap this particular series is spiky and And we only we only care if it's above the spike for 20 minutes Well the then you go, okay. Well, we'll just add another threshold that says don't alert anybody unless it's been above this spike for 20 minutes But then the next problem that you run into is oh Yeah So we did good on reducing noise but now Our service has been offline for 20 minutes. So when it's actually a real thing Data science is is is really helpful in terms of Working through the signal noise problem. I think Answer the question also depends on What is a data scientist you need to go and the and the canonical answer is it's a statistician who works in Silicon Valley? But let's do you need your canonical Do you need like to go hire someone you who is a Self-proclaimed or has a job current job panel as data scientist, or do you just need someone on the team who? Understand statistics and can and can Tell when there are anomalies and depending on the size of the team like if there is headcount here Right and depending on the maturity level just hire somebody that is is Has knowledge in this space? One or two years out of college They will they will probably provide the right amount of ROI for this project Right and I think that The biggest thing is they'll stop you from doing some stupid things. It's really easy I see this happened all the time and I'm as Brent knows I am NOT a data scientist, but I Can fake a lot of shit and I've read a lot about statistics I once gave a talk on a be testing and used all the right words and made Brent happy I know enough about Statistics I'll say that I could ask the right questions about metrics and understand how to figure out Whether something is statistically significant and in actually in the scenario I just mentioned The advice I just gave like hire Somebody who's just fresh out of college You would be able to do a lot with that person because you know What data science can do and what it can't do to some degree you may not know how to do it But you understand the language and you understand what it can do so you you would be able to to appropriately Direct this individual. Mm-hmm and a lot of the other places where I've had this question answered you have a bunch of people who Data science is the equivalent of magic. I want to hire a magician, too And I don't think that's a healthy situation for a young data scientist No, I don't think so another one and you mentioned the AB testing and It's good to differentiate the fact that just synthetic tests tests that you like actual tests that you would run internally Run those against production had them trigger an alert when they fail that stuff does not need a data scientist, but Whether it's a be testing or just understanding more about customer usage One thing I found that I'm not great at yet, but I'm better than most Around me because I spent a lot of time studying this is figuring out how to ask the right questions From data like how like that's where a data scientist can help like hey, we want to know X The data scientist is often the best person to figure out the right data. You need to collect in order to figure out X Brent you would think Well, yeah, if not, then don't hire them. No, there's a new phenomenon that's coming in lately Where I've encountered a lot of data scientists the kind of X backed That all they're gonna do is is machine Model building machine learning model building. Um, so No one likes to clean the data. No one likes to Do the data mining to figure those things out? You know do those guys I essentially say, you know too bad That's not how that's not how it works. The fun data science projects are Messy the valuable ones are messy. I Wonder if just like if you were to ask ten testers what they do you may get eleven different answers I wonder if right now while the data science role is sort of growing and evolving that it's sort of the same thing it is It is because summer I know there are ML people there are Statisticians there are people that ask the right questions that can design experiments I think there's a lot of nuance and expertise in data science just as there is in software testing so It took me a long time to come up with a definition of a testers job I have greatly accelerated and I have a definition of a data scientist job and a data scientist job is is to understand the relationships between variables that positively drive action for the business That's not bad. I know I know Brett just hurt his shoulder patting himself on the back But you will you talked so it is I've now interviewed several hundred of them And there is a lot of there's a lot of common complaints. There is a lot of common expectations right date several data scientists expect that They'll be doing everything in Python several data scientists expect that Someone else does the data engineering and the data mining This is what's typical in an academic environment right I Am actually going to be doing a presentation in that within the next month for One of my one of my professors just joined a brand new university He wants to start a series and he's calling analytics think tank So I got to build a deck around you know how Microsoft Uses data science that it's targeted the academic world right one of the things I'm going to bring up is It So the thing I'm one of my favorite things and I haven't quite figured out how I'm gonna bring it up I'm gonna bring it up. I think and I thought this back in in in the old days That PhD CS students were useless. I'm finding PhD data science People are mostly useless. No, they're useful for writing papers, but not for practical software applications Yeah, I fully agree with the former. Yeah, it's it's not enough experience latter, but I'm not surprised There is a big push In society lately where where there's a lot of questioning around what's the value of the university education system? You got things like Coursera We're more open source than we've ever been There's a lot of open content We don't have time for a rant. Did you see my blog post ranting about their The security VP security the CTO or whatever of Equifax? is blamed for The their security breach people were freaking out because she's a music major I Got up on my horse because one of a music major so a little defensive but to A university is not a vocational school. It's place where you supposed to learn how to think and Many people do apply what they learned in their their actual degree towards What they do, but many many don't and that's okay Yeah, if you if you want to go to school to get a specific job go to a vocational school go to course You know, yeah, anyway big rant there isn't a vocational data science school Yet Yet, but man my crash course part of my crash course in learning data science is courses on Coursera Yeah, no Coursera is a great thing and I I actually I I do think in in Probably in our lifetime Alan certainly in our children's lifetime.
