Hey everyone and hello Brent. Hi Alan, how are you doing? I'm doing great. I am actually feeling excellent given the fact that I just flew in from Reykjavik last night. Landed around 6pm. And what foreign country is this in? Dude, you have the geography knowledge of an American. You know, someone's got to keep the stereotype alive. The Reykjavik is the capital of Iceland. Oh cool. I knew it was the biggest city in Iceland and I knew Iceland didn't have that many people but I wasn't prepared for how small Reykjavik is. What could I compare it to? I was thinking about that the whole flight home. I took a picture so I could think about it some more. I don't know what the population is, I'm not going to look it up. One of the three can do that. But I was like in the tallest building in Reykjavik with 8 story hotel. Cool. And it is small. I don't have a good comparison. It is amazing how, this is probably too philosophical for our podcast, but I find it amazing how life always seems to find a way. It does man. Right, you're in the middle of, there's multiple middles of nowhere where suddenly communities just start popping up. Yep, yep, yep. Hey, I was in, I got to do the right segue slash pin here because I was there for a meeting with my manager and my peers to talk about people and how they're doing, go over some strategy stuff, basically a two and a half day off site. Probably the best off site of my entire career. Was there candy? Yes, in the form of fermented grapes and a glass. Oh, well there you go. Not only are we super aligned on what we're doing, I mean, if there's one thing I could go to improve the last three days, was I'm a big believer that great innovation, actually this happened at one time, that breakthroughs happened from disagreement and having an argument people you trust, it's okay to have that argument. I think great things come from that. Now that I think back, one of the great insights we had and the thing, this idea that just exploded upon us as a few things converged, did come from argument. So, wow, it was great. But one thing during the people discussion, I want to pin, because something came up that's highly related to the principle we're going to discuss today. Okay. So I'm going to go make a note on that on the whiteboard so I don't forget where we keep our notes. And then, Phil Miam, what have you been up to since the last recording of A-B testing? Oh, by the way, A-B testing is ... One of the things on my backlog is to actually record a proper intro. I think I'm going to change the music and do a proper, fancy podcast intro. I don't approve of changing the music. Okay, I'll figure something out. I got to figure out how to ... I want to do a proper intro for A-B testing so I don't forget to say crap and we can just start off talking about crap. Are you going to do your best practiced DJ radio voice? A-B testing. A-B testing, let me tell you. Wow! No, no, I will do something though. Anyway, if this is your first episode, probably not the best place to start. Although if you want to listen, go ahead, because we're talking about modern testing principles out of the podcast. We talk a lot about software development, software quality, software testing, Agile software, leadership, management, bunnies and squirrels, and this thing we've been talking about for the last, holy crud, like six months, eight months, a year, year and a half? At least a year. A thing called modern testing. And modern testing isn't modern in the sense that it's flying cars, it's just modern as compared to traditional testing. Anyway, I'm going to let you read the back of the Kim Koehner book while I go put a note on the board. So, Brent, what have you been up to? Nothing much. Okay. Yeah. All right. There is very little excitement in my life at the moment baseball season's done. You mentioned that last time. Yeah, I know. You've talked about this before. Agreed. Things I can't talk about, I mean, there is a lot of really exciting stuff happening on the work front. Yeah, I got some of that too. Well, at least in mind I can chat with you a little bit about after we stop recording. Yep. And you probably have secret stuff because you work at a big secret company. I'm sure you have secrets too. I do. I do. I have plenty of secrets. Oh, I have stories to tell. Yeah, I can't bring them up now. But anyway, sorry about that. So your trip to Iceland, was that a work trip or a? Were you listening to me? We just had a three day off site in Iceland. Oh, right. No, I generally don't listen to you. Holy fudge sickles. Man, what's the name of the podcast? It's the 88th episode of A.B. Testing. And why don't we just dive right in to the seventh of the modern testing principles. Is that cool? That's cool. All right. You can read modern testing principles on modern testing dot org. And this is maybe a record and that we're only about six minutes in once I edit out Brent's brain farts. And we are actually talking about the topic of the day, which is fantastic because we have a whiteboard full of notes. OK, number seven is the one that to me is becoming less and less controversial. Just absolutely makes sense. But it still causes a few heads to turn. What do you mean to you is less your observation is no. In my context, it's like it's making where it made sense before it is rock, freakin solid. You could not convince me to back off on the second part of this one, which is the part that people see as controversial. No, we're going to dive into that. I feel like I'm talking around it. Let me read it and then we'll talk about crap. You have a place you want to start from notes on the board so we can get now start with reading the principle. OK, here we go. Principle number seven. We expand testing abilities and know how across the team, understanding that this may reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist. So with this principle, we can focus on the first half and this ties in with principle number four about the quality culture and driving the quality culture on the team. But where this one is different, this is about for me, make sure on the same page here. This one's about making sure the team knows the test approaches, test techniques. They know teaching them that bugs lurk around boundaries, teaching them how to design chips for designing test automation. Let me take a different approach. OK, let's just take the controversy head on. But I dude, I said let's take care of the first part first. We can talk about why the controversy isn't controversial most of the episode. But what is the essence of how does this maybe you're going to get to this. But I am all right. I'm going to let you go. But you kind of principle seven. Yes. So the question to me is essentially it's the final straw in I think the modern testing. Well it's the final principle in the modern testing principles. But the observant amongst the most observant readers of the modern testing principles will notice that we don't actually address testing until principle seven. That is true. And what principle seven is essentially stating is the modern tester doesn't test. In a way. In a way. Yeah. Because again I stand by our statement that modern testing is a transient role. I'm sorry a modern tester is a transient role. Meaning they are someone who helps the team adopt modern testing principles. So for me essentially what number seven says is everything else above is executed so well and the quality culture does cover some testing as well. But the team understands testing well enough across the team spread throughout the team that they may not need that dedicated testing specialist. It's a culmination. There's purposeful and developed and careful overlap between the principles. They build on each other both sequentially and randomly. But number seven as you mentioned it's the pinnacle. It says if you are a team following modern testing principles and I remember modern testing isn't about testing as much as it's about how you approach quality in software development. It's modern testing as opposed to traditional testing. And if you follow those principles and the team gets what testing and quality are you may not need a dedicated testing specialist and that makes perfect sense. I think in this episode you're going to be playing good cop the entire time. Therefore I will play back up. One of the comments one of the pieces of feedback I've seen a lot of people will read number seven and run the risk of bit flipping the whole modern testing principles. I agree. And saying oh my God. Brent and Alan are just on the same. They will say we don't respect the craft. Or no we're on the same meme. This is what I'm talking about the same test is dead meme. And one of the things I want to say is that I'm actually we're not saying that. I have said I think it's on its way and the thing that I will say is in this particular case you can you can either be the butterfly or you can be the wind. So those who interpret this as a test is dead message and respond from fear like the one thing I will say on that front is like first off fear actually isn't real. This is super philosophical but fear isn't real. It's about what might be not what is. And so the intent on this one going back to the first half of your of the principle is like no you can control your own destiny. If you if you understand the prior six principles you will understand that your job and your business is better suited by you taking up the role and spreading the knowledge of how to do the testing activity. And as that testing activity is spread throughout your organization not only will the business benefit but one of the consequences a testing specialist just won't be needed. One of the things I've noticed from those who dig in their heels and say this is who may reject this principle or modern testing principles because of this principle is there is a belief among many in testing and I'll interject and get my stack correct. I am happily blown away by how many people agree this is the right direction or tell me we're already doing this. Thanks for putting a name for what we're doing. It is not some fad that you it's not an echo chamber of you and I talking about this thing. It is actually happening. It was happening without us. We are just trying to put names to the things we see that are happening and encourage others to go in this direction. So the fear or the worry I see the biggest thing that comes to me from people who are digging their heels in on no is they believe that testing skills are a unique thing that is only learnable and practiceable by people with a unique mindset and people that do specific areas of practice and they believe that they are I don't want to say special snowflakes you may but they believe they are uniquely suited to software testing and that skill that the developers programmers of code do not have the right air quote mindset to do testing and what I've found what what shifted me over this direction was I found that teaching developers to test was not only not that hard it was fun for me and it was fun for the developers I worked with I have done this now on three different teams and indirectly so now I went through two teams of teaching developers to test and now I am teaching people to teach developers to test and it is it works developers can learn to test it isn't a unique unteachable skill that needs to be done by a dedicated specialist you know I've been doing this now for so long I'm beginning to forget what it was like when I held that belief like to me is just absolutely clear in my mind that testing is an activity and not a job yes right and for me from a business point of view it's a testing activity that dev not only should and can but must do and when I say must I mean there are so many product related benefits by getting dev on this you end up with a much better design of the product there's accountability and ownership they're like oh yeah I thought of this test I want to do this test but accountability ownership just quite honestly I'm gonna say that those are useless criteria I don't think so when people think of something themselves they want to do it more the biggest problem I have with accountability this is an aside the biggest problem I have our podcast we're all yeah the biggest problem I have with the term accountability is that so I have pay attention to simultaneously the word choices people use and then I pay attention to the actions that are associated with those word choices and what I've come to conclude is that when people the majority of people use the term accountability what its purpose in life is is to publicly identify who to blame when it all goes to shit and I don't care about that no I care more about self accountability I'm not talking I'm not talking about yeah I'm talking about self accountability when I mentioned that so yeah I don't like that either the I don't even associate that word that way anymore so the way I would phrase it slightly differently is that once the devs understand this they realize holy crap it's actually not as hard as they thought right because actually at this point in time the testing has been around for so long there are multiple devs that have been in the in their arena or in their discipline for decades that have never actually owned testing and so to them it's this mysterious burden but when they realize when it gets demystified what you find is that no it's a benefit to them because it allows them to control their own destiny allows them to reduce surprises at the end of the milestone it allows them to control you know how many sleepless nights and weekends are working and gain confidence that when they did their check in it's done and it's not coming back yes right and so these are these are all strong benefits to to the actual developer whether it informs you know creates accountability or ownership I don't know that that's really important but what I do find from the human condition what people want is to control their own destiny and that's exactly what I'm talking about right they want to be the wind they don't want to be the butterfly yeah and I could reiterate and say exactly what I'm talking about so we yeah I want to tell a meta story about modern testing it's going to lead into this okay I realize that I have to it's actually going to be beneficial to tell the meta story so of course I talk about modern testing a lot on this podcast I have never once gone to my team and say here is modern testing is what we're gonna do some listen to the podcast hey everyone they go yeah we want to do modern testing but what I do on my team instead is make sure that the principles not in name like follow this principle but it guides what we do and we've been focusing a lot recently on the quality culture and and not just on my team across all of unity one of the things we discussed in our offsite last week is how our people in QA our testers they are accountable and to use that word again for nurturing as we say in principle number four that quality culture yep and we talk about the quality culture a lot and people and they get that everybody everybody all of unity QA is on board with yes we need to improve the quality culture and here's some approaches on how to do it I talked to them that's worked on my team everybody's fully on board that's good so one of the things that came up in the offsite we had a people discussion it's not like a Microsoft stack ranking we just talk about what people are doing how they're doing the twist on this is on the potential category we talked about people's potential we talked we framed it a little bit around how well around leadership skills and how well they could drive a quality culture or modern testing principles across the org so that's the main part on how I push or guide the team towards modern testing principles both on my team and outside of my team but I had it I was a little afraid to say it out loud but I did and I wasn't too afraid I want to see what would happen I was ready for a discussion but I when talking about one of my employees I said pretty much something like this blah blah blah they're working on this and this is probably the first person on my team first person on my team who probably won't do any testing as part of their day-to-day job and everybody got it I said okay cool yeah I didn't have to explain that nobody went what's the it was like okay cool that's great no the I see I see why you think they're great that's awesome yeah no the fact that you are basically saying this guy is probably going to be the first across this line and when that happens that is a win for the business right in the fact that that seems to be universally understood unless your leadership team does what I do and that is ignores you when you're talking no no no we are good at calling we are good at calling each other out I think if I would have said that six months ago in our meeting there would have been more discussion but in this case it's head nods oh that'd be cool yeah awesome it's like you doing the right thing there yeah that's that's great to see in terms of this stuff I mean that that might be relevant what do you think what do you think because what in principle seven we're basically saying you know what it doesn't matter if testers is dead or not you doing this shifting the testing activity to the whole team especially the development team and removing the the bottleneck around the testing specialist that benefits the business sure and what you're saying is hey you got tacit agreement in your business that either they observe that or they seek or they observed the promise of it which do you think it is and how do you think you got there I got there because we took off we loosened the tourniquet versus ripping off the band-aid we talked about this before where many teams have failed moving to a no tester team is by ripping off the band-aid and blood spurts everywhere and people that yep metaphorically this has been a very gradual change and I believe that's the reason it's working and I believe that's the way it will work for 99 or more percent of the teams out there the gradual change in your in your pace of gradual can be more or less than mine but it's worked because both on a individual level people reporting to me on the teams they work on and then on my overall management team and the weird part is I'm in a separate basically division from the rest of my peers so we don't overlap that much at all okay so it's services are for the most part just completely separate from there's part of my org that overlaps but largely separate so they have begun to see what's going on over here on on my team over over on my team and begin to adopt some of those things but I think as far as my peers accepting that was just seeing me we've been talking about quality culture across the org together I think they see it from that they get where we want to go what building a quality culture roadmap has helped me to do we can maybe dive into this in a future episode is it's it's a framework or a model that's worked to get everybody on the same page with what we want quality to do across unity and it's again I haven't it's a model all models are wrong some are useful but it's helped to drive even teams outside of mine towards something that looks like modern testing like you saw a rough you saw an early draft of this yeah this is what we're working from no and it reflects many or most of the modern testing principles and moving from the left to the right in the for better for it's not the right word for the maturity model I built no I know and I think we'll probably end up talking about it on the podcast because I think it's a good follow-up like this you know episode seven or the series that we're doing right now is around what the hell do we mean when we say this right right I think in the next series of follow-ups will probably be more practical around hey this is the phase this is what it means like again it's this whole concept is a living yeah yeah breathing thing on it although I will say in advance I think we better do a mailbag episode 89 to catch up on a lot of questions I agree then we'll figure out what to do after that but what do you think was there anything so I get your approach I get the strategy but for the listeners like what is when you if you were to do this all over again knowing what you've learned now because you were kind of also making it up as you went along if you were to go back and say okay if I were to start this all over again what would have concretely been your first goal given that you were trying to ease into it I'll have to think for a minute while I talk but my gut reaction is not much it wasn't as much as that I figured out what I was doing when I went along of course I always adapt and adjust as I go along what I've done as I've moved along is tried to document how I'm doing what I'm doing maybe I would have dove into building that model earlier a lot of it the reason that I was able to spit that out the reason it's been pretty adoptable without a lot of editing by a large part of the team is because it was all in my head first well so yet so one of the things that I know it explained what was in my head so I had to sometimes it to dump out what you do intrinsically for people to understand it and you understand definitely had a vision yes right and over the last year plus I think we've put a put a name to that vision in combination with what you're doing now as well as my own experiences on this front right your experience is you slowly loosen the tourniquet right yeah my experience I guess it was it was a band-aid rip right right but in I was able to succeed through it because I had testing experience and several of my IC's had testing experience so like one of the things I think helped me deal with the the band-aid rip is with the fact that I was in charge and I had this balance experience yes and that would help too so one thing to keep in mind is and again I go back to the phrase from heffetz disappoint people at a level they can absorb which is also loosening the tourniquet at a level you can handle there are parts of my org in fact a big chunk of my org where things were going fine we had the right leadership in place both from executive leadership as well from people on the team that knew what they were doing that we did eliminate the test role so parts of my team we've done that and was the right time it's worked out very well I'm not and I know which parts of my team that will happen in next and I know which parts will take a while longer but it's so my role is a lot about keeping an eye on how much bleeding is coming out on the tourniquet continually loosening it to keep the metaphor going and finding out when the right time is to take it off completely so I'm parts of my team it's just a very gradual experience to make sure we get it right and parts of my team were there and I've done it and eventually as I mentioned before on the podcast if I do my job right and we get this far I no longer have direct reports and I do something different I unity I have a hypothesis here okay and it's it's entirely anecdotal and based on what I've observed over the last couple of years here at Microsoft and I think it potentially aligns with what you're saying I do think this push towards a combined engineering model is unstoppable the unified engineering sorry thank you unified engineering model is unstoppable it will eventually be more common than not but that means a lot of companies teams are gonna go through transition and my hypothesis presently is when you do that and you have a separated discipline you're gonna have a different ordering or you're gonna have a set of ICs on both sides and a set of managers on both sides and the task is how do you intermix this my hypothesis and I will say it is absolutely untested or unproven but my hypothesis is if you form this up and you have a former dev manager as the manager of the team now you have to take the the the boil the frog approach but if it's the other way around and you put the test manager in charge as long as he's worth his salt and management no I think I think you can rip the bandy I that's my hypothesis I think that could work um the they may not even be the the test manager I think a leader you need it need a leader with the experience on the team so probably the manager but one of the things I'm doing on all my teams is making sure we have those leaders in place to help work directly with everyone on the team to make sure they know what to do because right now we have dev managers in place I think is fine dev managers in charge which is fine but they need you know this is what I did this is basically what I did on my last couple teams at Microsoft I was the the quality guy yep air quote and my job was to make sure that everyone did the right types of testing and eventually we did some of that for them through some vendors but long story so yeah I think your hypothesis is correct you need it doesn't work if you don't have people on your team who deeply understand testing to help with the transition no yeah for a while for a while you need a deep specialist to help the team become generalizing specialists and I'm now thinking through why do I think that when you when you if you do the reorg model where the former dev manager is the one that's still in charge why do you need to to ease the frog or boil the frog it's essentially because you're now actually also you not only need to also teach the dev the new development nice he's or the new unified engineers you know how this quality culture works but you need to teach that guy or gal what is the measures that now defines success because in some regards it's gonna it's gonna fly in the face of their experience right a lot of the times is you know how how accurate are your estimates right right but now you're actually making that guy a little bit more holistic and when I found actually is is test managers moving into that role already get the dev side of it yeah right I believe that's true and that's that's that's the modern tester role right so let me talk about DevOps for a minute and this again I will I will dive jump it on the outside and send her back on the world some company did a survey recently that irked me a little bit because they and I have I have semantic buttons that you can push on me all over the place not as bad as some but bad enough so they're talking about DevOps and they were surprised in their survey that only 50% of the teams they surveyed had dedicated DevOps teams and I thought what the fudge sickle because to me too high or too low well to me as I learned DevOps and I studied DevOps DevOps is a culture it is but you could have a DevOps team that would help the team drive towards that culture so what I tweeted a while back which I think is relevant here they said after reading that I said I'm in the DevOps is a culture not a roll camp yet I'm only slightly annoyed that there are DevOps roles or teams as those people in teams are there to create a culture of DevOps on the team eventually the team will have a DevOps culture and not need a DevOps team yeah so I don't correct I don't need elaboration so then I tweeted again and I replaced one word see if you can tell the difference I'm in the quality is a culture not a roll camp yet I'm only slightly annoyed that there are quality roles or teams if those people or teams are there to create a culture of quality on the team eventually the team will have a quality culture and not need a quality team WTF is the difference you just replaced quality and DevOps but it still makes sense yeah I guess the only problem I had with what you said is if you had said everything and said the word test but you're right I don't think you need a quality role either so going back to that survey to me it's I think they were if you take it from a more respectful point of view and you go okay this company whoever did this they had some expectation that the majority of companies that had DevOps were in let's say the first maturity phase of going to a DevOps system right in that first maturity phase it's brand-new knowledge yeah you need to bring in specialists you need to bring in experts no I and I can teach the others yes and a lot of the times that experts gonna be doing the lot 80% of the work because it's all a bootstrapping effort yeah it's bootstrapping and leadership absolutely it's bootstrapping and leadership which leads to a question I've heard about this which is a good question I think with an obvious answer based on what you just said at least in my opinion I've had people ask me hey angry weasel they say because that's what they call me a lot of people do yeah a lot of people do so let's say I have a team that gets to a stage where they don't need a dedicated testing specialist and we go on for a while and there's turnover and the team changes and that knowledge of testing is lost now what do they do well one you retrospect on why that knowledge of quality and why that knowledge of testing was lost on the team and figure out what what to fix doesn't just shouldn't just go away but two maybe maybe you do go back and bring in a consultant to your higher you don't go higher a test team because you forgot how to test but you can bring in a air quote modern tester role to help you get back on track right it's same as you'd hire a like oh man our DevOps went to shit sorry sorry I to answer it's got already really you do it again yes right but but I think you're absolutely right because in that scenario it's hypothetical right because I'm like how would this suddenly how would this knowledge suddenly just yeah I don't I don't think it was a hypothetical question right if you do it right in a way you go from a modern tester helping the team transition if the whole team understands modern testing principles and we don't do this stuff just for that the modern testing principles aren't important just for the sake of following principles they help you make better software yeah there is like if you are kicking butt on the principles nobody's gonna want to go backwards god I want to do so much testing it was more fun when customers were bitching all the time it's been a while right where I brought up the the monkey's experiment which there's debate as to whether or not it's actual experiment or just a modern a sub s fable but this is the one where with the monkey's and the latter electric shock and the and yeah yeah yeah right and where essentially there is social pressure to conform so once you have built up the quality culture and it's and it's achieved this it's tipping point and it's now part of the subconscious most muscle memory of how your team does business how does that go away well the only way it goes away is if you get rid of all the people who have learned this muscle memory and start new or isolation if you have the same people and suddenly isolation comes into play hopefully that's because of some business imperative that's temporary but if it's not then you're out and get rid of it again and one thing to be I want to be clear on is modern testing principles or modern testing as we talk about it isn't a huge leap forward we've been doing agile for a long time pretty good at it few holes then Crispin and Gregory the agile testing books fantastic talk about them all the time it like okay that's how testing works there they talk about the whole team quality approach we're just essentially taking our experiences and what's worked and extending on that even farther and doubling down on the whole team approach yep and raising the value of the importance of data so there was a Twitter feed or a slack channel conversation I forget which at this point in time where people were like yeah this is all all you know pipe dream philosophy so and then the thing is I completely ignore those things because even though from their point of view it's theoretical for me it is long since stopped yes yes no for the thing to again we're in a little bit of an echo chamber here if you yeah if you're listening to this episode you're nodding your head going yes yes but what has been interesting to me and I mentioned Caner's book earlier because we walked into our recording our recording studio and someone had left a copy of Kim Caner's testing software in the room so it just kind of funny to see where we come from traditional versus modern testing yes but for everyone that's like you know pipe dreams and dumb and you know this is wrecking testing or ruining the craft the number of people nodding their heads and saying things like we're already doing that or I had there was one person I mentioned before on the episode where I'm sorry on the episode on the podcast where they showed my talk at test bash and to their dev team and the devs said things like it seems like common sense to me yeah it should it should be common sense we're trying to just like I did with the culture stuff that you've seen on my team we've tried to take things that we have been talking about in essence boil them down to principles they've tried it to document what it is we're saying so you have to listen to you hours and hours of podcasts to kind of get what is it we believe about where about where quality comes from that is a whole additional philosophy I think it's something we should just go deeper and on that the first thing is in my view if you look look back and think about the summation of the modern testing principles what we see is hey there is a lot of value in this community in terms of its ability to help drive up customer quality and that there is a lot of value in driving up that that customer value to the business we also see number one testing is is on its way out I'll just say no way don't split that way testing is not on its way out no testers testing specialists that that's it is on its way out testing is still necessary thank you for that correction but the business more benefits at this transitional stage by us sitting with the developers and helping them to own it yeah and then us doing something that's even more valuable pursuing value versus reducing costs and going all right now how do we take our strengths and our skills around customer advocacy make them real and focus on what actually makes these customers happy what actually pisses them off and carve a new role for these folks yeah yeah and to be clear as I mentioned this person on my team who I said would be the first person to probably not do testing as part of their job I'm not firing them they have they are still a testing specialist they are there if a testing expertise is needed but they're focused on some of these other things that bring value to the customer and doing some feature work as well there is another thing that I've observed so now I'm gonna have asked you to go back to the days where you still worked at Microsoft you and I survived and there hasn't been another big hit to test but that's mostly because at Microsoft test is there's still some pockets but it's mostly gone but in our careers here we went through major several major transitions to the test discipline right sure one you know get rid of the manual testers to there's a several others I'm forgetting but the one pattern in you and I actually talked about this long ago in in the test architecture group that used to maintain one of the things we observed is that after a year or so after that transition all the doom and gloom that was predicted didn't happen no it didn't not only that but it caused a lot of sensationalistic tweets from the outside looking in it did but not only that the people who went through that transition personally ended up better fitting more sure right we saw that they were considered more credible we saw promotion rates as a community as a whole actually moved right shift that is correct and in this case it's no different what we're saying but I'm actually saying is it doesn't make sense to own this anymore that seems to be the trends if you are a modern tester and you are leading this particularly if you're in a manager role start working with your guys and easing them into the transition and give them a new place for their career to go and that new place is a more positive one yes and I think like I'm repeating myself here but if you're worried about your you like I like the principal but all my job to go away I like testing still I would expect none of my team does more than they all do far less than half the testing on the team from that point it's a sensible transition where they do less and less the only parting wisdom I would say on this particular topic is within Microsoft and I know because it's it's now documented I saw the signs of this occurring around three years before it actually occurred right because I saw the where the momentum was going I saw what would be the obvious conclusion and I also saw what the bottleneck was the bottleneck was executives were unsure and they needed someone to show the way and I knew that once that occurred it would be rapid and I had people come back and accuse me of being prescient and I'm like no I wasn't foretelling the future I just analyzed this hindsight 2020 though during that phase I spent a lot of time arguing with people who who held on to white knuckles with their current thing and I realized now that I was pretty much a waste of my time so some people are going to merge into it some people are going to be open and spend your time influencing those but I would recommend a three strikes your out rule on the folks that are just defending the set as quo you can't save everyone and the ones who don't want to be saved your time is better spent on investing in the ones that yep do one hopefully that's good one parting comment is we want to do questions next time about modern testing principles around data around anything you want you want to know about color my hair is I'll tell you it's the same color it's always been great a few more gray hairs in there you can either join our slack channel and go to anger weasel.com wack AB testing and find that or you can just email me at Alan at angry weasel calm and I will make sure your questions hopefully get answered on the air yeah all right I'll bet I got the code next time mail for sure we give that a shot all right I am Alan I'm Brett thanks for listening we'll see you next time
