Because now it's more martial arts. It's not boxing, right? It's not like who can punch each other in the head the hardest It is can you use the momentum of the people around you to be able to achieve the effect you're looking for? Welcome to a be testing podcast your modern testing podcast Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show Everyone welcome to episode 182 of the a be testing podcast Brent is I mean, I can't even see Brent. I think he's lost but we do have Brian Pulliam here. Say hi Brian. Hey And oh, there's Brent Brent just came in he was shoveling out the barn. Hey Brent, how's it going? Hey Yeah, so I hear I'm I'm on today to interview my replacement. Is that right? The B does stand for Brent and the B could stand for Brian. So yeah, we're doing a trial run here. Okay Actually, there's a reason I wanted to have Brian here and it goes back to I don't know I think you maybe you can Brian we all worked at Mike Brent still of Microsoft. I left Microsoft seven years ago I think Brian left before then and we'll get into all that if needed or not We have no plan here But Brian can you refresh me and our listeners more because I remember most of it on how like how did we cross paths? Yeah, so Let's see. Wow. I worked at Microsoft for about nine years. I actually got hired They say they hired me as a PM But my my FTE sponsor at the time for my contract work needed an analyst But he couldn't get a budget for an analyst. So I heard an analytics PM, which was no PM work whatsoever They just basically straight up lied to get the right person in the role So I joined as an analyst and I learned how to be a PM at Microsoft Not a bad place Nathan Mira vault having come up with what that role means originally and I worked with in a group called engineering excellence, which had a lot to do with a rotational effort to Understand what it meant to be a really good tester or a really good PM or a really good engineer and then rotate back into the product works and bring what you've learned back to office Azure and name any other big orgs you'd like so there I I found a close friend in the name of Paul God who was a big test champion and he since moved on to Zillow and a few other places, but we got to talking about product quality and Then your book how we test that Microsoft came up and so ever since then I've sort of had that your name in the Back of my head and I stumbled across to find out that you live in the same city I do we live like a half mile from each other Yeah, we've walked to like what 10 minutes each way to get to a coffee shop or at least I drove it was raining Drove he probably would have got there faster if he walked but that's fine. So Good so I'm looking at this like you met outside of EE we know we I think we just barely Didn't cross paths. I think I may be left as he was coming in. Yeah So it never we never met while we were at Microsoft. In fact, we didn't meet until probably what like a month ago Yeah, something like that but Alan having had a background in Microsoft and in games and me having started out my professional career as a game developer There were too many commonalities to not reach out to Alan for a coffee chat Having him having worked at Unity me having worked in children software at a small company called humongous entertainment that melon made Children's games and one thing you didn't call out that I and this is what other good connection there's a data analyst part Brent's going ooh interesting and but You know everyone knows I thought everyone knows I shouldn't say that all three listeners probably know I do a blog post every week And there is one where I talked about the different sort of tests and a big fan of this one from Pat lunch, Yoni called Working genius. I've also done strengths finders and Brian knows a lot about strengths finders I thought oh, you know who else I know who loves strengths finders. It's Bert. Jertson This well, I don't know who that guy is But you know three then Alan Yeah, and to be clear I would be very clear I am NOT against strengths finders and actually Brian walked me through I took the test again He gave me a key to take it and results are slightly different than before but you know in the same ballpark And I've evolved it's been 10 years since I took it So not not a non van But I thought it'd be cool to maybe have you two talk about strengths finders a little bit because I know Brent Brent's a big fan It sounds like we're gonna be singing to the choir. I've said this on this before my view is strengths it's got all the The mystical psychotyping of things like Myers Briggs But it's actually useful Actionable and something you can develop and grow in so for example My number one strength is ideator But that's my top one That's why you drive me crazy. No, it's actually The ideator is I would say one place where we where we Connect on the the problem is is every strength is also Perceived by others as your biggest weakness sure right right my me beam ideator. That's actually the place where my my Tangentation comes from if I can Be invited to invent a word It's because I see So a lot of people who don't have ideation will view me as constantly having my head in the clouds right whereas I go well It's it's actually the same thing So Alan back in the day when we predicted the the beginning of the end for test I had people come up to me and go wow that was really As if I was like a prophet and dreamed it and whatever and I'm like no I just saw how things were connected and I saw the momentum and I saw that Yeah, unless something changes and I don't see anything in The way to do that change the momentum is in this direction This is an obvious conclusion as we've also talked before I kind of feel the same way around what's happening around in the AI space Brian butts so I feel listeners as I was talking Brian was doing all sorts of positive body language like thumbs up like oh wow I'll interpret it as someone who can at least pretend to know least talking about on this topic Oh for sure. I will tell you I'll give you my quick spiel I think the gallon might have heard this already, but I've been in tech for about 26 years, but it hasn't been in one discipline. I was a TPM for a while was an engineer I was an EM Work for Microsoft Zillow Coinbase and other companies, but my most fulfilling role was none of those my most fulfilling role was this volunteer volleyball coach role with my wife for 13 years and What really struck me about this is I didn't even want to go the first day My wife got this job as coach. She and I met playing volleyball It's kind of like part-time relationship status, and I said why would I ever want to coach like I love playing volleyball Why would I ever want to help people that are terrible at it get better at it and? And then after the first season I remember thinking wow if I had three million in the bank I would probably just do this for the rest of my life until I was physically unable to do it anymore and Then maybe five minutes later Brent. I said wait a minute how am I so bad at interpreting or Predicting what will make me fulfilled in life if I can go from something I thought was going to be stupid to it being one of the most fulfilling activities. I've ever had That freaked me out I'm like wait do I have to say yes to everything going forward or to all I know I need to go learn a little Bit more about myself. I need to run this post mortem and figure out why I felt so differently before versus after And I turned it turns out I love helping other people succeed, but only when they are excited and committed to their goals so not a teacher Okay, so I'm guessing you have developer in your top five. I don't anymore. I used to okay mine are strategic maximizer who Communication and positivity if that's not a coach. I don't know what is but that's that is 100% a coach Yeah, yeah, it's it's amazing so I remember or sales or sales could be sales Yeah, easy to I like influencing other people as long as it's for a good cause so that's great and to the listeners Yeah, yeah, please translate to English for everyone else Alan is is Like I think this episode might just be for Alan because he is busily cracking him home His own self up so Alan maybe you should share with the audience We're not doing a live feed today No, no, no live feed today But maybe I'll draw some pictures for the show notes. Yeah, the it's interesting like you you mentioned maximizer I am a restorative. So for for the audience Maximizer is a strength. They want I'll put it this way maximizers can't stand the use of the 80-20 rule like what do you mean 80-20? I want a hundred right it maximizers strive for Perfection one one fact I don't know Brian if you've ever actually done this Gallup has a bunch of really educational things on on YouTube for each of the strengths and if you have if you have restorative in your top five something ungodly like 95 percent chance that Maximizer is your number 34 Interesting. Yeah, it's someone with restorative is driven to fix broken things They're good at identifying broken things and they want them fixed, but I'll tell you once it's fixed. I'm good I don't I don't need to take it the extra 5% that differs from a Maximizer who's like no wait wait. Why are we stopping? We still got more So how when you're a maximizer, how are you doing on your investment? I mean, I'm I'm coast fire now So I guess you could say good. I mean, you know, I work maybe three hours a day Oh, no, that that that's fantastic. I'm just thinking I'm not a maximizer obviously Yeah, but I'm wondering do you ever find yourself going? No. No, I'm not gonna sell now. It's gonna go another point It's gonna go another point. No, not at all. Like okay philosophically, I have a certain approach to Money I have now can be used for something that not only is useful for me now But better for long term and with as much as research I've done Most people lose money when they make decisions to change where their money is. That's where most people lose their money so I'm okay with the Ron Pope you'll sort of set it and forget it approach with you know call me a boggle head or focused on index funds and I have a year of Savings set aside kind of guy, you know live within my means. Yeah, I When it comes to investment, I refuse to accept that I am in my 50s So I still like oh I totally could make it a killing on that one. Let's go see. Anyway, all right I will tell you like this I've been grabbed glad you brought up this idea of What's the flip side of that strength and how other people would be annoyed by it? Because that is something I think a lot of people Who are exposed to this originally don't don't see there's a there's the three or four perspectives here. There's How does it help you in your career? There's Given that strength. What does your manager need to know about you and to get the best out of you with that strength? Sometimes you have to manage up because they don't know this framework What kind of environment is really good for you like is the team you're on? Recognize your strength as a currency. Is it even valued there? And then thirdly like what are those red flags to watch out for? Because with maximizer, for example, it is Very much you want to eke out that last bit like I used to work you guys know Bruce Dawson at all like Don't know that name. Okay. No, so Bruce Dawson I used to work with Bruce Dawson back in the day in game development and he went on To go work on very nerdy stuff at Google But he is like the maximizers maximizer like he's trying to figure out how to optimize the last little bit out of every single thing So if there was a picture in the dictionary of maximizer, it would be pushed awesome But with ideation right it is about how do you not come across scatterbrained? And how do you make sure you're balancing? Your ideation with execution right because other people will be like when are you actually going to do something? Rather than just spout these ideas but with the restorative they help balance each other out, right? So you you get sort of more of the centrist approach where you don't have to worry about it as much if I didn't have Restorative and I did have ideation. I don't even know that we would be having this conversation Yeah, right it the the other problem with people With with ideation so think of it from like an architectural those who are good at identifying better ways of doing thing Suddenly lose interest in how we're doing it now, right? This is the common phenomenon with with a lot of architects like segue they they invented a but I think is a brilliant strategy and that is Run your your v1 project sort of partially shifted with your v2 project That way once your your v1 project is halfway done you start funneling off your your architects On to v2 and let them go ahead and start ideating for v2 But then you have your closers working on the v1 and I'm like, oh, that's freaking Beautiful. Everybody's happy Yeah, the the product ships on time because when again one of the flaws with architects is that? We're really good at coming up with a better way of doing it And if we get the power to stop ship we will because it's better. Let's do it this way This is smarter and then because we continuously do that will never actually ship that has been Without my wrist even with my restorative at times that that has been a struggle But I learned early on how to balance it Yeah, you said maximizer what else were yours Oh strategic maximizer whoo communication and positivity Oh Yeah with those strengths I'll just tell you straight up Having someone on my team with those strengths because my team is all data scientists Right. I remember one of the best employees I ever had in one regard And I'm thinking through if it was the best because he really complimented the team He had communication and it was his number one and he would send status reports I one day I was I just tried to experiment, you know what? I'm gonna have him. I hate writing the status reports I find them a waste of my time I hate writing in general because one of my strengths is analytical So I will literally spend a half hour looking at the same sentence and judging every possible way Whether you combine and restorative and I'll go no that's broken. I got a rephrase it this way. No, that's it's torturous I hate it. Whereas I live in the moment. We'll talk about that in a minute Alan Alan I'm amazed at Ellen when he and I've commented on just different skills, man It's it's different skills different talents. I had him take over my status report now number one He loved it. Right? This is the first thing to learn about strengths. I don't have communication He does so I go to him and go and I I really can't ask my employee to do this thing that I guess to me Status report and pain like there is no there's it's a perfect Union It's it's complete intersection. No, not only did he love it. I had people Asked to subscribe to my status reports never had that before ever Like are you serious? Right? It's this is what I like about both strengths finders and working genius In a little bit different, but it's actually two things I like and what I want to talk about But what you just said is if you understand how they work you understand how to actually maximize and play that jigsaw Pete puzzle maker or conductor of a team and Leverage each other's strengths working genius. I could go deep into that But it's the same sort of thing It says some people are you're good at two of the six of these things wonder invention discernment galvanizing enablement or trinasty and there's two things probably in there you kind of hate and if you things you're kind of in the middle and if you understand that different people are good at different parts of this Of going from an idea or wondering what can be done to actually getting it done You can orchestrate your team that way the other thing that's interesting and brain I haven't gone over this with you I'd love to get your feedback on it and Brian are gate already gave me a walkthrough so he can give me add some certificate commentary as well, but is they both can if they can change Yeah, I Myers Briggs based on the work of Carl Jung and says it's to you are it's not gonna change you can adapt but And it's a little horoscope and I like it I can read mine and go yeah, that's pretty much me but these are much more applicable and Here's the thing brain. You've known me since the first time I took it You know what I was doing and then in my I've evolved and I've I found other things I like doing more and I'm better at I took it last time. I was basically an IC building tools on Xbox Lots of influence involved that back then I was in order strategic learner Achiever analytical Intellection ten years ago. Okay, maybe 12 years ago today, I'm strategic still Relator because I'm I've I've become a stupid VP and I have to have to relate Arranger, which I actually love it's the favorite part of my job or like Seeing what can like putting all the pieces together. Look here's the pieces I have okay here and here and here It's like cooking. It's fun adaptability and Intellection so I'm just kind of curious maybe for you like I missed one Strategic Relator arranger adaptability Intellection are my nose. Okay, my old ones here strategic learner achiever analytical Intellection and probably if we went down and got my top ten, they probably have much more overlap So Brent just maybe starting with actually starting for either one of you like one am I correct in my interpretation that these can change over time and As you grow and change there, there's no so Gallup So the nice thing about Gallup doing this they have over 50 years of like stats on this one, right? There's no evidence that these are are permanent and even Carl Jung mentioned not Meyers that everyone calls it Meyers Briggs, but it's actually Carl Jung They did it and it's his psychotyping. Yeah, he wrongly stated that it's it's Permanent but even recent things show no. No, it's actually very common For example traumatic events will change your change your psychotype. I will tell you I experienced this myself I'm not gonna go into details in the traumatic event 30 years ago. I was intj and now I am intp I am a strong P and previously I was a strong J Didn't have much of effect obviously on the other three letters, but that one massive Impact and totally makes sense in terms of you like I could see this all makes sense to me right except maybe a ranger In terms of my knowledge of you relater. Yeah, I totally see that one At the when you left Microsoft like literally the episodes I Bet you we even recorded it because you were nervous because the majority of the time I knew you at at Microsoft It was hell. No, I will never friggin be a manager and I want to get Brian's take on this thing But and that reason was at the time remember this is I did not want to be a manager not couldn't like managing people frequently thought of being a manager being a manager at Microsoft in the 2010s kind of sucked These have changed because I've actually really enjoyed leading large teams and the challenges go on with that different set of challenges and I faced in the old days Anyway, Brian curious on your thoughts on my evolution, you know, you didn't know me back Yeah thoughts on my evolution. I will say this I think I don't you know, I didn't ask Brent this question But I think I've probably taken about a hundred and five people through StrengthsFinder so far So I've done it a bit and one of the reasons why I found it So natural for me was when I became a leader The only thing I could look back on for a foundation was athletics coaching. I'm like, okay We here's a group of people we're trying to work together. We're trying to achieve something It's hard and I remembered saying well, I need to use this strength spaced approach in the workplace I might as well try it. This is what I know and it worked really well and it worked so well I started asking other people like hey, why do you do it this way? Like here I have like two years of experience as a manager and Yet my didn't realize how much of my coaching experience would apply in the workplace But what I didn't have were stats, right? I didn't have stats that were meaningful in the workplace to say Alan should do this job or Alan would be good as a TPM If he's unhappy being a back-end engineer and here's why So if he wants to consider that discipline change, we should talk about it But when I found gallup StrengthsFinder, I said aha, this is the conceptual thing I was missing That is domain agnostic, but tells me what Alan will be good at it or Brent is good at so now when I look at your transition those new strengths that got added there were later and the Arranger and there was one other that was new. What was that a third one a cheever? Cheever was there before I think? Oh, no, no adaptability The old one sorry, yeah, so I mean it doesn't surprise me either You know you get to a point where what you can accomplish by yourself Is now a small fraction of what you're expected to accomplish in your role, right? You start off What what's the analogy I use for early career people, you know, you become an engineer or tester It's like baking a cake with a recipe like here's the ingredients. Here's the recipe now Go bake a cake and I'm gonna turn around and make sure you don't burn down the kitchen and don't swap the sugar for flour Cuz it's a bad idea. Yes, they're both white. Yes, they're both kind of look like powdery substances But don't swap them and then you get better and now I care about what you think not just about what you know But I want your opinion on things right when you become a senior But at some point around senior when people need to make that transition to what to staff or principal depending on the company you're at this You need to develop these skills or focus on how do you bring other people along for the ride because it's now no longer Whether you're the smartest or you're the loudest or you're the most successful person in the room because the projects are too complex To be able to get it across the line if you can't relate with somebody right or you can't adapt And so I don't think it's a surprise at all to say as you advance higher in leadership and the larger percentage of your work is Dealing with peers that you don't really have a lot of authority over you have to relate to them It's the only way you're gonna convince them that to make a to make a compromise, right? Or or you're the one that has to make the compromise So you have to be adaptable because now it's more martial arts. It's not boxing, right? It's not like who can punch each other in the head the hardest it is Can you use the momentum of the people around you to be able to achieve the effect you're looking for one thing? I'd like to hear more about and maybe bring you off some stuff here, too But like you mentioned you brought over a hundred people through this and help them What often happens with these tests is is people take them they go. Oh like me like you This is me as an example. I go. Oh Interesting. Wow. I like this. This is really fun and then ever do anything with it. So What advice do you have for managers on let's say let's say I put all of my directs through it Again, not knowing their results. What would be my approach to look at that stuff? Do I put them in different jobs? Do I what's like the quick managers guide to using this to? To improve myself on my team the directs that I've had every direct I've had has gone through this I made it a point in our one-on-one document Right like a Google Doc or shared doc or whatever to have the strengths at the top of the one-on-one doc So every time we open it we see it like so we're using process to visually remind us and there's a lot of engineers that Don't do great with verbal cognition to begin with right? They either have ADHD and attentive like I do or They subconsciously got into coding because they could see it. They didn't have to remember things because they could look at them all day long so Re-engaging the visual preference that a lot of people in software Have is the good first start put it at the top as a visual reminder every time. So that's number one to I Have discussions with my directs and say hey these strengths are like tools in your tool belt so when we talk about the projects you're gonna go on to or a situation at work the Manager's got to reinforce that well. What are your tools in your tool belt again? I'm asking them. Oh, I'm really good at this and that Really? How might you use those strengths in this scenario, right? It's a coaching question It's open-ended and and then thirdly I'm a big believer in having an entire team Like you said Alan take strengths finder and then I create like a matrix and it's basically got all the strengths as rows The people as columns and I sort it by most overlapping strength to most unique strengths like in this spreadsheet And the idea is the top four or five that are up there are like the social norms of the team, right? They are the cultural norms that people should expect when they join this team new employee joins I show them this and I say hey this team really loves research right or this team really loves solving problems This team really loves strategic thinking But there are some people at the bottom here who have strengths that nobody else has and you need to know who those people Are because if you need help with X There's one person on the team that has that superpower and that's Sally or that's Sarah And so it becomes a means of onboarding But it also gives and unlocks capabilities for peer mentoring that didn't exist before Because the granularity in strengths finder is so high when you talk about 34 choose 5 right that's a lot of combinations the odds you have somebody on the team that's identical to you is very very small So use always something you can learn from other people and this helps Provide a roadmap for that That's that's great advice and I just want to point out because people that are not watching the video feed that doesn't exist Brent is in love Yeah, yeah There's there's definitely a bromance Potential here a couple of things that Brian said it cracked me up because I'm like yeah I could I could share my version of that right now We've all shared our five online except me So I'll go through that quickly and I and then I want Brian to analyze you Yeah I was good just I was going to to set that stage and then I want to answer your question And there's another question that I want to weigh in on as well ideation number one relater individualization restorative analytical now my question to Brian given Individualization what do you think I do with strike fighters? Well, let's see if you're an individualization Strength you're intrigued with this unique qualities of each person if I am prime customer. Sorry, go on, right? Yeah You know if I was your manager Then I would ask if you want to get deeply involved with matching people to projects because you're probably a good judge of each individual Strengths and their weaknesses which is probably going to optimize the org's productivity I'm probably gonna ask you if you want to teach internal training classes or mentor new employees Because you're likely gonna spot how each person learns differently. Yep. I would say I don't like the teaching idea, but I love mentoring Yeah, yeah, it kind of depends on the person right? No, no getting at the strength like in in its isolation We have to combine it with the rather ones. Right? I was gonna say and you would have realized that once you combined it with relater, right? Right and and given that You know your ideal environment is definitely one where you don't have leaders that think that every dev is fungible, right? You don't philosophically you're not a believer that I can take any dev and put them on any project because that kind of goes against What you're thinking about from individualization perspective So you don't you don't want to work where you have a leader that's like we need to hit this target Like how many warm bodies like even the phrase warm bodies, you know We're butts and seats are things that you want to steer clear of because that's it often not your ideal environment Those are trigger words for yeah. Yeah Yep, and then thirdly, you know because I work with a lot of clients trying to find to find jobs There's a set of questions that I usually suggest people ask in the interview to help suss out whether or not Individualization is a strength that this team that's hiring a position for Would would find value in right and you would try to ask sort of balancing question Let's say you're behind schedule on a project and you can take three people that don't understand the code base But they're immediately available and they'll have to ramp up or you have one person you can apply to it But it means you're not gonna hate your deadline. What do you do? What I would look for is a leader that's like well I'm gonna take the person who's the expert and put them on this team because those three people are likely gonna create More bugs along the way and I'd rather be a little bit over the deadline With someone who doesn't require a lot of ramp up. So I think I so in your example I think I would actually I think I would far more Be far more likely to actually take the three not because of the heartbeats because more of my perspective on diversity and inclusion Because I believe that with three I'm gonna get more rounded across the 34 on strengths and I do actually almost literally think in This way. Okay. Now, how quickly can I understand these guys and get them working as a team towards a positive direction and work in the The appropriate training as they go along like you did an excellent job there much of the things I thought you were gonna go into like you can look at those strengths and see why For a big part of my career people would say Britt. You should not be a manager. You should be a Architect I got that for a large portion of my career But if you look in my view correctly at these strengths you go. No, that's a mistake This is not a guy. This is a guy that I don't like being an IC. I Don't like being a manager of managers. I love being a frontline manager and With my understanding of strengths and I'm sure Brian you you you see the same thing that makes sense Yeah, it makes total sense. You know if you have one of these top fives in execution That's about as far away from execution as you can get without feeling like you don't get to solve Those type of problems right restorative like there's a fingerprint to the top five Where I play this game and I say guess what my job title is based on the top five strengths And it doesn't mean that's the job they have but oftentimes people feel like their job is off We do this exercise and I say, you know that fingerprint It doesn't look like the title you've got and I wonder if that's Supporting evidence for something for you to consider like a transition at some point I would say I'm surprised someone said don't be a manager Brent, you know when you've got This individualization and relater you've got two of these relationship building strengths in your top five Engineers on average you don't have that you know I'd say 90% of engineers end up with what two of their top five in execution Maybe one or two in strategic thinking and then the last one is you know What it's either an influencing a relationship and that's kind of the footprint the way I would describe the scenario Now looking back is that the people who made that feedback? right number one this was This is like the first 10 years of the career and strengths have been around a lot longer than that But I didn't have visibility to it till I don't know last 15 years So I didn't have the knowledge But if you look at the strengths that there are certain things that people see Though the see outside in even though they don't know the language for me being an idea guy I got that all of the time me being effective at fixing broken things and being highly analytical They saw that all the time They didn't see the other things because they were outside looking in The other aspect is looking back at least two of the people that I that said this I'm fairly certain were activators Okay, and and for the for our audience an activator is someone with with It's a it's an awesome strength. It basically means they need very little data if any at all to make a high confidence decision the risk of an activator is They can make bad decisions. But what they do is they they they really drive This energy around Ellen my answer to your question Where they don't make sense right? You're an introvert And you're now put in a job where you you Do more? people Work, okay There's no way for you to avoid talking to people as much it maybe it was when you were in I see When we talk about the strengths like why do they change? I'll go back to that question. Here's an observation I Have done and and I have done actually several at this point in time I think I'm I may not be as high as you But I have done at least triple digits on these ones and I if you print out all 34 was one exercise that I find fascinating and that is Like Gallup does the top five and they do a sort of a simplification effect but if you print all the top four what I find to be an education or 34, sorry an educational exercise is Go down from the top and then write a line Where where you where you feel? That you are not using this on a daily basis Right. So for me, I know I use my top six on a daily basis and my number six is responsibility I know I use my top six on a daily basis Then then make a new line where you go You know what? I've noticed that I can keep going down and I go I use these ones on a weekly basis Command is for example my number 10 and I have to go to command mode At least once a week, but I don't do it daily Then you could also go monthly and then there's some of them like you just like straight up like for me Maximizer I literally never do or if I do it is so freakin rare I might as well say literally never do and if you think about that Right, if you go into a new role, it would make sense That you're gonna go down your strength preference and then going Oh, I'm in a new role where where I have to use this not weekly but daily and as you practice that because they're not these are The the Gallup company will refer to them as what they are identifying here is your top Inherent talents and so they're developable Developable I'm not certain that's the word you can you can train in it the resources that that I mentioned on Gallup I went there for ideation and they talk about Okay How do you know if you're overdoing it? What to do about it? How do you know if you're underdeveloped in your ideation and what are things to do? Alan and I we spent a lot of time talking about Johnson on here right Johnson from my point of view is a guy that is Formerly teaching you how ideation works and how to take advantage of it This is Steven Johnson author of where good ideas come from Okay, and and the other thing that's fascinating if you go and look at if you go and look at the Gallup stats Anyone can can get better in any of these strengths But if if it's high in your natural talent list you developing in this You'll see they claim a ten times productivity boost because you're naturally inclined anyway They're just formalizing the things that that instinctively you already understand design patterns fits within analytical and restorative in ideation and up until before I learned design patterns I kind of designed that way But I didn't know why and what it was then when I learned that I'm like whoa and suddenly I had a huge boost in In my coding Alan for me. I totally get why relater is there? I kind of would have expect something more and I'm bringing out my cheat sheet Yeah, was there any influencing strengths on there? Yeah, that's what I was looking at I don't see None. No, it is fascinating that achiever was there both times because it really is just summarizes the story Brent just said right You know if you are if achievers in your top five, so you care about doing a really good job and having a high impact What are you gonna do you are gonna run experiments subconsciously on what skills are? Working well in your new role, right? You're gonna AB test this right? You're gonna have control treatment right and then you're gonna try something that works well And you're gonna say I'm gonna dig deeper on that right and so it's not surprising to me that those with achiever Will start to develop their strengths to a point where their top five might evolve when their roles change over time Yeah, I was just looking at it at the same the same pivot that Brian was just mentioning in execution you have a ranger who the way I summarize a ranger is They take joy at getting large numbers of other people to do their job for them What's interesting with me is that? Influencing doesn't even show up in my top ten. Oh Really that is pretty common in tech like I I've had a number of people take it Generally speaking that the results skew a little bit more towards Executing and strategic thinking as the top two themes and if I recall correctly I didn't write it down, but if I recall correctly you have three and influencing Brian Yeah, which is why you know, which is why I did well as a PM, right? I come into Microsoft as an analyst and then I take this career builder cuz you know L&D offers it and like the bottom thing on the survey is like project manager and I'm like, wait a minute I got a PM and the project managers like it's a hundred and thirty fourth It's like literally like the last job title they suggest for me, but I'm like, wait a minute Is PM a project manager in this case? And I was like, no, not really like if you could Design a role where you need to influence without authority, right? Then it is this PM role at Microsoft is why I enjoyed it while I did it Yeah, that's the yeah, that's the the influencing skill the way I describe So Alan the way you can think of it, right is it's almost like with Myers Briggs Executing if you were if you were to think of executing as Getting tasks done you can think of strategic thinking about getting thoughts done. So it is and the way I think this works is obviously people that work with me know I I Have you would say I have influence I'm able to get people to change But I don't do it through the traditional influencing skills I'm I'm heavy on strategic Heavy strategic thinking, you know relations and executing I do it by Getting I did it to it by getting stuff done Here's an example. I was talking to a team today about how we're gonna do a migration and It isn't about going to convince a team like this is how you do it and get them all bought on board and and And doing the influencing part of that I do it via execution. We're gonna hand hold the team through Initial migration or get some learning from that When we're going to From there, we're gonna get some documentation in place So another team can try and follow that while it will make sure we're there for support They can get through that once we get enough Automate workflow automation documentation in place where think everybody can do the rest of the migration on their own We'll let them do that and it'll it'll snowball from there. But we get stuff done and people See it as a good idea, but not because I've gone in and played the role of maximizer or or whoo I just just not in my wheelhouse I'm gonna do it through getting a good plan together Getting the pieces in place to execute that plan and then making sure we produce results Yeah, one of the things that that you brought up earlier you asked earlier. It's okay. I do this with my whole team How do I how do I leverage this as a manager? Okay, the very first thing is I will say I Now don't do the book you showed I do this one straight this is for the for the listeners Strength finders 2.0 Brent has strengths leadership 2.0, which I probably need to go read Here's one I suggest which is called. It's the manager Okay, I gotta I gotta go expand my my book list, which is basically Brent's book with an appendix for all the strengths, but it's also about The role of a leader transitioning a little bit more to coach They compared to telling us what to do in the past the thing I find it's great about this one And I don't I don't have that other one. I have three more here I could show but but I don't have that one. I'm like damn it No, the thing that's nice around this one is you can go through and it gives you a clue as a manager How to kind of put yourself in other people's shoes now me as an individualizer I do that fairly well It's sort of the thinking man's empathy like I understand Well, but if you don't have a clue and you need a clue because what I find is you just just start with five And then you start having conversations around How would you solve this problem? your way Right in the confused because they're like wait a minute. I thought you're supposed to tell me your way No, no, no, I'm not trying to clone myself what I'm trying to do Right. If you are a clone of me then yeah that job to figuring out your way of doing this is gonna be a lot easier I have a lot of hands-on experience But it's it's around how do we Because if you if you if you help them learn how to solve the problem their way They are gonna do it so much better So much differently than you most likely and they're gonna be happier at the same time An old manager of mine used to tell me productive people are happy people and I'm going to tell you that is bullshit It is happy people are productive people get causality in the correct order Yeah Yeah, I will say like when I've I've had to learn this as a parent, right? You know I have chores for the kids to do and you know Not all the chores are created equal one of them takes 45 minutes and one takes five minutes and the first Dozen times I tried coming up with the system and then I was like wait a minute Do I care about the how here or like I didn't do we need to more be more like Alan like I need to be In a ranger and then be like look this is the list of chores that needs to get done You know what done to find is because I'm in tech and so of course there's requirements that list what a clean bathroom look like but So that my ten-year-old doesn't like, you know do half the job and I said go figure it out I don't care how you break this up and they came up with a solution I would never have come up with in a million years and it was the following We will do every job every both kids will do every chore They will each just do half of it and I was like that is so brilliant and so simple and I wouldn't like and I was Embarrassed like that how stupid I felt when my nine-year-old and my twelve-year-old Came up with something in five minutes and I was like well Let's come up with a wait and then you can bid on it and then there's a budget You know like I'm trying to PM this with story points They're like no We're just gonna all do both that we're all gonna do both Both of us will do all the chores and we'll just get tell when it's halfway done and then we'll switch and I was like wow That I just got to get out of the way Like I like I don't have these execution strengths like my some of my kids do so let them run with it Into my to that I'm just gonna comment like seriously what problem can't pair programming solve exactly All right, we are out of time here, but Brian I do want to give you I know you have What do you do in these days anything you want to plug or talk about? Please please take some soapbox time. Sure. So I'm I now do career coaching for people in tech having been Had something like 11 or 12 different job titles and found what fulfills me has changed over time I now help people in tech with three use cases Landing a job in tech getting promoted and career clarity There's a fair number of people that are looking for two or all three of those these days so if anyone's interested in talking about My approach and how I help others they can just go to refactor coaching calm All right, I'll put that link in the show notes and It's basically just a landing page. It's not a lot out there But it is very much a strengths based coaching approach to helping you achieve your career goals Very cool. Very love it. This has been fun I've never seen so many hearts come out of eyeballs. I have with Brent today, but Super fun. I learned a lot and I'm excited to read some more about this and I have reinvigorated my interest in this stuff I think it's really valuable. All right. Well, that's all we have time for because I have a four o'clock apartment I'm Alan. I'm Brent
