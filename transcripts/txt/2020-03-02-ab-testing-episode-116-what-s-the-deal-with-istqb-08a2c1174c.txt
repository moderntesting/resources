What's the deal with I Stq B? Welcome to a B testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent Will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we are back again for another episode of a B testing. I don't know what number it is That's Brent stuff 116 that's what's that number in binary? It's Frantically counting on his fingers. Hey Ben What's new pussycat Wow? Have you ever been to Scottsdale, Arizona? Oh, that's right. You went to Scottsdale, Arizona I've never been there because I'm not although I'm older chronologically. I am NOT that old. I Understand the comment you are attempting to make know the comment was made I Yeah, I went there yes, the short answer is no, but that was that was more boring than the proper answer Go ahead. I am you went to Scottsdale. I Did you golf I did not so? Did you sit outside? Oh my god? about the heat oh This is gonna be a fun adventure today So never been to Arizona Or Scottsdale anyway, I realized after the trip that I had in fact been at Arizona before My as a as a young kid Ling we used to do trips to Lake Havasu Which has the London Bridge at the songs all about? So I've seen that but I do I do recall it moved there. Yep Have still have not seen the Grand Canyon Anyway, what I did see You know you know on every cartoon ever when they talk about the desert they show the the typical Cactus with the arms yep to the side That's first time I've seen those in real life and I was surprised by how Gigantic they are they're like tree size wait wait how big are they? They are so big That they're tall they are that trombone sound effect like two to three at least two times up to three times the size of a Standard adult human it was kind of cool It was neat that that They didn't have light pollution at night, so you got to see the stars Their night times were the same temperature as the Seattle daytime. Oh So like 40 degrees yeah, I mean cuz it's the desert so it it just back and forth We didn't go out exploring The this was just a 3d weekend And part of the point was just hanging out by the pool and drink That part I like yes, we did Unfortunately, we brought the kids with us all of them are just the two youngest the ones that still live with us. Yeah We didn't even tell them our oldest until I send them a picture from the in and out and in Scottsdale He's like what are you doing in California? So he might be a little angry at us because it's the first time we've ever done a trip and not even ask if you wanted to go But it was it was good time my we are now in the moment of the year And because it's sleepier Which is tomorrow Not for the podcast listeners, but for you and me leap day is tomorrow leap day. Yeah. Yes Day is tomorrow. So every four years ish My wife is Exactly two weeks older than me. She just celebrated her birthday Wednesday So two weeks from last Wednesday it will be mine and I am Officially moving a step closer to a RP. Oh, I've been a member for years Yeah, it's I was talking with one of my employees yesterday and it there's this psychological Thing that happens when you work in the software industry where the majority of people are 20 something 30 something's And so you walk around you see everyone in their 30s and You just you it's very easy to forget that you are not Yes. Yes, I Went down to the Bay Area yesterday for a set of meetings We should talk about DevOps sometime. I don't know why this because it's so close to testing and I It's so close to I think actually I think I've mentioned on the podcast that it is The best tool I've ever had to accelerate the achievement of a quality that that's I was down there talking about DevOps In California twice on my mind. I think actually I mean we could we should talk about it because I have a hypothesis that DevOps is is in essence a Service oriented actual implementation of true agile Yes, I mean but just like everything else in agile. There are fantastic ways just completely effort up Absolutely true as well one quick little bit. I'll just we'll get back on the topic of the day I promise but I find it interesting You know DevOps was never meant to be a role meant to be a culture that got rid of throwing things over the wall not from Deb the test but from Deb to Operations and the idea of a DevOps culture meant that the full team anyone on the team could deploy or Whatever culture where it's easy for anyone to safely deploy rollback, etcetera their stuff Which helps fulfill several of the agile principles? The DevOps role has grown out of that for some reasons that some of us used to fight now We just throw our hands up near say yeah, we I think we get what you mean as long as you do it, right? But what I'm finding as I have an open DevOps position on my team is that As I look at resumes of people who say they do DevOps it is Just as wide if not wider than the resumes of people that say they do testing Wait, why do you have a DevOps position on your team? Your team I run you're hiring Okay, so are you hiring? Because I'm confused I work at Unity. No, I understand just just didn't know I just making sure that how much alcohol you drank anyway Well, so to me it seems like you're hiring an SRE role because as you Stated DevOps is a cold it is it is really in the okay. Let me be clear Do you want to know where DevOps go 10 years ago? I would have been hiring for a Infrastructure person a platform person a tools person Okay today the fancy sexy things to call those roles DevOps. Oh I did not realize that I hate that with great intensity. So the team I the team I ran at Microsoft my last team basically was a DevOps team Airquote that the listeners can't see DevOps is what you call people that build all the tools and Processes and things that allow you to quickly and easily ship stuff to customers. Okay, so can can we start? Trying to rename this one. We can't DevOps Infrastructure to can't we can't the ship has sailed we can only ride on the ship. Oh my god Okay so Let's talk about the thing that's been working through the modern DevOps principles Alright, let's go and actually we've talked about we'll never get there because there are I think from Jez humble Don't quote me the three ways of DevOps Which are three things that I don't have memorized right now, but I remember reading them thinking Oh, these are aligning very very very very well with the modern testing principles So let's talk about the I STQB vision on the future of software testing because it's been flown around a lot We're gonna go through it in a little bit of detail and talk about our opinions There is one line in it that I'm sure we'll get to That one line out of the whole thing and not that the whole thing is like super awesome or anything except for the one line but the one line that has triggered Absolutely triggered a large handful of people from the test community So we'll go over that and some of the repercussions have come out of that as well So so let's go ahead. Well, you have a point. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. So I don't know if this is the line that you're talking about No, not that I'm very curious as to what ideas You contributed to this paper Okay, you want to get right there? Yeah. Oh, yeah, I Think it's easier to Get into that later. So my okay, that's fine. I will tell you right now. No, no, no, no We you brought it up. We can't leave it go now if you go to the acknowledgments We could have held it as a cliffhanger. No, you screwed everything up again So we go to the acknowledgments and the team thanks the following leaders who were interviewed and gave ideas for this white paper in alphabetical order blah blah blah Alan Page I I'm not saying I didn't talk to them, but I don't remember talking to them. I don't know What the interview was I I feel like maybe a couple years ago or a year and a half ago I could have talked to someone But I don't know what I said, I don't have a transcript or notes I can't find anything on my calendar I'm not do you think this paper? Was under development for a couple of years. It may have been I don't remember it certainly I certainly haven't talked to anyone Recently at the very end again. I'm old and I do acknowledge that and I do acknowledge that I drink a lot But I do not remember by it's maybe it's a different talent. It's weird. I have this vague Like I have this vague recollection of Someone asking me to talk to them, but I do something like guest podcasts that it could be one of those that I did there's enough of a vague recollection I could have talked to someone and I do I Get contacted for whatever reasons for a lot for just Research interviews and things for various publications I don't recall this one, but I do enough of these things that I may have said something to him all that said I don't recognize I Mean other than the obvious things that we're going to agree with in this paper that we're gonna go through in a minute I don't really recall any specific things. I may have said or even if I actually talked to these folks So that's my and we should let me come back to that because that my name being in this has caused more than one More than one alter not an altercation is wrong a Conversation on the internet because my name's in this paper So let's go ahead you want do you want to start with something or do you want me to start? How do I go through this so you can start? This is a very short paper and I'm probably gonna forget to link to it in the show notes, but just search for the Istqb vision on the feature of software testing if you're and again I usually put a sentence about the show on the website and if I remember a link I'll put it there, but I realized that 99% of you just listen to this thing What's the end the 9% of three? Rounded down the two so two of you rounds up to three two of you Whatever want to do two of you probably just play this in your podcast player and never go to the website But there's a link anyway the first paragraph is all about Trying to establish the credibility of Istqb So I'm gonna skip that one and then they say the out the statement that then this is not controversial Software testing is a complex topic. I'm gonna skip that but one thing in paragraph two will start with is True and I could have said this I could have contributed to this Significant change in the software. I didn't say this nevermind Significant change in the software doesn't discipline is on the horizon and testing has become a quality assurance driver engaging other professions and professionals Not just software testers. I'm not even sure why I underline that anymore except for the fact that All of this has been true for years as far as I'm concerned I don't know what's futuristic there But I do think change is coming in the discipline in that it's in everything we've been talking about in modern testing Yeah, no, that's why modern testing exists. We want to talk about the changes happening to how software testing is performed well, so a lot of people's favorite episode of Of a retesting every no everyone's I This point in time. There's a lot of people who haven't even gone back to that episode everyone oh sure Where we did the where you dropped the is TQP Quiz or questionnaire or test on me. Yes, and you failed I did fail Suck it So I think like captures us on this one is is the statement that significant change in the software testing discipline is on the horizon Now that's something that we very much agree with now the question is Do we agree with what that change is? Right there's surely in that some second part of that sentence Make honestly, I'm having a hard time Decomposing it and testing has become a quality assurance driver engaging other professions and professionals Not just software testers now one way to interpret that could be the quality coach Maybe but the one thing I don't like about this is it doesn't go it I thought it maybe mentioned coaching and what spot it could be misremembering ever read this in a week or two, but it still Views testing as a distinct and separate discipline and not an activity of software development, which is I think not the future But anyway, go on. Yep. No, no, I'm I'm good. You want to talk about the next paragraph? I don't even know. Okay, there's nothing there. I feel like I could write a One paragraph version of this whole paper. There's a lot of there's a lot of stuff saying testing is hard We worked hard to figure out the testing is hard Yes in the future it gets harder Technology blah blah blah. I think you may be over simple. I mean, yes, it does seem like a lawyer in test wrote this Right because of the the language that they're using That's lit Software lawyer and test. Yeah Like on the vision the vision that they talk about First and foremost, I don't know why they've done this but I do I do think That in their vision they are potentially playing it's safe Because they keep referring to this term called testing technology solutions. Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. That just mean tools No, I took it to mean tools is that wrong? No, I'm pretty certain they mean AI. Oh Well, we all know AI is gonna change everything or not Yes, so surely it's talking about future. They mentioned AI in this video if you go to So here if later on in the document They have a section called the clarifying section for the vision of software testing and and They describe testing technology solutions as follows the testing technology solutions will have quote intelligence in quote built into them Yeah, there are several trends including AI which will address effectiveness and accuracy of of Testing other systems and can be used to develop innovative testing technology solutions over time these Testing technology solutions will evolve into Learning teaching engines they will learn from testing experts, but we'll also learn from other testing technology solutions and from themselves as software development or development evolves these testing technology solutions may be integrated into software development technologies, okay All right, I get it. So that describes AI and the process of building and Training AI so one thing before I get into the controversial statement one thing I don't like about this paper is complete lack of specificity So it's very broad stroke ish things are gonna change and it'll get different Oh, so no, that's fine Maybe that's the thing that where they picked up from you right because it's this is following our prediction episode paradigm If you just say things hand wavy Yeah, I if it's I'm not happy with the writing it so beyond that Let's dig into this. There's one thing in this clarifying vision Which in the paragraph above the one you read which let's go ahead and get into now before I go on because It's this is the one that has triggered people lots of stories to go on here Software testing is moving towards more automation. No, it's not so Okay, that one has that's not the future that's been true for the past Gazillion years. No, it's not though because they're mutually exclusive. Okay, let me get on to that Because I assume that's going to go off so it says but then it says the part which is I I get what they're saying I don't agree with it but not to the vehemant degree as some of the people that have Stocked me on LinkedIn have over time a software testing will become fully automated and embedded in the processes and technology It's in the overall software development cycle Now you can make your voice cuz software testing can't be fully automated you can automate checking but testing requires Exploration and investigation and the computer can do that Actually it can So what computers can't do is Well, actually and that's not even true I was about to say they can't do inductive reasoning But that's not actually true either So I have written and I put this in Twitter and I'm gonna work backward is that I've written plenty of tests that do Investigation and helped me explore the application there is so what happened was more than once I've been tagged on LinkedIn because my name's not acknowledgement section and Someone who has not read the whole paper but just that line has decided to go off on the fact that She only checking can be automated which is bull and only testing can be done by a human and this complete and utter gatekeeping on this concept that yes, some tests have a binary result and some tests don't but the insistence on having people use the right language and an inability to infer from context and an Inability to see past your private little vocabulary that only exists within a microcosm of the software development world Just is not helping your cause. It's not making you look good every time And this is I know that there are listeners who are in that who believe in context-driven school I think context-driven is fine It's some of the dogma that's coming out of the the people that have developed that which has caused problems in the industry And I'm fine because those people Deal with people brand new to test don't know what they're doing. They're not Air-quote technical they've been thrown in to test things and they've been shoved at a conference and there are people in the industry who make Their livings on testers that have don't know what they're doing and are shoved under a mushroom and don't know blah Why a mushroom? Because there's there's some mushroom thing. They're in the dark and crapped on it. Oh got it. All right So look I get it I get it I get that you Follow two people in all of software and they believe and you believe that only they have the right answers for everything and you must regurgitate everything they say versus thinking for yourself, but for Christ sakes You need to think a little bit wider if you're going to be a successful knowledge worker in the 21st century So anyway stepping off of that rant on to another one I got tagged as like them post because you need I want answers Alan I want answers for this statement Someone said that to you not in those words But they went through and they found the they started with just a couple of us who were tagged in there It's easier to find but I think they went through it eventually tagged everyone they could find from that Acknowledgments list looking for answers on why they thought why we all thought testing could be fully automated Well now you have a podcast to send them to That to me That does does the amount of heat that you're getting are you suffering deja vu? You know, it's the same. Yeah, I mean It's not deja vu. It's recursive to me it feels We have a different version of to me. It feels a little bit like a Different version of the white knuckle Holding on to the past that we experienced when you and I essentially came out and said Not only is testing going away at Microsoft We agree with it. No the testing role is going right not the testing. Yeah. Yeah, and and people I tell people Alan you've been in testing a long time I said I've dissolved the last like I have a bad habit of dissolving all the test teams I work on because it's the right thing to do right so this I think is What they're stating here the is TQP is essentially one way to interpret it is The final mail to the coffin is Coming. I don't think it's worded in such a way. I don't think it reads that way I think you could read software testing will become fully automated right that means number one if you're in testing the robots are coming to take my job and and It means it's not going to dev Going to the computers, right? People would argue and you and I work almost entirely on back-end services API's Very little that the customer sees there are a lot of people testing the things the customers look at the UI's the interfaces the interactions the workflows who Insists that that must be tested manually. They must use their fantastic investigational exploratory skills that work at the speed of the human brain To test those things in order to protect the customer from bugs What do you say to those people that's easy? companies who who Have test leadership That gets influenced and buy into that philosophy Will be destroyed. Yeah there and those people are deeply embedded in job preservation as well They're not you and I and you know, you've seen me do this every role I'm in I try and work myself out of a job for better or for worse But there's this opposite effect among many of these people where they want to dig their heels in and make sure their job exists forever Why do we automate? Because we're bored. No, we automate We automate because we're trying to scale engineering Time that to engineering hours. Okay AI. What is AI? artificial intelligence good job AI In essence is automated decision-making. Yes, that is what AI is very well put So yes currently a lot of a lot of the software automated testing I would say a bulk of it is Checking right. Hey, I expect this to pass. I expect this to fail We know Hell I know I've implemented the you've already admitted to implementing Exploratory absolutely as possible sure and with AI You can make Exploratory much more intelligent. Well, if you think about let's go and wait and then you combine that with product telemetry When we're in the service space Sorry If you one big thing in services and applications now is growing is observability not just the logging and monitoring being able to know the state of What's going on in your application at any time and full observability? Now if you start adding AI into observability AI is great at pattern matching It can start to recognize when if it's connected with the with the internal structures of the software It can actually I could We could create AI to do just-in-time Diagnostics and recognize when a current state is one hasn't seen before like my soft your software system has reached a state that The AI has determined it shouldn't be in that's not theoretical. I know no, no, no I've actually written this in my I've written this in my head a little excited. No, no So yes, I know it's not theoretical it's possible and likely happening I can Date it is happening So the main point is I think a lot of the folks who are freaking out over that There's other stuff I want to get to which is equally as controversial this it's really cool There's two statements that should trigger the crowds that I'm speaking about this one especially But there's another one another section. I'll get to in a moment But yes, I think people are blocked They aren't thinking big enough They aren't looking at a big enough picture and they don't realize that some of these things are more Possible than they think they are because they get stuck in their vocabulary and their dogma Yes Yes, and I love it when we have episodes where I get to rant and I'm not even done yet. Oh Yeah Now it's interesting Because I didn't know where we were gonna go me neither about this thing So I don't know what your next statement is but there's one thing I want to bring up. Yeah, you all yours I need to I need to lower my pressure. I'm gonna check the stress level on my on my smartwatch so the I would love to Be able to conclude that is TQB is actually seeing the same things we are Now what I think is interesting is what what they are proposing Might be different and we should get into that But here's a statement that I think is Just so friggin important I'll read the whole paragraph The perception of quality of software systems continues to change okay, and We've talked about this a million times the the 1986 definition of quality is bugs and That is bullshit in today's world Get over that is not that it is customer of the business that drives that that perception Continuing on is affected by factors in the marketplace economics technology culture software technological innovation and globalization the business the business drives the interpretation of this perception of quality No, only the gatekeepers of quality could tell the person. Oh damn it Go on so we that one future of testing White paper we talked about a couple years ago One of the things they called out is that business leaders really felt testing Need to step up and understand how the business drives its business Okay, there is another section in here where they call out QA needs to shift to decision-making roles. Yes, and I cannot you actually finish that I want to get into that next right I Completely agree. I wish this whole idea of We just provide information to the stakeholders. So let me go ahead and get into that Because there is a big and I can name drop here so Michael Bolton over and over and over again and then through the the blind followers I'll call them blind followers because they don't look outside of that that echo chamber Insists that Testers get out of the quality assurance business because I think labeling yourself as purely an information provider is a very passive rule and not an active role in software development and Probably more importantly I I don't see a career path there. I don't see I mean, there's no growth there What do you do provide better deeper more information? I Don't know why someone would want to be part of a software development team and they weren't actively participating in delivering that software Here's my reports do it whether you want not my choice. I can't make decisions above my pay grade, which is crap It falls into the same group who in fact these guys do it too. This happens a lot in just in general People like to blame the pointy haired managers. Oh, we can't do proper testing because our managers won't let us well My manager at Microsoft in my first day gave me a list of test cases and told me to Run them every day and we didn't have time to automate them and I had them automated three days later because they were crap But anyway, let me go on to this section, which is at the end of the clarification section I think my papers a little out of order by now responsibilities of testing professionals blah blah blah Accelerate the incorporation of evolving text methodologies and tools in the testing technology solutions Okay, get rid of the get rid of the testing technology called technology solutions. That's DevOps. That's what we do That's what that's what DevOps does or or even modern testing We accept we we make sure we're using the best tools we can for testing for deployment for delivery For static analysis code analysis CI CD. We make sure we have the best tools we can use either bot OSS built ourselves to make sure we can deliver as quickly and safely as possible Well, but here's the thing because remember testing technology solutions that the AI one is Essentially, I think it's I think they talk about AI indirectly, but I think they're talking about methodologies They talk about it directly. I just read it. I know but they don't even use the word AI. They don't talk about it directly They do they did Where the hell is it? I don't know. So another one is again This is I think a direct jab at the information provider community when they say which is why I'm so surprised that Get out of the quality service business hasn't come up because people are so obsessed with you can't automate everything statement But they say in this paper be a major Decision maker and major not a decision maker not providing information not giving your opinion Be a major decision maker in the risk assessment and quality readiness of software solutions Holy crap. Yes Don't be an information provider. Listen to me Stop being an information provider you have the information. I don't understand people don't want to be a decision maker it it drives me Bonkers that that you think that's above your pay grade for some reason get involved the people in this role in the future Have to understand the business. Yes, they are already experts around Risk assessment and quality readiness. Yes. Okay what the ask is here is do the analysis and bridge between what the business cares about and What your data shows I think it's important to bring up because I think Some people will say well, it's not my choice to choose whether we ship or don't That's a business decision and your priority is improving the business and you need to be expert my job as someone who's been in and out of testing for 25 years is to help Entire organization balance velocity and quality. Sometimes I slow them down. Sometimes I try and speed them up. It's a balance blah blah blah Embrace new ways of software development and production so yes Follows modern testing principles use improvement. Let's find new ways to do things better theory of constraints, etc And ensure comprehensive risk assessment and quality readiness, which yes doesn't mean you do it Elsewhere in this section they talk about the need for software testers to provide leadership and move in leadership positions and modern testing is a lot About leading teams towards better ways of making quality software. So hells to the yeah So I think there are despite the fact that I'll let you on a minute here the Community has focused on the one line is pissed him off And I think if a lot of people were to dig deeper they would find several more lines that would piss them off and I encourage them to do so and Enter the conversation because I think they're actually entered the conversation Thoughtfully as if your career may depend on it. Yeah, it's just it's just There's gonna be a long tail. Yeah, we've if this falls back to them talking about modern testing Yes, stuff is changing if you fail to recognize that if you dig your heels in I Have no guarantees about your future employment opportunities. All right, you're going to say so The number two that you talked about apply common sense and ethics effectively into the learning cycles I skipped that one you can talk about it. All right with the testing technology solutions Right. So I'm going to one of the the page Titled clarification section the ethical aspects of decision-making by artificial intelligence Hopefully will be resolved and this requires a level of human intervention in the testing technology solutions where ethical judgment is concerned okay, so when they are Absolutely saying that the testing technologies 60 plus percent of the core of the definition of that is AI and they're viewing Tester's role is going to be a judge of ethics. I Think that role needs to be there. I think there needs to be a human That's judging that I Don't know that testing. I don't know that I agree that testing professionals are going to be the experts in that space Well, I don't know either. Yeah, I mean you look at me. I'm not very ethical You're being snarky I think you are well, yeah, I mean you're not a you're not a rule follower. I'll say that But the human condition is absolutely Something you're concerned with But I don't see it as testing professionals to do that. I actually Because right now the typical testing professional doesn't understand how these things are built so one of the things and I think there's a interesting cap we can put on this conversation is I think in order to You have to get out of the echo chamber. You have to look at opposing views I I do this politically I do this with testing to the software I look at people that hate TDD people that disagree with modern testing principles try and figure out where they're coming from It's always a motivation there. Sometimes it's job self-preservation. Sometimes it's something else if I look at the motivation of is TQB Although there are some things we agree with some things we may not agree with some things We don't I don't like the way the paper is written, but that's beside the point. I can say for certainty You know is TQB is in the business Of selling training and certifications So if the testing role were to go away completely They'd be out of business So I have to wonder a little bit around the motivation and again predicting things is hard, especially about the future So if they see these changes happening, they never see the testing role going away In fact, the first paragraph talks about the changes in the testing discipline. I Wonder what they think this means for them and their business What are the what do you think these statements if this future plays out what changes in Istq be? So in that light, let's let's now decompose a section called clarifying responsibilities of testing professionals Okay now first off This could in fact be an objective report Funded by Istq be right. Maybe they haven't Published a document that is useful to identify Istq be's response to this feature. Maybe they just did a study and Wrote it up in an objective fashion But this says testing professionals shall need to embrace the new methodologies and technologies around software development and testing with the intent to Integrate these faster into their testing technology solutions. Okay, that is something that we've been stating right the role is to accelerate the achievable a shiftable quality and The testing professionals they need to shift and stop bottlenecking and instead accelerate the shipping. Okay Well that first statement Could Istq be? Do a further study and adjust their certifications around that probably Right these new methodologies and technologies a big portion of that's gonna be agile Could they move and they do an agile certificate at like a agile certified tester or something something like that but would their Curriculum move to cover Learning new technologies or leadership as they like I think it will have to absolutely and what would make their leader I guess would be they could I could see Istq be this is pure speculation that we're endorsing this by any means But I could see them in the next couple years coming up with a test coach certification Sure, sure. I think that would make a lot of sense. Maybe you just solve their problem for them. That's what I'm here for I'll take and they'll probably talk to me about it and I'll forget talking to them and I'll forget I'll also forget to collect my fee Darn it. The testing professionals shall be required to pick up the pace of Bringing greater testing capabilities to the software. Hell. Yeah, right? Nothing wrong with that The try and argue with that one. I'm waiting. We should do a sentence by sentence debate on this over the internet Anyway, go on in working on behalf of the users Testing professionals will be required to learn how to teach the testing technology solutions to Continually improve the quality of software solutions and development. There's the coaching No, but they're teaching the testing technology solutions Yeah, I don't think I think I think AI is included in there. I don't think it always means AI I it primarily means AI Alright, well agree to disagree and here's what they're saying They're saying testing professionals Move to what's done in data science as an expert and contribute their knowledge into an AI that becomes their responsibility to train up better ais for testing and They may even be saying that there is a portion of data science that they're expecting that these folks Learning capture. I wish again. I wish this paper wasn't written in so much code Me too, but if you were is TQB It and you would probably want to do it this way to couch a Little bit of the hate that's gonna come to you Right. We already know because we did it with modern testing, but I think we're much smaller than I see QB We're definitely much smaller reach when they sent this out But you know you got to give him credit but this whole they got people talking about this paper this whole last paragraph I mean, it's Long worded. It's only three sentences and it essentially says the testing professional Job will be to automate themselves out of that job by training up the testing technology solutions Testing professionals walk to ensure the testing technology solutions incorporated self educating lessons and learned capabilities Which provide continuous improvements? They're talking about a learning system. I dig it I dig it so and can can they build a new certification around that? Yes What happens when those testing professionals succeed carp launch across the domain where where I see QB has a reach I see QB has to come up with a new version of this because it's over again feature of any feature of testing doc or Presentation or whatever it's going to be wrong. I've given a couple of these in the past. I've given feature testing talks They were way wrong. It's really what's the This one's actually more futuristic, but a lot of it we see is happening now Well, and the thing that was brilliant of what they did. They didn't put a timeline. No, of course not But they got people talking and I'm disappointed and I mentioned this There is so much in here to tear apart and to talk about and discuss Anytime you have an essay like this, it's not about It's not an experience report where you can say well that didn't work for me or whatever This is speculation to Inspire discussion and it has inspired discussion, but I'm disappointed in the overall testing community that the Debate has been around the one line around automating everything. I think Failure to recognize the context of which that line is stated and failure to recognize the other highly debatable points and discussion points in the document Is a failure in I don't know what I call it critical thinking or system thinking It's a failure in thinking and looking outside the box and there's a I'm sure there's a fallacy around this where you get It's like the moth to the light Fallacy, here's the most controversial statement. Let's focus on this instead of finding the other points to debate as well Whether you agree or don't agree and there's or like or don't like this paper I think there's value for anyone it's not just testing not just testing in software development To think about which of these statements may or may not seem Applicable or valid and have a discussion around that the thing I command is TQB with this paper is In my humble opinion There's no way to interpret it other than testing professionals are at risk and I commend Istqb making this a paper That tries to explain it Because they know if they were to just say if they were just to say the Istqb version of test is dead No one's gonna hear but that's a defense for many. I mean, that's the objection For many to this paper. They say purely Testing is not going away Therefore this paper and its statements are invalid and again because I actually think Istqb has a great deal of infrastructure and a great deal to gain by not publishing this paper True right. I think this paper is pointing out a direction that is Contrary to how Istqb has built up its current that is interesting. Yeah, you're right. Why would they? Because like I said goes back to their business choices Interesting and it's in my view. It's because the trends that we and others have been seen Are now obvious to Istqb as well and also and maybe Interesting to point out before we close here is that Istqb publishes paper I've seen I haven't looked for it, but I haven't seen them Discussing or defending this paper a lot. They've kind of let it just sit in the community and let the conversation Let it they're letting a thousand flowers bloom, which I don't know if that's actually true or not But it's interesting to see that all of the discussion is from the people disagreeing with the paper and there aren't I Haven't seen anyone from Istqb talking about why or what or anything No, but that's just the the noisy few it is that are Right now being defensive after all this discussion I would like to say I still don't remember if or when I talked to them or what I said So but some of the but I can see now how some of the things Could have been inspired by what I said. So there's that All right Thanks for our book report. Thanks for listening to our book report on the Istqb vision of software testing I am almost an hour later still Alan and I am NOT. All right later
