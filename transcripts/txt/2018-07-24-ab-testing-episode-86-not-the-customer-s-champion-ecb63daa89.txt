Hello again everyone. Good morning. He's Brent. He's Alan Welcome to another episode of a B testing happy to have you here. Good to see you Brent. Good to see you, too I'm recording on a Monday. How is your weekend? It was great. I finally won some points from the family Did you just spend the weekend away from them? No Did you at this point in time? I still have my daughter who still likes me. Okay, that's good. Yeah, good. Just Just make a bunch of food for them what you do. How'd you win some points? I did actually make something about tell me about the point scoring system. I finally put the pool up. Oh And it perfect time is supposed to be hot hot hot it this week It took me two days to put the pool up Yeah, because I could only stand being out side doing Manual labor in the full Sun for like an hour at a time Well, there are things called mornings and evenings where it's a little cooler. I had the plan to do it in the morning But my daughter got up and wanted to play and that sounded like more fun than putting up the pool. I suppose cool This is episode 86 by the way It is if you're new to a be testing this is the podcast by Alan and Brent that's the a and the B Where we talk about? Testing sometimes a lot of software engineering software quality Of course modern testing principles have been the topic For the last many many episodes. Yeah, you can go to modern testing org and read those And we have been doing recently some deeper dives medium dives spending about an episode each discussing them Drill ins drill ins we're gonna call them. Is that a Microsoft term? Maybe maybe well, it's definitely management Management-speak. I like what they say. Let's double click on that here that one. Let's double click and shift left Let's I want to shift out Shift out. I'm gonna just gonna drop. You know what I'm gonna do shift up I mean, there's so many directions to shift I know and I don't have nearly as many meetings In fact, I have one-on-ones and then like two or three other meetings a week But I wish I had more cuz I one thing I would like to do cuz it's fun. You wish I'm sorry No, no, no, you wish you had more meetings I wish I had some bad meetings cuz I wish I I wanted it go like You know to my car just just to go to meetings and have some of the bad ones again Where I could just drop random buzzwords that mean nothing and see if they catch on like we should shift out on that or That'd be great Hold on a second. Let's right-click on that and And get some more context Yeah, so the trick is to come up with something entirely new though. Oh Yeah, yeah, cuz everyone's You know, they're just evolving Like why is it left shift? Why isn't it right shift? Well shift, right? Right Correct. So, uh, I mean you got the double entendre with right. So if you shifted right Right, the direction doesn't matter and you it could be implying, you know, you're going more correct. You're shifting to correct. Oh It could be it could be so I need to think for a minute. What's that? What's like a computing term? It hasn't been used in a managerial speak I'm thinking something like a long lines of distributed networks. They're all the rage right now You got big data, but you know if you try to invent something now, you're like five years too late Alright, I'm gonna come up with those so you can send those in to the mailbag at a B testing Sure yet another place where a B testing adds value to the world. We'll start creating whole new buzzwords. Sure Sure, that's our that's our value to the world in between last time and this time. I Spoke to the internet a little bit about Modern testing again. I did an AMA and asked me anything for a Ministry of test and I will there is a recording of it available I will put in a link if I don't you can yell at me on Twitter But I will try and remember when I post this show to put a link to the recording where I answered a bunch of questions Hosted by our good friend Vernon and I answer questions about modern testing Yeah, I went back and I watched that video first off it was your video I threw it worse I forgot it's a video. So I totally shouldn't have picked my nose so much. You really shouldn't have And it was shocking. I'm like, oh my god Alan's face. I'm like is the whole world ready for this There's a reason we do a podcast. There's a reason we do a podcast Yeah, mostly me but yeah for sure I am certainly glad I did not join you in that adventure because some of those questions were really hard I'm glad you didn't join because you give really long answers and I gave longer answers We got to the end Vernon tried to go rapid-fire, but I couldn't let it go Sometimes right there was one time you were like no And then I elaborated We're going to dive into principle number five five of seven and this is the one about the customer and Surprisingly, there's a little bit of controversy around this one. We'll go into anything else before we dive in You know, let's go to go. Okay again. You can read these on modern testing org, but principle number five says We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product Agreed. Yeah Okay, and thank you for listening to a be testing Yeah, yeah, that was one of your questions on on AMA before we reflect back on that briefly Tell me and I'm gonna go to the controversy to the controversy the question, but before we do that, tell me Why is this the principle? What why is this worth bringing up along with the other six? The number one reason and I've cited this over number one The I've cited this over and over again. One of the things that I think especially true for those of us who have been in the industry for a long time and It is sort of seductive to believe that hey, I've been doing this forever. I know what I'm doing You've seen a lot of folks along those lines but there is a forgetting is how I'll call it as I cited from Tom Popendike over and over again No customer ever in the history of the world has ever wanted software Correct in any way shape or form What do they want before you go on they want their problem solved? Absolutely. We need to remember that that means There is a risk and I have observed this and I'm highly certain you have as well that there is trust in the test community that when they're given a requirement stock or when they're told something from their PM that That actually is going to solve somebody's problem down the road A big portion of this principle is intended to force people to think about What are they doing? That is actually solving a customer problem theoretically versus actually and it's it's to force the The modern tester to go No matter how right I think I am It's still just a theory It's a hypothesis. It's a hypothesis. You want to pick up? Yeah, sure. So what I've What I've seen and to build on them We can both reflect and probably anybody who's been doing software for a reasonable amount of time Reasonable amount of time or any but probably a lot some of you Maybe this week last week You are on a team or you've seen teams who build software Because they think it'll be cool Or we're doing this feature because the we like it without often thinking about what problem are you solving? It's amazing sometimes when you talk to teams and just ask them that question What problem are we solving with this? They'll eat they'll use it that isn't solving a problem And well, what's what's what's the customer value of this? they'll use it and Well, I've seen this over and over and Brent's laughing but you think about it. It's it's they're not quite sad because evil but in my experience, but generally darn close I I've told the story for years about shimmery blue menus and and There was a time at Microsoft and this is a A joke I used to make when I was teaching courses ten years ago It's been a long time about shimmery blue menus because shimmery blue menus are not a real feature I'm just these are my canonical example of something you're building because you think it's cool But nobody really needs it and what happens is the program manager Wants thinking about features they need to do they go what about shimmery blue menus You know, huh? We should do shimmery blue menus and then someone will say maybe we'll say Problem does that solve and they'll say uh customers need it and they'll justify it They'll go to a customer and say hey, do you think we need shimmery blue menus? They go sir, whatever Customers are demanding shimmery blue menus. They're waiting for this feature. We got to go do it maybe that's a little bit of a stretch, but there's so much reflection in my past of doing features and The build it and they will come mentality field field of dream software. Yes, we're gonna build this thing and We'll give it to you after a long development cycle and we trademark feel the dream software and even though feel the dream is probably and in the end you will like it, but Right, oh this part I've seen over and over again I have This is hyperbole, but there is there wait hyperbole on the a B testing Whoa, I'm gonna be careful because it's modern We're much more modern world, but let's just say I Don't know five ten years ago it was impossible to have a conversation with the PM and not walk away with the sense that They were the next Steve Jobs. Oh god, right? It's it's requirements stock what a lot of the requirements stock is is built off of Processes similar to what Alan just described. It is hey a customer PM they have their own day job to do and sometimes it's calling out the customers and They will call out to one or two and and establish a pattern off of that Now is that a pattern? No, of course not however, their job is to get new features in and If they they've encountered a new Requirement that they could build upon that's fantastic right that they're able to do add that requirement into the dock and and Get engineering rolling now, it's interesting because you say shimmery blue I've actually Had to deal with that and it literally was blue. It wasn't shimmery Years ago. I was an MSTV and Microsoft was building the software for Comcast and Comcast rejected our our Software not once but twice Because we had the wrong blue in our CSL and And I'm like Wow really Yes, and again twice There's a design choice there and there's plenty stories about Google trying out 50 different or ever in shades of blue It was for their links for they chose the right one In the case of of Comcast right blue is part at least it was back then now they got this red black and white team with their Xfinity stuff but blue Blue was part of the brand Donna get ditched cable. I don't know. I was gonna bring something Oh, I had a little I glazed over for a minute there while my PTSD kicked in on when just showing out When the job his book came out or the first couple jobs books came out after he passed away. Oh Oh my god, so many when there was one in particular I'll finish my thought a bunch of people decided to start comparing themselves to Steve Jobs Literally, and there's one high-level Test director you and I both know I won't shame him on the air who who in a meeting no metaphor aside flat-out said Because I'm making this choice this is what Steve Jobs do he basically called himself Steve Jobs And that was that was like oh god, please please let it in please let it in but even Steve Jobs I'm so whining back. I'm like We don't know any test directors Because they're gone We did they were Peter principled up to a level far beyond the capability and since retired once Once in the new world figured out they had no, you know, it's funny I'm because we know so many of those folks and Several of them are alike. I Cannot guess who it is at the moment. I'll let you know off-air. Yeah I have several guesses. Yeah, I'm pretty sure all of them having that conversation. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure you could nail it wasn't Steve Jobs who when there was the camera which iPhone it was but there was an antenna issue and Wasn't he the one that said it's cuz they're holding it wrong. I don't think That I think that was one of his but that's a great example I mean it doesn't matter and the customer customer is the only one capable to evaluate quality and they Can't hold the phone. However, they frickin want to hold the phone, right? Right This is still prevalent In today's world like I have conversations similar to this over and over and over again This principle is essentially the modern testing version of the customer is always right Perhaps perhaps and so let's talk about which it makes so much common sense, but let me play Simon Devils advocate. I'm gonna bring up the controversy and let you there's believe it or not. There is controversy around this testing principle Probably this one is Probably second on the if you're gonna rank them in order of controversy behind principle number seven Some of you are going how the hell can this be controversial? But let me bring up a few points for you. So Here's the easy one as testers We are the customer We're the last line of defense Brent. We're the only ones capable of Sympathizing and making sure the customer is getting it. So really as a tester. I am the customer No So Yeah, that that's a little bit of a softball, but no, I mean no no, it's just no you're not the customer and and I'm I figured this part out years ago, but doesn't matter how much you're trying to replicate. Here's an example Do you remember int int? Remember data type no int the integration environment. Oh my god There is a time early in the services world of Microsoft where there's this massive Ridiculous integration environment that was done It was people tried to do testing there and they wanted it to replicate production as much as they could and it never even got close never ever ever ever and and They held on to the theory that it would Hindsight 2020 I'm not at all certain why But the biggest cause And this was actually something that test played into it one of the one of the problems with with our Automation We would target automation that would deploy out in it and one of the biggest issues with it with a with a non-prod int environment Particularly with how automation was deployed is it was always covering the clean room Scenario sure and I have nothing against integration environments and doing testing in some sort of pre-production environment that there's Plenty of reasons to do that But do not ever kid yourself and think that your pre-production environment Whatever you call it is a reasonable facsimile for production. Yeah, absolutely it it is It simulates production environment exactly once in its lifetime And even even then not exactly because it's not running on the same hardware It's it's it's running differently in production. It could I mean, I mean that's still it's still possible Do your teams at Microsoft use Docker? Did teams use Docker at Microsoft? Oh my God, you know what just before coming in here. I was gonna I was gonna share with you off the air around Dude, I don't understand how we got stuff done back in the day without containers because that that Docker has been one example where it's Containerization has helped with test environments making them much closer again for one time only But giving you a much closer to production environment as much easier and quicker to set up and tear down. Yeah containers my experience with containers they keep talking about Those of us in the cloud industry we keep talking about That it's some future date Compute will be the fifth utility behind water and electricity and So You don't have to spend much time with containers To go. Oh, I see how that's gonna be possible containers They just work and they just do the calculation that you want them to do Right and it's just like whoa. I didn't have to configure crap I didn't have to yell at IT for rebooting my container. I didn't have to do any of this No, like it's just friggin fantastic From a platform side and from a developer side. I will say That does create problems for us in the cloud industry Because we have this sort of generic compute interface at the top, but yeah underneath it it's running on different pieces of hardware and and Each component and that hardware could be could be very different Right. We have a new generation of hardware in Azure And it took us months to realize that there was this one memory chip vendor who had poorly manufactured it for us to figure out that that was what was causing these containers would To reboot even though they shouldn't Let me really back in to the customer. Yep. Ask another question. So What if so testing is not the customer testing is not the customer and that Above and beyond everything is what we want to get across Okay, but but but but but but but but okay my I have a B2B business So is whose mic so I'm meaning I business to business I my software just for the listeners who may not have heard that acronym before but so I'm making something for another business to do something with or and then they have a customer Who's like which one's my customer? What are my choices? this business I'm delivering software to or maybe the Is it who I'm delivering it to or the end customers? Like is it the end user? like if I'm giving a platform to some company and they're using it to build software for Maybe their internal systems or maybe for an external customer How does that work? Who is who is my customer? How do I figure out who my customer actually is? In a platform situation that can be challenged right because you when you're a platform foot. So for example Unity I want to bring it up directly. I'll let you do it right unity is a I'm sure you guys I think it's a little easier in our case my customer. Well for most of it the vast majority This is actually a good question unity holistically our customer is the developer the developer making unity but not in every situation You definitely have two customers. We do we do and in the B2B play you also definitely have two customers Right in the case of unity Developers who want to design games They don't have to go to unity There are what five to ten major game engines out on the market They don't have to go right your company. So what differentiates what differentiates is the capabilities and Well, so there was a long experience could be capabilities and features or ease of use lots of things. Yeah in one of the in one of the Analyses I would do at your company is Go and look at okay How do we grow the attach rate of of the developers on the unity platform? How do we once they once they try us out? How do how do we get them to stay? How do they get how do we get them to engage with us directly on on on feature requests? This actually was the Microsoft play back in the 19 early 1990s. Sure Right. Um, it was we got the developer we got the world but the other aspect is as well is These developers are building software for end users and it's that end user where Ultimately Your guys's paycheck comes from correct. Well, I mean Yes, ultimately yes, but it's a you can draw a feed you could there's a nice feedback loop there Yes, we need to enable our developer customers to give Their customers something world Value awesomeness and then that feedback comes to them and then comes by us Do you can I can't draw it on a podcast but there's a nice little there's a nice little loop there, right? If your platform has performance issues So for example in Or if our if our game engine components crash right, you're not You're basically going to be a platform that gets abandoned because the the developers who are using your platform Can't make their customers happy. Correct? Correct. So in that particular case The two sets of people who are your customer are your developers and are the developers of your platform in True and I think it's gonna be the same for and the end their customers They it's gonna be same for I would imagine that's the same for any sort of business to business type thing as well any any place where it's essentially a platform component that's Indirectly talking trying to think where it would be difficult to figure out who your customer is, right? But I Honestly, if you can't figure out who your customer is if it's that difficult I Think is a deeper problem there in your software company. I Yeah, I think I can understand why it would be it could be difficult to get feedback from an end user but here But there are still ways right it There so in a B2B play let's let's say Actually, this was this was big news recently Walmart and Azure are joining hands we You could it's very easy to see That Walmart competes with Amazon in the retail space Azure competes with Amazon on the cloud space So does does Microsoft want Walmart to improve and and winning in their particular market you bet Right now That's probably the as far in the details on that particular topic. I can go into on any of these indirect things On a platform you live and die on the ability of the people above you to satisfy their customers if you don't have direct customers Now one of the things That I've seen on the B2B discussion is oh no So so some company comes down and leads on requirements And I'm just gonna say anytime anyone delivers requirements You're better suited to treat those as hypotheses Let's let me loop this back may need to deliver on those requirements because the contractual agreement. Let me just finish there but That's the bare minimum and you should be gathering Whatever data you can if you think one of those requirements is baloney You should be gathering whatever data you can and go back to that contract and say hey We actually think our relationship is better going in this direction and here's our information that back set up One of the things I think can help Someone a team practicing modern testing principles or someone leading the team in that direction to Really nail this principle is to have those conversations around things like requirements talk about Or ask what is the problem we're solving? Yes, and From that requirement and may change from that. I think requirements end up being a lot versus being a lot of want to versus need and asking questions like What problem are we solving will help will help vet that out? There's a question our good old friend and sometimes listener Jim Moore used to ask all the time But someone would would get come to him with some long request Or some complex request something they wanted He would follow up. This is a great question So imagine you had all that what do you do with it? And they give an answer and from that you can figure out what they really need and go. Okay. Could I just do this instead? Oh, yeah, that'd be great and and you need a Team following modern testing principles who embraces this principle are going to be very good at asking the questions Whether they're around a requirement slash hypothesis customer request from a forum for example customers engaging online tend to be a Just loud majority of your customers but not representative of all your customers. So you don't just want to make them happy you want to figure out What customer problem can we solve so learning how to ask questions around? Problems you're solving trying to understand need versus want can really help make your team excel at this principle For sure. That's my brief little soapbox on this. Yeah For me the best thing I have found is anytime someone has communicated requirements To me I will echo back the requirements, but I will use them Okay, so what you're requesting from me I will change it to the word requests in my communication back and then in my thought process I view the word requirement and hypothesis as synonyms and I find that that last aspect whether or not you do it publicly or doing it privately I think that aspect is actually really important Because it'll it forces you to consider That you may be doing work that does not achieve the ultimate goal and that Goal is where all these precision questions that Alan just referred to come from There are many times where I have been told what to do and in general that is because that's that's that Individuals best gets as to what can be done And I have found that more often than not That if you can decompose that and figure out what it is that they need Mm-hmm now sometimes You'll do exactly okay. I get what you need and yeah, I can't think of a better way of doing this for sure for sure In in my scenario with you know, they're coming to me to do it generally because I'm the knowledge expert. I Know more things about this space than what they do Which gives me the opportunity to go. No, I think actually what you need is this. How about if I do this instead? what you end up doing when you really execute on this principle is You solve customer problems in priority order like what's the biggest problem you understand What's the biggest problem we can solve for our customers and you solve that you help that you help them solve that and you move down the list so It's as much about Misdelivering quality by or delivering value to the customer by Solving their most and most important problems first Yes Now let's talk about scorecards No, let's not Okay, fine. Let's talk about scorecards. Thank you. I know it's one of your least favorite topics but I think it's I tell stories about why I hate them so much, but let me But go I think I think we should talk about it right the the if we're saying the customer so the controversy with this principle is What is the definition of customer? Okay, and what we're saying? It is a human who is taking a dependency on what you are releasing and That human is the one who's making a decision as to whether or not it is quality Okay So if you have a business to business Contractual agreement that's not a human who's taking a dependency. That's a piece of paper Now it may specify Hypotheses around this and the maven specify legal consequences if you don't deliver on those hypotheses But just recall that there's still a hypothesis Now we could have a scorecard that says that we delivered on it. Okay now So let's say you delivered a scorecard all green and it released to the wild and you're in this B2B scenario You still run the risk Because you delivered what that other business wanted instead of what they needed You still run the risk that they pay you for your contract and then leave you Sure, because and there are probably I didn't dig any out in advance But anecdotally from my experience I can tell you this happens or happened frequently or not rarely Not yeah, not really. I've seen this happen as have I Trying to remember that stupid phone product Microsoft built Oh kin. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was kin. Yeah That was that was a required. It was essentially Someone or some set of someones had this idea of producing a a Hybrid dumb smartphone Yeah, right. It was smart enough phone, I guess. Yeah It was where we could keep the price point super cheap and the target tweens sure that's talk about it was for right This is a great example of building something that doesn't yeah building the wrong thing Right now the if we were part of the business team and doing a retrospective on this Right. We would want to go back and go. Okay. What could we if We've now learned that the market doesn't want one of these things Right. What could we have done earlier? to come to the same conclusion During that time and I ran the last test pass on kin. Yeah, I did not know And you're still I didn't just flat out fire the whole team That's why I ran the last test pass. Oh because we had It was a special deal with Verizon Verizon wanted had all of this hardware stock and they wanted to to sell it out And so though yeah after yeah, so they changed they changed some of the software To turn it into this is after I mean, this is a product that was out on the market for a week or two And then just given up on And I want to literally spit state. I literally ran the last test pass I literally executed the very last set of test cases on this one and this was me as a back then I was a test manager But it was one of those things where I wasn't going to assign it to one of my ICs Not if I wanted to keep them on the team, but what a great example of just shipping the wrong thing This is well and that's part of the the learning lessons here Is We did ship the wrong thing and we spent a lot of costs and if we had gone back and we had said Okay, the customer is the only one qualified to make a judgment call here, how can we How can we test our? Hypotheses here Much sooner much. Yes Yes, before going all in on this this is maybe the canonical example of field of dreams engineering Yeah now there was We were in transition back in those times a lot of the lot of it was a very predictive software development But that doesn't exist anymore. I know well now I did want to merge doesn't need to exist I think that back we don't have the infrastructure requirements to force a Get it right the first time when your delivery dates three years from now, right? That's just that's Foolishness in today's market it is I was just gonna note that it's incredible that After the failure of kin that Microsoft was able to turn things around to become a world-class phone business Yeah Yeah, you know so I don't have any Information here that's not public knowledge I keep seeing news reports about the surface phone right, um And I keep I'm curious about this this one because every time something else comes out. It still does not claim That the project's been abandoned Right and the M. I'm curious about that is like, okay so if we're not abandoning it are we going down some sort of intuitive route or Have we learned from our our prior mistakes and there we leapfrogging? And I really don't know. I don't know either I did want to there was a little state if I don't think anyone on the business team listens to the podcast But pretty sure they don't if they do Like if it doesn't directly contain say the Android app store or The iPhone app store. Yeah, like what are you doing? so I think we've made our point that Absolutely customers important we as modern testers or people driving modern testing principles need to help our teams figure out what customer problems were solving and Drive the team in that direction and talk about some different ways we can do that Anything else on this topic talk about asking the right questions prioritizing Treating it as a hypothesis that that your work should prove or disprove You can go with a negative aspect and say I'm not going to just trust the requirement But you can also think of it from principle number one Hey, so this requirement stock is a list of someone's Hypotheses around how we can build a better business principle number one test is not just Test is no longer just a cost Reducer no, we're looking at we're also looking at how do we drive revenue? Mm-hmm. All right so with these hypotheses in play Okay, and and with our knowledge of What makes customer happy and what solves the customers problems? What can we do to? Prove or disprove these hypotheses and the ones that where we gain knowledge. What can we do to grow those? The biggest aspect I think of modern testing is they shift to being a More active portion a more active participant in the business and are concerned with growing that business It's not about Preventing customer harm anymore Certainly, that's important. It's about how do we if the customer is the only one qualified to define if it's a Quality software situation and the quality software situation as we covered here over and over and over again Sometimes customers care about bugs. Sometimes they don't They care about their problem solved. Correct. How do we how do we take that and help the business Grow faster. Yeah, I think its principles a lot about just Re-emphasizing how important that customer prioritization is in order to make quality software There's a there's a model a bunch of variations of this that show The CEO at the bottom and then managers and then individual contributors who are making who are making a lot of decisions And then on top of that the customer Yeah, so the customer leads the way and being able to drive the team towards recentering the team I guess would be a good way of putting it of Continuously recentering the team around the importance of the customer and the importance of solving their problems if there's anything around This one that I would say we The test community should walk away with is we are abjectly saying No, an end user is The single most important in an indirect situation There may be other people's opinions that are important on if it's a quality but ultimately it's the end user who's benefiting from the From whatever you're producing your solution to a problem number two test is Absolutely not a Representative of the customer they are not the customer. They should stop pretending to be one For sure. I think we're good. So thanks again for listening. We'll dive into number six next time. I am still Alan I think I think so too. All right great. Yeah, whatever. See you next time
