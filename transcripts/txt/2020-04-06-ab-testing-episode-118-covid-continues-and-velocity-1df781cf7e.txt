Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey, Brett Yeah, we're gonna do this again another remote because we want to observe the six-foot rule AB testing podcast Actually think this is all over we think you and I should continue to observe that You know not a bad idea not a horrible idea. So how are things going? How are you adapting? so the last episode we did actually was rather helpful I spent a lot of time sort of thinking through and adapting to what What sort of things can I learn from Alan who has? mastered this I Would say like in my family my son Adapted pretty quickly He's 18 and school district says you don't have to do school. I mean that's enough information for him He works at McDonald's so every morning We get a hey dad. I'm essential and you're not Sort of common wait I I haven't really left the house and I haven't been to a McDonald's in forever But McDonald's is essential. Yeah, cuz they provide food No comment. All right, then did you see speaking of school? Did you see the on April 1st the there was a mocks? There's a screenshot looked really real of Jay Inslee with the banner below saying Governor makes the tough call to ask all students to repeat the 2019 2020 school year. I did not Yeah, that's a that that caused a lot of kids that poop their britches It's interesting. My daughter is Checking along. I mean the only issue with my daughter is I think that so she's been doing Online for a great deal. She goes to private school. So she's not beholden to Inslee's statement or so Inslee at one point in time basically said all schools are canceled North Shore School District had online That's where my son goes. They had online school going within a week and then the governor's office said Can't do that unfair to other districts And so they did some wrangling got that back online that just started this week but again my daughter private school the only issue there is She normally had been doing school for like six hours a day, right and right now Consistently every day at 10. I go. Okay. Are you done with school and She's like, oh, yeah, I've already turned in on all my homework assignments and everything and so I don't feel at the moment I'm getting my ROI of private school Yeah, so my kids are in public schools, but they both go to a it's called the big-picture school It's all project-based so they can do a lot of that from home and they're both I'm what my Alan one second pause What? I'm doing a podcast go away. I'm gonna leave that So it's a project-based school they able to do a lot of their stuff from home My son is sporadically working on a python project. I help him with a little bit Making him learn get so I can send him Pull requests for like I start things for him so he can finish them as a way to kind of get him going and That's plugging along. My daughter's doing a She's pretty much done with all her schoolwork But the point I was getting to is it's a gua. It was going to be where my kids go to school They were going to be at a school till April 20th and then Inslee extended that by two weeks. It's probably gonna be longer, but they're going to kick off remote learning sessions Beginning the week after their spring break would have been so it's all kicking in. I don't think they're going back to school this year We'll see what happens We'll see right I So first off many things So first second third fourth and fifth off go ahead right the you mentioned Teaching your son Python or working through Python There is a book. I got my daughter Ten-year-old daughter called its head first as we both Played we love that series. I do love the head first series They have a sick they have a book called learning to code and I have been doing this for about a month. We do a chapter a week with my daughter She's she's about to start chapter four and learn about while in for loops But those on the podcast can't see this But I got this as a follow-up once my daughter What he's showing me that it's a mystery it's porn no it's head first Python Yes, so the learning to code book uses Python as its primary language Forgot to mention that and then this one is far more in depth Very very interesting. I will check both of those out and Yeah, hey So getting back on to a little bit more COVID then we have some kind of loose topics to discuss today But I'm curious to talk about what's changed. Maybe I'll start I'll tell you what's changed for me at work You talked about me being an expert at working from home and I have more experience Not necessarily expertise, but what's happened and I can't remember if I mentioned this last time is It's learning to help everyone else learning to work from home has become a big part of my job and That means you are a Work from home coach now to Apparently and it's some therapy too because I have some employees who Live by themselves and they're going a little stir-crazy one in a in a apartment about as big as the office I'm recording this in at home So they have their own challenges. There are people with roommates who are slowly learning to loathe their roommates and and what impacts them Separation does make the heart grow fonder what impacts me the most is a lot more meetings on my calendar a Lot a lot a lot. I have calendar explosion It's good. I feel like 95% plus of those meetings are actually effective uses of my time just ends up being exhausting. I'm probably in meetings I didn't count I was thinking of writing a plugin Extension to count how many hours and meetings I have a week, but I'm assuming it's somewhere near 40. Yeah, if you had If you were still at Microsoft and you had Outlook they have now a new analytics tool plugged in and So like last Monday The little plug-in sent me a mail and told me hey You should look into this your meeting schedule has spiked up in the last week Oh, yeah, that's that I kind of I can tell I can tell well So here's the thing that's depressing because it will quantify it and it told me that 98% of my time now is being spent in meetings. I'm like, oh kill me The other interesting thing is there's some new meetings on my calendar that I don't always go to but they're interesting We have regular yoga classes over zoom. I can attend We have a happy hour every Friday virtual happy hour Everyone drinks at their home desk and toast each other and chats about whatever little things like that we have teams with discord servers and One of my teams has a slack hangout not a slack hangout a Google hangout they just keep running all day to pop in and out of and at work, you know, they all sit in a all sit together in a little pod and They're used to just having chatter with each other while they work and it gives them a way to emulate that So a lot of things it's it's interesting to watch how people adopt in a company a gazillion times bigger What's different about other than the media explosion would you I assume you've noticed what else is different? What do you what? Do you and your team is doing to? Handle the brave new world So my experience is different than my reports. It's interesting because the majority of my reports are reporting in So I have one kid that He just joined us from college. I call him a kid, but he's he went to a PhD So he's nearly 30. Yeah, my whole team are kids. It's alright He's going stir crazy. He's an extrovert and he's like people Yeah, the the rest of my team primary introverted and they're all reporting. Oh my god My productivity is through the roof right? I've heard that too. I've heard that for most of my team Yeah me I'm as we've talked about many times before I'm introverted By the way, I I had a meeting this week We're doing more like get to know each other meetings over over zoom and I'm interrupting you because one of my Skip levels spoke up. He's a kid. One of the kids lives by themselves. He said and I'm an INTP I thought as am I as we all are yes All right. Go on as a manager, right? You have to compensate, right? You you you can't follow your instinct to avoid or kill all the people that you were interacting with Crap, it's against the law. So you you learn skills to compensate for this and even how to fake momentarily being extroverted but the meeting schedule is tiresome Right. It's it drains your battery really quickly and You don't get to compensate or balance it out with actually getting stuff done right, you know Too much talky not enough Dewey in Prince life. Yeah, I think I've heard that. Yeah, I have Honestly, and this this won't sustain long term But for right now I've had to commit that I am just gonna have to spend Four hours half a day on Saturday doing the stuff that I would normally have done during the week the Dewey part I do my Dewey on Saturday So I I do that on the weekends as well. It's essentially as My body clock no matter what time I go to bed I get up at I haven't set an alarm clock in forever If I stay up too late that little aspect of my body clock drives me crazy So I am very defensive I need to make sure I go to bed on time because I know I'm getting up at five no matter what Anyway, the nice thing about that is the majority of my family on weekends will sleep in until 10 like sweet Actually when I get the work done I have this weird thing where if I Most days I will wake up five or ten minutes before my alarm no matter what time my alarm set for I Usually have meetings beginning at 5 30 or 6 in the morning So I to get up at 5 or 5 30 every morning and I tend to wake up most mornings on my own on the weekends. I will My body is able to sleep till 7 o'clock, but my family doesn't roll out of bed till about 10 so I have plenty of time after Taking care of the dog and take the dog for a walk and making some coffee to get a couple solid hours in then And that works out pretty well. Hormone. Yeah, what's your what are your team's doing at Microsoft to stay connected? Other than the typical day-to-day meetings So I have a daily stand-up, right? I did I Bring that up. I ask how people are coping how I can help We are doing a more relevant today with within my managers organization That should be interesting So as you know, typically with morale event that there's generally food involved and and some sort of activity Just bring your own food No, actually so Every member of the team yesterday got a $40 door dash gift certificate and We are all to Schedule our door dashes Make sure the food is there by noon and then noon we will be eating and Playing some sort of game. Oh Cool cool. We are there's a lot more virtual happy hours going on across teams some games I've been playing a lot of exploding kittens over the Internet a little bit on board game arena. I just downloaded doom eternal I'll be playing that all weekend But a couple questions for you during this time. What book are you reading right now? Not really much headfirst Dewey Yeah, so the the closest thing to a book that I've been reading is this one Called math riddles for smart kids Brent is where this is why we shouldn't do recordings over zoom cuz Brent Hold things up to the camera on a podcast. I Think it's kind of fun. But yes, it's smart riddles for for a math riddles for smart. I like that I like that. I like that. It's it's basically nothing but story problems And I sit down with my daughter and we do a couple of them a day. Good. What games are you playing else? Not playing anything again, here's what I would say is Because the meeting schedule has gone way up My drive if I have free time I'm getting stuff done because that actually helps my my karmic balance better than then Then those other You know normal relaxed time activities. Yeah, that's true for me as well I wonder if it has to do a little bit at least with the personality type makes my son and I Was interesting so He has a girlfriend. He's going a bit stir-crazy because of this can't spend time with them and He'll go up on Xbox and if his friends aren't there then he'll fall back to his plan Z Which is oh, let's see if dad wants to do something So we played a borderlands 3 for a couple hours four or five days ago But other than that, I mean there's nothing Nothing to report on my side you Like I told I've been playing Ori and the will of the wisps. I Kind of get platformers end up frustrating me after a while So I bought and downloaded doom eternal as I mentioned earlier last night and I'll be playing that this afternoon and this weekend That's what doom doom our first person shooters in general was a good way to Virtually act On your introverted instincts. Is that true? Right. Are you making crap in? No in in doom? You are allowed to kill all the people now. You're killing you're not killing people. You're killing demons Whatever big difference what's been other than the work stuff we talked about what's been the biggest change for you over the last two weeks three weeks finding a rhythm so so I Am I own babysitting duty up until noon then we hand off to my wife so finding a rhythm where I can kind of keep my my day schedule Sort of normal ish, but incorporating helping my my daughter That's been the biggest challenge like right now So normally around eight twenty and it's eight twenty six right now Normally around eight twenty. I have to stop whatever meeting. I'm in Go get my daughter breakfast, but today she's having cereal and I have put it all out on the table It's self-serve breakfast this morning. Yeah Having teenagers as painful as it can be is an advantage at this time because they're largely self-sufficient I have to give them some structure to make sure they get things done and other than that it works out pretty well Yes, I just went and glanced at the table. It doesn't look like she's up yet Yeah, oh, okay, I'm sure other stuff will come up but I am going to do a yet another episode where Alan outsources his job to Brent attempts to or looks for ideas and I am a big believer in the littuce Pauling quote that I mentioned probably 10,000 times on the podcast The way to get good ideas is to have a lot of ideas then throw the bad ones away So I'm always looking for ideas So you're welcome to send me things if you're listening if you're on the one of the three dot slack comm slack group You can send them to me there By the way, we don't have it on our slack But looks like all the paid versions of slack have got the new slack upgrade. It's very slick You can now put for those of us that have Slack teams with lots and lots of channels. You can now organize those channels into folders or groups makes things very nice a Little more organized. I was worried at first it made slack feel a little bit too much like email But not too bad that should roll out to those of us mooching off the free version. I'm guessing in the next few weeks So it's kind of cool Anyway interesting. Does that mean? So it's it's it's right. It sounds like Slack is lighting it. I wonder if they're prioritizing their paid or if they're free just significantly Outnumbers, they're paid. I'm sure free significantly outnumbers paid. I don't know if they're fighting I think it's been available We just turned it on So I don't know I'm not a slack admin on I haven't been contacted I'm not sure how they're going to do for the paid version to contact an admin first and say hey when do you want this Turned on for you and they do a little testing and then they say yeah So anyway, I wanted to mention that because I like it But give me feedback and the question for Brent and for everyone listening is this Say for example, you knew someone Perhaps who's speaking right now who was given the abstract task of Increasing velocity on Their engineering team or in their engineering organization Knowing full well Actually, this is weird talking on this way. So I have been asked to increase velocity for the team with both parties knowing full well, there's no blueprint and Velocity is an abstract term and that it has probably as much perception as it is actual execution I have my own bag of tricks which has worked for a long time small batch size is probably the easiest one both for perception and actual throughput That along with a clear definition of done that focuses on that includes a focus on the customer problem That's being solved by that work Those two are my two go-tos But I know enough to know that those two alone aren't a blueprint. What else should I consider if I wanted to increase the actual and perceived velocity or I'll use the word velocity for now or put another way if you were the designated velocity champion What sorts of things should you be doing or thinking about? And I assume Gaming the numbers is off the table. This isn't Microsoft. We actually do legit work here. Okay, so You called out velocity versus perceived velocity So I can I can how do you think those are measured differently? It's the communication of the velocity. It's a little bit not necessarily how to lie with statistics or game the numbers but for example When we I send I have a couple weekly meetings one with America's one with Europe where I go over project status across the org And just just focusing not on these 70 or so projects. We have a flight but just focusing on the projects that have some delays or some risk and the purpose of that meeting is much less so on The actual delays because they could just send me those in slack. It's Really about emphasizing our culture of transparency and psychological safety and just learning from each other I think the primary use of that meeting in my time in the group has moved from sort of a status check to a meeting that covers that there's really about emphasizing our values as an org our principles and However, however, however to answer your question. I had to proceed with that afterwards I send it I send a brief set of notes to the whole org with completed projects that week delays updates and new projects One thing I did recently to address perceived Velocity is I started I used to start the thing off with delays had delays and then completed and then new I did two things To improve the perception of velocity exact same information one I put completed at the top instead of delays at the top and Then and then delayed and then I always have delayed with the reason but now I have delayed along with the mitigation step for that delay with the idea being that This is delay because team X was depending on team Y and they're waiting on whatever Same reason extra sentence. This is being resolved and determine if it's a systemic problem That should be solved at a higher level or whatever that it's a little bit in the marketing spin of the same information That's what I mean by perceived Okay in one way and that can be in a bunch of different ways So right now if I interpreted that correctly right that last thing is your manager Sounds like he actually reads your status report and I don't know I mean he does but it's the other people that read it. So I I'm surprised that people actually look at this It's just meeting notes. I wouldn't even call Sort of a regularly read and structured email and if it framed delay at the top You're puzzling through or had validated that You starting the top of this with delay is Artificially raising the focus on that that is my hypothesis. Yes. All right And that's just one example. There's there could be more but I wanted to give you an example Then if you put completed at the top, then the likely the next thing is is that your manager is going to so Count the number of bullet items underneath that Going forward is don't don't assume pointy Herodness the idea is that I think my hypothesis is that I will improve the perception of velocity by focusing first on the things that are done and then Improving the information that goes along with the items that are delayed. All right, so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave the perception thing aside for a moment because I'm gonna actually before you do that The reason I bring up the perception is often in the data we communicate the way this is true across velocity or quality or whatever we're trying to get across the way we present that requires a little bit of Spin whether you want to call it marketing or selling but this is common when you're distributing distributing Information to a large group when you have to consider your audience and your audience is vast And well, you know will interpret things in different ways Maybe I'll put this differently the larger your audience the more Spin you may have to put on things to get across the the takeaway you want them to get Yeah, I'm from a Sociological point of view sure spin is one thing But you're the way you're describing the problem. I actually don't view it as And I don't and honestly, I don't think I think perception is is Indicative of a problem with velocity. I don't think we're moving as fast as we can I don't want to go fast and break things. I want to go fast and break as few things as possible We'll break them in a very safe way as possible. I think sometimes we over plan Sometimes we over test and those are the things I want to work on But at the same time I work on the communication so that but again, there's little pointy Herodness in my boss But there are leaders and other disciplines who look at this and and don't know quite how to interpret So I want to communicate to them that Again, this meeting is about and emphasizing the fact that we are learning organization that were very transparent I want to emphasize in my communication that we are a learning Organization for those that may not be as close to the principles as I am So I think there is some truth to perceptions. I want to manage that but But yeah, sure sure great So anytime you're sending a broadcast and set us report type of thing. I tell people it's best to to view it Almost like a slide deck right? Yes, of course. Do you want to put the People are if you assume people are only going to spend a max of 10 minutes Reading it. Yeah, probably less it then you want to want to put the price you want to put the high order bits at the Top of the email and you want to be succinct? Yes I think just to move along I think maybe we're focusing a little bit too much on the perception part you asked about it And I want to give an example. Yeah, probably other ones, but I think I want to move on to the actual Well engineering velocity and practice soon. Yes, so I'm gonna do that now because previously So the best way to improve perceived velocity is actually to improve actual velocity. Yes Yes. Yes. Yes. It makes sure it's visible Clearly, right you want you want to get the perception to align with actual so How do you measure velocity today or do you? The only thing I use now is lead time. I only look at things at the project level So I can use lead time, which is a pretty good measure But what I'm missing is what that doesn't get me. There are some projects for example that their definition of MVP and my definition of MVP are Different to some degree And you know me, you know, I have a very lean definition of MVP What is the minimum thing we can build that will let us get validated learning? So on that one, I've had that conversation a million times that is generally a Discussion with the team and go MVP is not the new millennial version of the term beta They're not soon. Yes. Yes, you're right And what happens is So lead time is very much a trailing indicator for me. I can tell Lead time of our projects I can tell how many projects were delivering a month They're not all the same size, but it's in larger numbers. It makes sense, but it's all trailing indicators The work I need to do is at the team level So what I'm thinking of doing is trying to figure out what are some principles We should apply across our engineering orgs to increase velocity batch size is one But I'm probably getting too specific. I don't I want you to continue to comment. I'm just gonna steer you a little bit So I gave you a very long answer to your question that I should have just said I Know I know throughput at the project level and I know lead time Yeah So lead time Translated to compound is what the the time the the the batch is in development No, it's from it's from product hypothesis to customer reaction or customer feedback customer validation Oh, that's cycle time. Oh cycle. Wait. All right Got it. Well and and to be fair as I've read about this I've seen those terms not quite interchangeably used but Flopped and extended a bit. So thanks for clarifying. So this is not just development time. This is Wait, I've always thought of those backward have I? Anyway, it's this time like We want to build this so that includes planning all the way to in the hands of customers Lead I'm looking at so lead and delivery time often go hand-to-hand They are the terms invented from the manufacturing Okay, then I'm gonna go with them Okay lead is the time that will take to process and prepare material produce and transport it to you the customer Oh, okay. So lead time in that regard Yeah it's So for example, we're dealing with this all over the place in the world right now Manufacturing their lead times have gone way down, right? Are way up? I guess they've increased right if you need toilet paper the the lead time to for producing toilet paper is Has increased it will take longer to get it out to the customer as an aside. I was at the grocery store the other day They actually had toilet paper. I didn't need it, but I felt obligated to buy one small pack anyway You're part of the problem I almost posted on Facebook Achievement unlocked. I haven't bought toilet paper since this thing Happened I didn't I honestly I didn't need to but I bought just a small pack Anyway, alright good for you. Where are we? We're on a lead time tangent. Alright, so here's the thing That I normally do Okay, I think you're trying to do it from the top down Which is the thing that's interesting for me because I'm trying to I normally do it from the bottom up. Okay I work at the top. I need to go work with the bottom. So I do want to hear this Theory of constraints right what you need to do is figure out how to apply the theory of constraints at a useful macro level Right. You need to identify the very first thing that you need to do is Visualize the process In and obviously something automated is going to be great, but at your level Like how to do it at the macro level is something I have not ever done at the at the micro level Right visualizing bottlenecks is easy. You put together a Kanban board and you get useful columns going and you put whip in place and The bot where the bottleneck is becomes really clear Really fast. So one idea might be Whatever your macro level thing is Do you have the power to limit with? No, I can plant seeds though So I just talked about how our org works and it's interesting you brought that up because that's been on my mind as well Maybe last month. We have a monthly get together of all of our leads and I usually take across the world and I usually take 10 or 15 minutes and present something and It's usually not very prescriptive, but I'm planting seeds and the thing I talked about in this one was flow and cues and some lessons learned from Renaissance flow book It sparked a lot of interest. I use that to segue into a talk on because talked a lot about Q times I use that to segue into a brief overview about how you and I like to approach Kanban well, which is really how to use Kanban properly and I the model I used was People taking the default version of Kanban like the first board you create Kanban board has to do doing done And I say this isn't really very helpful you and I have quite similar columns I've used what you have built what you have built. I won't go into mall right now but logical steps that show flow all the way from Things that can be done to things that are validated in production. I show Why you know how that how that works and then I introduced whip which a lot of people using Kanban don't use and I show how easy it is. Just some quick examples how like I just throw up a Kanban board. Okay, what's the problem here and Immediately because human brains are fantastic at pattern matching. Everyone knows exactly what the bottlenecks are It's amazing if you use Kanban and whip properly how powerful that is not coincidentally I Did a query last night of I look a lot at all that our project data I did a query of every project that's been completed on time or early in the last since I joined the team in the last 10 months or so and The delivery owner in charge of those projects all of our projects have a product owner which is product management and a delivery owner, which is the engineering lead and Would you believe would you be surprised that? that The people at the top of that list are people that I know from talking to them Use Kanban and whip as part of their project management. I am not And actually it's interesting. Maybe you have found a clue there. Yeah, there's something there But here's here's a little bit of my challenge. Let me I need to get a little bit more of our culture Then go on there. We have a very We're very proud of our autonomous culture the the directions We give our engineering leads if you have three jobs you need to manage people you need to be a tech leader You need to do your own project management How you do that is up to you But when you do it you should balance that work is roughly 60% new stuff 20% keeping the business running 20% tech debt and We give them like in very much in the spirit of oh Who are the radical leaders guide to radical management the denning? give people a framework they can work in and then get out of their way and So I offer tips on Why they may be using scrum or Kanban and effectively and slowly they get better But that's kind of where we're at. So people get to choose. We don't prescribe a project management approach. I Obviously have my preferences but in the way our org works It wouldn't be fair of me to tell them what to do I can get them suggestions on what may work better in their context as I work my way around our our 80 different engineering teams however many we have Yeah Okay, I get that so So in addition to this we need to come up with a strategy that doesn't involve command and control Yeah, and and I should also point out they do listen to me So if I just sent an email or a slack message or presentation that said Alan thinks velocity can be improved if we follow these three principles They'll try them. Oh So I will I can't prescribe but I've worked myself into a position of Credibility where if I say stuff it won't be whatever shut up So that there is that advantage well Right, if you were to say the principles Let me try these right? CICD obviously pole and whip right, I think the those three principles or those three acids techniques thingamabobs I don't care about the right now that's the secret sauce of Kombat to a great deal. I mean be the fourth one is visualize everything. Yes that helps, right? But if you have a team So if you initiated if you get teams to initiate whip And then people are gonna come up with well, hey, I'm idle I can't pick up another ticket because Whip What do I do? Right, then you you guide them towards pulling right, and then the CICD the best thing about CICD is Is it's just fantastic inoculation into the primary? Flaw with scrum in that is All the bugs get integrated or get introduced into the product The 11 p.m. The night before the end of spring demo. Yeah, even our teams using scrum though, however, I'm 90 plus percent of those Their stuff when it gets to the done column is going into production. They don't really it's a it's a scrummer bond sort of thing But we have CICD Across the org that parts there. What we don't have is this idea of whip and I think it does I think it is leading to perceived an actual slowness so if you have if you have whip in place then Then that you need to make sure pull is in place and and a lot of times when I say the word pull I mean the opposite of push Not a long thing that you hang electric wires off of Right so Whip is really powerful along with pull right So there's a problem at the individual level They're motivated To start the next new shiny thing Thanks for that Wow You'd make an attractive teenage girl. I don't know what you did Brent's hallucinating. Yeah, Ellen is somehow Incorporated Snapchat into zoom Shiny things Sorry tip of the day. Sorry to interrupt. I was goofing off listening to Brent There's you can go to snap camera snapchat calm and you can get a filter that'll work in your video app So you can change there's one where you can change yourself to a potato. It's pretty good anyway anyway, so once I get whip Getting whip on a team because whip seems like what you're doing is you're setting up artificial bottlenecks And it takes a little while to get people to understand know once once you have the white right limits in place on your con bun board you should always have exactly one column that's bottleneck if you have the right what lip limits in place and It's great because that is Kanban telling you Hey dive in here It's it's all about Creating an effective learning culture if you don't know where your bottleneck is Start adding whip and cranking it down until something starts to slow Absolutely, and I can offer this advice to the teams that are using who have chosen who have been nudged properly to use Kanban as their project management. The second thing is you got you want to You want to change? the intrinsic Motivation of each employee they're motivated to start the next new shiny thing You want to change that intrinsic motivation to be around? Closing is more important than starting Finishing what is in flight is more important than starting something new and What they what I when I get a team going into that particular rhythm and they successfully change that mindset You discover something fascinating and that is that they realize they can actually start the new shiny thing faster by focusing on closing Yes, and I feel like we may be pretty good at that Okay I think there may be and maybe you have true advice here We're actually believe it or not getting close to the end of our time is One thing I've discovered in looking at which projects have been successfully Delivered and looking across hundreds of projects now There is a correlation Between and it's a little different Microsoft with program managers who were a bunch of different hats but between our product managers our product owners and Our engineering leaders the better alignment they have between the two of them because they're able to figure out What exactly is they're building what problem? It's solving what a true MVP is but the tighter that alignment is the More velocity their teams have have you noticed anything like that or have any ideas how I could encourage that to work better When you have Teams that have a tight alignment. Here's how I phrase it my PM in engineering Or development let me do that PM in development they have different roles and often the the power structure between the two of them is unbalanced and the the way I Frame it is They're my partner And what I expect from a partner is that they are is as concerned about my goals as they are their goals and their goals are not my goals Meaning we have we have overlapping so some PMs go Do your goals are what I tell you to do. Here's the requirements that go do it, right? That doesn't work though. It does not work, but there are there there are some Thankfully, it's rare, but there are some PMs that are Power tripping So I sit down with my PMs and I go look This is my definition of a partnership if you want to be my partner. It's not by words This is what this means means you and I will Consistently sync up around what my goals are and what your goals are and we're going to have a conversation That results in both set of goals of being equally cared about by both sides That is a partnership. Yeah, right and Why do you have it a pushback? Why do you you want both sets of goals to be like how come you just can't have one set Of goals between you because the goals are gonna be different Right, they're gonna have something very PM focused as well on their list No, the screw that screw that your come your goals together are to solve a customer's problem That's nice as a t-shirt model But on any level of drill down It falls apart pretty quickly every human being has intrinsic goals. They have things that they want to achieve Hey, let's say you were my PM and hey, you're like, hey, this is the right thing for the customer and You know what you're really trying for a promotion Yeah, we we'd right that that's a Microsoft thing There are always intrinsic in and extrinsic goals I believe that people are trying to improve people are trying to grow but The first thing you do is realize that users come first How are we gonna solve that problem on the engineering side? You help figure out what's the minimal amount of work we need to do to validate whether we're solving that problem or not Agree on that implement it rinse lather repeat Yeah, so I've definitely come from the engineering management point of view and as you know with my experience like more often than not Nowadays I'm more of a I am my own PM right? I already have the lather risk repeat I know how to get feedback from the customers. I know how to Use the data So it's generally not a problem. Yeah, I Work with no PM's on the teams. I manage. I just want to help the rest the other 240 engineers in the organization be successful So before we run out of time there's one last Concept that I wanted to bring up on your other question and that's the identification of waste Do you have the ability do you understand this concept? Yes, absolutely. This is all over my presentation I gave a month ago on lean and writer's and So if you can identify So I have a particular style of a retrospective We definitely do not have time to go through it where you where you can Force teams to understand what waste is and Visualize it in a retrospective But the more you can make that part of a culture and make each individual realize Realize on their own that the effort that just spent on it could have been reduced by n number of days You then get that learning in that pre-thinking done Going forward Right. You got to get rid of any sort of semblance of a blame culture I have no doubt that that's pretty thriving not blame culture Non-blame culture, I think is thriving at unity based on how you describe it in our org psychological safety is definitely something that both my manager And I make sure is a top priority. Yes So once you get through that then getting people through trained on at a ground level how to use a retrospective to identify sources of waste As a way to learn what to do next time because turns out Very specific causes of waste are very rare. It almost always generalizes that That is actually a good brain tickle that last bit you brought up because I've talked a lot about with my teams around I call them my teams I consider the whole org sort of dotted line report to me Whether they do or not, but we talked about Waste and cues and whip and all these things but one of the things I haven't planted enough seeds about and I Talk a lot about planting seeds and leadership and just kind of mentioning things and see who picks up on it My org is very fertile They like when I plant seeds they pick them up, but I'm surprised sometimes Hey, Alan, I tried this thing you mentioned it's working. I thought that wasn't even my main point But yeah, and I haven't planted enough seeds yet around the power of retrospectives and that may be one of the next things I talk about with the team and start planting because that's That's where the improvement happens. We have a learning culture and most or probably all the teams do retros But are they effective retros that focus on not just on? bugs or issues that came up or Conflicts but make sure those retros include ideas on improving velocity or identifying waste or cues would be Right so Retrospective and You know said not be a postmortem It right right and I I don't think they're that but I think I can nudge those to being a way to scale some of this Knowledge and we are going to spend our next podcast talking quite a bit more about retrospectives whether you know it or not I just put it in slack. What do you think about that? I think that's fantastic All right. I will will have forgotten it. All right. I better get going All right Alan is now mr. Potato I have become a potato for Brent and hey, it is good chatting with you glad things are going Well, please stay healthy and that message goes to Brent as well as the rest of our listeners All right. All right. I will see you. Thank you
