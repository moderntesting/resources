Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the ship Mary ho ho where that's not right. This is a it's December 24th and we're recording and and Brent's here and So is Alan and they got my name, right? We're ready to go here It's been another year of a B testing podcast. This is our our Ultimate is if penultimate is next to last is ultimate the last this is the last show of 2024 Yeah, we reflect on the year and Talk about you know stuff. I don't know. What do we do here? How's it going? It's going Fantastic, how about you? It's it's going really really well, I think a whole lot of crap going on Dog is crying behind me. She's gonna show up on the podcast this week. We got a lot to talk about We got new stuff old stuff Reflective stuff. We had a pretty fun year in the podcast which reflect on in a second, but yeah episode 213 Can you believe I mean what a frickin waste of time it is for us to get together Every couple weeks and this podcast put it once twice. We do it 213 times over a little over 10 years What are we doing? Yeah, what is that? I? Don't know don't I've five five weeks over ten years five working weeks Oh something like I don't know plus it's been it's been a long time 213 episodes Sometimes they're good and the rest of the time it's like Two people talking over beer even though it is actually we're ever late start today. It's 10 a.m. Yeah No, well, normally we're recording much later. Yeah We did yeah, we've been all over the place so Anything else new and exciting to share before we get into all of our normal stuff I'll share it during Yeah Yeah, all right, okay what we like to do in last episode of the year is kind of reflect on the year Talk about some of the highlights lowlights if we had them, but you know Talk about some of our predictions last year. We didn't have very many And we but we'll talk about those and then what do we think is gonna happen in? 2025 when the world falls apart so I'm gonna walk through our Spotify wrapped for the ABI testing podcast and I think the Spotify wrapped is complete bunk because my I know my wrapped for my Song to listen to was not right. I don't think it was right. But well my mine was totally right Are you still listening to acoustic alchemy all the time? Nope What was your top? What was your top artist? My top artist was the yeah. Yeah. Yes Very interesting. Very interesting. Yep my top song Was float on by the AAS. No float on it's interesting because None of my top songs were from the AAS, but my top song was float on by modest mouse Well, interesting and my second top song was ain't no rest for the wicked by cage the elephant And it's interesting to me That both of those songs kind of Express a similar emotion Which was very relevant to me in 2024, but we're not at that section It doesn't matter how good I feel or how bad I feel I always listen to like my my jam is just People who singer songwriters who hate themselves? Okay, there's a lot of those what's it? What's the current example? So I I Gotta think of one Because my top artist isn't one they have some happy songs too, but they kind of fell You know how Spotify very often of tangent already it will Like some songs. Let's do go. Hey you like those songs you like this. That's alright I'll listen to that for a while and I got I fell down a huge Apparently a huge Casey Musgraves hole because Casey Musgraves should have my top artists, but I think that's wrong I don't think I don't think it was that much I don't know. I don't even know who that is. But if you know who like Elliott Smith If you want to hear so yeah, yeah, Elliott Smith from the 90s That that's that's the stuff I listen to all day or even even Sean Mullins He had a little hit for a minute there in a while But the singer songwriters who sing songs about you know, dogs dying things like that old deal are those from the same genre No, Casey Musgraves kind of considered country or country pop and Elliott Smith does more of I guess just call him indie folk or indie pop and and I would say that Sean Mullins is indie folk But anyway before we go into somebody's gonna go. Oh, that's not indie. This is indie and shut up I don't give a fuck. Let's talk about our podcast. So apparently we grew our listeners by 66% and That means we went but if we went from three to four, I don't know. I still think we have three No, we went from three to three. So so I'm gonna ignore that one So 66% I'm assuming it's 66 repeated Yeah, so that means we we went from three to three by increasing by two. All right 83% of our listeners something Discovered our podcast this year. So but the numbers don't reflect that that doesn't make any sense Your fans have a clear favorite And I don't know why but which episode 202 the return I care what we even talked about that episode but that had for some reason according to Spotify wrapped 999% more streams than our average episode So I don't get I didn't look to see what the numbers were this stuff. Oh, I Don't remember what we talked about. It's at the return of Jason Arbin. Maybe he pumped it up or something. I bet it was Transcript hey Spotify has a transcript So I don't think Jason was in this one, but we like the title is organizational change which means And we did a mailbag so maybe whoever we mail bagged for Forwarded it on worth checking out worth checking out the wrapped itself is horrible this year because There's no deep stats. It's all just top level stuff. Our top streaming country was the US. Yeah, right Dumb things like 61% of our audience also watched a video on to modify this year. So here's the fun part We are a top 10 podcast for 1000 listeners. Oh How about that? Oh, okay. People have not updated there something. We're a top five. So we're a big fish in We are a top five show for 851 fans what this is showing me is that the average A B testing listener does not listen to podcasts that often We are we are the number one show for 353 fans 353 of the three listen to only one podcast. That's the A B testing podcast Okay. Yeah, it's kind of these feel like weird stats. They they are super weird this year not happy I'm done with those. I'm closing. I'm closing the wrapped window, but I shared it last year wanted to share it again So that is our that's our episode for this week. Thank you all very much. No I do want to look one of these windows. I have some notes from last year. I want to talk about Oh Before we do that what I mean, this is an easy answer. What was your what was your favorite A B testing podcast of? of It I'll surprise you because I know what I'm supposed to say, which is my number two My number one you're my number two Yeah, and you're my number one The episode with Dagna was oh she's a delight. Yeah that that was 2000 or not 2000 208 Where we walked through her book a lot of the times like when we get people on there. They're mostly on Make we go. Okay, can we can we help this person hawk their wares and still have an interesting conversation? Right and it's clear from their point of view hawking their wares is the primary pivot with Dagna Yeah, that was a that was a big part of it but her book I have it is really good that conversation was fantastic and Very well, yeah, mine's actually ups. I have a copy also. It's really good Yeah, and I feel like I walked while you're looking around for that doesn't matter it doesn't work for a podcast Yeah, I felt like I mean I felt like I was getting coaching from her during the podcast you as do I As as do I or did I okay? I like that one a lot and I would be remiss if I did not say that are the not just because it was our 200th episode but that we we I through the power of manipulation of statistics made sure that our 10 year anniversary our 200th episode and our Brent Brent just you know, if you only looked as good as I told to give us a little bobblehead that we got Here's mine. But we managed to get our 200th podcast our our 10 year anniversary and our 1000th member of the slack community all on the exact same day Did I manipulate things a little bit to make that work I did do we do we Crush in like three podcast recordings in a week to make sure we could get there Do we record at night at that night? Yes, we did all those things we but we made it happen We made it happen because we wanted the stars to align we did we made or or did we? Or is it like all the science fiction movies where you have this like all the moons on? Planet zen bar are gonna align exactly at midnight at this time and we have to make sure we get there in time or else The you know the catastrophic moment occurs. So yeah, that's the AB testing podcast What other podcasts is listen to this year? Oh I just wanted the list off number 200 was my number two and then I also want to call out Like literally all the ones with Jason were in Positions, you know three to and whatever because I don't remember how we we did at least two with him We did I think we did those were great discussions. Those are great discussions. He's a good guy. Hey Jason What other podcasts do you listen to anything? I I Recently have followed suit with Alan Yeah and got rid of Xfinity And so I don't know which things on on YouTube I would count as podcast or not because they do podcasts on YouTube. I'm like, I'm like, I'm so confused Listen to podcasts. I got a pot like it like the the one and only one I did this year Was we started out at the beginning of the year was 60 songs that explained the 90s, which was a fun little podcast where he felt where he goes way beyond 60 songs, but He talks about particular songs. Oh, yeah. I remember this talk. It was it was like Musical anthropology. I greatly enjoyed that that podcast Yeah, I should check that out. So yeah, I listened to too many podcasts. I'm gonna start weeding them out But the new one I started listening to this year I don't listen to every episode because they do two episodes a week and every episode is an hour and a half long But but there's actually only 30 minutes of each episode of really good stuff is pivot podcast by Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway They have some good Good moderate sometimes sometimes absolutely not moderate opinions on you know, you know Kara Swisher she used to be Major tech writer. She was like working with Walt Mossberg back in the day on and I read her book this year, too Which is really good and Scott Galloway is just an asshole, but he's fun to listen to but anyway listen to that a lot this year That's a political podcast political tech comment, whatever is new because Galloway is a professor somewhere doesn't matter Filthy rich and Kara Swisher is a tech writer, but super smart. It's like super super smart. I like them both a lot So they're fun to listen to I like their rapport back and forth They're like a really imagine if you and I were smart and we had really deep discussions about anything That's them, but we're not capable of that. So we're like if they're the pros we are Single a made not even single a ball. What are you before single a I don't know my sports that were little league Junior high little league. All right. So listen to that one Um, I don't think I thought I listened to fewer trivia podcasts because they're running out of time And so just weren't warning as good. I was on a few trivia podcasts this year Were you didn't announce them anywhere? But I did I one was a head-to-head one on The throwback trivia was called a throwback trivia podcast. They do like They do random questions from in 12 categories across You know six decades like you get you pick a category and they roll a die and you get like it's okay 60s music and anyway, I I won the episode I was on That was fun I was on another podcast called How did you get on the podcast? I support them on patreon so they they invite all their In the same with trivial warfare, which is are probably the best podcast out there. They do a really good They have really good commentary Sometimes a little they're a little too proud of themselves that I like them and I was on that one one So my team lost I had a really smart person with me and I drug them down and we lost on that one So, yeah, I did that Traveled a little bit. I don't know What do you last year you had some good YouTube recommendations for me and one that stuck with me was Josh Wiseman I still watch Josh Wiseman his videos really great cooking videos Just really well done well produced a lot of fun to watch but what do you what even watching on the tube of use? I have been mostly watching so Ice-cream sandwich is Okay, it's all one word ice cream sandwich It's an it's an animator who kind of tells little stories and they're I'm using af as the kids would say Still watch Josh. So watch Guga Zach Friedman is another guy I'm watching a lot It's it's old news for you but Last year got my daughter a 3d printer and it's the first time we've had a 3d printer and in Do you know the the thing? Or the models known as grid finity. No, okay very popular set of models for 3d printing and those were invented and then open source licensed by Zach Freeman And then whatever random Oh My son's gotten me into I think it's called monster factory Mon It it's not great. Um, but it's fun what they do Their whole shtick is they play game. They play games that have a character editor and then they go in with the character editor and they make it as Ugly as they possibly can the character And this is interesting and then they play the game and they invent sort of a backstory with with the character It amuses my son and spending time with my son is important to me Yeah, how about you I should look but I Probably nothing new in my subscriptions on the tube I got like everybody else I get pulled into the YouTube shorts all the time and they were I do watch Let me see what's in my subscription list, um, here's a good one I watched this to be called five guys FC, which is this just these 20 something year olds in England playing in this Six aside soccer league and they film it. It's kind of funny and there I don't know why I watch it But now I watch it every time the ever sees it's funny Josh Wiseman I Watched I might have mentioned it before the only new one here is Rick Beato who I probably mentioned him last year. He's a former musician producer he does a lot of Breaking apart songs and talking about why they work along with some interviews of musicians. He knows everybody But he does a really good show on On kind of how music how pop music is made and why stuff works and he'll listen to you I love he'll listen to you like the Spotify top ten Kind of cold and I'll play along with it and go. Oh, oh and I think it was It was a Sabrina Carpenter song. He said he stopped it goes. Oh my god That could be the first top ten pop song in the last ten years that has a key change So little things and he goes, oh you're probably right. It's been a while. It's been a while He has a serious. I don't think he does anymore He used to do a series called what makes this song great You know take some hit song from the last 20 or 30 years and he just break it down completely everything from the everything from the music and lyrics and chords to the production to the Just you know everything so really really interesting to see the production behind how the song was repaved. So that's another one Anywho, I have a couple more I can share cuz sure you and Then we then we need to talk about the year coming up. Sure or Okay One the only political based one I have in here is by lady shoe on head As you know, I am neither left or right She is left But will throw shit at anyone and is funny Like crap in my humble opinion the nerd Forge These are two Norwegian people who just make random shit Like they did it. I did it. They did a gigantic reprint of Harry Potter Where? Literally, the book was like three feet tall and they just combined all of the books and reprinted them and they and they walked through How they they'd leather bound it and how they Prep the leather and how they formed the stitching and I'm like, okay, that's fascinating. I already mentions that Friedman Musically, I have two in here a Davy 504 who's just a fantastic bassist who who who's When you have a comedic pair the guy That's sort of the silent one that always straight man straight man He's he's he's got the he's kind of got a straight man attitude, which is funny and then the charismatic voice which is a opera an opera singer who does sort of reaction videos around Music videos across a span of Genres what's that one called? charismatic voice The charismatic is fine. Go ahead and finish. I'll tell you about some of these. Oh, I have seen her Here's my view on that. Mmm I don't you know, there's a bunch of these out there. There's a whole genre on YouTube of I'm gonna I Never heard this song before I'm gonna listen to it for the first time And I think it's all I think it's largely staged It's largely there. It's largely entertainment You know and some of the stuff they point some of the stuff she points out even as complete BS Some of it's actually interesting but but the entertainment factor top-notch the factual factor me Again it's entertaining It's interesting. Yes, it's entertaining but yeah, but anyway, and she has a crap ton of Views and listen to it's about entertainment. Not here is here is the state of the world in As I go off and this could be about anything about YouTube videos or you know politics whatever The entertainment factor has far outweighed the need for things to be accurate. Oh Oh Yeah, and and that and that's that's what I think about the curious man. That's where well, I don't know I mean, oh, I'm not saying I'm not saying it's as bad as politics. What I'm saying is entertainment getting getting views getting clicks and Even even the meat in the media does this across both sides and down the middle The goal is to get clicks and reads because they're trying to make money. It's not about being accurate News week especially is horrible at sensationalist headlines, but they're all over the internet. They do these they they purposely either ignore facts or Change facts in order to get more views and clicks. That's what's happening with with what's your face the charismatic voice That's what happens in what you and not just political but all over the place. He's saying that's what's happening with her Oh because she's she's wrong some of the times She's trying to be entertaining and she's very entertaining, but she's also you said you hadn't seen her. Oh, I have seen her Oh, okay. No, I have seen her. Okay. I had to bring her up. Yep. I've seen her talk about stuff She's a lot very entertaining, but not always accurate. That's my that's my take Okay All right. There's there is Anyway, okay. Great. So speaking of lies moralize and lies disguised as statistics What are some of the things we should talk a little bit about what are some of the things you think are gonna happen in In the world will get more specific on the A B testing podcast. What things are gonna happen in the world in 2025? well We kind of skipped over reflection on 20 for let me pause that was there more reflection on 24 Well, let's do that. I'm sorry. Let's do that. Well, I'm gonna edit this. Let's go back on 24 24 was a big year. We talked about the podcast in 24, but not much else Right in the only the only big thing For 2024 so it's finally closed Alan's known about this for a year and a half. We've we've not talked about it And I'm not gonna I don't want this to be a downer episode but on December 11th, I Have completed my divorce And accordingly 2024 Kind of sucked So Yeah, so I I'm not gonna go into a whole lot of detail on the suck a tube there not in this episode anyway the completions gotta feel something It feels Yeah, I keep reminding myself repeatedly That every time a door closes a new one opens Yes, right. Um Right, it's it is easy to To think about the future and if you're in the wrong frame of mind Go quite apocalyptic Pretty quickly So that's That's the the number one thing I'm focusing on not going apocalyptic but realizing that in battling against it Yeah, yeah, I can see that it was a lot long long path Well, and on that lovely note, but yeah, yeah I don't know what to say. You don't say congratulations, but it's a it's definitely a milestone. I'm not sure what to say about it It is what it is. I don't think I think the listeners were afraid you're in divorce me, but No, no, no, no, that's that's not 20 24 That's a 2025 thing yeah, we'll get there we'll figure who gets fired first Ha anything else from 20 I gotta think in my 24 I did the the Wonderland trail again I did I tell you this on the podcast that I attempted to do another section of the the PCT for much I have to die Steven's past to so call me past and my water filter broke and it was just too hot for me to try and Fake it through there. So ended up bailing a little early, but I'll go back and finish that sometime you should have a I Don't know what you're using is your water filter, but they're small. I mean you should have a backup Yeah, I think so as a Nobody's the van of hikers and listeners for this overlap. I use a one called the Sawyer squeeze which works out really well I don't know why mine just decided to puke But they're not that much but they also make a Sawyer squeeze mini which is even smaller and lighter But they kind of suck because the the flow is so awful, but it's so it's like a couple ounces It would be it would make sense to just carry an extra one Just in case like the odds of your especially if you're using it every day the odds of your water filter dying are pretty low But having the the lighter weight one Kind of just sticking in the bottom of a bag somewhere just in case would would have would have been super helpful What do you do for fire? The fires aren't allowed most of the places I go. So I have a oh, I see I have a little a little stove I've a little called a pocket rocket and it's teeny I don't have here but it's just all it is It's just a little screw thing and a couple little it's hardly anything to it weighs like an ounce and you screw that on top of the fuel canister and light it and That's where I get heat from I have also done hikes before where I did not cook anything just cold soaked everything That gets a little old after a while So it's worth it for the extra weight a lot of people who like a lot. They just get nuts around weight They want to see how light they can get everything so they carry nothing and what I've discovered in my experimenting with this is Like these folks that carry nothing. They're carrying about nine pounds of weight on their backpack including the pack and For me I can carry two more pounds, which isn't that much and I can be Comfortable I can have a little bigger sleeping pad. I can have a stove. I have camp shoes I take off my wet shoes at night It's not that much you can look at oh, it's like 20% extra weight Nine pounds and 11 pounds. It's easier for me to lose 20% extra weight When it's the difference when the 20% is two pounds, right? Yeah, that's one of the things I bring up in data science all the time Like what's the important number? Is it the percent or is it right unit? The thing I bring up because I get this question sometimes from folks and they say They'll ask well Wouldn't you like to use that 12 pounds down to 10 pounds and I say I Will be more I mean you want me to carry two pounds extra weight I will just go lose two pounds of body weight and keep the comfort Right and keep the comfort and safety like these folks will sleep like I have I have a tent it's light, but I have a tent and My tent is made so it'll stand up with with trekking poles, but I don't like them there So I thought a bike trip once I use the tent and I got some actual regular poles for it They're great It also means I can pick up the whole tent and move it if I don't like where it is So I I carry poles it's extra, you know 11 ounces But some people like I don't need a tent. I just need a tarp to sleep under I'll just string this up like they're just this ultralight is like no, I'm not comfortable there I kind of like being totally enclosed when I'm out in the middle of nowhere I don't want bugs and mice crawling up on my sleeping bag. Yeah, I mean I Was just thinking okay just a tarp, huh? Do you have like barbecue sauce scented like deodorant or something? Like just to lather it up for the bears I mean not that the tents gonna really do anything in terms of bear protection, but no But but the bugs for certain the bugs for certain. Yeah, there's just no way so anyway Okay, I buy a pack fully loaded is about 11 Touch over 11 pounds and but that gives me all the comfort I need which is fine. It's still really light That's not including food or water That adds weight to so anyway, I'm 24. I did that I didn't do much else I think your dog is trying to dig into your couch. Oh, she insists on making her bed. She has She's a burrowing gotcha Yeah Try it she's trying to make it nice. Okay, so let's I don't think anything else exciting in 2024 Let's talk about 2025. Let's do the world first software and then a be testing podcast What's something you think will happen in the world in 2025? Okay, we'll do that one I Can chat GPT what's gonna happen no, I'm reorganizing my list, okay my theme for 2025 is On that topic is death death to the uni party long live the uni party Okay, tell me tell me more right well One version of the uni party just got kicked out of office a new version of it just got Brought in I do not think the sky will fall Whether that is a bullshit affirmation or not. We will find out But again because of my reflection in 2024 God damn it 2025 is Brent Jensen's year of hope so I don't care what else happens. I Will find the hopeful way of viewing it. I do not think the sky will fall but it's Yeah, things are gonna change that's like generally World stuff do I think Ukraine will stop like I would very much like to see the two major wards Stop, I would like 2025 not to be the year of World War three Yeah So I see three world threats right now Like I'm continuously afraid of China trying to take Taiwan Will you can war in I don't know We can't know but I it's a worthwhile thing to talk about. I think we both agree that Both of those major wars should stop. Yeah, I think it's I think it's It's likely I think the Israeli one will stop This really Palestine I think that one will will will likely stop next year Well, here's what I mean, I think the politics are more complicated Particularly with Russia bringing in North Korea. I think I think it gets interesting With the new administration because it could just be that Trump pulls the plugs on all the US funding to Ukraine and Putin steamrolls them And it's over so could be And then and Trump will take credit for stopping the war in Ukraine and his his fans will worship but I think it's actually a reasonable chance that I Actually, you know what after the election? I did two things the highly related one is I removed the politics subreddit from my subreddit feed I read it food and then I kind of stopped going to read it very often I just I stopped checking the news. I just can't I just can't it's it's the potential and this is again going back to the news But the potential of very bad things to happen is very high and It's higher at me looking at it does not make it More likely or less likely of the bad things to happen. It just raises my anxiety so I look at enough to know what's going on in the world and Just try and ignore the headlines because they're there to get a reaction out of me It's kind of like I Think we've talked about art before here and did you paint it all in 2024? No, so art Yeah, enough stuff other stuff going on art is The piece of art isn't the art the art is the reaction of someone viewing that Sculpture painting banana duct tape to the wall. That's the art. The art is the interpretation of what's there same with music Why John which is art by the way? I'm aware. Thank you. Yeah, but it's not the piece itself. It's it's how is it felt like when Stravinsky premiered the Rite of Spring in Paris there were riots. That's a reaction to art because it was so different than anything else I could was bad they listen today. This is fucking cool. But back then I was like what a minute my cheese got moved too much so I think it's the same thing I you know I Internet headlines or art It's not the headlines just words on the page It's how those are interpreted by people is is the reaction and those things get clicks and those things get money And that's not going to get fixed in 2025. So I am Moving myself as much as I can from looking at those things because I don't want to be part of I don't want to contribute To that art. I don't want to be yet another person reacting to something in a way that is Irrelevant to the underlying facts the I don't think I was thinking in terms of a data science like to me Like there's a lot of place where crowdsourcing Data science is able to show crowdsourcing this benefit. I do not think news is one of those things. Yeah like I think it is It's a massive echo chamber in So, yeah, I get I get where you're coming from like what part of your speech reminded me early on in this in 2024 I I came across Have we talked about the stoics or the stoicism? Oh, I don't know if we have but I have spent a lot of time Reading about stoics this year interestingly, so please go. Yeah, so did I earlier this year? um, and one of the things that really resonates with me is one of their key tenets is only Control the things you can control right and you cannot control outcomes Right, that's it one million percent and And they felt there was no point in having an emotional response to any outcome at all because you're It's nothing you control Yes, and in fact Go ahead. Yeah, no, I would like to do an episode maybe our next one sometime on Stow system in modern testing. So let's let's pencil it in that would be fun. Let me thank you for bringing that up As far as other things like world stuff I don't know. I don't know. I'm trying not to pay attention trying to Yeah, I don't have a good thing there. But how about let's talk about the world of software So which is gonna be largely around Gen AI But what's different a year from now in the world and one thing I said last year just to bring this up I didn't quite happen, but I still think it's true was That you you you wrote down our predictions from last year, right? Oh, there's there's somewhere around here but I kind of went through most of one of them was that I think that the ability to read code and interpret it and and and not interpret read it and Critique it is going to become more important than writing code and I think that's actually true today people just won't admit it yet I think we can rely on Gen AI to generate large amounts on all large amounts of our code But we have to be able to see in the articles this year on and the research showing that There's lots of bugs in this Gen AI generated code which means that we haven't shifted yet people haven't able to take this Gen AI code and and Look at it and fix it or look and see why it's wrong or why it doesn't apply and yeah But I think Gen AI has has dramatically changed both right how I said priority though, I Didn't you that that Reading is gonna be a higher priority than no I said it's gonna be a it's gonna be a more more important skill Yeah, what we're gonna use. Okay, and more important sure Reading is going to become more important than writing Yeah And I don't know if that occurred because I think I think it's I Like the fact that you put more important because I think that's true Right because I've seen reading and writing Being done through LOM quite often like even in my own own coding I am using GitHub co-pilot just a lot more and It's mostly because I find that it's a great education tool. I go. Oh How would you improve the perf of this and it generates? Code options for me and I look at and I go. Oh, whoa I didn't even know that class could do that like there was one example where I had a nested a two level nested loop so n squared Mm-hmm, and it got rid of the whole damn loop and I'm like and it's because it used Part of an interface of a class that I didn't even know existed and I'm like, oh Thank you GPT. You know, we made my code better, but you upleveled me It's actually really that's a good story. We need more stories like that. I The it's a rare story honestly because I can also see places where where I'm very actively paying attention to my own interaction with GPT Because I can see places where intellectual laziness comes in Right when it when it comes to interviews Like my stick at interviews used to be no, I don't remember much. I'm old and Like I haven't remembered much In the interview basis since 30s my 30s But I know where to find it right? I'm not a rookie in the industry. Don't ask me how to It's not important for the type of jobs that I do to have to traverse a doubly linked list right But if if in the real world we need a doubly linked list I know how to You know do find the go through my reference materials and then we'll build one. Well now I don't even need that right? It's GPT generate me a class that I can use as a doubly linked list it like I've never actually done that but that would be something I have very little doubt that it will do well Okay, so what's gonna happen? Tell me something. It's gonna happen in the world of software in 2025 Here are my three big predictions and I have three and I wrote them down I do not heard so much more prepared than me, but so prepared. Please tell please chair. Okay, I do think we are Officially at the beginning of the end of the data science era officially God Yeah, I feel like I've talked about this for a few years, but please go on elaborate Yeah, no, I so I think 2025 will be the year where data science Scientists who can't actually code to say a bachelor's CS degree level Will not get hired. I believe 2025 is the is it won't be formally constructed as such but 2025 is The unofficial year where data science becomes a specialization within death. Okay, I agree Um number two, I believe in here I'm Soft and fuzzy. Okay, I believe the first major instance of L. O. M. Causing a human harm or safety issues Because its controllers don't know what they're doing Will occur in 2025 and I don't know if I completely fucked the grammar with that sentence But I think you got what I'm saying. I do I do and I think Unfortunately, you're right, but we'll see what happens and then lastly I think RTW Will become a much bigger thing. I mean return to work. Yeah, talk to me more about that And Here I think it's because of the new I think that's a tenant an old-school tenant of the new that The on the onboarding version of the Uni Party. I think that will be become far more politically correct to Force everyone back to work. Huh honestly What do you mean by so this is a good one to discuss because we may have talked about in a long time enough a ton of time today, but everyone is a lot of people what about orgs that don't even have offices or Like there's not even an office for me. We'll be fine They'll be fine Because if they started off with that as a key tenant, then I think they'll be fine I think well, I think these people these companies that have all of this office space That's going on utilized. I have an idea for that Never sure this is freely available I had an idea because we work kind of they're still around but they kind of died during the pandemic as well I would love all this unused office space Here's my idea. We work buys it like sometimes I want to go to an office. I'm gonna go to the house I don't have a place to go What I would like a company to do say a company I'll say I'll pick a generic company ACME software company what I can do is for my I Buy a certain number of credits like, you know for my thousand-person company I'll buy you know 10,000 credits that we work and what that means is my employees then can choose to go to these offices It's kind of like a gym membership And I can pay these companies and my employees when they want to go to an office and work and be around people They do their work and have internet and a conference room They can book where they don't have an office to go to they can go to an office And that would I could I think what I think is I think there's a lot of people who would like to go to an office But if you're gonna rent a place that we work it's like every day and it's expensive I think I think there's a way to do sort of a subscription service of of office rental There's some details to figure out and I'm not enough of the innovator and entrepreneur to figure this out It's been done already by there's got to be a way to use these like downtown in Seattle especially sounds to go dead because so many people aren't going back to work and very similar in the two cities because The people that used to work there have don't live anywhere near the cities because it's so expensive to live in the cities They live farther away and it's expensive to commute to work Right, right. Yeah, so I I don't we're gonna talk more about that throughout the year about curious to see what happened there We almost time here. Do you have a picture here? So what we'll see is I Do you think like I realized myself just in the last couple of months? right the so I have my own leadership team that reports to me and We just have a better meeting when we are all in the same room. Absolutely. Absolutely So the question is why aren't we putting more effort into teaching people how to have a successful virtual meeting? Like it's doable. It's doable. I've been very good Figure it out myself. Yeah, I think people just kind of forward in I think that one of the challenges I fully agree on why there would be a reason to go back to work and I think people are just frickin lazy Remote, I mean, oh my god. So many people is the thing that kills me if you're in a meeting room And remember the old days somebody we're gonna go a little bit over here Somebody be on a laptop in a meeting say hey close the laptop. No, whatever Because we're virtual then the people multi and you know multitasking during a meeting like I'm so frickin tired of repeating myself for someone because they couldn't be bothered to pay attention in It's ridiculous Anyway, I want to have a whole other thing about there. So they're like There I think bringing in Open space principles. Yep If you can't be bothered to pay attention to the meeting then why are you get the hell out like get the hell out unwritten rule There should be an unwritten rule Where like a socially charged rule where where people are like if you're not actively paying attention Yeah, get out get out. I think it's laziness Shouldn't have to kick you out. You should feel guilty and get out. I think people are lazy. Okay very quickly because then I got What's your predictions? I don't have any whatever I comment on yours podcast what exciting things are we looking forward to in 2025 All right. I did the last topic that one's you okay once again I'm every year I say I'm gonna I'm gonna get the it's like asking the hot girl out I'm that was I was really sexist If I'm so afraid to ask Nicole for his grin again, that sounds weird in context But I'm such a huge uber fan of Nicole for his grim that I've been afraid to ask her actually I don't know how to get a hold of her, but I really like to have her on the podcast at some point We gotta do that I feel like I committed to helping on that one. Yeah, that's right You have you have her email address right didn't she did can't you just like send her a message on on? I could I think I could teams are right now. Let me see I think we will have We're gonna have a lot like connecting with her Okay, not right now Well, we're gonna have an odd recording schedule in 2025 because I have vacations and weird stuff going on We'll probably talk more about that throughout the year and then that's all I got Those are my I don't have really much going on there We're gonna get to We're gonna get more people listening but more people wondering why the hell do we have a podcast when we just talk about nothing for an hour That's it. All right, Brit. Yep. Anything anything else before we go for the day? No, I can she's It's all right. It's nobody's looking at it's holiday year. Of course, of course, of course Alright, this has been episode 213 of the EBT testing podcast last episode of 2024 I hope everybody has a happy holiday. This will go out probably on Christmas Day. We'll see what happens. I am Alan I'm great and we'll see you next time
