Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey we're back yeah mostly anything else that comes to mind yeah and today's gonna be extra bad extra bad extra yeah those of you that aren't in the I don't even know where to start those of you that aren't in one of the three dot slack comm you can get an invitation by going to modern testing org if you are there you will have seen my post from a few weeks ago where I said Brent and I recorded no Brent and I met and talked about what could have been perhaps the best podcast ever done by anyone of all time and I didn't record I absolutely believe it was yeah it was I mean so now now everyone welcome to episode 2-0 redo 202.2 could I do that so yeah if you could imagine imagine like you've just listened to the most amazing podcast episode in the world ever and then double it and then double it again and that's what we had all or so we thought or yeah I mean you never know I mean we'll never know and that's the whole thing yeah it's it's great big bucket in the sky all right we have a male we when you brought up when you brought up how to actually solve world hunger overnight I mean that was amazing I know and I can't quite recreate it so one thing we did I wanted to re-mention from the last so we're not gonna rehash it I did write about it on anger weasel that sub stack comm I think but one thing I wanted to mention is oh because I guess it's worth worth calling out in a podcast because didn't get published last time after 200 and I also did it in 201 rather than take and do a full edit of getting through all of our good blas and Brent's coughing and this and that I decided I'm gonna try for a while to do far less editing and just fix fix the levels add a little bit of EQ try and make a sound good and then go from there and see how it goes and listeners let us know what you think you can you have many ways to do that the easiest is John our slack group go to modern testing org blah blah blah and we're gonna see how that works and then I spend a lot of time taking the ums out and after 10 years and 200 episodes maybe we can just stop saying that as much I don't know just a thought I died it's I'm old and in my habits I don't know if I can stop I put filler words in and today's worse and I'll tell you why in a minute but what do you think about that brain ready to go your cats here today the cat is dead Brent's cat is next to him in a little bed on the desk it's great but unfortunately the cat died I am NOT going to prove that she is not dead because if I do that or mention her name she will immediately start fine I can only and what I am seeing for listeners who don't not have video which is all of you what I am seeing is a cat that appears to be dead I'm still not I could either confirm or deny yeah she's been doing it all day I saw the cat move I saw the cat move the cat is no longer dead Schrodinger's cat is alive so hey man bread what's new what's going on oh my god oh what I did is it review season again what happened oh review season was was what's what's the Oh God this time you're stuck to the gajillion you're fine oh yeah if I could ever you know the problem with the stock being at a gajillion is you have to you know have time to go do something with it yeah so though it's review season and I'll just say in terms of this is the first time since Satya has taken over that I got an uncomfortable whiff of the bomber years and I'm like oh no those were the those and the aftermath of those were the death of me like I tell myself all the time look at the stock I go fast eat at Microsoft I'd be so much better off and I think oh yeah but I'd also be dead so it's hard so that's that's rough man who who did it and you want me to take him out so the latter part yes okay first first I don't know yet I'll make a phone call I got a guy the but it just to give you a hint like like the last two weeks on average been doing four to five hours of sleep because there's there's a there's a couple other things happening that have to happen at the same time as well and so thankfully the the the review season part of it is is over for now we got a three-day weekend and if my body clock lets me I am going to sleep all three FM days okay I will tell you a couple things I was gonna count them I couldn't I can't count past one one is I as I get older I have less and less tolerance for people who are jerks and people who I would say are people who act stupid your behavior comes from motivation when you act stupid because you're you're there's something about being a jerk in there but I I it there was a time of my life where I could let it roll off and for whatever I'm old get off my lawn whatever I just cannot handle when someone is a jerk with the exception of if someone has the jerk and they have some self-awareness about it but if they're just if that's who they that's who they think they need to be then fuck them the other thing is I was in New York the last as you know last couple weeks and I had a flight back last night supposed to get back and settle around 9 delay delay delay landed around 1 o'clock in the morning came home got four or five hours of sleep my body said get up Alan it's 10 a.m. on the East Coast so yeah lots of coffee lots of snarkiness throughout the day I have less patience when I'm tired and here we are and the thing is actually I'm going to careful listeners mark the date I'm going to say something nice about Brent oh boy shit it's I already feel weird never mind I'm not gonna do it no I I think we both can be the grumpy old men the stark you'll mean we can be pissed off but together we're better that for sure for sure yes because you know some good can come out of this you know it's it's the world is a crazy weird place and the and the world of work is full of people who do not actually understand how to get work done and you and I are gonna try and help people navigate through that hell I just thinking yeah grumpy old man is up is one of my better skills I mean it's it's up there with like occupying space all right we we got a thing we can I can kick off a conversation here if you're ready to get into the podcast proper yep and okay then well welcome back it's been a long break we were recovering from the episode the escapades of 200 but speaking of which we have a question so that that makes me so happy it does on one of the things we covered in the long lost episode from last time that we did not record was Brent noticing my joy in having all of my little audio toys to play with as we do the podcast and it's kind of do do stuff live every episodes live that's really what we're getting at really with me not editing as much everything's live everything's live coming soon to twitch you don't know what's happening you know what we could twitch we could we could the thing is if you look at the two of us we are made for podcasting for better for worse I mean yeah yeah like at times I think we should both just turn off our cameras oh yeah yeah but I wouldn't see the dead cat so on our slack group which I've already what's the word talked about a couple times there's another word there but I lost it Sean H has a question in our mailbag channel he says finally getting the episode 200 thank you for listening to episode 200 hopefully you didn't start at one and Alan's calm I don't remember saying this here to help my I do know what I want to talk about but and sorry for the editorial here but I don't remember exactly what Sean is talking about but you may remember but I kind of got the gist of it says an Alan's comment intrigued me on enterprise change do you think you could discuss in more depth your experience on how you managed enterprise level changes without people knowing I work at a big enterprise trying to improve quality mindsets and feel overwhelmed level of effort and potential will of those resisting so so we've done that yeah I have no idea what we talked about no me neither but I can actually answer the question anyway the fact that the fact that I have the memory retention of a small ant makes no difference makes no difference I can talk about this and I can answer this question and I can answer the crap out of this question oh well and the thing is like I was about to you know say the initial question again do you think you could discuss in more depth stop stop okay that's it can you think you could discuss in more depth dot dot dot for Alan the answer is yes and I've seen him do it all right and and on things he knows nothing about and quite well like he could pass the I don't know what's the Turing test for intelligence or knowledge I don't know I'm a bot yeah by the way the the caps of things are getting worse I hate them so this one's interesting timing wise because I just put together a talk kind of about this and I'm not giving anywhere externally and doing it for a friend for an internal audience and I will do it for your company for you know $10,000 whatever you need I got a pay some bills all right so but the second part is I mean I want to put his context in there because absolutely true since I work at a big enterprise and feel overwhelmed level of effort potential will of those resisting is because people are lazy and don't want to change yeah in general I mean you know this is the hard part it's organizational change so let me let me go into depth because this is what I love doing I love trying to change people who don't want to change and because they don't want to change for a multitude of reasons what are some of those reasons Brent Brent was writing wasn't making attention you ready why do people resist change the number one thing is because it's scary think ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding that's the absolute number one reason yeah it is and for and it's scary for different reasons they're fearful for different reasons maybe this change took my job away maybe this change will oh maybe this change will require me to learn new skills I'm afraid I won't be able to learn them which roughly is the equivalent of take my job away potentially it's just deferred maybe I won't be as important anymore I guess maybe there I'll take my job away or there's something a version of a version of that but keep going you're on yeah yeah so you can jump in here anytime you want I am extremely interruptible on this topic so there's a one of my books favorite books that I've mentioned a crap ton of times in general and on the podcast is a book called Leadership on the Line by Ronald Heffetz and some other authors whose names I forget and in that book he talks about the difference between adaptive versus technical challenges and technical challenges are the ones that are easy air quote easy they generally have pretty well-known solutions or like it's kind of stuff we encountered before if I need to go write a new menuing system and I've written a menuing system before I kind of have an idea I gotta fit it within the context or I want to write whatever oh I every once in all for fun so I can still feel irrelevant I go query some crap from github using their API I know how to do it I didn't know how to use GraphQL to reduce my request so I learned that but pretty pretty much a technical problem no can figure it out answers are on the internet I can piece of stuff together adaptive problems are where the fun stuff is this is the problems that you and I get to solve Brent it's it's complex and systemic issues they requires changes and attitudes behaviors and beliefs the solutions aren't clear we often have to start before we know what the solution looks like there are things like culture change you know adaptation and even just addressing resistance to change so in this book Heffetz I mean it's not like a blueprint and there are no blueprints but he gives some good ideas for helping people change stuff and what he says is that you will no matter what change you're trying to make you will be able to find allies but you have to look for no matter what change you're trying to make you will absolutely have resistors and you're gonna have some group in the middle who are kind of waiting to see what everybody else does and go along for the ride so how do you do that how do you how do you like let's say let's let's pick a modern testing principle give me a random number between one seven okay so oh we want to improve the quality culture of our team and this is actually well rolled because that's actually what the question was I should know I should I should have went directly to that one but oh well undone I basically basically when I quote unquote rolled I basically picked a number from what was remaining after I eliminated one five and seven because those are the only ones I still have memorized okay and and again there's no video but Brent actually made the hand motion of rolling a die which is pretty cool by the way when I was in New York I saw reason I couldn't record last week when my daughter and I went to a sort of a live D&D improv show oh fun it was hilarious it was hilarious lots of audience participation cool stuff going on was it was there like an audience was there like a DM and an audience member like actually rolling the dice or so there was a DM and it wasn't actually like a game it was a it was roleplay but there were points in the story where they had to we had to choose what they did or sometimes they had to roll and there were some great rules for critical feathers or successes they did a really good job having a scripted you know comedic show with some elements of improv in it so pretty pretty impressed nice so people with a problem heffetz find your allies yes good you know just just kind of walks through it you got to take a step back get to adapt assess you know just do a bunch of different crap lots of lots of listening you know and and communication anyway lots of tips in there what was it getting to no blueprint can't get there by yourself but you have to you know we talk about experimentation and software when you're trying to do organizational change you have to be even more experimentable more of an experimenter do you yeah so maybe let's say okay equality thing I want to get my devs to write all the automation if you're in a company you're trying to get devs to write unit tests I'm sorry hopefully they can get fired you can get better death let's say your let's say your devs are writing unit tests but you but as you're led by the research you want to get them to write all of the automation what we can say Brett before I go on well what I'm okay I'll just say it say it say it okay so number one this reminds me and I don't know if it'll end up being relevant this reminds me way back in the day you were still at Microsoft agile was struggling you you actually had you did a an event and you asked me to be one of the panelists yeah we have talked about this event before this was yeah this was a a monumental event in the evolution of Alan and Brent at Microsoft and in one of the questions because the so the panel that Alan had done was us was a small group of people who who claimed to successfully be using agile in in their business I want you to pause there I want to give some more context okay so I ran this community of quality leaders around the company and I got them together once a month I worked with these great TPMs I worked with it was a cross-company thing we got them together talking about a variety of subjects one of the things that's much better now at Microsoft even I'll admit that I found embarrassingly funny at the time was how maybe this is true at every company I don't know but then how a little Microsoft would pay attention or regard anything that happened outside the walls of Microsoft anything that wasn't happening at Microsoft may as well not have been happening so I tried to like bring things like here's the thing that maybe you've heard of that you want to know a little bit more about it because maybe you heard someone on the bus all excited about it things like that so agile was one of those so at that time which was years after agile had been around so I put together this panel as Brent had described right and I remember and so and this was this was a community of mostly testers and many of them knew me because I had been in the testing community for a while and when agile first came out I was on the same page as many of them had been at that point in time around oh my god agile is the most dysfunctional thing ever that has ever existed right and in some regards it was because a lot of dead teams took control and they just the other thing that you didn't mention is the dead teams that did go out and look at what other people were doing in this space had decided that agile was an a la carte menu right yeah let's just I think agile says don't do documentation we won't do that and we'll do whatever else we want it'll be great right right we are now agile god yeah right in to which Alan invented a whole new term fragile which to this day I still love and still yeah sadly observe fucking ridiculous agile the now going back to the one of the things that I remember for that to make it so that it's not a complete freaking tangent is too late one of the questions one of the questions is like okay how do we get people to do it and in essence I remember my answer which was look if you go to your executives right at that point in time agile was on the leading edge of the bubble but at least within Microsoft I mean it really wasn't but within Microsoft correct as a whole it was like in that in that phase where only you know people who aren't afraid of risk it was early adopterville at Microsoft and and and people were like going to their executive and say look internet says agile is the best thing we should do it and you look back and I'm like okay you went to your executive and I'm sure you're paraphrasing but you went to your executive and said we should do this because you found a web page that said it's wonderful and we should do it and you're surprised that they told you no shocked I'm shocked like well what's funny is this complete tangent has somehow wound its way back to the trail yeah I was taking the scenic route no that was great so if I hand you the quality culture quality transition culture guide yep English Alan whatever that thing is we made that shows like how to grow is a quality if I just hand that to you this is great go do it people look at that and go um yeah great thanks Alan and the foul it away making those things change is hard and and again going back to what Shawn said browser overwhelmed with the level of effort and potential will of those resisting and yeah it's a ton of effort which is why you do a little bit at a time that whole concept of 1% better every day works really well here so if it's getting devs to own more tests it's do it a little don't say like this week you do integration tests next week we do end-to-end after that you own it all no it's not gonna go that fast you have to this is a line from leadership on the line you have to disappoint people at a level they can absorb I have I have more I can add to that fire as well and men so what you have to do I mean and the problem is that level they can absorb is different for everyone those who are on like yeah let's do something different you can they're disappointed of a little higher you can give them a little bit more let's let's use you to walk the talk show me the example you're my pilot group you're gonna try new things I'm gonna give you end-to-end automation framework and you're gonna use that and we'll have that as an example for when the other folks catch up these guys at the other end said great it's okay your unit tests are great why don't we pair one day a week on writing some integration tests and and we can get a shared understanding of what those mean and get a little bit done you have to if you aim too high you're going to be disappointed here cuz it's gonna be that's what it gets hard it's it's never easy but it's easier if you target what you want to do based on the capabilities and willingness of those people you're trying to move but you have to go a little at a time brant you look very anxious to say something I have a long set of things to say so I will I will mute and let you go okay so number one so you mentioned this book for me the primary books that I learned from and then applied and then tweaked for this for those who care first and foremost is influencers influencers is is a whole series around how to think about how to execute the change and I'll go into some level of detail and explain how it fits in even with Alan's paradigm the next one is getting to yes which is a negotiation book because a lot of the times it's it's around when when Alan was talking about okay you're fighting against the jerk well there there are techniques you can do to to change their argument in a way that then opens the door and the third one is never split the difference which is another negotiation book but unlike getting to yes getting to yes is sort of an IQ version of negotiation where never split the difference brings in EQ which is often even more important right if you can have a pure logical conversation that's great you're probably negotiating with chat GPT which by the way is just an AI it's gonna be easy for you to win that battle now when I go through trying to institute a change one of the first things I will tell you is every successful change involves changing something slightly in all three of people process and technology people are gonna need to get trained technology is probably going to need to change or written and then a streamlined process that that bridges the two between these like if you create a whole new tech and no one knows how to use it guess what they're gonna fall back to the old stuff now the thing I like about the influencer stuff is they will break things down into a six quadrant problem space and for me I'm highly analytical time my mathematical brain got stuck six quadrants so imagine a two by three table with things that you quadrants are fours okay I get you two by three go on it's six except I don't know what that one is I don't know if it was 24 of them or I had to the math too many numbers it's now important so I'm typing so while you're typing Brent's books are a little more mainstream than mine. I go a little bit off the beaten road, but I made a little face on influencers. It's, it's, I, it's good. It's kind of, and not from my it's fine. Getting to yes is fine. Both valuable. It's kind of like reading for those of you that have read them. Those two books from Brent are like the DaVinci code, the mainstream serpii thing, if you want to read something a little deeper, a little more meaning out of it, you can read Focal Spindle. All right, bread. What'd you find out? I'm still waiting for, are you asking chat GPT? I am. Yeah. It can't count either, man. It's going to make something up. It's cause it a hexagon, but I'm like, no, it's not stupid. It's going to make, we know it's stupid. It can't, it's not a thing. It's good at when you know this, you know better, Brent. I'm just going to go with fuck you, Alan. It's six quadrants. Um, that answer is fair and we're going to take that answer. That answer is fair. I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, okay. All right. Now when I go and analyze this, like number one is yeah, it's convincing executives is absolutely possible. Like I, I now do it all the time because I have worked with them enough to know what it is that, that kind of drives them. What kind of the kind of decisions I think, you know, my experience a lot, maybe it's cause of I've grown as well, but my experience the last many years is executives aren't the hard sell. No, it's, it's, it's their directs. And, and, and then I do not believe, I do not believe change other than culture change. Change through executive mandate does not work or it works in a very bad way. No. So the executive, um, I know, I know that is where you were going, but I wanted to be clear on that you need to, it's a, it's a, it's a people thing. And, and you met, and as if you mentioned too, but most executives that I know of will not say yes, they'll defer. Yes. If executives say anything, they'll say no. Right. And if they say no, it's dead. So, um, now there's a bottoms up approach. A lot of people try to do the top down approach and that's kind of what you're talking about. Oh, if I can go to God and get him to add the 11th commandment, then my problem will just be solved. Um, it isn't now, uh, going back to the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, uh, USC Research organs. The odd aspects of the . So it's a two by three that you can think about, and you can think about these separately. The first one I'm going to go with the to the very first set of problems is okay. What's stopping them from making this change? Is it motivation or ability, and that is an important thing, right? know how and that's why they're telling you know versus um or they even perceive it to be hard which is usually code language for I don't know how right versus motivation which is I don't want to if I go down this path then I'm testing my own code instead of having and sometimes it's a little of both or a lot of both right it is and it um and if you go through and think about them all and come up with a strategy that addresses all of them um you have a pretty good chance in here I mean all six quadrants um here you have a pretty good chance of succeeding in my experience the other thing that you want to do so now the three uh that I was talking to it's a two by three so motivation ability but now the the the cross grid thing rose right it's all right the person that you're trying to or persons that you're trying to to influence right what's their personal motivation or a bit of ability that blocks this right um there is science that shows that if you if you can propose something that that hits their personal intrinsic motivations you have a much greater chance of getting them to do it right or certainly you want to avoid their intrinsic um the allergies right then there's social pressure and then there's structural but in structural um social pressure is like use peer pressure to your advantage right um hey if you can let's say you're on a team with with three other sister teams and and your manager wants something done right but one team just doesn't want to do it well if you get the other three and then start changing the conversation around have we're all great except without mentioning names one whole team seems to be slowing us down right no one likes to be left out um structural is um structural changes or more things like just reminder notes sometimes that's how people need like a sticker that says place the boxes here or um or static analysis tools that say hey are you sure you want to maybe not static analysis i don't know what what it used to be called big red button is what office uses a tool that says hey um you're trying to push a pr and it doesn't look like your unit test ramp are you sure right um that sounds like clippy for ci yeah yeah yeah um so what i have found now when we're talking about social pressures and then you started hinting to this you do want to um i have found that if you if you start from the bottom for for things like mtp or in in this case we talked earlier about agile right you want to look around and say you want to gather allies is what allen said okay but in particular there's this just fantastic term for the type of ally you want okay and that is the opinion leader this is the person who if you could win them over they're going to they're going to be a public ally for you this is one of those people that when allen mentioned you know the one set of people are the ones that just doesn't care see who wins and they just follow that you know the the that shepherd you want to look for the shepherds and specifically target them and go and figure out what holds them back um how you can help uh and get them to a point where they're open-minded and might be and willing to try a few things out um now of course the trick is with that one is what you ask them to do you really got to set it up to succeed so that they have a continuous experience of something positive if you say oh go read the agile manifesto or go read i don't know what's the agile manifesto for mtp i don't think there is one there isn't well maybe it is mtp don't have a manifesto so um thank you for making most of the points i was going to make so this is good good everything it's right and the way i put some of those things just to reiterate is uh i talked about allies and the thing talked about i like the way you said let me say i even wrote it down so i could remember that's weird right it's weird on day uh it's people processing technology making sure it's one or a combination of those not what you said that's my takeaway and i focus a lot on the people side because that's the harder part but you do have to balance it and it reminds me of the times like what's the best way to get devs to make sure they're writing unit tests and putting them in ci or or sorry i'll what you just talking about what's the best way to make sure that fred the dev is running unit tests for hxn you make it automatic or so brain dead easy it's harder to not do it you make it brain dead easy um like from my experience there's two things that you do number one you make it brain dead easy for them to do it number two in the case they don't um you reduce the friction between what they did and it going to prod and you hold them accountable for what's in prod and again right and it happens all the time so we uh many many years ago many years ago 2001 or so uh i worked with our development team on windows ce to help them learn to write unit tests and they asked the questions you'd expect of a developer at microsoft in 2001 they asked me things like if we're going to write unit tests for all of our code what is the test team going to do oh you know what you know what that reminded me of what wait wait you know what that would hold your thought that just reminded me of i had i hadn't thought about this in years and we didn't bring it up at 200 what to date is still my view our second worst podcast ever i only know our first worst what's our second worst the one where we thought it would be a good idea to do a podcast and a presentation oh that didn't work yeah yeah yeah they didn't like us giving each other crap in the middle so whatever you know maybe now we can get away with that people know us better that was like in the 20s or 30s we couldn't get away with it but that was one of the questions that was asked okay if you remember i don't remember dude i don't remember what we talked about two weeks ago so anyway unit tests windows ce uh if i think you worked on windows ce a bit we didn't overlap but um doesn't it through windows phone it doesn't matter we had a the names don't matter all of our tests were contained in libraries dlls on windows and run by an executable that could go uh find the test cases inside the dll and run them uh pretty cool pretty common way of doing it what uh so what i did was i because i wrote a little wrapper application that could look it would go through the functions in your code and create stub unit tests for all of them and i just stumbled across the source code for a while back it's it's brute force dumb but it works so you want to write unit tests run this thing but all you have to do is fill in the crap make it easy to get started then they can expand from there you can pair with them coach etc etc find ways to make it easy to do i wrote a little bit ago about a ci system uh we wrote for that team before we knew what ci was just made it easy for people to do the things they were supposed to do i was on another product once where we wrote a test that would run in the background as you changed code and that's kind of what i mean if you look at what co-pilot does today it kind of looks at your code gives you some ideas you could see that expanding and doing static analysis and other things in the background helping you fix your code maybe even and this probably somebody's probably written this somewhere but i'm going to go ahead and imagine it hasn't for a minute so bear with me an a generative ai could as i'm writing code uh not only give me suggestions as co-pilot does uh search through a bunch of different static analysis tools and find potential errors for me and flag them and create unit tests for my code and run them in the background on my code and let me know if i was writing buggy code as i'm writing it probably somebody's probably already written that not a big deal it's free Jason probably has but anyway we talked about pilot uh i think a couple things you didn't mention is once you get those allies you collect that data you can tell a story you can you can you can use that because sometimes those people who are lagging they just want the data to show sometimes they'll ignore it what's really good is peer pressure so and and the way i do peer pressure is probably at least two ways i'm counting on my fingers you can't see them but one is just to celebrate the behavior you want to see um team x uh wrote a full suite of end-to-end tests they're running and monitoring they run within 20 minutes they're running on every build is great call it out for the team they go oh wow people often people people are going to tell me i'm wrong that just being recognized for doing something is a lot more than you know giving him a gift card or or sending him out to dinner giving him uh whatever people like recognition depending on culture you may not so use peer pressure there um gamify give people badges i'm i want i want to give people badges in github for for doing the right thing i'm just i'm just gonna ask like has my i was still at microsoft i would wonder can we get all of microsoft code into github because everything's so silent you're not telling me don't don't tell me any secrets or anything be kind of cool but i want badges so number one i don't think it all is but honestly the where it isn't i'm not certain anyone really cares yeah yeah because at the time when i left git was all in uh i'm gonna call it visual studio team system and not azure devops that's a dumbass name so anyway badges uh are a great way people go to somebody's report check out their code to see look at all the badges you guys you guys are the shit um yeah and i guess it was just two things so celebrate the behaviors you want to see gamify and or find any other way you can use peer pressure you can because that'll make it'll make a difference lots of little things you know you just inspired an idea i'm like oh hey no no because i was thinking you know if um i don't badges sure but to me badges are are honestly they feel childish but you know what that doesn't feel childish to me that's essentially the same thing is achievements yeah yeah yeah yeah and i'm like you know what it wouldn't take much like ado probably wouldn't wouldn't agree to integrate it but it wouldn't because all of their stuff um all of the ado stuff that we use at microsoft is available in in public databases i mean there's nothing stopping me from inventing my own shell and you can and you could allow people with your teams with a high gamer score they're allowed to check in on friday i i i mean putting their shit into an i-frame is like the easiest thing on the planet i'm like huh that's an idea now of course the problem is i have to have time to do things like that and exactly exactly hey um we have we have covered a lot of stuff and uh we could probably keep on talking for another hour on this but if you have more questions you can shove them in the mailbag channel but i i kind of think we should wrap it up there is everything you but after this one last code a bit that brent wants to mention we can we can no i was just thinking through okay so and uh what we really did is answered you know we answered their question at a strategic level like we listed off a number of strategies around doing this right um uh order of ignorance number four they didn't they didn't have one we gave them like a method we're giving them a means to discover what they don't know they don't know is there anything technical right in like the way they they said enterprise level change so that to me invokes i think they're talking about things like are in the quality culture transition guide so not really they may need a testing frame i mean no not really no okay it's people and knowledge people and knowledge it's not as good as the real 202 but i think we did a good job you know it's it's it's a start back it's a start and you know what if it's not if you hated the whole thing and you're still well one if you're still listening um it doesn't make any difference we don't have any ads yet at least so nobody got paid and you paid zero except for your time with this podcast if it sucks you know what your loss but given that let me pause and mention that we are on audible.com and if you really don't get we are but i i mean i don't i bet alan doesn't even remember the code brent you are you are a horrible at a bad joke so um all right so let's call that a day he is brent i am and i'm not we'll see you later bye
