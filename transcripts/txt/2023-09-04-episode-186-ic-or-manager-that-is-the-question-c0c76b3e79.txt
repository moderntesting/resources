So it depends on which challenge you want. They're both hard. They're both fulfilling. It really depends on which challenge you want, given the context of the team and the product. Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile and anything else that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hey, everyone. I'm Angry Weasel. And I'm Colonel Stinky Bottom. To the Weasel and Bottom podcast. Weasel and Stinky podcast. Oh, I should get stinky weasel dot com. Oh, yeah. So the reason I bring that up and you can go to angry weasel dot com and see the history behind Angry Weasel. When we're logged into Zencaster, which is working for now, we have to put in a username and mine is I logged in as Angry Weasel and Brent logged in while he cleans his room while I talk as Colonel Stinky Bottom. So could you, um, the story of Angry Weasel is well known on the internet. Could you please tell the internet, the story of Colonel Stinky Bottom? Actually, it came from my roommate in college. He and I played a game and he actually went by general Stinky Bottom. And I thought that was the funniest game playing handle. So college kids do dumb things. And I can tell you because my daughter is gone, left the state, practically left the country. She has moved into her dorm. So far, she hasn't done dumb things, but I'm going to say it's inevitable. That just started, right? Yeah, yeah. She starts school on the sixth. She was able to move in a day early. So she moved in yesterday, but she's kind of getting unpacked. And I don't know where she's going to fit all her crap because as I told you, not only is she moving out, we're boarding up this house and getting out of it. So she's like, everything gone. No, the fact that I'm in a weird audio config today, it's essentially, I'm hearing myself, but sometimes I'm like a three to five second delay. Oh, well, you're going to have to figure that out. Milliseconds. Both are annoying. Yeah. Brent has like one speaker that's working on one computer and one microphone working on the other computer. It's confusing. And somehow Zencaster is handling it. This is our last podcast from from this room. I am moving on the 11th. And then after that, I'm on the 14th. I'm going to leave and go do the Wonderland Trail. So we'll figure it out. We'll figure out. Maybe we'll do one next week. I don't know what's going on. It's the A.B. Testing podcast. You haven't figured it out. My AKA angry weasel Allen and he is AKA Colonel Stinky Bottom Brent. And we're going to do a podcast where we talk about random stuff and hope that we make sense to at least one of our three listeners. So like a plan to you, Brent. It does. All right. I have the first topic. You do. I do. You do. It's now Brent topic one. Go. Okay. Do you know what this is? That is a box. It is a box. It is an X box. I don't know which camera it's an X box, man. It is a box with an X box. Correct. In a box and Xbox X. I have an Xbox X. Do you? I do. I do, too. Yeah, I got one in a while back. A little while because because Starfield that came out. Yesterday. Oh, it did just for the pre-release. Right. For everyone. Yes. But if you are an ultimate game, I am, I am, but I have a problem. And you bought the premium upgrade and you have one of these and you were a friend of mine. You can call me last night and tell me how awesome the game is. All right. I can't. I can't. So we have my daughter left, but we do have two teenagers living in our house right now, long story, and they're living in the room with the Xbox. So I have it. I'm not able to play the Xbox for just a little bit longer. Move the next box. I got to pack my freaking house. I'm going to get to it. I'm going to get to Starfield about a month after you. So you can ask me. So it better live up to one half of the hype. So that's all I can say. If it is half as good as being hyped, I'll be happy. But I'm worried. I'm actually worried that the amount of hype makes me think it's going to suck and nothing would make me sadder. It's advertised as made by the Alan makers of Alan's two favorite games of all time. Fallout 4 and Skyrim. I was like, yes, yes. Give me, give me, give me. If it sucks, I am going to go off. There's no way there is. Did you play Fallout 76? There's a way I did. And I did twice. And I will tell you the first time it does suck it. But the second time I've completed all of the missions. I was amused by the game. But now I'm just sort of wandering around upgrading my house. Like, all right, cool. I'm not as much into the crafting part. So I like to fall out for. Hey, so should we talk about our mailbag questions or other stuff we got to discuss? What's going on, man? What's the plan? Do we have a plan? Yeah, let's do the agenda. Let's go. We got two mailbag questions. Mailbag. And the question is, it's from Aaron. Aaron Flynn, thank you for being one of the three in our Slack group. And if you would like to be one of the three, you can go to modern testing. Org and find the link to join our Slack group. And if the link doesn't work, you can send me an email. The address is on there and you can get me to fix it, which I just did this week. All right. But Aaron asks, I'm interested in the circumstances or reasons people made a transition from I see to non I see roles. I see being individual contributor, a non I see, a K.A. a manager. What makes you go back and forth? This is editorial comment. He didn't write this. He's better at English than I am. What are reasons for going back and forth between being a manager and a non manager? What made you do it? When do you encourage people you manage? Since I read the question, I'm going to let you I have a I just want to keep on talking for like 20 minutes on this, but I think it would be better if we got your insights first, Mr. Stinky Bottom. Do we think that's the question he meant to ask? When do you encourage people you manage? Well, I'm going to switch it like, well, it is about like I'm going to talk about that, like when people should when I encourage people on my team to become managers or not. But I want to tell my stories about going back and forth. Oh, do you think that's what it was? Because I'm reading it literally. When do you encourage the people you're a manager like all the time? No, no, no. It's about making the switch. How do you coach people on when to do it? How do you choose when to do it? And even if that's not the question, this is the question we're going to answer because this is the better question. Okay. I have always been promoted to manager literally every job I've had, even including when I started at 16 and Carl's Junior flipping burgers. For me, it's the work ethic that kind of always brings me there. Managers. Because I see don't work hard or have a good work ethic. I'm going to let you finish. No, but I have some comments. They do. It's just I've always been in a position where I was in the upper runs as an IC. Right. It's like I'm here to do the right thing, make customers happy, etc. Try to bounce stuff on your desk while you're talking because I can't edit that out. I believe you're selling yourself short. Please continue. Think you bottom. I was always someone who is striving towards perfection as in terms of how I was being judged. It since has been revealed to me through my counselor. This is this is one of the aspects of how I grew up. And that's all the detail. I'm going to go on the podcast, but not great. So what you're saying is your environment growing up has led you to wanting to be and being more comfortable in managerial roles. We'll do that. You will do that. Okay. Summarize. It's one of my powers. When I look at my strengths, we've talked about strength finders stuff on here. Right. I'm really good at seeing what makes each individual really special and helping them to carve the Michelangelo out of their own marble columns. Cool. Early on, it was just because sometime around 20 years ago, what I was about five years into my career, there's a bit of wisdom that I realized as a manager, no one's ever going to remember the projects we worked on and what we shipped the tech, although that's not entirely true, unexpectedly. Perseus, as we've talked about before, is still in use. And surprisingly, that thing we built in 1996. How you how you treat your employees, the employees that love you and the ones that hate you, they're going to remember you forever. And I think about that legacy and I'm kind of blending into the second question. Well, let's not get there because I had a whole bunch of rebuttal and questions for you for our first question. Sure. Are you ready for me? Yes. So I want to go all the way back to one thing you said and be very clear on it. Yes. And that thing is you mentioned being promoted into management, which I don't like that terminology because it's not a promotion. I'm sure at some companies when you move into management, you absolutely did. And I will now elevate the volume on you saying that and editing because I can. I have always been promoted to manager, been promoted, been promoted, been promoted. It is a career change. It's a different job moved into management. Yes. So let me tell you a little bit about what I've done. I have gone my entire career bouncing between an IC and a manager and for a reason and for good reasons every time I talk about those. One thing really cool is on our Slack group merit has done the same thing. She has bounced back and forth between being an IC and being a manager. Some of its contextual and not everybody can do that. But let me talk about my reasons and see if they help Aaron at all and understanding. So I started at Microsoft as an IC 95. Here's how I became a manager at Microsoft for the first time. I was working on Windows and it was a I call Windows ME Windows marketing edition because it was really about having a ship vehicle for a whole bunch of applications. So it was a small team and they kind of just put something together. Pretty small team doing an OS. We did some I don't want to go into all the details what we did, but I was working on debugging the nightly stress runs working on the kernel and working on enhancing and debugging the debug version of Windows and I was underwater like one of the only times in my life I've gone to my manager said I'm having a hard time getting all this done. There's lots of context switching cognitive load and he says, hey, I think we have a new hire starting next week. Let's have them work for you. And I said great. I have someone to delegate crap to and so I had a direct report. And he came in. He's so funny. I won't call Yawn out by name shit, but he overslept his first day and showed up around noon. It was hilarious. This is what he felt so horrible. But it was so funny. I didn't care. Anyway, Yawn helped me out a lot and they ended up sliding a few more people into my org for for consistency, the people who ran stress, etc. So I had a small org after that piece of crap shipped. I worked over on Windows CE where they grew a larger team around me because I knew a lot how Colonel and drivers work. They put all the testers Estet's in charge of tool development, driver development, kernel development, all of my org. The name of graphics over and before I knew it, I had this team of about 50 people. I was very much and here's probably where I made my first mistake. My learning as a manager. I had crappy mentoring as a manager. I think Microsoft didn't really care as much about managing people just having people on teams at the time and I was so hands-off today. My philosophy is give people a framework they can work in and then get out of their way. I didn't really give my team a framework. Fortunately, I had a lot of really good performers on the team and the team got a lot of crap done. But then I just didn't like it at the time. Part of it was I thought the whole I mentioned just mentioned a minute ago at a team that was performing really well, but we had the whole stack ranking thing going on which I thought was dumb and I have to go into these meetings twice a year and go here's my lowest performer. Here's what they're doing. Tell me I'm going to give them a 2.5. So yeah, we'll do the hand wave and we'll figure something out. Maybe they get to three. I said bullshit. So I just didn't like the way Microsoft made you manage people about the same time. Thoma invented this test architect role and my manager said well, you should be a test architect. I said, okay. I don't know what that is. And so I jettisoned everyone except for the tool development team at first and eventually jettisoned everyone else back to an IC. So I turned to that time. It's sort of the IC that's the right hand person if whoever is in charge of stuff and I love that role. I have someone who works for me in that role now and it's great. I love doing that. I did that. I went over to the engine XO thing and whatever and did that for a link. I left there. I went over and did that for Xbox. I worked as a IC reporting to our whatever Chris was director. He wasn't a VP. He was a partner director, but I just figured out what needed to get done and did it. I've always enjoyed influencing without authority and helping people. I've never had a problem with that. I have no problem having an opinion and helping people get stuff done and I did not like how Microsoft wanted managers to behave. I had studied enough at that point about management. I got into studying management a lot when I argued with our learning and development team over the differences between leadership and management. I said a lot of things you're teaching managers are good for people in leadership positions. So their answer to that was to send me to a bunch of our management training. And so I learned a lot there. This is where I started reading so many damn books about leadership and management. I stuck with an IC when I joined Chris's team on Xbox. I was offered a role of running the tools team for Xbox and I said that noise because not only did I not really want to be a manager at Microsoft, but I had been around a long enough to know that folks who worked on internal tools got shafted in reviews across the board. So there's just no way I said, you know what put me in charge of it. Don't give me any direct reports. We're going to run the whole damn thing like a virtual team open source and and we did and I wrote more code in those two years. Like my joke always is my two years on Xbox one were the best five years of my career and weed and a bunch of that stuff still being used as well. Not like famous like the Perseus test case management system after Xbox one shipped. I worked on that stupid science project for a while still as an IC doing whatever I wanted. I went over to teams as an IC at first and then eventually grew a team around me and that's where those things were a little better than the Satya effect was coming around and it was a little easier to be a manager. They weren't making us do dumb things. I found with all my experience influence that authority and with like the things we talked about on the podcast and studying agile and agile leadership. I felt pretty good about it. I enjoyed management. In fact, I think I remember at the time we're around then talking to you and go hey man, should I go back into a management role? And you're so in your hell. Yeah, you do it. You may not remember that I do know I do. I totally remember it and and probably over over lunch at that Vietnamese place, but or somewhere. Anyway, no, no, no, I do remember it because it was also the same time we went to I went to Din Tai Fung for the first time and like everything about like Din Tai Fung friggin fantastic. Oh, no doubt. And that was my first time and I remember everything about that. I if I knew the Japanese names, I think I could tell you what you ate let alone what I ate. Yeah, Din Tai Fung is Chinese. Yes, I know. I realize that I was dumbass again. Yeah, I remember that and I also remember you were like the team you were leaving was not great. Much of what you were saying kind of resonates like one of the things I realized as you were talking about you switching back before between a manager and an IC is kind of what I do between M1 and M2. I often get pushed into M2 is kind of kind of what I think is on track right now in my job. And what's interesting is I love that I have grown to love that M2 role. Why how to teach me? I immediately miss being useful. I get a lot out of helping leaders become better leaders. It's really motivating for me in the five levels of leadership by Maxwell. He talks about and I love this the levels in the book. Some of the book is a little weird but talks about you're putting a position of leadership and then people give you permission to lead them as a gift to build trust on that team. But eventually your job is to build more leaders in the org and I like that. I do not want to manage the details of what my team is doing. I very much want to help go back to Legione. I'm a galvanizer and a discerner. I'm going to help them figure out what is the right thing to work on? What is the direction? Let me put a nice framework around what you need to get done and then let you ride your bike and I'll watch from the edge of the cul-de-sac and see how you do. You can ask me for questions, but I really like helping people become better leaders. I'm a very good leader in the business. It is what I will do for the rest of my career. I'm managing a much smaller team at NBC that did a previous job, but I'm still managing a group of leaders. I have my right hand I see and three other director plus level folks and my job is to give them a framework where they can be successful and coach them. I just went through the just very quickly the five levels of leadership. I got to imagine this is something you talked about before but I'm looking at it now and I'm like, I don't remember ever thinking the thoughts I'm currently thinking. Right. These five levels is fantastic. I wonder does the book go through and and argue why that's the leveling very much so. Okay, Amazon.com. Yeah, so let me go ahead and finish my story because I kept on bouncing around. I went to unity as a manager direct and as we discussed on here and as I've done many times in my career, I worked myself out of a job. I got to a point where I had moved all of my team into either quality coach roles into Dev roles into DevOps roles platform engineering whatever you want to call them and all of a sudden I was an IC without a team. So I went over if you recall and worked as an IC on our ad system running program management, which was a good learning experience for me and I learned a whole crap ton about delivery in just having an opinion there moving forward that I still apply when I went back to leadership. So I I am comfortable but I am comfortable being an IC who tries to influence hundreds or thousands of employees as I am leading a team of 50 100 200 500. I am beyond the point in my career where writing code all day is going to be my job or even where writing code half the day is going to be my job. I miss it, but I'm just not as good at it as my employees are but I feel like I am I enjoy it and I feel like I do a good job influencing and leading large numbers of people with a M and IC or a manager. So will you comment on that? I'm gonna go back to the whole like how do I make that choice? I'm thinking yeah, you're right on for me. I know I and I'm wondering if that's one of the if that's my next thing right now, right? Similar to you your career since you and I've met you've kind of changed what you do and how you're doing it every two to three years if not faster, right? I used to argue through on that but you're exactly right. You did and then I think I don't know. I feel like I may have pointed out the pattern because I remember one time you did try to argue with me and I'm like dude, I know I take it back. I was wrong. I'm like it's on fucking LinkedIn. Let's go look right now. Yeah, I'm thinking I really still get a lot of joy. It's not so much of the coding stuff as much anymore. I'm spending a lot more time focus on teaching my my employees. It's almost out of self-defense. I run a team of data scientists and very very clearly the trend is that a science is going to be a specialization in death. It's it's absolutely clearly a trend in my mind that's ever increasing and so I'm like, okay, these guys got a code and I don't think a single person other than me on my team really has a good sense for example of design patterns or TDD or any of these sort of modern development principles. That's not true. Actually, I have two people one has a one was trained collegiately as a CS right up to Masters, but the other one has has industry. I mean your story makes sense. Do we use that you have more things to go? Oh, I think that was I just saw how I make the choices. You know, I don't think I'm going back to being an IC and it really if I go back to the points where I've made that choice, it's taking the opportunities where I thought I could learn the most and being a manager isn't for everyone. In fact, one of the things I do I did this at Unity. I'm doing it right now in my current job is when someone wants to be a lead like someone thinks I'm thinking of going into management and in my head first off a conversation with them and I'll explain to him that's a career change and by the way Camille Fornier's book called The Manager's Path excellent walkthrough on how like she's really thought through this. I think it's an excellent book. I'm a big fan of hers, but I have a conversation with them first to figure out like this is a career change is different. It's not a promotion. It's not easier. It's just different. It's a different job and if they tell me yeah, I want to try it. I make them a provisional lead which means that they I don't move the people over but they act like the lead of the team and they and they function as the manager. I treat them as a manager. They're invited to my leadership meetings and I like to do that for about three months and what happens in that time is they figure out if management's for them and I will tell you 25% of the time maybe a little less 20 to 25% of the time people have gone through those three months and said you know what this was fun, but I'd like to go back to being in I see and because it is a dip. It's a career change and I want to give people the opportunity to try it in a safe environment. And if it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. No, no feelings lost. They got a chance to do it in a safe environment. Lesson learned. How did you bootstrap that that sort of process within your team like the first time. Hey, this person is going to be an active manager without any reports like how do they learn how to manage in that regard? Well, I talk about with the team about what the provisional lead role is like. I say I explain this is anything I explained to you to the team. When we have opportunities for someone to move into a lead position and someone's interested. I explained that will put them in this provisional role. I explain what it means. It means they're going to manage the team. We're not going to we're not going to make the HR changes, but we're going to have them manage the team for around three months. I like from two both sides to try before you buy it's a very safe way to do that. I don't know how it is. I know since the big flattening at Microsoft is all these people that were had been leads forever. All of a sudden weren't leads and when I would open a lead position, I would get 10,000 internal applicants for that position, but I had an opposite challenge on my previous team where I don't know enough yet about the current team where people did not want to be leads. They thought that seems hard. I don't want to do that versus all that seems easy. I want to do that, but I want to give them the opportunity to do it in a way. That's not scary. I just talk about it. I socialize it. I like that strategy in some regards. I'm kind of doing this more informally with with my team. I have two IC level principles on my team and I really want them to understand business leadership in my organization is something that I believe for a very long time. I do know my senior VP agrees with me on this principle level. I sees they need to be more owning a small part of the whole business like they own the KPI. They got to move. They own the strategy to get there. They own that business and it's a real struggle for people going from senior to to principle right because they what do you mean? What got me here isn't going to get me there. Did you have a difficulty making that shift? I know I did. I said at 64 for I think seven years because I was just like and then I realized I went and actually talked to the right set of people and they're like there's no such thing as as a level 60 at that point a level 65 test architect. That was sort of what they were saying. Now, I know that got to be true, but they're like they may have that title, but they're a business owner. They're not just the next level up test architect type book and for non-Microsoft people that's sort of that where the principle level begins the principle engineer. Yeah, it was really hard at that time. I think it's important to a lot at that level. It's important to align yourself with a manager who understands what should come out of that role. I think it's important as a principal engineer 65 plus for Microsoft folks to have an opinion that matters that you can sell. I guess the big difference like at 64 you could just crank out really good work all day, but at 65 plus you're expected to be an influencer and and help drive big things and get them done, which I enjoyed so I probably I must have been I don't really remember when I got promoted 65. I know I think I was still in Windows CE. I was because I think I made it to 66 in Windows CE the mid-principal level and eventually got to 67 when I worked in engineering excellence. The short answer is and we're not going to get to the second mailbag question, but the short answer is to I see your manager is I would say understand that it's a career change and be in the place where you can both learn the most and have the most impact and I honestly be engaged the most I wouldn't take a manager position just to take a manager position if I didn't want to do it. If I didn't care about growing people and increasing engagement to me, I think the most important thing a manager can do is drive engagement for their team, which means building a healthy org, which means autonomy mastery and purpose make sure people understand that they're what they're doing and why it's important have the skills in order to do that and the autonomy in the framework they can work in and then get their work done as a manager. You want to build that culture for your team to be successful. This is true for a line manager as well as a manager and managers take that management role. If you want to not have the burden of that and get a bunch of stuff done that impacts maybe even a larger part of the orgs, I think those high-level ICS can often or I think 65 plus going back to principal engineers. They're having influence not only in their manager's org, but in their manager's peers organization. So it depends on which challenge you want. They're both hard. They're both fulfilling. It really depends on which challenge you want given the context of the team in the product completely. I mean, I think the trick is take on the one that's more important and then train up your people and have them help you shoulder the burden on the other. Yes. Work yourself out of a job. Yes. We've said that mission repeatedly on the cast and I will say it is still the right thing. Absolutely. And did you see my my sub stack post like two weeks ago? What was the title? I don't know some Taylor Swift song. I read something recently. I don't know if it's the one. Why don't you make the it was a real story about us talking to someone who were talking to their husband and their husband said they couldn't take a vacation because their team needed them. Oh, I did read that one. And that's a true story that made me think so much like that is absolutely wrong. So every manager I've ever worked for I've all I've taken a bit of their style and made it part of my own right. The bad managers like the thing I took it from the from their style is like, yeah, I am never going to do that. But there was one manager that told me early on in my career that at Microsoft there is never a good time to take a vacation. Therefore any time is just as good. I think that's true for any job. Yeah. And we need to learn from Europe. I don't care what's going on. I'm gone for four weeks. I don't know if that's we need to learn. It's tough for Merk tough for Americans. No. So one of the issues one of the issues that contradicts that which is there's still like at Microsoft and I don't know how how wide it is. There's still this sort of emphasis around specialists. Hey Alan, what's your project right. And I'm like yeah I don't want Alan to own a project and I certainly do not want my manager talking to him about the project he owns because that contradicts the T shape people I'm trying to build in this organization. But with that with that sort of ownership model it has a we've talked about this a million times. Right. A specialist is on this podcast is known as what a bottleneck. Right. Right. And you know what you may not actually your team may not actually need you or may actually need you if you're a manager I'm going to just straight up tell you if your team needs you you're up. Yeah. Now it may be situational like there are times where that happens but I sure as hell hope that you are as Alan said I think like six times on the podcast working yourself out of a job one million percent. All right with that violent agreement I think there are some chunks in there that maybe someone finds valuable we'll find out let us know. Yeah let us know could join our slack community give us high ratings tell people listen to the podcast send us we don't need any money. Send us don't send us anything save money. All right let's cut there. I am angry weasel Alan and I'm I'm just right now. Okay that's cool. We'll see you next time everyone. Bye.
