This is the AB testing 343 podcast a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast three questions about almost anything ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started Hey everyone. It's been a long time. We're back for an ABT 343 where we asked one of our three podcast listeners three questions about themselves and today we have the I think world renowned but we'll let him speak to that but we have Danny fought here. Hey Danny. Welcome. Hi there. I think the world has mostly forgotten about me, but Thanks for that shout out. I I do not think so. I do not think so. I Have some questions for you, but I want to establish some context first Well, actually first even before I get to the context question the pre pre question is how are you doing? How are you surviving the work from home and the pandemic and all of those things? I Am doing great. I love working from home I've done it full-time before and I'm doing it, you know practically full-time right now I'm doing great and I can't really I feel bad saying that because some people aren't doing great So I just got a promotion at work. I'm doing better there than I ever have before Congratulations. Thank you I had put for all those people who are looking for a job, you know, I feel for you. I'm sorry So I can't feel too good about my successes, I guess But yeah, I am doing great except for you know Worried about staying alive and my friends and family, you know staying alive and healthy it sounds like we're in a lot of the same boat and I have to remind myself and and I don't have to anymore but I just remember that's what I meant to say. I remember that I am in a very privileged position right now Where I can work full-time from home our company my part of the company especially is doing well better than expected because people are home playing games and I'm just in a very fortunate position. So I'm thankful for that and Again job going well here and trying to stay alive. So What is it just for some context here's the actual pre-question What do you do? What kind of what's the cat give me and the listeners some context on? What's your day-to-day like or however you want to describe it? Well first I want to mention in terms of privilege I am an old white man and what the heck am I doing here? Someone else could be here increasing our diversity And I am proud that we've had some good diversity on AB 2 3 4 3 But every once in a while we do have an old white man on so so yes Make sure we aren't exclusively old white men Okay, good. If there's anything I can do to bring people up and then I'm all ears. I'm trying to figure out how to do that exactly So what what do I do? And it's I think thanks to you really and and Brent My title that I give myself on LinkedIn is I am a software generalist I do whatever needs to be done. Whatever people are willing to pay for basically so I Try to do those unique things that no one else is doing or is willing to do or knows how to do So that's the snarky answer What do I do day to day just in the last month or so I'm a developer Senior developer, I guess was my title recently changed to squad lead So I'm also kind of helping work flow through a squad right now so and this is a Devopsies kind of team so we do all kinds of different things so many different things That I can't even learn how all these tools work that we have to do both to develop features and Get them tested get them out the door and ask ourselves. Are they working or not? Just So many different tools. How can I possibly learn how they all work and how to fix them when they break in production? So it's different every day Yeah, the trick I found is you don't have to know how all the tools work You have to be willing to learn how they all work when needed Yeah, I'm very willing but for the first time I'm feeling overwhelmed I'm willing to learn one or two new tools, but this is this is a lot of new tools and they're changing Constantly some of it is cost-cutting as many companies are reducing their costs I mean we were doing this before the pandemic and before our Customer base dropped by a very frightening percentage, but you know certainly even more so now So that means the tool we just sort of learned. Well now it's a different cheaper tool It is a bit even for me and I welcome change in new things is even for me. It's getting a bit overwhelming yeah, as you know, I run a DevOps team is for my organization at Unity and We have had a few of those come our way, too And they usually involve a migration that my team has to run and man are we tired of migrating stuff So I think we finally have the big one behind us, so we're pretty happy about that Oh, yeah, I forgot about the the migrations are part of that from one part of the cloud to another part of the cloud Because the first place we want it wasn't really the right place and now it needs to be this other place. Oh my goodness Yeah, we did one a while back which was moving Well, we thought I don't to be abstract. We changed cloud providers. We moved from AWS to GCP Google gave us a good deal. I guess I don't know. We just did it Cool We talked about generals Brent tonight do and I always call myself a specializing generalist or a generalizing specialist I forget which one I go back and forth and I know you have a background like I do being a testing specialist So I'm curious. What do you miss about being a testing specialist? And Yeah, what do you miss about being a testing specialist? What do I miss about being a testing specialist? Well, I guess a couple of things I miss breaking things on a daily basis. I still get to do some of that because You know, we are our own QA and Occasionally I get to bring up a load test tool where you know, that's where you can really break something And so that's always fun I miss the community. I mean it's still there most of the people I follow on Twitter are still Overwhelmingly in the testing QA community I'm slowly trying to expand my network more in the development area And I'm finding that I don't think there is quite that tight-knit community. There might be around a particular technology but You know just a general community of practice out there in the world I'm still trying to find some of those to support what I'm doing right now So I do miss how tight-knit that testing community has has always been really But in terms of being a tester I Can't say I really miss that Very much, you know besides the fact that breaking things is great I'm doing okay with what's going on right now and the fact that when I ran that load test I saw this null pointer exception. I didn't file a bug report. I just fixed it and Committed the code. So that's that's something I like more about what I'm doing now is I don't have these artificial Boundaries on what I can and can't work on Yeah, that's good that it's just tightening up the feedback loop. I think I heard this discussion It was a while ago maybe years ago that probably on Twitter because I think we follow a lot of the same people and Someone was talking about like why isn't there I guess you could say stack overflow as a developer community But it's it's huge and and it's not really a community Yeah, I blogged about how that's difficult to get into and and to get the reputation to be even allowed to post the kinds of things You want to post? Yeah, it's funny. I have an ever-growing score on Stack overflow and even a few of the other similar sites from questions I answered years ago, I probably haven't answered a question anywhere on any of the overflow sites in As long as I can remember but ever but everyone's while I go back I see oh my score went up by 100 points Let me see why and just more up though. It's on the same, you know, 20 questions. I probably answered in my life Well, yeah, they stay around a long time Don't they do and I do I can't say after I blogged about that about how it's just really I just gave up I'm trying to get into that community There was this big announcement from stack overflow that they were making changes to make it easier and you know That's probably because of me. I'm pretty sure Actually, it could be could be not that world renowned but it's fun I will I will add it to your Wikipedia entry as an accomplishment So it can be deleted a few weeks later as soon as anyone finds it. Yeah, I've been through that not my own But others that I've added. Yeah, I went through tangents because they're allowed anywhere with this related ABT I went through you might have seen this a while ago I kind of changed gears on this but went through an effort to try and clean up the software testing Wikipedia page Oh, yeah, I joined in that effort and did a little bit of work there and I think Noah Had a good suggestion what to do with that. Just let's just Let's just define a set of soccer a soccer wear Let's have a Wikipedia page on agile testing and maybe we can actually get use that as a place to talk about the way Most of us are doing testing and leave the software testing page to those folks But that page is the software testing pages a lot of changes get rejected And I'm friends with the main rejecter and so, you know You know you engaged with the people you're arguing with you didn't rather than the waging war I mean we even got him to join our select channel Yep, which is now pretty much dead because I haven't paid attention to it and that's fine because I'm okay with where it's at I made some changes that really bugged me and and Yeah, I haven't checked that in a while anyway back on track so You and I have both although I left test and then kind of fell back into it when I first joined Unity and then fell back away from it, but So you're a successful developer now successful Generals developer, which in my opinion makes the best developer Do you wish you would have moved there sooner? Do you wish you'd have moved out of testing and into development sooner in your career? I actually do I think I have limited myself by identifying so strongly as a tester and You know, I've talked about this at the online test conference at the presentation I gave there I mean that was just really that was who I was I break things and I'm an underdog You know QA people don't get respect, but that's who I am and I just latched on to that for for way too long Really, I mean when I consulting business I was an independent consultant for several years when that was faltering it didn't even really occur to me Maybe I should apply for development jobs or get some some programming contracts. I'd been a programmer Since before I was a tester But I don't know why I just I was just so locked into that identity as a tester That I couldn't get out of that box and I wish I had my consulting business might still be alive if I've done that So yeah There's so many more opportunities if your title is developer that I really have stunted my growth I'm having great fun now. I'm the old guy and where I work. I'm very glad they don't they don't really seem to discriminate based on being the guy with gray hairs in his beard Which is great, but man if it had been ten years ago That would be so much more I could grow from there You know Brent moved away from QA before I did I think at Microsoft and I'm sure he would make the same claim and there are some things I think he probably the same claim as well that Some things around systems thinking I could never have got from Without being a tester about seeing the big picture and understanding how pieces work together Understanding how software is delivered and then basically I think it helped you become the generalist you are today is what I would say I Want to also dig in on one thing you said because it struck a nerve or a memory Because we do see today Because times are changing more and more Companies are using fewer test specialists and there are people who cling to that test role. It's their identity And I'm just curious if you have a message for those people. Oh goodness, I mean I could just be I Could I could do the hard sell and barely be a butt-head and I could say test is dead It was kind of my message at the online test conference is you get out while you can and that that is kind of my My message is get out get out while you can but the fact is a lot of people are still Gainfully employed as testers. There are people getting jobs as testers for the first time and You know, they're probably gonna be okay Just fewer of them are gonna be okay than before I can't analyze what those numbers are gonna be so my personal choice in terms of career opportunity was to broaden it and I still recommend to people that they take a broader outlook than being a testing specialist But also I've worked on trying to train QA people to pick up development skills. I have been successful in that once I'm very proud of that that person is still working here and You know, I don't have a good count on how many of them didn't make that transition there are some that made it to other roles, but I would say a pretty big majority of of testing specialists are not Programmers already and don't want to be programmers and if it's not a job that they would enjoy It doesn't really make much sense to try to do it. Yeah, I forgot what the question was We can we can go here for a while because while you were talking about being a generalist and testers and testing I think what I would encourage a tester to do based on what you said in my my Interpretation of it is be more of a generalist. Don't be a testing specialist have a test specialty, but be a generalist It doesn't have to be programming I think of all the other things that go out in the DevOps world Which may require some configuration files that may look like code, but there's so much Technical work and I'm not getting into the whole technical versus non-technical. That's a that's a rat hole not for today Because all of our work is technical. Anyway, there's Hooking up static analysis tools adding a tool to a CI system All these things help out a lot with quality But they're not testing One thing I was curious you think about this. I think one thing I would encourage testers to do is Be a tester be the testing specialist if that's your identity I'm not I don't want to take that away from you, but I think you are going to be You're gonna guarantee a better career. I think and maybe have some more fun if you try and generalize a little more as well What do you think about that advice that I just made up on the spot? Yeah, that's great. And I can tell a story about that because I actually earlier on I Went away from testing when my consulting business Dried up and I got a call from a recruiter who said hey, do you want to work in doing? Technical support basically and I said no I'm a tester and then I looked at my finances and I called him back and said Yes. Yes, I do So I did that and I did for a while and for reasons I left that several years later and Went straight back to testing because that's what was easy to do I Did that at a couple there those lasted like three different jobs lasted about a year and and for various reasons needed to move on to to something else and Then my place I'm at right now. There was an opening as a QA analyst I've never had that job title before my whole career. It's always been You know some sort of engineer But you know, I swallowed my pride I really liked the company and I said, all right, I'll be a QA analyst. It's contract So, you know, whatever let's give it a try and for one I was surprised they hired me No one said overqualified or anything like that. They just said sure. Yeah, you're qualified to do the job and Started talking to some of the developers on the team because You know, this was I guess you would call it Combined engineer. I don't with the mic, you know, Microsoft term is the Microsoft term was combined engineering Okay, Brent and I preferred unified. It's like oil and vinegar versus ranch dressing It's it's the way that you do things if you have testing specialists That's kind of the way I look at I didn't even really think it was weird that I wasn't on a separate testing team We were on a team a couple of testers a couple of developers Yeah, it was just just made sense. But anyways, I started talking to some of the developers. I said hey, you know, I I think I see a security vulnerability here and let me show you how to set up a debug proxy modify The the output that's coming in. Oh, look, you know, here's here's this issue here and you want me to dig into it further and It turns out one of those guys was pretty influential in the organization and You know before long I got this offer said hey you need to do something Like like at least like test automation or something else and so I was able to move up from that pretty quickly. So You know, I think that kind of fits in with what you're saying I was in a testing specialist role and But I had other skills and I found places to use them and without me even trying that led to something else Now I don't recommend the testing specialist to test automation specialist path and I think you've mentioned that several times before And by the way at my company, not only do we not have QA people anywhere in my organization We don't have automation specialist either So that was also a bit of a dead end So yeah, definitely if what you're doing is mostly testing You don't have to change your job title to expand your skills and use some of those skills Yeah, the titles really don't mean anything It's about being willing and eager to try different things and try to help in different ways and and just that attitude for me of always learning, you know, we talked to to merit on the the A.B. Testing podcast a few weeks ago and She came across and I described her as being addicted to learning and I think something a Any generalist actually any knowledge worker should also embrace because that's gonna keep you Well one employed but more importantly gonna keep you engaged and keep you having fun I mean talk about privilege not only are we still able to make money during this pandemic and pay our bills But we get to do something we like It's fun to do you I have to follow merit. That's not fair Like the best one you've done I can't I can't follow that Not that there'll be an A.B. Testing after that Brett and I did a Recording this morning. And by the way our first ever live stream we decided Right at 8 o'clock. We recorded that I was gonna live stream it. So I was wondering why people were commenting on that I missed out But in terms of learning, yeah, I was I was thinking about what am I learning right now and Goodness I've started a couple of Tracks at work. They're very big on learning. You know, I just spent basically every Friday afternoon is learning Don't work on any user stories unless that helps you learning. That's our mandate to our whole organization and I love it That's nice. So I'm using that to improve some of my programming skills while also pushing forward a Technology initiative that the whole company is gonna be able to benefit from But I also just a few days ago started a music theory course on that same platform the company sponsors but you know in my own time I'm on a More than 310 day streak on duolingo learning mostly French but not entirely I'm not bragging on that I just I don't know I made a habit and and that once I make a habit it tends to stick and I'm sure I'm missing something else. Yeah, I had like a 50-day streak on duolingo a while back and then I said I missed a day. I never went back I feel really bad now. That's too bad. It's not too late to start another streak I know with a different language in different language every time. Yeah, I've tried four or five. Yeah, I Had to tell an employee just this week's for about this learning Friday. I had to tell him it's okay To read this book. I asked you to read during the work day Encount it as work. It's like really I said, yeah, you can even see you have to sit at your desk You can sit on your couch and read this book. I want I want to discuss it with you and etc. Etc. It's okay I can do that. That's weird. I said no, it's not weird. This is this is this is life Sit on your couch read the book. We'll talk about it next week. Yeah, it's weird that it's weird But yeah, I used to find a little out of the way corners away from my work area back when I worked in An office with other people I would go hide and so I could read without being interrupted and then the team made a game out Of it. I found you that time. Well fine, but you just keep on walking because I'm gonna keep reading Speaking of books I hear a rumor that you're writing a biography Tell me about that It might become what you would call a biography I suppose so Yeah, the friend of mine Jerry Weinberg We it started on a tweet of his that piqued my interest in basically computer history You know political history the kind that you have to do in school and get a grade on Not not super interesting but computer history. Oh my goodness and history of other interesting things That that's really cool stuff. So I got to talking about that and I said, hey Jerry why don't you write a book because you were there like The first computer that was ever delivered to San Francisco as far as we can tell He was the first person to get his hands on it and figure out how to program it and that's just amazing and It turns out I wasn't the first person to say hey Jerry, you should write a book and I didn't know at the time But this was his pat answer and the answer was no you should write a book Because how could he write all the books that everyone says he should he's he already wrote like 40 plus books Give the guy a break, right? About probably 20 them over my bookshelf. Yeah. Yeah, it's good stuff And so few people know about Jerry Weinberg and you know The psychology of computer programming and secrets of consulting and are your lights on so much good stuff In fact one of secrets of consulting because my my organization In addition to DevOps a lot of folks that work across the org, but it's one of the four or five books I'll show you they won't see it But it's always on my always on my table because I just I show people say read this book. Oh, yeah Good stuff. He told me that that should actually it was the more secrets of consulting should have been the book that went with I think it's the chain shop workshop But it was still new at the time and he hadn't switched over but man that that's to get the blue book That's to get the blue book to the the second secrets of consulting book. It's on the bookshelf. Awesome So our discussion it kind of morphed and and I realized you know this This might be more interesting so many history books have been written already about computer specifically even Let's just make this a biography and he said yeah, if you write it, I will answer your questions one at a time and I'd be glad to contribute and so That's how that got kicked off and I've got hundreds of pages of emails between Jerry and mean at this point by the way, he was so rude as to die in the middle of this project Dang it So now I'm continuing on by talking to people who knew him and can give me more information About him and I'm still filling up another hundreds of pages document that somehow I have to wrangle into some book chapters right now, it's really just a blog post and I'm hoping this is gonna spur me to get one out. I've been working on one for more than a year now the next installment I'm getting really Really close on it. I've just been a little stuck and and I've read several books in the process Once I realized that I'm really getting into the computer history part here That was really why I got started on this and I want to get I think I've got an angle on it It hasn't really been published before about this crucial transition point between Well, you know what just just come to my blog and bug me about why I haven't posted it yet and you'll find out Give you a cliffhanger there. I am That's so exciting. I'm so happy you're doing that I'm talking about I'm not sure I'm not sure the order some I need it's like the chronological order The all of Jerry's books came out in but I know you probably have more than I do But I have a copy of humanized input, which is It's like typewritten. The printing is like it's a super cheap publication But I know that was pretty early on but it's still really valuable. He had a way of writing Information that just it's amazing how applicable it remains It's all about it again. It goes back to systems thinking. It's all about Trying to figure out what the real problem is and solving that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely I think I have every one of his books at least one edition of every single one and a big bibliography where I'm trying to just list all of them and that is a challenge because he's republished them he split them into several ebooks is this the same book is that and Some of his books don't have an ISBN or even a publication year. Come on. How long? Give me something to go with here so I can identify what this thing is in a bibliography. So it's been a challenge But yeah, I think I've been able to acquire Every single one and I got started on that when I was researching the triangle problem that everyone thinks Glenn Myers First wrote about but Jerry told me that no I taught that to Glenn and it's in a book I can prove that I published it first and I found this book I think it might have been PL one or somewhere around that era and I I got this search going at a used bookstore and sure enough I got a hit on it and I bought the book and there it is the triangle problem before Glenn Myers wrote about it Wow, and I feel like I've heard that did you blog that story? I'm sure I did somewhere. Okay. Yeah, I I think I recall Hearing about that once a while back it tickles a memory Which could just be my memory playing tricks on me, but I feel like I had heard that Maybe I am world-renowned if Alan Page has read one of my blog post No, I read way too much you can know from my five four Fridays that I post I I read I Read a lot of stuff. Sometimes I skim some stuff There's usually a half dozen or a dozen articles a week where I really spend time on and they you know, I believe That good ideas come from getting a lot of ideas and throwing the bad ones away And also that good ideas come from other other ideas meeting. So I will read it could be articles around science or data analysis of Covid or software engineering or testing or systems thinking or management or leadership I'm always looking for ideas and not and also For the critical thinking aspect things I disagree with so I can think about why I disagree with them And so it helps me understand then from if I don't disagree with an article Understand what's important to me or at least understand why I don't like it and I could do a big soapbox on that but I read a lot because it I Like merit. I like to consider myself addicted to learning. I want to get I'm not nearly at her level of attacking learning but I I Want to take advantage of a brain that still works as long as I can Awesome. Yeah, and what I'm doing right this second is part of that learning is volunteer to do something I don't know. I don't know what I got to what I can present for that But I just sign up for it now I'm committed and that gets the gears turning and it took a while to figure out what do I want to talk to Alan about? I know I've been wanting to talk to Alan for a long time You know that's having that deadline. It's on the calendar You got to talk to Alan about something and you know, you're bugging me about what's the agenda? That's typical of what I do I'll sign up to speak about something at a conference and it's not something I have no idea about but but probably not something I know enough to really talk about and that's what spurs me to go learn it It's a challenge to go learn it. That is a fantastic attitude and we managed to Fill up an ABT 343 with I think some Information the listeners are really going to appreciate especially the the biography work you talked about that's it. That's That's gonna cause a buzz. I think cool. Yeah, let me know what you think about it. Tell me which parts you don't like, please How can I improve on it because it's still very much a work in progress I'll grab some more information after I say goodbye here, but let's say goodbye to our listeners thank you for spending some time with me and answering some questions and Hope to hear from you more on one of the three dot slack comm and I will be following your blog closely So thanks Danny. Thanks. Goodbye to all two of you. I'm one. So there's only two others listening It's only two others. They'll enjoy it though. I promise cool
