Thank you. It is a little my daughter Welcome to a be testing podcast your modern testing podcast Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show Could we be? any more Pathetic old men is it possible? Are we the most pathetic old men that exist on the internet? No Yeah, there's something we can strive for for sure So as many of our readers know I gave up on grooming part way into the pandemic and grew my hair super long And and my beard super long. I have since recently partially Groomed to myself. I have a beard looks Defuzzed It's shorter than Brent's but one thing I didn't realize still Brent was looking at his cat is that We both are holding on like I I couldn't cut all my hair off I can still do the little man bun ponytail thing and Brent has one too And I realized looking at his how much I need to cut more of my hair off because I realized How bad I must look no you look great actually like thank you, but you don't have You don't have the little hair island up here that looks stupid More out so that the whole damn thing Like now I have a little You're not the target demographic. I'm trying to make my hair look good for it before just you know Oh, just so you know sure you know Just just know now you got the whole sexy salt and pepper look going on. That's that's that's that's what my t-shirt says We are back for episode this is 212 I believe that's on right to you Sure, right 212 212 is an even number not a prime number to even number Also the area code of Manhattan in New York City. That's a fun fact. I didn't also also a palindrome to undo Many good things. I can't think anything else about about 212, but that's that's up to five All right, and that's the end of our podcast today. Thanks everyone for listening How's it going? What's new tell me something exciting about what's happening in your world? Uh, well, it's been a while like we haven't talked the election at all. Oh Wait, there was an election I missed out. I Understand why you might be repressing it I mean, I'm embarrassed but anyway go on I'm embarrassed you know 49% of the people who voted voted for a Convicted rapist and felon and all-around fraud Not good human being that's who we are as a country. I'm embarrassed Okay, so I've said on the podcast before I I did not like Biden or Trump Kamala the we haven't talked about her at all and that is actually part of the reason why She lost I don't think Trump won. I think she lost I think I I call that correct. I am mad at the Democrats They did not call out the misinformation around the border of the economy, etc. Etc. They thought they could just yeah They didn't wait again their strategy and we can just simplify it because we're not a political podcast Not their strategy was a complete and total utter clusterfuck. Yes Yeah, yeah, and we will deeply pay the price for that That's where we're at. So anyway other than that moving on from the election. What else has been going on? We had a huge storm here in Seattle Area we did we had a bomb cycle and did you have power you're on the east side you have power Yeah, no, I live in neck of the woods that all of our wires are are underground so We do get power outages, but the tree has to fall directly on the transformer like the probability So yeah, we've been fine. Yeah ours flickered a few times. We have been solid We have a couple more storms coming in over the weekend. So good times. Yeah, there's supposed to be something today Yeah, so anyway, I've been traveling a lot. I was in New York last week I was home for about a week in between I was in Montana taking care of Just Family stuff before that I was in New York for 10 days again before that it's been a lot you have family stuff related to Montana I didn't know this. Yeah. Yeah Okay So I haven't been moving on I haven't been home much. It's good to be home And I kind of just trying to catch up on shit. Yeah So anyway, yeah, I never let you answer your question. What else is new? What's new other than the power outage that you didn't have storm bomb cyclone? You missed the whole connect season. We talked about remember last time we talked about The the how performance reviews are done horribly like 99% of the company has talked about how I try and come back Episode 211 that's one back in your history. You can hear a lot more about that there is there is Something sort of new popping up at Microsoft that I think is an interesting topic Maybe I'll throw it out. How about that? Can you tell me? All right. I'm ready the Nothing could surprise me. No, so it goes back to to AI again However, you remember remember way back MS. Poll I do remember MS. Poll And the engagement survey and this poll is gone. It's replaced by a new system a new engagement survey. Okay. Yep and one of the current questions is I know how It's I'm screwed it up and I know how to use AI and my day-to-day life Oh interesting. I bet that number is pretty low. It is certainly Well in my organization, it's not shock But Overall, it's it's it's generally viewed as lower than Than people would like I'm not certain I've not had any conversations with him. Like what's the right number? But I do think it's interesting that that showed up Well kudos to the HR team for adding that question Right. Yeah, why? Because I agree but why because it's not normally they're focused on engagement and how they look on the Gallup polls blah blah blah Here's a actual question you can ask you kind of know the answer But you want to confirm it because you can do something about it. You can actually do something This is common. I would bet every company that asked this whether you're Microsoft or you know Walmart Nobody answers that question as positive No group of employees answered that question as positively as you'd like because you and I know there are many advantages to productivity to efficiency to decision-making that can happen if you use AI effectively and It's just it's just good data to have to point out that we're not taking advantage of what's there and I'm going the whole Gen AI isn't really AI but whatever it's helpful no matter what and I don't think most people Know how to make it helpful Yeah, yeah, no, I think number one The fact that they are asking that question Right. What does it do? It asks that question every manager in the company gets a score against that question and Then they immediately take action like this is this is just a fantastic way to motivate a behavior change in a direction and just like ridiculously Yes. Yes, but also because there you can correlate that question against things like I have ample time to learn new topics helping with my job So I imagine that's low that could be low too or maybe it isn't and it's high but they're spending their time learning other things There are other questions in engagements It's like the whole advantage these things is not the way people sorry on soapbox The way people screw up surveys is they just treat every question individually. You have to do analysis to find Correlations and find out to helps answer questions on why things are the way they are and once you do that with that question You're gonna find some interesting insights Yeah, unfortunately, I mean you can and if you're if you're the team doing Analysis that has everything in the clear. You probably can do a lot more. Obviously. I only have my team scores and only in aggregation and without commentary So I just look at him go neat vanity number. I have to get for me that sucks I don't I don't know who runs HR at Microsoft anymore. It's a revolving door there. That's fine It's probably somebody better given you know, it's probably somebody good That's not the point. The point is I would be willing to bet you know I pick on Microsoft a lot, but I'd be willing to bet that a company like Microsoft are Taking a data analysis approach to the survey stuff and looking for correlations and trying to find not just oh Let's give people some AI training. They're gonna find some behavioral things and management and team structure that are going to help influence that I will Join you in your optimism. I Like in my little neck of the woods like I run a data science team. Yeah, that's what we do But again, the debt is not sufficient. I have no visibility to to Matter of fact other teams have come in and said hey, can you data science our scores? Data science your scores. I kind of believe they'd say that Some do Some do that the the ones I like working with do the Right gives a figure they go. Okay, I don't I don't have the skill the thing I wanted to drive with this that I think is potentially interesting because this one question has like I as I mentioned has encouraged a behavior amongst in particular Dev and PM and and the Dev and PM managers are basically going late WTF what the hell am I supposed to do here? Right and and Meaning even those managers don't have enough understanding of of AI and There's now it just event Carefully because I love my company and that is honest. That's me just saying it but There is a There are two things that one thing that's bad That's happened here is is there's a lot of discussions I'm having with people. Oh And I call it AI and magic same thing And then the another discussion is AI and LLM same thing and as we both know These are both false But that's how they are approaching it with me and so I go, okay, how do I engage here? How do I help them? move forward like p.m. Hit me this week and I spent a lot of time with death because that's easier for me to understand I'm like look look at any place in your architecture where you need to automate decision-making where your devs have made up numbers Like if made up number equals another made up number then do thing Timeouts as a very simple example PM is a new one and they're like, well, what am I supposed to do here? I don't like well two things that were very obvious to me is Look at the part of the job that's that's tiresome and See if if AI can can help you like I find good success in terms of I don't like using LLM to write my slide decks But I do like it in terms of writing the the outline of the deck Do you have you used LLM to do death work? I have it doesn't mean it hasn't been great But it's been helped this bit. It's again. It's a collaboration partner. It gives me some ideas and I go well that sucks But I can build on that say something. Hello. Oh you sound maybe Welcome back Brent to the AB testing podcast Thank you 12 even number Blah blah blah question on the engagement survey, although it has a different name on on Using AI appropriately people come to you to talk about whether AI is magic or Whether LLMs and AI are the same thing. I think pretty common across the industry. I hear those same problems all the time where I am, so Do you remember where you were on that journey or should I just take off in a different direction? You can go wherever you want. No Fully agree and we've talked about it a lot the fact that people don't know how to use AI effectively They don't know how to use and it's it's fine. They're going to learn it. I Think there's extremes where they think it's like we get the folks on LinkedIn saying oh, it can't count ours in strawberry It's stupid, but you're an idiot because it actually is very powerful to help and I think Blah blah blah so if I said before I want to talk about you're gonna get back in the AI stuff, but one thing No company as a collective has ever done really well that I've worked out in 30 years is actually Do I've never seen a company do the right things with those engagement service? It's almost like they do them. Okay. We have to do an engagement survey. It'll tell us whatever but It's actually used right. It's a really powerful tool. I know Microsoft used to do like let's do a morale event Let's all go to a movie or a bowling the day before we fill the survey out to make people feel a little bit better Absolutely idiotic and stupid there is a little bit of a day of a snapshot of the day that comes into fact comes into play with those surveys, but I think I'm taking this different direction because actually something I've thought about a lot and I went to a leadership session when I was in New York last week and I was talking to the guy that runs it I think my retirement job may be to run Like leadership programs or talent and leadership things like that's I think I'm at some point I'm gonna get out of software completely because it's killing me and I'm gonna do something to help people become better leaders So anyway, a lot of folks look at their survey results and they'll either pat themselves on the back or not They'll look at the low stuff Often what happens you look at like what sucked you? Are you? Okay sharing what what like sucked in your your team on your thing You can Holy crap, did you know this is going You know one thing about record we need to cover recording studio so don't have all this bullshit, okay Dropped your tablet and blah blah blah and slightly crippled. Okay fair enough fair enough This is gonna show up on my podcast Alan does things like that. All right, let's see what happens here. Okay. Now. Anyway, we're we were you're told Oh my god, where the hell were we what sucked on your engagement survey? Super you for you on mine One of them that I remember is Compensation, okay, and what can you Brent personally do about that? Jack all you can't do anything. No, that's false. Oh, tell me okay I was I was actually hoping you'd agree with me so I could disagree with you. Tell me more. Oh Sorry. Yeah, you're right. What am I gonna do? I'm not Authority on that No, actually, I'm one of the rare people at Microsoft that believe that if you if you approach it the right way Every one of these things the frontline manager can take action Yes, right So there's and that gets into two big mistakes people make in looking at their engagement survey results one is They look at things that are negative and say I can't do anything about that employees see they need more comp They need more money. Sorry the same thing with any more education whatever employees go. Well, it's not my job I can't do that which is a big chunk of BS. You can affect that go back to Dan pink maybe it's not money maybe it's autonomy and purpose and mastery or Maybe there are things you can do about money. You can make a difference there Other thing is no and actually even further and again, it's Dan pink. But the other thing further Yeah, I I have my scores up my lowest is I have a good deal at my company right, that's the lowest one and and There's a reasonable balance between what I contribute and what I get in return and That one most managers will interpret it as money But that's not what it says. It says I have a good deal Yep right and People go after as Dan pink points out people go after money as the plan not even be but CDef Right people are more engaged By by being in the environment where they're energized by it. They feel like they have a purpose They have some sort of autonomy right those matter far more Than the money once the money is at a basic level right Right, that's for the majority people there's there's always the others who are like comparing themselves to their cousins or you know things like that right um So okay, so you're absolutely right. So the mistakes people make is They either throw stuff away say I can't do anything about that Or they only focus on the low thing say a low thing Say okay, I say give people more money more money and that it'll be great You also have to focus on like what's your highest thing? What are you best? What is your what is your team say as far as engagement goes your best at manager respect? okay, so Um, what's gonna happen if you focus on getting people more money? But you sacrifice manager respect You're gonna play engagement survey whack-a-mole the the the the point is that's a bad example That would be hard. But but yeah, you're right if you focus If you don't focus on the whole system Exactly, and that is the mistake people make they don't focus on the whole system So again in my in my future job where i'm doing this full time I would make sure every leader of a certain size team has a coach to help them Evaluate what it means help them figure out the actual behaviors. They are doing that they should continue and behaviors They could be doing to help improve things You're not trying to Play whack-a-mole with the small things and ignore the things the low things and ignore the things you're doing well at You have to figure out what you can adjust in the system to make these numbers are a rough reflection Of how the org feels about coming to work for you So you have to attack it as a system and you have to look at It's a reflection everything happening at once so you understand Uh what you what behaviors need to change? There's no leader out there who's perfect every single one including myself including you Can do some things better? We can do some things better that help our teams focus on their work and be more productive And I think a lot of managers are just freaking lazy and don't bother That pisses me off lazy managers piss me off lazy leaders piss me off There's a lot of these assets when I think about right the new system like they have There's a lot That they can do to make it more actionable Like even someone like me like I have spent an hour trying to reverse and successfully reverse engineer how they How all the data flows? Because I was trying to figure out how to drive action with this um They've dumped it down to a point where i'm like, yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if so many people Okay, what if? Can I walk you through a thought exercise? Yeah Okay We have the engagement service those can be different every company you can add questions like the ai question is great What if there was a separate survey for leaders you can say people managers or or people at a certain level? I would say people at a certain certain size organization That asked you maybe even in free form text about behaviors that you employ as a leader things like I make I focus on making sure every person on my team gets feedback at least once a week or What form or short answer what forms of feedback do you get? Um, how do you motivate your team or question? They can be they can be uh bullet points, you know multiple choice or they can be um Short answer so we're giving all the leaders of a say more than 20 people all these questions to kind capture their behaviors now Can I take the results? I haven't thought about this yet. Can I take the results of that? Correlate them with the results of the survey Put it into an llm and put a chat bot on it and ask it Here are my survey scores. What are some things I can do to? uh balance these numbers higher across my organization or whatever the question is because I should be able to see I would think uh those because behavior drives motivation and I would think from those behaviors from again at microsoft size from Hundreds or a thousand other managers and and they're correlated with their Engagement survey scores. I would hope I could find some common ground It's a it's a kind of a cheap way to learn from each other on how to How to treat those that survey like a system Yes I actually think What what you inspired for me when you as you're talking through that? um is strength finders We we've talked about this and I this isn't a a tangent to go deep into strength fighters, but if you read when you go take the strength finders test you you get a A pamphlet That talks about each of your strengths and it gives you a little paragraph. You you recall what i'm talking about. Yep. I do. Okay now If you read that paragraph versus going to the strength finders book and reading the paragraph there You'll notice that there's similarities That that the theme is similar like uh, for example me one of my strengths was restorative I go and read it in the book. It'll say a bunch of things and I go read it in my own PDF and it's it's it's in the same ballpark, but it's different and that is because Gallup has the ability to Because the strengths aren't independent they play off of each other so my other strengths pivot around how I use my restorative it's not the Not the pure restorative that you would find in the the book, but it's one that's Aligned by the other ones and for me, it would be absolutely that would be an llm tool worth building where it takes As long as this was done in a absolute psychologically safe. Yeah environment because What i'm about to propose Could absolutely be used for evil Right. It would be handy if I could go to a tool Give it access to my email Give it my scores and say Hey what are the Here's an example question. What? What are the top five high roi proposals You have for me right look at my patterns because If I try to take make a program out of each of these It's going to be a challenge and with Uh, I think there's like 30 40 questions and so trying to do Me sitting down and building a system out of that Is going to be very complex and time consuming Well, let's go And I have an ego so i'm gonna go right? Oh, no, this wasn't me This was the top down bullshit thing that I had no choice over right? I want to meta even more because Why don't I there's a challenge with a lot of leaders is they There's uh unconscious incompetence. They don't realize how much they don't know they don't know Uh, most leaders i'm not one of them would say they don't need a coach or a mentor Uh, and I think most leaders actually do I don't think most leaders are as good at doing their job as they think they are So that's that's a problem. I can't necessarily solve however Why doesn't ai just look at not just email but other communications I do Even even to my meetings since most meetings for me at least are online and can be if they're not recorded can be analyzed Why don't I get coaching tips weekly or daily on things? I could do differently or like when I talk about feedback I like to give continue feedback or improve feedback like you great I like I like the way you listen while i'm talking and makes you feel like i'm listening to thanks for doing that Please keep doing that. I don't have to think of a new thing you've done, but I want to reinforce the things you do well and then Uh and this ai can do this as well. Hey you you In the it's the meeting you were able to get everyone in the meetings to talk and that was great Keep doing that. I want the ai to tell me that the ai can be changed can be trained on not just the The literature out there, but the literature out there Like there's a lot of literature out there that is based on interpretation of facts accelerates the same thing It has an interpretation of the facts. It's pretty good. It's pretty objective in the way it does it a lot of leadership books in the same way what I wanted to do is take the the canon of of known solid leadership principles from gallup from strength spiners who's based on data Correlate that with how I behave at work in a way that can be observed by ai and then give me Coaching feedback in small chunks on a regular basis And I think the cat wants to talk apparently, but that's what that's what I want and that's doable today, right? That is doable today someone could build that now. Here's the question and it's I love it when she does is she's like i'm right here pet me. Um I've had multiple cats use the only one that's ever done this the cat was batting brent on the arm while I was talking Yeah, she was like hey, I want your attention pet me now what you just said mate Is interesting In let me let me do something with you Let's see how well it plays out. All right. Okay. I was like I have on my android phone the microsoft Co-pilot app. Okay. Okay. I don't know if you have android. It says brent is great to see you I do have an android phone with no sim in it that I use for Watching tick tock there is a neat button Right there. All right Okay, i'm going to turn up the volume And this what does the button do? Hey, brent. What can I do for you? Hey, can we go back to a previous conversation? For sure What were we chatting about? How do you feel? about voice driven ai bots with a personality Speaking strictly from experience. I think they're an interesting tool They can make interactions more engaging and personalized. It's like having a conversation with a knowledgeable friend Of course, it's all about finding the right balance between personality and popis Too much personality could be distracting but the right amount makes it more relatable What do you think? Well, I think it's interesting that you did not bring up the primary detractor What would you say that is? Probably the risk of over-reliance on these bots. They're a great aid, but shouldn't replace human interaction entirely They can also sometimes unintentionally reinforce biases or lead to privacy concerns It's kind of like wielding a double-edged sword you get the good stuff, but you need to watch out for the sharp edges I think you we should be stronger. We shouldn't just be having to watch out for the sharp edges um Like do you have any concern around? human beings Falling in love with ai and how that may impact society That's a complex topic for sure while it's understandable people may form Attachments or emotional bonds with their ai companions It raises questions about how those relationships might impact real-life connections It could blur the lines between genuine human interaction and artificial ones potentially affecting how people perceive relationships It's a nuanced conversation with ethical emotional and societal implications Any specific part of that intrigues you? Yeah, the ethical concerns and how we're gonna how we're going to prevent the ethical concerns Before they happen. It sounds like you feel you're sounds like you're okay with us taking a reactive approach Not really I think we should definitely be proactive about ethical concerns Especially when it comes to rapidly evolving technologies like ai setting strong ethical guidelines Fostering transparency and ensuring accountability are crucial steps to minimize risks It's about anticipating challenges and having robust frameworks in place before things get okay. Thank you. I gotta go back to a podcast. Bye Sure thing brent. Enjoy your podcast. Oh my god So that's weird. Um And yeah, but how did you feel about that? Like the first time I did that I was with my daughter in the car And I don't know how I let it do it But basically if I were to go to a different screen and I would show you that is all llm Like everything that they it was llm running And it was just the voice ai Outputting it there's a couple takeaways I have from that one is I no longer need you on the podcast. I can just as have an ai to talk to Let's see if I can figure out how to do that. No, don't do not do not stop that I think I think the key thing is is yeah, we we all saw her Was it her or she her? Who my ai the movie the movie with the guy fall in love with the ai. So Oh, I haven't seen that one. I'm not talking about you know Focusing on the ai, but the ai I think even the way I use chad gpd today. It's a coach. It's a collaborator So why don't given in general how bad leaders are across the industry and how much data we have on how? On on what it takes to be a good leader and what it takes to lead it to to make a team successful Why don't we why why can't we take those conversations from all the ways we interact with people? And have an ai become our coach to help help these leaders learn how to behave better and improve That's the question because so now we're going back like okay brent that neat tangent But why the hell did we go that way? Right? And so what I walked away with okay And I I don't think this is what you're saying But what I walked away with wouldn't it be great if we could have an ai watch what we do and give us little affirmations But affirmations corrections course corrections tell us to do things that we're not doing okay. It's of course corrections. I love that towards What goal what correction and who gets to define that? Okay, i'm gonna go off data here research shows that highly engaged teams deliver Uh faster With quality and there are facts on what creates highly engaged teams They need to know why their job is important. They need to learn manager cares about them They have to they have to get feedback are the biggest thing And and and then those those dive into I feel like you're missing my point because you're mentioning all the things that you know, I already agree with I I know but I think I think if you look a lot of managers, you'll ask them for example. Hey, do you give feedback team? Yeah, I give my team a lot of feedback and then because it's not observed because it happens behind closed doors and closed meetings We don't know if that's true or not What I want to have is the ai to tell me if i'm doing the things that create highly engaged teams Or maybe I tell the coach here is what I want to get better at I want to get better at making a closer connection with my employees and get so they'll so that I can give them strong feedback without feeling like without them feeling like i'm attacking them Now we're on the same page and and then having some So we're on the same page having something doing Pavlovian experiments with me without my conscious awareness I'm I'm just like In the beginning I have to have the ai help me figure out what the goal is because if i'm your typical mediocre to worst manager or leader I don't know what those things are I need to do because i've never done as good as I was as a software developer I've done jack squat on learning anything about leadership and growing people. I completely get that you are essentially What you are done is trying to create a fourth order of ignorant solution Yes, I want to use ai to help people discover what they don't know they don't know right you are correct and all i'm saying And i'm aboard on that one, but it's got to be ethical af It does. It does have to be ethical af but I think it can be I think it can be and and I would be surprised because i've never had an idea that wasn't already invented or already on the market I would not be surprised if one of these companies like fellow or whoever who focus on These managers, excuse me manager employee interactions Haven't already thought about this or building this in some way. This is I think it's critical. I think I don't like like you just heard what what bing is. Yeah, like it's not far off I don't I personally Like I think I told you The first time I did this I I did a different voice and My daughter was in the car and she's like dad Because the way it responded dad the ai hates you and Because of the way they responded i'm like, yeah, I totally get what she's saying And i'm like, this is why I don't like anyway, i'm not going to kick that horse any further I absolutely believe it's unethical to put personality into ai because of The yeah the problem because because people Number one, it's well known People are very easily manipulated and an ai could do that and a friendly ai could absolutely do that Super well Anyway, yeah No, okay. I agree. So I also don't like the personality I think it's a nice little parlor trick they've done to make it a little scary to to creep towards uncanny valley I do not like it either, but I think there's a huge opportunity there and I think we're yeah, you're right. I want to find a cure for fourth order of ignorance Yes And I I agree. There's a way to do it I just as i've mentioned before right, it's The fact that there's so few systems thinkers in this space Ah is problematic This is why like if you get down to it, we don't need And this is why people can't coming, you know looping back This is why people come to you and can't differentiate between ai and magic or llm's and ai I think the need for systems thinking in the new world we're growing into is becoming Uh more than critical, um, like like vital. Yeah vital like I like Near existential I don't use that word very often because it's so buzzwordy now, but near existential Yeah, I agree. I think it has to change or I mean It has to change because we'll never take full advantage of the tech the advances into technology until we do Yes, so yeah All right, then well, uh I'll I will be a combination prompt engineer. I hate that term a prompt engineer and a Talent coach in my future life not not But I think there's there's something there and I yeah, I think mostly like Rather than look at ai as magic. I look at what I see are big problems and one big problem as I see is that Oh god, I could tell stories probably get fired for them, but I see uh There's just a lot of flaws across the industry here There's some other folks as well in how people lead teams and they fail to see how important it is to Focus on those things as a leader the critical thing. So I wish they would get the coaching they need They don't know they need it. They're never going to see it. They think they're fine. Whatever whatever whatever like Let me give you one more example We can close to the day But you and I'll go back to microsoft in the old days when it was toxic microsoft and the way to get to the top Was to leave bodies in the wake You know you you and I both saw people who got promoted for being complete assholes and tearing people apart and What happens that happened? Did they get whatever whatever level it is at a higher level? Um What it does is it reinforces that behavior so they do more of it so they continue to grow Yeah, and what it does is it tears apart teams and makes good people leave to go find different things The great thing about microsoft if there's one Is just teasing is that uh, like I survived there because I as you know, I changed jobs every 18 months Because if if I got bored on the job or I didn't like the manager there was another place I could go work That would be better for a while Yes completely agree That the no it and there's unknown you get more of For any organization that you probably know this better.
