Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show Hey everyone Brett say something. Hi All right But you said hey everyone like that was for the list that was for the three people Brit you're you remain the smartest idiot I've ever known but luckily we have someone even smarter joining us on our our Socially distanced podcast this morning. We have Julian Bucknell who is the CTO of test cafe? Hey Julian and Good morning. It's well, it's morning for me. Yeah Hello Long-time listeners may know that we we record it 8 a.m On Fridays usually so are welcome to have Julian get up early for us. Which part of the world are you in Julian? I'm actually in Colorado. So it's it's not an early morning for me. It's it's pretty good. I mean I've got my Starbucks coffee which I went to him, you know a Drive-thru To get and I'm ready It's Ready for the the morning's work All right. Wait, you introduced me as the CTO of test cafe. I actually am the CTO of developer Express who Create and market test. Thank you for the clarification. What else does dev express do we are mostly about Kind of user interface controls for for developers across the gamut from Windows to the web and You know, I can get into why we created test cafe because you know we have all these user interface controls for the web and We need to test them and so on so forth. But yeah, we we basically target developers creating applications you know either for Windows or for the web or It's getting more and more things like the Mac and and so on so forth. It's it's getting very interesting Yes, indeed and I like that you said you cater towards developers I don't I didn't mention this earlier in our pre-show talk, but I My role is difficult to describe. I run engineering systems for an org of about 250 people and We don't have any dedicated QA. In fact, we have a lot of people doing testing. They're also called developers and many of our developers for the parts of our Our product that are in UI are using test cafe and I have played with it in the past for some prototyping And I have to say I'm a fan so I am curious why in a world where Selenium is ubiquitous. Did you like what was the Where'd you where'd you come from here? Well, the thing was this is my word. This is probably about seven years ago now Yes, we we developed Web controls controls for web applications so, you know the boring things like menus and buttons and all that kind of stuff we have a theming thing we have grids and spreadsheets and Previews and dashboards now and all that kind of stuff and the big problem without this is yeah, we can write our own Tests or the developers can write their own tests to a certain extent when you're talking about things like unit tests or integration tests and so on a functional testing but When you're talking about the web as I'm sure you both know and all everybody listening knows You're not actually running the web app on its own. You're running it inside a browser and We ran into the problem with Selenium Which I'm sure a lot of people run into is in order to test an application say test your user interface you've got to Install something inside your browser. I think it's called web driver or something like that and And that becomes a problem. You can't just you know start up a browser and say, okay Let me test this particular piece of my application or this particular piece of the UI Am I getting the right results from my back end and so on so forth? and so we we started to run into these problems and Pure JavaScript controls were originally written for the mobile market so we talk about phones which were tablets and all that kind of stuff and Selenium tablets the phones No, so we had to basically come up with an idea Some kind of tool that we could use to test our own user interface controls on mobile devices Automatically and You know put it inside our continuous integration Service and all that kind of stuff. And so we started off in test cafe I remember when we first launched it. I think was 2013 There was a big conference in San Francisco an HTML 5 conference or some description and so we had a booth there and we were showing it off and and I had my my Kindle and You know, we were showing everybody that oh it runs on this laptop that we have here and there's Julian with his Kindle Look, then test cafe was working on the Kindle Yes, we love doing stuff like that And it kind of grew from there really people got enthusiastic about it The thing is with test cafe, I'm sure you know is you write your tests in JavaScript So not only you writing JavaScript for your web app You're also writing JavaScript for your tests You're not having to learn something new. You're not having to install something new. It's just You know, it's no JS essentially a nice framework for no JS Can install it with NPM and you know, it's dead easy and as I say you don't have to install Anything on the browser to make it from the test The thing was that you know at that point We realized there were a lot of people out there who would like it even We just have a user interface which ran in the browser and People saying yeah, but you're not doing this you're not doing that So we basically stopped developing user interface and we decided to create an open source framework for test cafe And Then once that was popular create a better dashboard style or studio style Interface for recording tests and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, you can you can download it from GitHub it's open source project. We get a lot of Feedback from from people who are using it and so on so forth it's It's been a it's been a journey Yeah, so I briefly my experience touched on this a little bit in our pre podcast talk, but Many years ago when I was still at Microsoft as a Microsoft for a long time with Brent That's where we met tonight. I've moved on from there about three years ago. I My last job there. I ran a team where the developers were using Slow down protractor for an angular website and one of the things that Bugged me was that the only browser we could get all of our tests to run on consistently was Chrome There were various issues with Firefox more issues with ie and granted. This is now five or six years ago Five well three four four or five years ago. I can do the math here So when I got a chance to prototype test cafe just to let you know My experience as a user it was NPM install test cafe Open some you look at the docks write a little code go Oh, wow, this just runs and then try a different browser and it just runs and I wrote more extensive tests And not only did I write I just wrote a little Basic test for one page to create some random project names for us. This was an angular set at the time and It was pretty easy to get a basic test up and running Ended up having to do a lot more and I'm gonna really anger the Selenium crowd I'm not against Selenium as everybody knows we had Jason Huggins on the show last year to talk about it's a lot of value to it But as far as quick Getting things up and running it worked really well for me and those tests ran with only one Air when someone pulled them out and dusted them off to build on them Six or eight months after I wrote them. So I think that's a testament to How well things work? I'm a little bit removed from that but I remember in Selenium a lot of waiting for elements to appear which You have to do a little bit of a test cafe But it's a little smarter about not needing to write these massive nested Weights and checks so a big fan. So this is all leading to a question. So when I first used test cafe, I posted Eventually Alan gets somewhere. I posted to Twitter and said hey because I haven't done a lot of web automation. I Said I've used test cat facings to work pretty well and what am I missing? What's what? Why isn't this a bigger deal and the feedback I get from my followers who use And others who are forwarded. There's a lot of Selenium folks out there We're really just two things and maybe watch you address these and kind of get rather than my opinion your opinion One was which I will actually argue with first one was will it inject JavaScript into your website? So it's not the real site customers are seeing I thought that is and just I'll just dismiss that one is lame but the second one is But web it doesn't use webdriver and webdriver is w3c c standard w3c standard and My answer to that was so and they said but it's a standard and I said so and they said but it's a standard But you may have a better answer to that question. So I'll leave you with that to comment on My my viewpoint Just to go back. I mean we create these user interface controls written in JavaScript for web applications And the thing is we don't just say these controls only work in Chrome or Firefox or Safari or whatever edge. Yeah, that was the other one edge. Ha Yeah, we say it's you know, it's a User interface control for the web and it should work in any browser and what we get is if we get it wrong We get you know a support question or whatever it happens to be. Hey, I'm using this version of Safari and your web Your user interface control doesn't work And so we have to basically, you know Boot up some Safari or other and check it out. The problem is Once you fixed whatever issue it was in whatever particular browser it was You've got to repeat that test forevermore It's part of your test suite at that point because you don't want to revert to a buggy Version and so on so forth So that's you know emphasizing the fact that Yes, web driver may be W3C Compatible and all the rest of it, but it's not in every browser It's not there if I download and install Firefox, it's not there you have to then install something else and And you know if I come my I'm old-fashioned. I've got an iPhone 6 It's you know, the operating system is version 12 of iOS not version 13. It won't go up any further so at some point, you know I'm just saying We're going to create a user interface control or some feature and other and it's just not going to work on my iPhone 6 And i'll be able to say okay guys, you know sort this out but with selenium until If you like the web driver becomes like um The big thing everyone's talking about these days is wasm web assembly Every browser now has web assembly built into the browser so you could now write applications Which target web assembly fine? web driver is not like that and um, so You know for us in particular Uh emphasizes the fact that we needed something which went beyond Um what selenium could do because we have customers out there across the world Using a wild variety of different browsers, so we cannot Just say oh, sorry. You're using internet explorer 11 You would believe the number of people you still use internet explorer 11 Um, I would because i've run those Because we had to when I when I had web apps At microsoft I would look at browser percentage and at the time again four or five years ago At I was surprised how many people were running ie8 Yeah, absolutely. I mean it is it can be absolutely crazy, but then you start thinking about okay It's a legacy app and you know, we haven't upgraded all our users So on so on so on I mean, I wonder how many people out there are using the new microsoft edge for example if they're using edge Did they actually do the extra step to install this brand new chrome based edge? Brand you you're probably using chrome edge Uh not by purpose. No Do you call it credge internally? No, we do not we do not I'm gonna offer that up for free Just pass that along to satya or the ie team directly If it goes that way it's already going to get translated to frames internally. Oh, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said microsoft I'm sorry. Credge for business No, so like the the uh I do think going with the chrome Architecture was a net positive for edge Uh, I don't think there's much disagreement there not for me No, no but Like to me, I think there's a bit of a branding problem right now because I think the majority About if I were in the right position Once I made the decision to go with the chrome back in I would have rebranded Right because I think I think edge is synonymous with pain in in the world market That's just my opinion and satya listens to this and what's the question me on it? Um, I'll still stand by that even though I have no data to prove it one way or the other um couple couple of things, uh So i'm currently stocking julian on linkedin Oh and I see he actually has spent time at microsoft as well Yes, that was a while back I was at microsoft for about a year. Um I was brought on um because The visual studio team were about to release visual studio 2003 And if you know your visual studio history, there was no visual studio 2003 because there was a major cockup And so it became visual studio 2005 and so I was brought into you know in theory to provide I was program manager to provide ideas and thoughts about what the next version of visual studio would would have and Would be doing and so on so forth except that I was brought in and everything had been decided and We were doing visual studio 2000, what's it called? Um codename whitby It's kind of interesting. I remember these things. Wow. Yeah C-sharp was getting um generics. That was the big thing about it I remember when generics came out those were cool. Uh, So you remember when wittaker was in dev dev Was it around that time frame? It might have been so barton barton was running their massive qa org But when did I don't remember when wittaker's first stint at microsoft began and ended? But yeah about that time he actually might have come a little bit later Yeah, was was tfs a thing then julian? Tfs was just starting It hadn't the team foundation server I I I No, that was later i'm sure i'm trying to get back now I mean i've i've been with dev express now 14 years. So it's like you know I forgot I forgot most of those days at microsoft. It was uh, It was fun, but I just didn't fit in at that particular point. Unfortunately, so all right I had to give your yearbook away. No, that makes that makes perfect sense like like um You know, he started this question with sort of a web driver Is the standard thing right in in the somewhat of a? cyclical argument in my view standards change right, uh, I Just happened to be looking uh Uh in right now I found a page that talks about laws that have changed Right there was a law apparently in washington in 1969 where it Made it a felony and punishable by five years in prison if you um Slayed bigfoot Where are you going with this? No, I I'm just Which page you've got up? So so that law that law was in 1969 In and in the context back then there was there Either this was a complete joke or Uh in in the people who passed that a lot had nothing else better to do or there was some evidence or a real strong belief That bigfoot is a creature that needs to be protected. My my point is is that as time advances? We create new tech new standards need to be Uh Standards need to be reconsidered right, um Qa certification Right. There's still a lot of standards in in in the eu around qa certification And and as an example i'd make a large argument that those standards are Contradictory, uh to to many marketplaces today Not all but many I I I Alan you you sort of just immediately bit flip the javascript argument. Likewise. I bit flipped the web driver argument um, alan Well, actually i'll i'll ask one question that i'm very curious about so Dev express targets deaths, right? We we talked about at the very beginning. It's very fascinating What about test cafe? Specifically do you have any sort of sense of If you can share this sort of your your customer segmentation around Uh a developer versus a a traditional Uh ui tester or ui automator Uh, so So let me let me approach that in in a slightly weird way Originally, we wrote test cafe for developers because we as a company market to developers essentially um As I said, we do user interface controls across the board and so originally test cafe was targeted towards developers and those developers would be Fairly proficient in javascript as I said we're talking about five six seven years ago um and what we found was that The developers were saying This is too simplistic um For us to use you've got to broaden it and you've got to Make it easier to program to Um, and so on so forth. So that's why we split test cafe away from its user interface to a pure javascript framework essentially And that was made open source and blah blah blah blah And then we went back to the user interface to say Okay We know that developers will um I'm going to say the word enjoy using test cafe because You know, they're writing web applications and writing some javascript and they know javascript and they can write javascript to do their tests brilliant Now we have to target those people who Maybe don't know javascript as well but are Qa people testing people people who basically are If you like away from that developer mentality and go How is this application really going to work and how easy is it to use and how can we test the usability of this application Easily and quickly which is when we produced test cafe studio, which has basically a visual test recorder So yeah a developer could go in with the studio and say all right Here's my web page and i'm going to press this button i'm expecting this to happen and you know these Elements to be updated and so on so forth and they could actually just record that using the visual Test recorder instead of actually, you know trying to write the javascript and Oh, they're using or really and they need You know an extra bit of code to actually access the elements and and so on so forth so we originally started targeting developers, but with the User interface either studio side or It's going to migrate into a kind of dashboard type application um You know, we're we're then Basically saying okay developers you have a qa team Um who may not be as proficient in javascript as you are And you don't want them to come to you to say write me this test, please because i've got to run it You know add infinitum every day uh in my integrated test suite um that's The whole point where we thought okay, we have to target um Uh the testing environment in these companies these uh corporations and make it easier for them to Create a suite of tests to run that suite of tests as part of some integration um and So on so forth so it's um We're not we're not saying Oh developers you've been doing it wrong. Here's a great new studio, which will help you do it better And we're not saying to the testers. Oh, i'm sorry. You don't know javascript that well Here's something to make it easier for it. No, we're basically saying Writing tests is I mean, there's so many different types of tests you've got you know, as I said units integration tests functional testing Which is very developer based um performance testing Hmm in usability testing the thing that fascinates me most and um, uh as uh Cto at dev express no I'm very into usability Unfortunately these days I don't do much development Um, you know, I started off years ago as a developer, but I don't do much development nowadays. So I tend to look at things from a User standpoint more than a developer standpoint so usability testing for me is is something that's interesting and um I I really want to get more into and um, you know to be able to look at our particular controls and to say Yes, they're usable if the user Comes across an application written with our controls. They know how to use the application. They're not searching around You know the window going well, what do I do to do this? It gets obvious um, and you know test cafe is all about that it's uh, um, especially the studio side of things it's the ability for um Qa testers to actually Write tests which show that an application is usable and continues to be usable so I don't know the state of the art today on test recorders when When I started this this was back in oh my god ms test was when it started Ooh Are those who remember that? I I I was a beta user um and one of the traditional problems with this is they were They were absolutely great for very quickly creating a bunch of repeatable tests As long as your developers didn't check in any changes Uh, then it very quickly then it very quickly became a maintenance nightmare often with people who didn't understand Uh the code being produced um What's the what's the state of the art on? that that's That's that's that kind of a broad question because if you like we suffer from that from our um, you know main um thrust of our um our company is Breaking changes, you know, we're we So let's say we produce a control Um people like it and they want some changes and they want this feature and that feature and all that kind of stuff It's very easy at that point to say, you know We thought about doing abc with this control at the beginning but it turns out that c is not really required it really ought to be d and We make the change and it's a breaking change and Yes, we have to tell our Customers that yet there is a breaking change Uh, it won't work in the same way as it did in the previous version and all that kind of stuff and the one thing about test cafe video Test recorder is that it's actually writing the stuff as javascript in the background So it's not some weird and wonderful Database there and we're just doing some wacky sql to Put the test into the database and all that kind of stuff. No, it's just a javascript file so In one sense, it's uh fairly easy to make changes Yes, the developers can do something which will break a test as the test broken because the change made was Um bad or was the breaking change a good breaking change in this case you have to change the test for sure and it's easier to change the test if it's just You know language, you know and can just quickly change or re-record the test with the new Um new outcome that you're expecting from this new feature Yeah, so to build on what with what brent asked and as answer part of it myself in the old days of windows ui automation People would change an id of a control or the tab or a tab order or something that would screw up all your automation in the web world brent the If people Have auto generated or randomly named or or usually unnamed controls things get weird even in test cafe I had one control in that little suite. I wrote that didn't have an easy way to access so I had to make a constant with with the Totally ugly selector name and we went back and changed it later But the way you get around those tests breaking is you you give your controls ids with sensible names That makes them easier to access So which is one of the reasons I think it's critical Whether you're using selenium or test cafe or any of the other tools around this is that for that Unit level that basic bvt of ui wouldn't be unit level test But that basic bvt of ui like are my controls there and they do I'm beginning not testing logic is the stuff where I want it to be Have the devs write that because they're going to feel that pain right away and go fix Yeah, and I mean We don't have qa on our team, but if they if they go oh wait, this is stupid Why am I doing it this way? That's such an efficiency boom rather than the if you have a like there are some organizations where a tester writes test cases and an automation team goes to automate them and the back and forth between those layers and the developer Just it's it's an inefficient game of ping pong that drives me nuts So let's take care of and maybe if you have that automation team, which i'm not a fan of I'm not against having qa teams. I think it makes sense, especially in a in a ui centric application, but get that basic Testing that that first level of testing done by the dev team have them own those tests Because if not you're going to be playing a constant game of back and forth and back and forth the entire time you're building your product And it's just a horrible way to make software That's a that's a good point actually And one of the things we discovered is yes Uh test cafe will record a test saying is the 13th child of this particular parent because you haven't actually given it an id And yeah, something will break pretty quickly at that particular point Um, which is why we also have Not only pure if you like css um Classes and ids that we can search for and use and all that kind of stuff. We also have the ability to um have Format format framework specific Um selectors, so if you're using react for example react is If you like notorious for hiding things from you because it creates an old separate dom and you know What do we do about that in test cafe? Well answer is we have a react plugin if you like which knows about react and knows how to get uh to a particular control or a particular element in the react dom tree to be able to ascertain its status and What it's showing or whatever But yeah, that's an excellent way of putting it if your developers can't write the test then Nobody else could Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance a book on the philosophy of quality basically says quality and care are two sides of the same coin If I look at my work, if I look at a string of random Glued greater than signs and strings that that that is a thing in my test. I am not proud of that work Right, and I want to be proud of what I make whether it's a test or production code or or even a project I like to be proud of my work. Uh, I want to Ask you a different question And I think it's fair for because again a lot of people I don't I don't think it's any mystery to you. There are more selenium users and there are test cafe users I haven't looked up that number, but I'm pretty sure I can say that I feel I have a high confidence. That's correct What are some for the selenium crowd maybe because i'll get questions about this maybe let's preempt some of those What are some things you think selenium does better than test cafe or or or a reason you would use selenium in some instance over test cafe? that's a question that I really could not answer because I Personally have never used selenium. So I I I just don't know. I am to officially outsource that question then because I don't know either I I mean I get I get the point that selenium has been around the longest so So actually I have one maybe we can talk through because I haven't thought about this But I think I think I can talk through it. Maybe you can help me with it is One of the things that were built on top of selenium is selenium grid the ability to have a basically a server farm run a whole bunch of things you test across a whole bunch of browsers and a whole bunch of permutations I'm as I say that because I brought i'm just trying to think I think I could duplicate All of that in a modern ci system Is that something that's come up with you? Has anybody ever asked like I want to run this across on every build across 16 different browser and os flavors Would they just use test cafe on something like browser stack or like what will be your what would be your answer to that? That question that's something that we are continuing to improve. Let's put it like that the ability to run Test suites concurrently and it's Quite unquite difficult, but it's still it works at the moment. We The other thing is to go back is We get an awful lot these days Of people are using sites like source labs To run their application on multiple different mobile devices And yes, we'll do that in quite parallel. Uh, unquote Um Which again, you know selenium is more geared towards your desktop browser Experience and not necessarily. Oh i'm running it on a very smaller Very smaller and a smaller screen and you know, these things disappear until you hit the hamburger menu Icon and stuff like that The way test cafe works is it uses a proxy server essentially so It's end-to-end testing and test cafes in the middle. So If your browser asks for a particular, you know HTTP request test cafe receives the HTTP request recognizes it sends it on to the actual back end And then when the back end replies will then pass that reply over to the browser and um Um You know inject if you like it's uh its own test, uh information Uh so that it can verify that test is running. Okay, and all the rest of it that server proxy server will work with multiple browsers at the same time So you can basically with test cafe set it up so that You know it'll run even on a desktop Chrome and firefox and edge all at the same time running the same test for the same application and so on so forth But I would guess that selenium if you like does it better because it's it's an actual application. It's uh, you know, it's Giving the whole hog as it were Yeah, I think in So let me talk through this. I haven't thought through this completely but because the installation is just an npm install Yeah, uh, it's it makes it fairly easy. Well, not fairly makes it extremely easy to add to my My ci workflow. I just added I add a step that's Uh, there's a setup step for npm install and then it runs the test results get reported and I can definitely in parallel send that that that step to multiple locations whether it's on a farm or Or I can specify where I want those to run. So that should work and i'm sure and again I have used selenium protractor fairly extensively, but again, this is years ago. I I don't have the data But uh, my experiences are similar, but i'm actually looking forward to hearing Uh what our listeners have to say and if you're fairly new to the podcast if you go back to About a year ago one of the early posts from 2019 I think that's what it was. We had jason huggins on the podcast in response to a tweet Actually, this was better brought up a minute ago. We're talking about ids I had come across a blog post and someone talking about how they solved the problem in selenium And they're very proud of this code And I looked and talked about looking at code and saying am I proud of this? They were very proud of code that I thought was ugly Unfarrassingly ugly. It was a long string of Of the selector they had to choose to get it get access to the control And I tweeted something crass like reason 438 why I hate selenium And the community exploded against me and told me I I couldn't hate selenium and it's not I don't actually I I think selenium is great Uh, it solves it solves a huge problem What I didn't like is that it enabled that stuff. This is true also in test cafe but it started a nice little war, uh, one of the the contributors to web driver was extremely mad at me and and gave me uh, I'll just say some grief over twitter and I We ended up having jason on the show to talk about it and he was actually he was super pleasant and he got it and He asked he tried to bait brent and I with a uh, a question Well, should should selenium just not support selector? So that make it easier said no We should you've you've you have legacy of a million different tests. You can't just go break them Uh, I think in a way he was acknowledging it that part kind of created a monster But the point I wanted to make was not that I hate selenium Uh, I hate hated the way it was being used the way people like again going back to my statement before which is Don't don't settle for having to access controls like that And I got all kinds of well, we can't get developers to do that Okay, if you if you're not collaborating with your development team if you're in a dedicated testing role and you're not collaborating with your dev team That's the problem Solve that problem. You'll solve all kinds of other things, too so anyway, uh We we support everyone if in fact I will put an open invitation out If someone wants to come what else wants to come on the show and tell and tell me why? uh Why selenium is so much more awesome than test cafe? We could do that too and I will offer that to you julian as free competitive analysis I'll tell you I'll tell you if you if you want to do that that's somebody on and uh have me be there as well and You know have a big discussion about this versus why and i'm gonna even go more meta on this and say uh Don't use a tool because it's the one everyone else is using don't follow someone Because that's the guy you think you want to follow form your own opinions Whether it's around philosophy approach quality Test automation tools do your research and form your own opinions. I can tell you i've formed mine and mine is that uh test cafe is very easy to use and Consistently runs my tests across every browser. I could throw at it It does seem to me that intellectual laziness and In the knowledge work business is a great way to limit your career Um one million percent. Yes The and then for those listeners who are curious Alan's uh ui rant was episode 102 And the follow-up 103 was the one with Jason I I will look up those and um, um listen to them afterwards. I just like to say, um I had a thought and it's gone. Um, it sounded like me No, it's completely gone Actually, I was looking at um angry weasel ab testing the website and um You are responsive or the site is responsive. So it's a word. It's just a wordpress site. Yeah Actually, I should bring this up I used to give a workshop at conferences called tools you can use a bunch of different tools that any tester could use for testing And I use test cafe as part of that i've since open sourced that I know one of our listeners chris kentz has Given that workshop and anyone can but I used a quick little test cafe script uh to do some automation of angry weasel.com and And show that as a demo like this is this is how easy it is. It was not very much code Yeah The I I just remembered what I was talking about. Um You were saying about, um developers um not being um Exploratory enough if you like and just plumping for whatever everybody else is using Um, this is something that we we come across with regard to our trial versions Essentially the trial versions of our products are there so you can Play around with them and see if they're actually going to suit your particular application your particular company and uh Whether you should actually buy them and all the rest of it and I always say to developers when they're When they're saying well, you know, why why should I buy yours and not? Um, you know competitive be your competency And I just say to be honest, you know writing user interface controls You have two audiences you have the user and you have the developer and So play around with it use it as a developer And show it to your users and see if they like it and the same thing with test cafe essentially Try it use it You know do a Contest if you like between selenium or cypress or one of the other big ones Uh versus test cafe How easy is it to use? Does it suit your particular application? Does it suit suit your particular? environment And Go from there if you plump for one brilliant I'm not going to argue with you if you say, you know, we did a test we checked, you know You versus selenium versus cypress versus weber and we like selenium better fine, brilliant you actually did the work to say that Selenium was better and i'm not going to argue with that i'm not going to jump up and down and say well we use javascript We use javascript You know, you know, it's it's nothing nothing to do with that. I Goes back to that whole, you know writing crappy code or whatever or writing Code which you look at and go. Holy cow. Is there any way to make that simpler? Uh, maybe if I switch my framework, it would be simpler to write and to maintain and to use and all that kind of stuff but at that point it's you and your developer mindset Whichever thing works best for you go for it Yeah, same same advice for me Yes, brandt. Sorry. Yeah, this is to julian Julian has so are you familiar with the work of nicole forstman? She recently published a book called accelerate I just like to point out now for our listeners. This is the 37th podcast in a row. We've mentioned the book accelerate Go on brandt. Yeah, we we Um, so what she did is she went back and did A research study around sort of typical agile practices and she concluded many interesting things um one of them was that Uh developers owning their testing Owning the testing for a company was highly correlated with Uh the company's success and productivity uh, however qa owning the the tests uh was not at all correlated with highly valuable business results and um This is somewhat towards the salimian salimian comment and perhaps test cafe But I wonder if if companies in your sorts of business Shouldn't in some regards help your your customers? um I need those sort of goals. Uh, meaning Right. Sure. If you don't have an id Uh, if you don't have ids we're gonna fall back and we'll still succeed within test cafe But now you're gonna have the high maintenance Uh version of your recorded test rate. Um I'm wondering if things like annoying warnings or or or something along those lines to sort of Start changing the their engineering behavior towards towards things that are that are known to produce positive business outcomes like it seems to me Uh if test cafe was able to say Hey, we not only just do tests, but we actually help you change Uh the culture of your business Right. We're an ally to your business as well as our own anyway That's an interesting viewpoint and i'll have a chat with the developers. We already produce a Uh a product for c-sharp developers and javascript developers called code rush which Helps you analyze your code and suggest ways of improving your code like it already and That seems to be or what you're saying there brent seems to be something that we could do with test cafe whereby as a An example like the stupid example I gave earlier, you know instead of hey, you're selecting the 13th child of this parent Why don't you give it a name? And here's a name for you or something like that. Let me that's an interesting viewpoint And I I've just bought it on amazon and it's coming tomorrow. So there you go. It's a great book Um, okay, that was my turn to forget what I was going to say as a photo Yeah, it's the end of the week Mind you every day seems to be the end of the week Oh, yeah. No, my my recurring comment there is every day is tuesday Right. It's not monday. It's like the not the typical misery of monday. It's it's not oh wend's day Hey, we're halfway through it is most certainly not friday All right with with that I with us all being confused by the day of the week but not being confused on uh branch shut up But not being confused on having a great and fun time talking to julian today Uh, we need to close Well, thank you very much. Alan and brent for invite me on to the uh, the podcast. I I must say I enjoyed it very much We're super glad to have you here. And I uh, I say again if you uh invite somebody who wants to have a discussion A versus b then I'll certainly come back Yeah, sure. Let us know. Let us know. All right. Great. How do you hear? Brent what were you saying? I said hear that hugs We'll see if one of the listeners uh routes it to a Yeah, we'll see what happens and again I think it's I think again. I just want to close and say critical thinking blind faith in anything is Whether it's ideology or tools or anything in between is going to get you in a heap mess of trouble so with that message, uh Thanks again. Julian good talking with you brent And we'll talk to You too and our other three listeners sometime soon. Everyone say goodbye Bye, bud
