Hey, everybody. Howdy. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. Still, huh? Welcome to AB Testing. Especially welcome to our new listeners. I did a webinar last week and picked up a few new listeners. AB Testing is your best podcast in the world for, oh well, actually nothing. AB Podcast. Going gently to sleep at night. AB Podcast is a possibly interesting podcast for those interested in software quality. Agile testing and what Brent and I call modern testing. We talk about everything from test management, leadership, agile quite a bit, software engineering, tools, favorite colors, squirrels. And data science. And data science. Look, Brent, someone's talking about data science. We did pick up a few new listeners, as I mentioned a moment ago from, I gave a webinar on Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Yes. Okay, that correlates. Because Webinar Wednesday rolls off the tongue where that alliteration did not happen. You know what? It really should be. I mean, that works perfect. Well, interestingly enough, I don't even know which direction to go. The tangents are going to start. I gave the webinar on Tuesday for AST on the use and abuse, capital AB for AB testing, abuse. Test automation, give a lot of my rants, got some good feedback on that. I was really happy with the way that went. Webinars are always tough because you can't read the audience. And just to challenge myself again, doing another webinar next Tuesday. Not the next week I'm skiing, the following Tuesday, the 27th I'll be giving a webinar. I put the link on Twitter, but I'll put it in the show notes today. It's on the future of test automation. I'm doing it with Orin, whose name I can't remember, who is the CEO at TestM, test.im, who make a tool for applying machine learning to testing. Nice. Yeah, I need like that part. But yet we have some different ideas on where things are going. My ideas are very much aligned with what you and I talk about with modern testing. I was a little concerned when you mentioned that you're doing two person panel for that one. And I'm like, okay, who's this guy? But now I feel a lot better about what this panel could be. And what's really cool if you want to watch it is there will be a demo of his tool at the end, which normally I don't like, ah, marketing thing. But he and I, we've actually prepped for this thing. We spent some time talking about questions that may come up and actually preparing for this thing, which is a new thing for me. Wow. There is crazy crap going down the diesel end. How does that work? So it may actually be all right. Nice. We already have a lot of people signed up to help more of the three listen. Brent, again, for the new listeners, I've mentioned the three a few times. Can you tell our new listeners what that means? Yes, it's very simple. We have three listeners and we affectionately refer to them as the three. And if any one of you asks a question, we say, oh, you're one of the three. Absolutely. It's kind of like, I don't know, Jimmy Buffett calls his guys the parrot heads. And then Justin Bieber has one. Who is this Justin Bieber? Some stupid kid from Canada. Yeah, that sort of thing. I'm going to Canada next week. I can't say dumb things about Canadians, perhaps, are listening. Or perhaps they'll just apologize for Justin Bieber. Well, yeah, they have several people to apologize for. Oh, like we don't? Like we don't? No, no, for sure. For sure. I was thinking Celine Dion. Anyway. Oh, Brent, Brent, Brent, we're going to make so many people mad. We're going to have two listeners next week. We always have three. Early on in our podcast, Brett and I would joke about our three listeners and then people would. It was actually our first episode. Was it really? It was. Maybe we'll get three listeners. But then people, we kept on stuck and then people would go, hey, I'm one of the three. And it kind of developed. So that's where that came from. If there are other things you don't know about us, you want to know, you're welcome to ask us questions for the and Brent trashed hands on this for the mailbag and some ways to get mailbag questions to us. I know Brent's going to bring this up in a minute. So I'm not going to leave even an ounce of silence in my talk. So he cannot get any words in. But the way you get information to the mailbag and to us to answer your question, to give us something intelligent for once to talk about is to either ping us on Slack. I'm Alan Page, A-L-A-N-P-A-G-E. And Brent is Brent M Jensen, Jensen with an E or you can... You have to breathe sometime, Alan. ...email me at Alan, A-L-A-N-P-A-G-E. And I'll take it there. In fact, I had one question there from the webinar I was going to answer today, but I'm not going to. I'm going to save it for another mailbag and I'm really not going to give you a chance. And we're going to go on. In fact, the rest of the show... I'll just sit here in time. We also have a Slack group, one of the three.slack.com. You will need to use one of the aforementioned communication methods to get me your email address so I can send you an invitation. Happy to have you there. All three of us discuss things about the show, about things related to the show. It's a good little micro discussion. And as I found out this week, some people join the Slack channel just to get an A-B testing sticker. And yes, if you join the Slack group and you find your way there and you join the channel called I Want a Sticker and you post your address, eventually, usually fairly quickly, but eventually I will send you A-B testing stickers. If you are listening and you posted your... You didn't think I'd do it this long, did you, Brent? If you are listening, I had three people post their addresses this week and those went out in the mail yesterday, so look in your mailbox. Okay, Brent, I have to breathe. And in the episode, this episode comes out... Oh, actually, I can't predict. You gonna finish it today? Yeah, I'll get it out. It'll come out on Sunday, probably. Okay, so... It may come out... If you're listening to this episode, you'll need to figure out how to go back in time because Alan committed to shipping all the stickers out today. Yeah, if there's any more posted today, I'll get them out tomorrow. I'm driving to Canada on Sunday, possibly according to the weather forecast in a snowstorm, but we'll see what happens. Whistler? Going to Whistler. Nice. Favorite ski place. Last time I was there, my 19-year-old was three. I've gone every year for about the last eight years. I really... Yeah, it's my therapy. It's how I get through the winters. Okay, oh, is this episode 76? Episode 76. Not that we're counting. So, what would, on your webinar, what was the key things people were questioning about? I can post a link to the recording. I have to remember now. So, the webinar was about all my grabs about test automation. In fact, much of it was based on many of the things I rant about in the A word, free on Lean Pub. Yep. You notice how, like, I had AB in the webinar, AB testing, abuse and misuse of test automation. One thing I did on purpose that maybe was too subtle is in the A word, that the A and the W kind of squished together a little bit like angry weasel. Look at you. I'm all... Subliminal. I'm the Illuminati. Questions were the typical things about what if management wants me to write UI automation? Well, you can change your manager or you can change your manager. Often, in the answer, of course, we talked about a lot is pilot, use data, don't be complacent, don't be afraid to make change. I... Branch? There's definitely... You asked. I know, I know. That one, if your manager wants you to write UI automation in particular, right, then you as the knowledge expert that he has hired, I think the onus is on you to correct your manager's understanding on the ROI of this topic. Sure, sure. And I've told the story, I think it was in How We Test Software at Microsoft. Remember that book? Yeah. Yeah. And, but I've mentioned a lot of times, it's my very first day at Microsoft, I was given a list of test cases and asked to run them every day. I said, when do you need these automated? They said, oh no, we don't have time to automate. But I automated them anyway, because it was the right thing to do. And I just did it... There are things like that where I will automate it, because I am not doing this again manually. Well, I think... Boy, we could go way off into tangent, you want to get to the main topic of community, which we started last time and didn't get as far as we wanted. So we want to go a little bit farther there. Yep. But as far as... We've talked about command and control and the spider and the starfish and empowered people and all these different things. But I think in knowledge work in general, one, management doesn't work if you just tell people what to do and just give them exact destructor. Here's what you do all day today. We're not building widgets in the factory. But that freedom, being able to take advantage of that freedom properly and knowing when to push back, I think is part of being successful in knowledge work. I don't think most... So management as a whole, right, is a command and control structure. But I don't think most managers are really wired that way. For example, every manager I've ever worked for, let's imagine... I work for you, Alan. Let's imagine I come to you and say... Oh, wait. I got this. Brent, you're fired. All right, great. So I work for another Alan and I come to him and I have two options for R101. One, I say, hey, Alan, I'm done with this. What would you like me to do next? Or two, Alan, I'm done with this. I'm thinking these next three things are the next things I should work on. Is there an order that you think would best value the business? Right? It's one of those things where I'm just like... A lot of the times, particularly I see it in tests, I think a big part of it is the... Well, we talked about the enablement loop or the disablement loop, where I think a lot of tests is just used to just getting instructions and they've gotten to the point that that's how they operate. I don't think... The optimist in me likes to think that's not as true as it used to be. I know it's not as true as it used to be. So delving deeper into Tangentville, I mentioned last time or time before, but anyway, sometime last month I met with my leads and then again met with my peers to discuss just people in the org and how they were doing. We're talking about levels and internally Unity has some levels which we're figuring them out so we don't really communicate them to people, but just helps us talk about people the same way, which I think is fine. We're in that part of growth. But what came out of that, and this is true of levels at Microsoft and those are the only two I'm intimately familiar with, although I've talked with people a lot about levels at Google and Facebook as well. But the point is that the point I was eventually going to make sometime down the road was that when someone's brand new, maybe out of college or barely or changing disciplines, they need more instruction. They need more hand-holding. They need to be sometimes like that first person you described. And then there's a maturity where they start figuring out what work to get done and they come to you to bounce them off you, get prioritization. And then there's that maturity continues. I spent until my last job, I spent where I was a little bit more of the micromanagy. Actually, even there I still figured out what I did still define all my own work. It was just a little more stressful environment. But I spent my last 10, maybe more years, maybe 15 years at Microsoft, defining and prioritizing all of my own work. And that was the expectation for someone at my level of seniority and maturity is that I should figure out what's the most important thing to do. And I was better suited for prioritization than my manager was. I made balance ideas off of him for bigger scale things like that may involve organizational change or affect a big number of people to get some feedback. But it was more of a discussion and brainstorming than it was a prioritization. So anyway, taking the subject away from me, because that's not what it's all about today, at least, is that that maturation happens. And I expect as people get more senior in their knowledge work and more experience that not only do they seek out and figure out what the most important work is to do, but they're able to prioritize it correctly most of or all the time. There is, I don't know if they're still active, but one of the best topics I've ever studied on this is, well, classes rather is situational leadership, which walks through the manager employee relationship on a particular task. And it's very similar to what you just talked about, right? A manager's job is to direct initially and then try to shift it over to more of a coaching style and then get the hell out of the person's way. But I don't think it's a person level maturity, but rather a topic level maturity. People at any level at any time are more than welcome and welcomed to with the tools that they have in their tool bag, identify problems, try to connect it to something that the business cares about, and then also bring forward with a solution. That's one of the biggest things I push my people towards, like look, as you and I have said on the podcast, ideas come from other ideas and good ideas can come from anywhere. You have to create an environment in which you encourage that to occur. So one of the things that I think is actually relevant to the topic today. I thought you were just about to lead into it. If ever we bring it up. You're practically segueing until now. So ideas can come from anywhere. The environmental context can help suppress people coming up with the ideas or sharing them. And at least I, and this is one of the issues with command and control, particularly with new managers. I see this a lot with new managers. They go, I am accountable, therefore I must make the decisions. Whereas my approach is I am accountable, therefore I must make decisions that are correct. And I don't necessarily presume that my decisions are. If there's a timeliness stuff, right, I still hold veto power. One of my favorite phrases on my team. As you know, I run a, I execute via a Kanban style. All the things we talk about around no specialists, no generalists. I live and breathe that on every single day. So I've created something. I don't know fully enough of how what Lisa talks about when she says whole team. But I certainly know the concept. But nevertheless, at times my team is reminded that I spend a lot of time and effort to make my team feel like a democracy, but it's not. So it's interesting to bring that up. I was just at a conversation yesterday as someone gave me actually a lot of parallels here. The one of the people on my team was going over his suggestion or he was working with the dev team and I'm, I'm hands on hands off. I'm hands on as a coach hands off as far as I think the team makes the decisions. I will give strong suggestions, but I won't very few if I can recall any, I'll bring them up, but mandates like we're all gonna do this. Like let's go in this direction. You're on board? Okay. I'll help you get there. So the question was around setting up a Kanban board. Okay. And I had some suggestions on like if you don't, I think if you don't do this, this will happen. But it goes, so it sounds like you want to do this. I said my suggestion is you have a way to handle this and here's one way to do it. The decisions yours. And I realized I do that a lot. I try, I don't try and make decisions for people even if they ask me to make it for them because I want them. One of the things I think helps people grow in maturity and grow in leadership skills. I think when you're in modern testing and you need to be influential over your team, having leadership skills are important. And I found the only way to get good at decision-making is to practice decision-making and practice making changes that people may not be comfortable with. The Heffetz quote from leadership on the line, I use a lot. People nod their head. They laugh and they nod their head. His leadership is disappointing people at a level they can absorb. And Brett just nodded his head and laughed. That's what I get every time someone hears that. And it really is. If you're just complacent, not gonna get changed. If you're, I know leaders who say this we're doing this, this is what we're doing, and people are, they're not on board. It's too much disappointment at once. And the right things don't happen there either. But you want to keep people, I mean, for organizational change especially, there's a level of uncomfortableness where you actually get the most productivity and the most change. Something to think about. There's almost every book on the planet around business project management. We'll talk about that. That you make them just a little uncomfortable. You get a lot more productivity. I often change absorb to tolerate. I think leadership is disappointing people at a level they can tolerate. I think it's, to me that one works a little bit better, but it's the same thing. The issue though, like what you brought up with your discussion. And I do think it, this is an important one. Like if this individual had come to me, they would have start getting my speech on leadership. Because there's, you cannot come to me and ask for permission to be a leader. Right. It's no, like what they're saying is really, can I be the decision maker and hold you still accountable? No. That's not what leadership is. All right. Shall we start the episode? Sure. Okay, I'm gonna hit record. Just kidding. We wanted to continue our discussion from the last episode on community. A couple topics on the board, but I'll let you kick it off. So, because you have some notes Brent. Well, it's just the agenda. Last time we started talking about community and building community and Alan shared a lot of his experiences. But the question that was asked of us was rather deep. There's a lot of subtlety there and we felt it was worthwhile bringing it up again. I don't have the question written down, but in essence the question was, hey how do I create a community when my target audience is essentially testers who the person has observed don't see the need, aren't engaged, and want to be spoon fed. And I think the prior topic that we just had, well, it's not as much of a tangent on this one. Did we accidentally talk about something relevant? We did. That's so weird. Yeah. So, Alan, what are the problems that you see in constructing a community from ground up? Like we did spend a lot of time talking about the vision of how you build a community, right? You need to, and we talked about your approach, which we resolved as essentially we want to shift from a spider organization to a starfish organization. That's the vision. Now, today let's talk about the specific context, the test community that he's referring to here, and what would be the first step. So, I've spun up, we talked about my communities in Microsoft. I've spun up several, without realizing it, without intending to, I spun up several communities at Microsoft and then probably the best, as far as the most mature community, as far as any sort of community maturity model is my QA slash test community at Unity. But starting from scratch, you need a little bit of a shared, like what is the purpose of the community? First, we have a nice little mission statement you may have heard of at Unity, accelerate the achievement at Shipable Quality. I have heard this mission statement a couple times before. And it gives you a thing to rally around. And then, but even beyond there, one thing I've done at Unity, I probably do this by heart, but maybe three months in, about the time I was realizing it was a community, about the time I knew enough about the org to want to develop some rallying cries for us, I realized a couple points I wanted us to rally around. One is moving towards data-driven culture. We will use data to evaluate the quality of our product in production and use that to make decisions, get us close to the customer, etc. The paragraph follows that. But everyone knows that's very, very important. And I'm going to come back to something in a second. We will share our successes and failures with each other and use those to learn and get better. And that's pretty much it. And then I use the community, it's self-fulfilling, because the second one's about community, but I use the community to make that happen. And then there's some tactical things I've done to help build that community. And I want to go back and reflect on this process with some of my Microsoft communities as well. I think it'll be fairly similar. Let me change the scenario briefly, right? Because you have an advantage in this particular case, because you're the boss, right? If you need to... I thought you were going to say you're incredibly good looking, but I'll be the boss, okay. The last check that you sent me hasn't cleared yet, so there'll be no compliments today. And when you have a role of authority, there is absolutely an advantage, particularly if you know that this is your vision. My job is to create this community and then get it self-sustained and get out. So let me finish the Unity story. Then I'll go back and reflect on my Microsoft communities, which in no case was I the boss of. But also a scenario I want you to think about, and maybe it's aligned with that second one, is let's imagine that Tony, who asked this question, hired you to be a community consultant. Okay. And you were going to go to his company, spend a week there, and create a thriving community and then disappear. A week. So let me go through those scenarios in order. So let me finish the Unity story. I found ways to reinforce community. And this is weird. I did not come up with this idea myself, but the leads... Beer. My leads and I came up with this, mostly them. In fact, maybe all of them at our offsite last August. We had talked a lot about community before them. One of the things we've done, just sent out the 20th weekly newsletter yesterday. And the newsletter is, in this case, it's sometimes, not always, it's just something everyone needs to know. Like, or something about... We ship your thing. Here's our vision. Or no, because it's too many things going on. No. I don't welcome new people. I don't say things shipped. A lot of the initial newsletters were promoting something else we did for community, was get everyone together from around the world in one spot for a couple of days. That helped build community, helped get everybody on the same page, get everybody in alignment on things. A lot of times I just share articles, web articles about software quality or about being data driven, about things that align with our mission. And it adds some commentary and those are taking off. I start getting replies like yesterday, I sent one out and today I got, oh, you mentioned this. Have you seen these articles and some really cool articles? So that was cool. What I try to do, I don't do often enough yet, but remember my goal around sharing each other's successes and failures. So I try to, and each one, I don't get everyone, is to get someone to share something going on in their team. Like, hey, I use this. The last one was last week, a guy on my team put together, who's also occasionally one of the three. He was playing with using Grafana to map out web errors, 50X errors from one of our websites and saw an interesting number of 503s that shouldn't have been there. It's a static web page. And he dug in and found out, oh, this is a bug. And worse yet, it's a bug that could be exploited as a security issue. So it was just a nice little issue of like, I'm going to use this tool and I'm going to see what I discover. Ooh, look, I discovered something bad. And then here I wrote this up on this page in our wiki page on how you can do this yourself and test your own stuff out. So it's really good for sharing an experience of what you learned. And I like those things. Those things help build community. So I do some things like that. I make sure I celebrate in Slack, in our company Slack, the things that people do that align with our accelerate the achievement of a quality or moving towards being more data driven. Let me go back to Microsoft. I'll get to Tony eventually, where I ran a couple of different communities. Some from the beginning, some I joined and sort of took over. For some reason, I've fallen back on writing newsletters because I can do it very quickly. I enjoy writing. I can get newsletters people like done. So when I was in engineering excellence at Microsoft, I would send a monthly test newsletter to all testers at Microsoft. I don't remember a single one of those. Yeah, thanks. And we started doing a newsletter with the testing quality experts, quality and test experts community. I would include like bug. It was just some ways to get people interested as trying to grow, make that community self-sustaining got partially there. Eventually, someone took over the newsletter for me for that community died when TCN died. And I also did that much less frequently for the test architect group. But an Xbox also had a weekly weekly every other week. We did a frequent newsletter was that one was a lot of fun. It worked. I had a lot of people contribute articles and ideas for that. It was a way to share ideas, tools, concepts across the org. I did one of my best April Fool's newsletters was was in the Xbox org. I really need to dig that up sometime. Really happy with that problem. But it's just finding some ways to get people together. It could be meetings. It could be events. It could be beer. But finding a way to get to have one you have a mission or vision, a thing you want to accomplish together and a way to encourage people to be a part of that community contribute to the community and leverage leverage people leverage the community to grow. I think a community is a means to discover what you don't know. You don't know. You also get out what you put into the community. If you contribute and share your ideas, you're probably going to find more ideas that inspire you and help you create new ideas. So a bunch of things I want to. OK. And then I'll go on to what I do if I'm I'm a consultant for Tony. But go ahead and add your your stuff. Yeah. And it'll be good because I think it'll help frame your next topic. So a lot of the communities that Alan just mentioned. I was a member of one in particular. I'm thinking about the test architect group. There was one phenomenon that that that I noticed in that whenever it was the scheduled day for the community and Alan couldn't make it it got canceled. Right. So part of the problem in this particular case is Alan loves this stuff. He's very effective at it. But he ended up being the virtual leader. And when the leader wasn't there it didn't happen. And so one of the things why I say self sustaining right often is the goal. It's also saying is and one of the things I would I would actually. So a couple suggestions I have for you based off of the experience and what you just described for me. OK. Create a community of the newsletter producers and your first task is say hey I want the newsletter to go out every month. I want us to first figure out what is the principles around how it's going to be built because I want people to look at that and not tell not be able to tell that it was a different person sending them each month. And then the next thing we're going to do is figure out a rotational model. I was I will do the first few of them until we are happy with the iteration. But by the end of summer each of you guys is going to is going to take point and we're going to rotate through and you're going to own sending this. What you have to do is then use that command and control to force them to learn and to spread the next phase after that is how do you get them to want to maintain the rotational model. It would take longer than two podcasts for me to go through suggestions on that one. And I wouldn't even. I'll build on that. The last thing I would suggest to you is make a key section of your of your newsletter. Are you sending out monthly weekly weekly. OK. Make a key section of your weekly newsletter. The most glorious fail that occurred in your team and figure out a way to send that person a gift card or some sort of little incentive. Yeah I do agree that one thing we could do more of is I mentioned in my my principles is celebrate our successes and failures. Actually both internally and publicly I want to post more of what we're doing around quality and. You know services on the unity blog and we're getting there. But we don't celebrate the failures enough and we I do want to do more of that and it's harder to get people of course to to recognize those and thankfully we're not making very many epic failures. So that's good but yes I agree those things should be there. I agree that I want to add. No it's my turn now. And I also agree that. You do want a community of people distributing the newsletter. And I do agree you want to have a group of people that can send the newsletter. Kicking it off here for the first several months. I've been happy to do it I think it's the right thing for me to do it to establish a cadence to prove we can do it weekly to prove that we can get value from that. I'm stepping away next week and people are no problem. Stepping in and making sure there's a newsletter done while I'm gone and eventually they will contribute more more. They actually all contribute the article ideas. They they they get ideas for articles from their team and I play editor. A lot of times. And sometimes for light on stuff I have no problem just kind of writing a little mini blog post about because I read a lot of articles on the Internet that I find this to be interesting for the team. Let me add a little commentary to get them engaged in it and explain why it's relevant to our mission. And then they are pretty good about jumping in and getting some new ideas. You want to say something I want to talk about what I do for Tony's team. If I'm his consultant. Go ahead. Talk about Tony. OK Tony hires me to come in to help me build the community. I don't come into Tony's team and say OK I'm going to give you a newsletter. That you only have a week. I have a week. So the first thing I want to do is find out from Tony what's the goal of your community. We get paid six months later after they seem the result. Fine fine. All right. Good fine. I want to find out what. I would start with why. What do you want to accomplish. What's the reason for having a community. And I'm going to hypothesize that it's we have a lot of silo ism people aren't we have people working on the same things because they don't know what each other are working on. We're not people aren't learning as much as they could if they had a way to connect with each other. I say OK great. So let's come up with a. What's the mission of the goal for the community. And maybe it's we want given that criteria. We want to have a means of discovering what we don't know we don't know. And maybe we'll work. I'll work with Tony a little bit. This is all like over coffee in the morning. We'll come up with. As a test community of practice at Rungco widget factory. We want to share ideas with each other and use those ideas to develop bigger ideas that help us accelerate the achievement of quality or help us achieve our quality goals or help us whatever have a purpose for community have and something that's compelling and you think if I told people that the sum I think they go yeah that's something that we should do. I would start with that. And then I would meet maybe team by team depending on the org how big the org is now structured is I want to get some information from people on what their biggest challenges are and are their challenges being with their challenges be addressed by this community or would some of their challenges be addressed by this community and find out if the community idea makes sense for solving their problems. Chances are it will. But I don't know that I don't want to. Last thing you want to do is think OK we got to really push this community thing when it's not the biggest problem. Eventually community a community of practice if you will at a small scale. Someone pointed out an article this week on communities of practice I was talking about communities at a very very large scale which I think is a different beast entirely. So within a company that a small organization this community of practice can help solve a lot of problems. So anyway I've talked to people talk to some people on maybe maybe people that aren't even going to be in the community say what do you expect if we had a community of the testers in this or what would you expect that community to accomplish that they're not accomplished now and chances are if community is an issue they've seen things like well I talked to Joe and Cindy and they're both working on the same thing but they don't know they've there's no desire for them to connect and learn from each other. So once I have all that. Can you talk briefly. Because I think our listeners know very well we we care very much about learning organizations. But we've also spent a lot of time this episode and the last episode sort of framing community as something that is inherently valuable and I don't think it is. I think community is a means to an end. Sure. So why would the business care about you building a community. The business cares about continuous improvement and I think the business cares whether they know it's called this or not a learning organization. I think the business cares that about efficiency and I think the business cares about results. The last one community helps indirectly but everything else community helps directly. The community helps. I think it helps directly for results. Yeah. I think the biggest reason to form a community is to create a means by which people don't know what they don't know. OK. So community solves a knowledge sharing problem. If you if you're a bit you run a business and you realize that there is rampant duplication of effort you have two choices. Generally allow it to continue and let your leaders run their business as they see fit. Build a central centralized organization that's going to be responsible for this duplication of effort and force everyone else. I call that the WTF model. Windows test framework but a community is no less. It's more of an in between when it comes to business results. I realize as I we've been talking that I wonder if this community evolved for me over time and I wonder if starting with the idea of I need to build the community isn't what I in my consultant role at Tony's org isn't what I do. I would actually focus on. I would do everything I did before but I may leave after I talked to everyone leave Tony a list of here's some things you could do on your team that would help grow community potentially. But I maybe you have to plant a bunch of seeds to get the nucleus of the community going versus going. We're just going to start a community. Let me give you an example going way back. You reminded me that around the turn of the century seriously when I was working on starting with Windows Millennium and then moving on to Windows CE when I again actually I was a lead back then. So I had a fairly large org. One of the things I did was a weekly it started off as a group code review ended up being sort of show and tell and it isn't the kind of code review where you'd look at every single line and the kind we do day to day pure code review. This was more of a group show and tell where we'd sometimes mostly walk through code like here's architecture of how I built this thing or here's how it's working. That knowledge sharing a lot of it was oh there's a DLL that does this thing you're doing or don't you find some more big sweeping things those great opportunity for learning and sharing. But sometimes I had PM's on my team at the time program managers and they would go over more conceptual things they're working on like here's the way this framework is going to work. We had a CE test kit we gave developers and a PM on my team in charge of that and you talk about the direction and what it was going to do for our customers etc. But that show and tell we had a community again I was in charge ish but that even that was a form of community. So I'm going to leave Tony with is based on the problems there from his team. I'm going to look for ways where knowledge sharing may help and I might start right with knowledge sharing. You should do this group code review thing just get people doing it get it regular. I think people will latch onto it. It could be maybe we're going to do a test talk once a month and some someone or maybe it's Tony starting at first. We'll see if we get a few people signed up that have some good ideas and we'll get them to once a month talk for a half hour we'll bring in some snacks get people connecting and maybe a list of things that may help build community but maybe not even start with the goal of community because communities the means to an end on becoming a learning organization on getting ideas to mesh and learning new ideas. But I think if I had a week to kind of get things going I would and I'm going to be evaluated on how things are going in six months. I'm going to give Tony a fairly tactical list of here do these things for the next six months. It should take a fairly minimal amount of effort. It's going to take some effort. And let's see what's in the sea what builds over that time. Sure. Sure. I mean the value I would add to that I think I'll tell you the one thing that I've learned from Google and I've still not seen Microsoft do this. Tony talks about testers aren't engaged because they don't see the value and what you had to do is boil the frog here and find ways to get people to see the value on their own without you telling them. And I didn't say that directly. One of the reasons I want to talk to the individuals on the team find out what they're interested in what would engage them and make sure we have. I think if you might see someone is unengaged until you find the topic they care about the topics they care about and all of a sudden they have an opinion. Yes. Like the biggest problem with siloism is since your siloed you don't know what other people know. And I can guarantee you in any organization of sufficient size there are two people working on similar things that would prefer to work together to get it done faster. And the more you can use find those folks and get them connected and working together towards a common goal. That's your seed. You just need two people. Two people to use as an in-house case study and motivate them to succeed. Google does this practice. I don't know if they still do it but the weekly status report as I understand it everyone in Google every day or every Friday writes a status report. You and it goes into a public index. I love this idea. Which is then searchable. It's searchable. I people can go how many other people are working on a similar concept. Now you don't use terms like duplication of effort because that's jurisdiction and command and control and gets people defensive. You cannot build a community of defensive people. It's just impossible. But you can encourage and say hey maybe you guys can learn from each other or maybe you guys could kill this faster. One my particular team highly values knowledge sharing because I started off with pushing command and control. No you will write this doc. You will put it in one note. You will blah blah blah. And then they would discover like oh crap I had to fix this bug. I didn't write this code. Thank God. One note had documented who did it. What their approach was and what they're thinking. I could go and search one note and I got the answer immediately and I saw it and they knew it's that knowledge sharing actually had just saved them five hours of searching through get. So you start small and you begin to break down those barriers and that's how you get engagement going. I like the status report idea because it's then it's very easy to go. It's just scale and figure out which people have sort of a similar bent on topics of interest. The there is a great book on this topic. It's called influencer how to change anything. And it goes through and it talks about a very tactical set of steps that they've done studies on. And if you follow the steps it's a complex framework once you've practiced it a couple of times. I have deployed it multiple times. It is extremely effective. Their answers or rather their numbers show that it's a greater than 90 percent success rate in terms of executing a change. Influencer how to change anything again is the title of the book. If I'm fine good I'll put a link in but the rest you know how to use a search engine. Yep. To build a community you have to address simultaneously the extrinsic value. Why you're building a community. What what problem for the business is going to always start with why. And you also have to address the intrinsic value. Why is. All right. I'm going to build the community because I think Alan and Steve need to knowledge share and that the business is going to benefit be more productive. That's not a very good why. No. But you also have to address why Alan and Steve care. How you're going to get what's what's their motivation. What are they going to get out of it. And if you have a model and an approach that addresses both of these concerns and it's going to be very context sensitive. You can move forward. You know that it's a test community. If I were going into doing a test community I would start on something very tactical probably on the topic of modern testing like Alan's got this webinar. Hey check out this cool machine learning test case. I just spent last week and did your team's entire job using this tool. Yes I agree. Yeah. Find a way to get people engaged and think but first think about the problem you really want to solve and understand why building a community if that's your goal or what are the ways that will solve that problem. But always start with why. What are you going to do with it. And then of course make sure people are engaged understand why it's important for them. We are out of time. I am still Alan. And I am Brent. Thank you. We'll see you next time. Bye.
