Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show welcome to dance party you know it's the AB testing podcast hey everyone I'm Alan I'm Brent and this is 144 yes episode 144 not just a random number which is a perfect score of 12 by the way I tend to prefer our prime number podcasts when's the next one I don't know what no 20 no 147 49 might be how's it how's the the new gig well it's the same gig with the new boss and my org is growing I have yeah there's a unannounced reargue coming so I won't give the details on that but that'll put my org at about including open headcount about 130 140 somewhere in there Wow so my dog is joining the podcast everyone say hi to Tara Tara say hello hi Tara she can't hear you you're in there my headphones but it should make her wookiee sound here in a second it's going pretty well I like it works fun it's just an easy place to do good work as I've said many times so yeah work is good how are things going on your end work is work where we're in a phase where I don't know so right now there's a high urgency thing asked from the senior VP and it results in me spending a lot of my time building yet another dashboard and as you know that type of work really excites me yep yeah yeah yeah yeah I am I tried I play the hands when somebody's told me to build a dashboard I play the hands over my ears la la la la can't hear you game that works well for me I'm not sure what happens you know well for you yeah no so in this particular case I actually so the last time I said yes to this ask it was a big massive learning lesson I told my manager no I am NOT doing this again and this time around I had I had my staff come in and have them work on it but one of my peers is going on paternity leave and one of the things that I do pride myself on is I am good at training up people to be on the bench and so the person that I had targeted to to basically be the leader for this project that is not me was also on the bench and so she is now going to be while he's out on paternity she is going to be the acting manager of that team which I think is a fantastic opportunity and experience for her but it now puts me in the position of oh I have to be the IC for the stupid dashboard so you bring up one thing I was gonna push us along to the topic but this idea as a leader in building a bench and it's a term that's not every company uses it but I've heard it enough to know it's used pretty often it's this who is the level of leadership that is gonna take over for you when you leave move on to something else etc right and I've been working a lot on that I have a fairly junior team where I now have with a recent promotion I have one manager within two levels of me right now and working on getting everyone else where they need to be with the way you have one manager in an organization of a hundred no no no I have one that's within most both all of the rest of them are three levels below me latter level wise one is two levels below me I am trying to grow my org so right now there's no one if I disappear if I decide I want to go farm clams in would be island there is no one in my org that can take over for me as my org is planned to continue to grow throughout this year I have now one person who can take on a lot more leadership and some that are getting there but I'm spending a lot of time trying to groom my bench going back to the term of the bench again to get more people on my team capable and ready to take on larger more strategic roles yeah yeah I forgot I there was a reorg we had a lot of reorgues I actually have two two of my managers are within two levels of me but I don't I don't I'm not I put it this way I'm I do not have a good bench right now it's on my mind it's something I work on with my HR business partner as far as planning goes quite a bit to make sure we're moving in that direction when you say in within two levels of you do you mean lateral or yeah hierarchical I mean latter levels okay got it got it and and those I just want to I'll keep them abstract but it's you know similar to Microsoft is a level of scope and responsibility that people typically can cover as they grow through latter levels and you know I could solve the problem I'll just promote them but they're not already to handle the scope of that work so I'm working on that right right that's that's one thing that I I view very seriously with with promoting folks one cool anecdote to share I don't spend long talking about but we could actually if I could change the topic we could do a whole podcast on growing your team when I left Microsoft and we're gonna have a longer topic on this a little bit I recall my last several years there as teams began to flatten there were far fewer lead positions and there were people who had been leads or wanted to be leads it was very difficult to get into a lead position I don't know if that's still the case or not no it's not it's not in some regards and I forget the chronology but you were you were there for both events and one was right when we got when we we moved tests to different disciplines and then there was another where and not all teams did this but it was in general with them within Microsoft like a general flattening of organizations yeah what I recall I'm just finished my thought and you go on with yours but whatever call is that when that flattening happened there are a lot of leads who either moved to I see positions or what remember when there was an opening for a lead position there would be a hundred applicants and just the thought I was gonna say is right where I'm at now I actually have lead positions that I can't get anyone to want to I was I am short a few leads on my team across across the organization and I am going to have to probably internal transfer or higher externally which is I hate I don't hate doing for a lead it's difficult to do for a lead I think but I have to figure something out because I'm short a couple leads and all of my IC's are like no man I don't want to be a lead I love being an IC but go ahead and continue your chronology sir about Microsoft well I was gonna say there was a time where we kind of flattened the the organization as a whole within Microsoft I remember not all teams did this but it was still sort of a general practice and I would say things are sort of naturally kind of going back to the way it was like they're heading back so in other words we probably over over flattened and in the in the do-ness of time things have become a little bit more hierarchical as things happen I don't think it's problematic at this point in time like back in the day right a manager with two directs was super freakin common yeah it's it's it happens it's but it's not common now back in the day someone in the senior band might be a manager or that was super common it's not common today but it does happen the 20 20 years ago someone far from senior could be a lead yeah yeah actually is the wild wild west all right so anyway that's interesting grow your bench and find good leads and take care of them because they're good people I have two topics for the day one was a cliffhanger from our last episode if you want to go back and check it out you can do that but the story was I was asked to give an AMA at test bash home if you are a Ministry of testing pro subscriber you can go watch that recording right now and the wonderful Tristan asked me questions about the feature of test automation I think they asked me to give this talk knowing I would be at least somewhat controversial and I came up with three bullet points that we discussed and each designed to it in combination the three of them together the van was designed to piss off the most possible people unfortunately because the audience was so mature and had actual proper critical thinking it just made him think about stuff and ask good questions but the idea was there so I don't know if I should give you them to you one at a time or go through all three maybe I'll do one at a time because knowing you you'll want to comment and off the real you back in so the first one is I have forgotten no the first one is in the future developers will do the vast majority of all test automation okay and I was trying to find in looking I was trying to see if someone wrote down what these were because I I just scribbled it on a piece of paper somewhere as test bash was approaching but I can actually find myself saying this as far back as 2016 so I don't think anything super controversial or something you hadn't heard before actually none of these are things you hadn't heard before so that's number one any worries about that as a prediction like the only thing I could say that would cause it to fall apart is perhaps underestimating the the strength of test automators white knuckles holding on to the past this is actually my worry because there are leagues and leagues of teams who do our test automation specialists yeah and that's what they do they don't want to do anything else they make their money making so but I think it's right I think it's in and for all the reasons we talked about in modern testing on this podcast it's inefficient once developers write the code write the test for the code they end up writing better design code because they end up writing more testable code all these things happen lots of good things happen developers own test automation they end up automating a lot of the right things and they do a good job yeah I think actually one of the one of the things that is sort of what's the opposite of a prediction the one of the things that benefiting the opposite of your prediction is that literally everyone that I have talked to and we even when we had that conversation with those folks a couple of podcasts ago right I'm forgetting their name the the company name at the moment where where they're providing test automation services reflect on run thank you reflect that run right one of the things that is I think slowing this down is the fact that not a lot of people are still currently aware around around the the current studies and science on this one no no because they like to just you know we live in our bubble they live in their bubble yeah a so anyway I'm not surprising you there too but you can imagine you can imagine that would push some buttons the second one again is nothing you picking a reflect dot run nothing you haven't heard before I think record and playback low code whatever you want to call them tools like reflect dot run test and Mabel etc they will be the de facto standard for test automation I think in the future handcrafted tests in Selenium sorry Jason I love you but you're not the future handcrafted tests go away and record and playback was a de facto for UA automation there's still actually you will use Selenium for some special cases when you want to do a special maybe it's a stress scenario maybe it's a smart monkey test there are some things that it will probably do better when you want to handcraft your test but this idea of armies of sorry not armies this idea of a mass of web tests written in Selenium running as your product is going away those two together mean that developers will be using these record they know how to code which is great they also know how to be efficient and I would say in the future a developer quickly creates a record and playback test for the UI they've done game over that's that's the way UI testing is done and the way test wait UI test automation I'm sorry is done in the future yeah yeah and I think it's influenced once business leaders recognize the outcomes that we're recognizing and I think they'll shift over right it's essentially what so what holds it back number one developers don't want to do it number two test you know small armies of test automation engineers obviously don't want to have their job at risk right number three business leaders aren't actually really aware of the benefits so if business leader once they're aware of the benefits right whether it be dev or test they're both gonna kind of both dev and test and a lot of businesses are gonna push back on this that's that's what's gonna slow it down at least from my experience you need to have leaders that I don't know the way I would never mind I'm all right I'm blocking my own tangent so the last one can try this one a little bit because I know one way to trigger a lot of people is bring up the test automation pyramid because I don't know why I like to push buttons and what I said was because of the first two when the when we have a world where developers are doing the vast majority of automation and the UI automation is done via record and playback the benefits from that actually make the test automation distribution just test automation pyramid true in nearly every case wait wait wait so that's automation pyramid because of one and two test automation pyramid becomes true yes where I think a lot of people this was back to my comment I've said many times where people look at the test automation pyramid and they think it's dumb to try and make their tests fit that ratio and they're right and my viewpoint has always been that the test automation pyramid is a reflection of what happens when you have well-designed code and I think you'll get more of that as developers own more stuff and have an easy way to do their UA automation you're gonna you're gonna see the pyramid actually happen and nobody will care and this is the problem right now people care too much about the pyramid no but it's not always right and sometimes you want the ice cream cone and sometimes shut up stop your warning it's a model all models are wrong some are useful everything about it makes sense just stop getting your arms all caught up there slim buckety so let me first thing when we're talking about when we're talking about the test automation pyramid correct we're talking about one where there's edb number of tests at the UI layer there's you know right more at the business layer and then way way way way more of the unit test layer right that's what we're talking about right so if Dev owns everything and record and playback is done through the UI you then think unit tests will become dominant and the UI will be I think you're overthinking this Brent and no no I'm trying to decide if I agree with your thing and what I'm you're right I may be overthinking but obviously what we see so if if record and playback becomes wildly successful because of well let me phrase it differently I think those who argue with the test automation pyramid most of the stem of their arguments come from the fact that test rather than dev attempts to own the vast majority of test automation I think if and when developers own automation regardless of the children regardless of a second one when developers own automation it is much more apt and I would say almost guaranteed that the tests fall into a distribution as described by the test pyramid yeah I'm just wondering to what degree the service layer like I actually wonder in your thing if you know the quote-unquote middle class disappears because it's really the thing there's there's not if the pyramid puts those nice lines between things it's test get more granular less granular depending on where you're going there's a fuzzy line between things you call unit tests and things you call functional tests and even things you call UI tests or end-to-end tests yeah the the only issue is is that I actually see you know UI tests you know taking over if it ends up being that easy and you know fixing shit through through ML supported methods right ends up being that easy then I could easily see the the business rule automation sort of disappearing unit tests thing because of how fast it is and things along those lines I kind of I feel like I agree with you that that would be at the bottom but I'm wondering if the pyramid becomes a square I don't think so I think and I'll say this again for those who have heard me say this I think today due to ownership and the popularity and nothing again love you Jason nothing against Selenium I think the industry has an unhealthy infatuation with UI automation and I think the in the future that goes away explain that in the context of your principle number two today with test owning writing the UI automation and loving loving loving Selenium and having it being a separate team often not even connected or talking with the dev team agree right thousands and hundreds of thousands of lines of Selenium code to execute the UI of their application it takes a long time those tests are can be flaky when selectors changes lots of stuff you can do around that to make those more resilient but still they are flaky and it takes a lot of time to build and maintain those tests I'm saying in the future it's going to be much more efficient to just record and playback that test and if the test ever can't handle those tests again with the right tools those record and playback tests will automatically adapt to changes in your underlying selectors layout etc if it ever gets to a point where your test just the tool can't keep up with the overall you made to your website I think it's still faster just to go rerecord that test than it would ever have been to continue to handcraft and maintain those tests over time I now understand where we we where you and I where I was having difficulty getting to the same page in your book and it was essentially because you talk about UI automation and in all of that discussion that synonymous with with handcrafted UI automation right to me recording playback is still UI automation it is I did not mean to imply otherwise right but the value proposition of having a whole team whose job it is to spend 50% of their time taking yesterday's flaky tests and turning them into tomorrow's different flaky tests right that shit goes away I think that the tools today are very resilient to change in underlying code and that's what's been missing and again we came from a world you and I hear record and playback we automatically think nope way too flaky for use the world's changed in the web world at least stuff got better anyway that's it I do want to get to the other topic today which I think is gonna require some discussion so that's sort of a recap I encourage you who are pro members to go to the ministry testing site and check out that talk it's very I had a good time lots of good feedback and I'm surprised given the at my attempt at controversy which kind of failed that it was still fun I at least got some people to think which is always what we strive for and maybe testing and so I try and take that stuff elsewhere so did you get any push back on not really not really there are some tangential questions around well should testers still learn to code and of course I think yes and I think it's a lot of things that could do that aren't writing test automation there's lots of tooling and even doing some testing that isn't necessarily driving the UI but no real pushback no real pushback people there's stuff like people didn't really believe me like oh yeah I could see why you think that but that won't work in my world a lot of the snowflake stuff you overtime what happens I could be wrong but it's a world where I think it's a better world the future I described is it is it is achievable it's what Steven Johnson calls the adjacent possible it's right there we just need teams to start doing it and I have found I also discovered not just teams I've worked with here at Unity but I have now found other team for the development teams are more and more like when we first talked about modern testing team say oh hey we're doing that I am finding development teams who are using record and playback tools for the UI automation so it's it's happening just not widespread yet I think it's gonna be big we had a subject change not really a mailbag question but a good inquisitive question on the slack channel today it's something I've been asked before and worth talking about if you can recall way back remember the you don't remember it but the listeners are three listeners may remember we did a podcast once without Brent I invited I invited all three to join me in this small room kind of off behind the seats in the room where we had a test bash Philly in 2016 I was at Microsoft working on Microsoft Teams and I gave a talk on testing without testers sort of the beginning of how I have been working with teams to on quality coaching we took we have previous podcast or talked about that will rehash a little bit of that but they asked a very good question they say Alan I'm gonna I'm gonna for Raghu on it's like I'm gonna summarize this whole thing to something I've heard before so you're pretty passionate about modern testing and not having dedicated testers and test coaching and you worked on teams but with all that said you worked on teams Microsoft Teams and Brett don't say anything you'd stop in trouble but they say but Microsoft Teams really really sucks so what happened is it did you really are you are you not walking the talk or whatever again I'll do most of talking to your Brett in case you know your boss is ever listening I like like honestly I can't imagine Microsoft you can't badmouth our product every single Microsoft product is excellent and you need to tout our awesomeness no so there will be no teams bashing for me today I I do think it has I mean it has it has wads but generally generally a lot of those wads can be traced that sometimes can be traced back to two things that I have a very particular interest there will be none of that today but as it relates to what the hell Alan you you hypocrite I'm all aboard on that conversation okay so let me talk let me just rehash a little bit those haven't been on the podcast for a long time we talked about it when I was there on the podcast I don't remember numbers back in the 60s or 70s it's been a while not episode numbers not years so I joined teams as an individual contributor to they were very early on they were about 75 developers maybe all up at the time maybe less maybe 50 I can't quite remember but they wanted someone to come in and help the team think more about quality they did not having dedicated testers they had some former testers working on infrastructure here and there but they didn't really have anyone helping the team think about testing I joined the team and they had a pretty good suite of unit tests in place and some other tests which weren't very good they did as I've described elsewhere all the testing they knew how to do and they put some effort into it it wasn't great but it wasn't horrible so that's where I started and I joined the team and I did some stuff kind of like a test manager would for the team I just I made sure bug tracking was in place and we had some bug metrics boring but worth tracking for tech debt I did some communication around quality and just kind of set the team up a little bit with the quality culture maybe some of my first thinking that in develop the quality culture guide till a couple years later but at least stuff that was in my head way more years later yeah so one thing I realized there so I did a couple times I did a bug bash kind of thing let's take two hours today or a half a day today and we'll all do a bunch of testing on the project and I would they mostly did it in teams like small little teams getting together to work on things and I would roam fairly small team and give them ideas and help them and I of course I have been coaching them and giving them ideas on quality little tidbits here and there before then and this was the first time I discovered that given the freedom and permission to do so developers can do very excellent testing not checking God okay I'm gonna avoid that very deep good test they dug in they found bugs that only the very some of them some of them just found very surface level things but a good number of them found bugs that only the best testers I know may have found very deep important bugs and they just they looked at how the system fit together and found some flaws that were worth fixing definitely your P0 type bugs so that was a revelation like yes they actually can do great testing wasn't really revelation I expected it would happen but it sort of provided some proof so in the early days we were trying to get we're trying to get product market fit trying to prove viability trying to figure out if we're making something that could be sold and as typical for many projects at Microsoft there were several teams at the time originally working on similar things they wanted something that was sort of compete in that slack space and over time they we built in the the conferencing stuff too but we we kind of won out along the Microsoft teams among the Microsoft organizations building communication and collaboration type tools so at that stage all pretty good we're still pretty small trying to find the right product we did and it was working I over time I took over to have the most influence over quality I took over running all of our infrastructure teams as well as kind of putting on a release manager hat for our beta and I left right after the beta to just have as much control as I could as I could over what we were releasing quality understanding understanding where risk was also in the modern testing world helping the team get to a stage where they could comfortably release every week and not worry about it's for the we actually release all the back-end services all the time but the front end once a week and getting a team used to that that was hard believe it or not because they were so used to your typical waterfall ship every year projects a lot of these folks that they would even for a once a week release they try and shove stuff in at the end they say look the next trains coming by and I at the time when I was there I really wanted to get them to continuous delivery on the front end right but we just didn't have they didn't have the quality cultures to do it talk about why in a minute I wanted to get there I ended up hiring a team in India to help with testing because the develop I'll get to the crux of this the developers were too busy doing other stuff to get to to get to doing the testing that it needed to do and what it came down to was really the culture of the team which is eventually why I left Microsoft Teams was I can say in my 22 years at Microsoft hands down the most toxic culture I ever worked in there was nothing about the customer it was all about pleasing your boss and pleasing their boss I had never worked with such a huge group of suck-ups in my life you know I said earlier I said it a million times you know unity it's easy to do good work because the egos don't get in the way best ideas win the things you want to see but at teams it was so hard to do good work because if you did the right thing for the customer doesn't matter if you didn't matter if it's a huge win for the customer if it wasn't done in a way that sufficiently sucked up to your manager or to their manager it was gaffod so we had a program manager which is a Microsoft or like a product manager in the rest of the world who was I remember the time I remember the time I knew the end was near I was in a we used to call a war room meetings and then became something else a ship room a ship room meeting and we had just put the the Alpha out or the first beta some early release before the beta maybe it was the beta that went out I can't remember what the order was and he had went and you know got feedback from some other teams at Microsoft and some customers and came up with a list of things that had to be fixed in fact I didn't know if it was customer-based I think it was made money been from our VP but he's like ten things we gotta do and we have to do these and we have to do them by this date and he went he got up a little bit of a soapbox and said every priority is getting these things done in time for in time for this whatever this date was we'll take shortcuts where we need to we have to have these done and I chimed it said yeah but we can't sacrifice quality we have a good quality release we can't sacrifice it he got mad he is like yeah he says quality is one of the shortcuts we'll take to get these done and at that point I knew I was in a losing battle because he was fairly new to the org but he had joined the org because he was a previous suck up of our VP and he had our VP's ear and once he knew that I was against getting these features done over the favor of quality it was basically impossible for me to get my job done so combination of that my boss calling me at home to ask why I approved something for release just all kinds of micromanaging and toxicity kind of caused me to leave but I think those things this prioritization of features over quality this inability or unwillingness to understand the value that CD brings to quality after I left they went to a point where their changes and bugs were so jarring in their big weekly releases that it's like my reaction be okay we just ship you know continuous delivery ship our often puts FBI and feature flight theater right their immediate reaction was to go ship that front end monthly instead of weekly and I have told you a thousand times I'm sure you agree I would rather ship a hundred times a day than once a month and I and I believe those things led to gaps in quality I could say I can say that from a data perspective as advances as you would expect any Microsoft team to be we could debug we knew exactly where customers were getting failures and what was going on there the problem was there were so many failures that we had a hard time prioritizing them sometimes it wasn't it wasn't tractable because it was so frequent that's more into why I left than the quality issues but I'm going from what I heard from immediately after I left I talked to some people for a little while in fact I hired one of my previous managers to take over my job when I left and he's much more of the traditional test manager which I thought would be good for that org but maybe it wasn't because he was all too happy to drop back to shipping once a month and doing a full test pass with the even an even bigger team of offshore testers in India and I think a lot of those things just trying there was still trying when I left or at least in that first six months after I left they were still trying to test quality in via outsource team and I just don't think that's a good recipe for long-term quality success so that's where I think happened there but I didn't even make fun of team as much as I want except for the fact that I can tell you that it at least they have a Linux client now which I have installed and uninstalled occasionally what I have to do a Teams meeting but honestly zoom and slack I have to say whether I worked on teams before or not I love so much more I would say teams is to its credit teams being part of office 365 is genius because it's the collaboration app for companies that don't know the need a collaboration app nobody's switching from slack to teams released willingly but teams that don't use a collaboration app they can they'll use teams and it's it's kind of okay it's not great there are some bugs and not to say zoom doesn't have bugs and slack doesn't have bugs these things all have bugs and I'm not gonna go list them all out and see which one is buggier but for me the zoom slack combination has been pretty awesome so anyway that that's the story of why I think quality remember do you work with Ronnie Calabi yeah so he has that term he came up with the term he coined the term the hippo the highest paid person's opinion and you want to avoid that and be data-driven this team very much and they have a new VP in place since I since in the last year or so but teams was very much at the every feature every decision was at the whim of the VP running the org I think that's what led to the quality where it was the story I think you just told I mean it happened there were there were some things that I'm not gonna talk about on the podcast that I think were unique to your situation but in general I think 80 to 90 percent of your situation was essentially a team and transformation right it's essentially you had you had a lot of old schoolers in the business leadership folks that would say hey I've been shipping product for 20 years I know how to do it blah blah blah yeah at the same time you had those folks building a what is essentially a service and not really adapting well and what happened in this particular case I think your story is is one around how agile transformations can go wrong right so I have talked about it on the podcast as well you and I had different experiences and being the in the Xbox right my experience on the Xbox org I will I'll just quite honestly say very very aligned with the story you just told right they were not an agile team they were a fragile team and they and it was during that period of time in Microsoft where they were where again agile principles were being weaponized instead of being used for the the benefit of the customer and there weren't a whole lot of people that really understood how to do it even me at that point in time like I left Xbox to to go to Bing at that point in time because they were a service and I went to Bing to learn how to do this right and I did and I don't know too much about the internal structure I have a few contacts in teams I don't talk to them all that often but to me I think actually the story to tell there right the difference between zoom and in slack in teams might very well be I'll frame it as a hypothesis my very well be you know how long it took teams to to realize that they needed to shift to it to some form a CICD model yeah I don't know if they're there yet I don't I I would hope so but I don't know it doesn't matter I have some evidence that they might be but I can't say one way or the other I don't actually know but this is teams is where I learned how to do safe deployments I'm we would do originally I got there we had a both a dev environment and a test environment and the regular environment the typical environments you have and the dev environment was always crappy and I remember this is funny it's reminding me I remember that nobody on team is before we ship but nobody used the prod everyone used dev go after use dev loading get the new features but oh god this is bad but eventually we had one environment with with ring deployment so we when we did our weekly release we always like released on Friday but we did the snapshot on Monday and that snapshot on Monday immediately went to prod but that version was only available for first my team and then we roll it out to usually if it passed initial sort of smoke testing would go to all of the Microsoft Teams team and then to all of Microsoft and then eventually on Friday release it to customers which was you know my first experience doing that kind of staged rollout which was really powerful way to do that and that was fun and I loved it but hopefully that got even faster but I totally forgot that yeah and I went back and looked back in time the one thing I'll say is to the best of my knowledge teams was the first time where you were taking a very direct hand in trying to ship the waterfall team to to an agile team it was worse it was a it was a edge it was a waterfall team who thought they were agile right yeah it yeah go back to that's exactly my experience the back box and and for the listeners like I left before Alan joined and any overlap at all there I don't think so when did you do you remember when you left it linked in would show it I'm not gonna go look at LinkedIn so I remember I joined Xbox on Halloween in 2013 yeah I was in being so I think there was a gap of months there so no no overlap because I I joined being in pretty certain 2012 I either joined Bing in 2012 or a left thing in 2012 I don't remember the point of the story I think here and if I go back in time as well I went back in into our podcast and look for what was the date of the episode titled the conception of modern testing right that was in 2018 which I believe you were already in unity oh yeah yeah for sure I was well but right yeah we've been talking about we just didn't have a name for it maybe we've been talking about modern testing for a long time right like but it's the beginning right the my point is in terms of hey Alan did this you know Alan keeps talking about all these principles and all these things so how come teams is all screwed up the the one thing I'll say on that front is you don't learn from success true only learn from failure and what I will say is a lot of Alan's Alan and I have never had this good discussion but I am so confident in what I'm about to say I'm gonna say it anyway you're wrong a lot of Alan's thought process around supportive of modern testing when he was thinking through it he absolutely was considering what he views as personal failures from his experience with teams right yeah I agree and there's there's two things maybe to highlight there one is that definitely the modern testing principles were nowhere near being formed at that point it took me going back to managing a test team for a while at Unity to kind of think through that as well as building that quality culture transition guide at Unity with reflection on time I spent on Xbox and on teams doing coaching yeah those ideas came primarily like even when I joined Unity back in a test manager role it made me go back and think about what actually mattered and how testers should work it's that's what I began to think about using it when you have dedicated testers using them to accelerate accelerate the achievable quality or to accelerate the team versus be a bottleneck and then building that quality culture and then and then maybe that last principle came from my time at Unity when you have dedicated testers you can use them to help expand the testing abilities and know-how across the org and all that came from a lot of reflection and in fact when I first gave the talk in 2017 let me think whenever I gave that talk at test bash in Brighton the first time I give a public talk about modern testing it started with the history all the things I had learned from Xbox and then from teams and then from Unity and how those all came together into the principles so back on teams I had a lot of good ideas I learned how coaching worked I learned how to teach I began to realize that yes developers can be very very good testers but my full thoughts on how to achieve quality even though I gave a talk on testing without testers my full thoughts on how to achieve quality without dedicated testing specialists didn't fully come to fruition for a few years after that based on what I learned there and if both you and I have multiple different experiences around attempting the principles trying things out and going well that didn't work that that that that not only didn't work like one of the things I think we've talked about in the past in my view agile principles will far out produce not only slightly it will far out produce waterfalls based mentality okay it far but the one thing that is the Achilles heel to agile do you want to make a singular guess before I drop the bomb nope go ahead the Achilles heel to agile is command and control absolutely right there is that I have yet to find anything with with agile that that successfully survives a hierarchical structure where the hierarchy is is against it right or or or even either against it directly or indirectly even micro management might instead of using quantification or other other means a customer usage to to sort of drive decision-making so that's something that I think is is it's actually one of the reasons why you make fun of me all the time on this one but it's one of the reasons why I actually still do favor the safe methods because safe actually tries to make the management part of the agile process instead of say scrum that's another conversation on their slack channel right now around sort of the failings of scrum and scrum scrum has had the sort of history of of enforced autonomy management's the man and scrum is anti the man right and I think that actually holds it down or holds it back and creates limits yeah that's my philosophy yeah I'm with you man okay so that's kind of the story you know we can go deeper if there are more questions but that was way easier to talk about it here cuz I think it's interesting to everybody else and I like I like where we got with that then trying to have an answer in slack again if you want to see these slack conversations or ask your own questions in slack you can go to modern testing org and join our slack group there is no cost for that it is absolutely free of course you get what you pay for which is me and Brent being smart asses in slack but it's fun we have we have we have taco emoji so it would give away yeah one one additional thing that I at least want to say is despite what you feel about teams I will say teams has actually been in a important asset to the globe during the pandemic times I totally agree and I think it goes back to the fact that the vast majority of people who are using office 365 or office subscriptions to their enterprise they're not using any other collaboration tool and it just it just gives it to them in a way that's comfortable and it integrates with the way they work and then one thing worth sharing it so I totally get that but I'll mention a name the old VP he really wanted to compete with slack I want to take out slack and and Stuart Butterfield was worried for a while he's put out that that full page ad the day teams came out which was kind of cool but it says welcome to the welcome to the game but it really fits the niche because those office 365 companies that use that and there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of users in that camp they're not going out and getting slack licenses they they just get teams as part of the package they already have it's very convenient works very well I'm all it it fits there very well something else I was gonna say there but I forgot and we're out of time anyway all right okay everybody thanks for being part of our podcast today all three of you you and you and you I'll see you next time I'm Alan I'm brain bye bye
