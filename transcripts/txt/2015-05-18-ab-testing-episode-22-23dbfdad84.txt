I'm Alan. I'm Brent. I let Brent sit down barely before starting today, but we're back for episode 20-20-20-20. I used to know how to do it in zwei one wait ein zwei Yeah, no, I've forgotten how to say it. Okay, the the multilingual version of A-B testing will not be releasing this week We're on episode 22. I forgot for a moment, but now I remember and good to see you Brent Good to be seen by you Alan So we get shall we get going? Yes. Hey, I read some I got some mail this week And I'm just gonna read the first sentence of it. I want to see what you think I like reading mail to Brent dearest at no, we're sorry wrong one wrong one The mail says with agile becoming more and more popular It seems like everyone is running iterative development these days It goes on from there. Is that it? No, it goes on from there. So but that one opening sentence Kind of pushed my buttons in a way that probably isn't obvious to a lot of people No, it's obvious to me it is but you are not a lot of people are you? No, you're not a lot of people So what by body weight? I'm at least two ah Shush Shush shush what caught your ear there are mr. J There are oh to do you have a doctorate not yet. I can't call you. Dr. J You'll just be mr. B So what was it that pushed to what what kind were actually two things that bothered me about that sentence It was a short sentence. Please tell me that read the sentence again. Oh damn it. I mean, okay sure All right with agile becoming more and more popular. It seems like everyone is running Iterative development these days. Yes, the two things that bothered me is this idea of You should go with agile because it's more popular. Ah, yeah and This idea that agile and iterative are the same thing Yeah, the second one really it's funny You mentioned both of those because the second one is what caught my my ear initially and said not of I cry foul And we'll go into that in a minute, but it's interesting I just polished up my keynote for Star Canada a Couple days ago yesterday day before and we lose your submission. Oh the submission was a while back this is a slide deck, but one of the things that Kind of came to me as I was putting this stuff together is in the takeaway is you don't make changes like this because they're popular Or because you know, they're interesting you have to have a reason why although it just for many many reasons talking about leadership But yeah, really important agile is popular. Let's do agile. It's a really Stupid thing to do and a great way to screw up agile and a great way to make crummy software. It's So I actually just before here Alan I I did another coaching session and so I have a variant of agile that I teach people It's a two-hour training session and literally I finished another session an hour ago Okay, the very first slide I spend 15 minutes discussing. What is agile and These people who Push it forward as a popularity thing helps to encourage it to becoming a fad and it makes it a lot Freaking harder for me to get these people to understand that it is not a religious Doc a dogma. It's not a fad. It's actually the scientific method in action and And it is makes it so much harder to open Minds when you already have a prevailing belief number one that it's a fad or number two You have dumbasses in this company who read the first chapter of the scrum book and look at the first paragraph of the other Agile manifesto and then come back and tell me it's about Iterations well, it's funny We're gonna we're gonna go way off from the weeds and come back and get on this That's a very important point But while you were talking I was thinking in doing some research for my talk I came across this a couple articles sort of bashing agile, but for different reasons and some good reasons I'm not but one started off very interesting Interestingly said that my team's doing agile. I think it's effin stupid But I want you guys to help me out. It's not an as some agile forum Then he goes as I understand agile. It's this and he described scrum Yeah, which I thought was interesting Which you know again scrum is not agile well Implementing scrum and you know accurately is it is a way of implementing agile There is a way of implementing scrum that is completely non agile. Absolutely. Yeah, exactly the just because you did did 70% of scrum Doesn't mean you're agile. Yeah, and the other thing I thought while you were talking was I Would bet nine out of ten agile coaches are people that whether they're called agile coach whether they help their team with agile not I would say nine of ten agile advocates wish there was a new word for it because the agile ward has been so screwed up and bastardized well there We we have got to have already talked about this No, I don't know. I don't know that Let's let's what the point I wanted to get to and the point I promise I in the strategy actually we could go back from year one Shut up, shut up. Yes. So yes, there is and I'm thinking through like the very first thing the first slide No, second slide first slides the goal slide second slide is what is agile? Because I before I go and they talked about everything else. I want to get these guys out of their head that Agile is iteration or agile is scrum or agile is some other thing that it's not Okay You're I really wanted to have like a big bang on what agile was I'm gonna let you give your get to the you What is agile you have agile? Well, um, can I has agile put in the macat sure Not one with the cat meme. I've got actually real work to do I don't I don't have the time to spin like you do trolling for anyway Moving on The first thing I do actually when I do these presentations I now have a I learned of a game called the penny game and It's it's basically I put a simulation Of the team through three different phases of how to improve their throughput and the first thing is I set them up at teams I actually give them ten coins of different denominations and I And usually I have multiple teams today. I had three teams competing against each other Ten coins of multiple denominations and they put them in a cup. The first thing is that they have to The output is every person on the team has to have recorded the result of a coin flip But they have to execute that coin flip in denomination order So quarters before dimes times before nickels blah blah blah. Okay. Now the first path I bike. Okay, it goes in the cup First person has to flip all coins and record it put the coins back in the cup and then pass it to the next person And you do that through the team. I call that waterfall mood. All right, okay, and it is the I've now done this several times and every time I go through the first phase I will tell you I have done this like ten times and I I personally hate phase one Today the fastest team got got through there were only four people got through it all in three minutes, but it felt like 15 It was just like oh this thing is dragging on Then I Modify it and I tell them Okay. Now what you're gonna do is one coin at a time you flip a coin You can then pass the coin to the next person and they can go through the chain teaching them flow like a combo flow Okay, okay. Everybody does the quarter. Everybody does the dime. All right First person starts he flips his coin records it. He can now pass the coin to the next person They can flip and and now people are Parallelizing and it goes a much faster and usually that takes about a minute and then the third phase what I do is I say Okay. Now teams we're gonna give you one minute to discuss your strategy and then we're gonna do it same way last time That I only care about these two outcomes That coins are done in order first and everyone has a result recorded and that third phase everybody improved another 20% off of their prior time now the three minutes went down to a minute Like it cut it in a third and then there was another 20% off of that minute and that last phase is is intended to introduce them to how you can prove things if you work as a team work together towards the goal versus What we talk about all this time the the groups of specialists conveniently classified under the name team Drives me nuts the That should be what I call phase two now specialists specialists under flow now the next thing I do is I said agile and learning go hand-in-hand and agile is the ability to adapt to Adapt quickly to changing phenomenon That's one of the things iterations doesn't do right? We've talked about it here before I Know we've talked about it because I called him out and then he talked to it was Steve Rowe and he talked about it At our next lunch. He once told me Windows is agile. We do iterations right and and It's and that was an important insight because with his and my conversation allowed me to understand What is actually wrong with the word that there's power in well, I think two things happen one is there's this blind Ignorance or belief that iterations Equals agile but some people I know believe definition of the word iteration has included well you you reflect and adapt at the end and So it's they're still wrong. Yeah, but the point I like to bring up is I worked on I just got mail my Invited me this September to the win 95 team reunion. They're having 120 year union. Okay, that's my first project at Microsoft It was mine, too Uh-huh Would you work on it when 95 I was on the at work fax team a little Oh a little stupid come something. Yeah Something nobody used I worked on networking I made sure you could connect to network networks. So that is relevant today as your fax machine Yeah Anyway, we were we were on iterations We had three-month milestones and sure we knew the work that was planned for each milestone, you know a year in advance But there were iterations. Yeah well, and the thing is like Kanban, which is in my view significantly more agile than scrum is I agree There's not an iteration in there. I know It's a continuous flow now when everyone thinks of iterations like that they Think of every sort of PR material you'll you have ever seen on agile, right? I'm currently visualizing in my head Reese's build measure learn loop Okay Mm-hmm, and and I think what's happening to these people are just looking at this thing not reading the words not processing and just going Oh, it's a circle must be iterations Right and they're missing. Yeah, like learn One of the ways I tell the story I'm not going to mention the team today But I've seen situations where it's both basically build measure build measure build measure build measure Right. That's a loop too it is but it's not agile not adaptive and What you're talking I thought of and hopefully even though we haven't actually directly getting kind of the point between iteration and being adaptive and adaptive and learning and Elizabeth Hendrickson's litmus test for agile and I'm gonna probably Badly paraphrase this but I'll get close is something very close to Agile is delivering frequent customer value at a sustainable pace It's it's and nothing in there quite that but very close get close enough to know that that and I like it because that doesn't imply iterations it implies delivering value and Imply a sustainable pace, but the important thing that gets missed it from her side Isn't in her sentence, right? That what you're gonna say it's implied. Okay, because what she says is delivering customer value Not delivering code to customer. Ah Yeah Let's take a moment to ponder that how many teams you bet on the delivered value Versus delivering features that may or may not be used how many teams have I been on? Yeah, I could think some I've been up most of Matter of fact It's made a it's made me it It's made me it It's it's been a brand of mine Because of that People call me out and want me to come in and work on their team because I they view me as having a customer focus and And There was a buddy of mine that now works outside of Microsoft and he was describing a story where like I wish you had been here to do this because this the project if you had managed it it would have been much faster much sooner and People would be happier. Right? It's um, I mentioned this on the podcast before what the the variant then shut up People can go back and listen to all the podcasts. They're not gonna okay fine finish you just finish you just did the stats for that One of the key things that I have added to the variant of agile that I teach now is After it's released most most scrum boards. It goes check in done Okay, not mine. It's it's checked in and Then it's released Then it's validated by the customer Then it's done. I'm not gonna call it done until I've proven that the requirement assumptions Of why we built this code are proven true We built this code because we intended it to add some value to somebody before we really progress further on the plan Or maybe not before I'm not gonna necessarily block But I want to get that out get that validation done Because if that's gonna negatively impact the rest of my plan, I want to know now Yeah, I like that a lot. I've worked with orgs where the Getting that feature done Was the ultimate goal? Done and checked in and and not much beyond there. There was with it's done And I know I'm gonna have to fix a bunch of bugs and make it work and add some fit and finish But for now it's done and for me, it's not even close. I have a Litmus tests I use quite often and it sort of discusses Three common software development paradigms that I see a lot first and foremost waterfall What you see is that they're trying to constantly ask the question is the plan on track It that's it all we care about. Did you get this thing done by this date? I wouldn't even necessarily I agree with that and that's the iterative model Yes, the only the only part I would question on that is another thing pushing my buttons is waterfall and Agile are not necessarily opposites and very few teams actually do true waterfall But which is as it should be Okay, but I but I get the point I get the point Alan and I talks about this a lot That particular topic right the thing is is Waterfall true waterfall was written in this this white paper. I know Alan remembers the other yep But no one actually executes it so so no in the paper He's not a little dangerous and prone to error no, but waterfall today is whatever the serial Fazed gated sure crap that people used to and it's gonna be very similar Scrum in 10 years is not gonna be what Schwab wrote. It's what the society has turned it into. Okay, sure But waterfall is the plan on track Agile is Focused on is the plan correct? That the important thing there, of course For I haven't had to deal with this a long time But when I first started dealing with this people were saying Oh Agile is just about doing whatever you want no plan no, it's about having a plan but not but building the plan in as lightweight as Possible and a high ROI plan and building in that learning which is really important like we're going planning to we're gonna do this And then we're going to learn and adjust and constantly Evaluating that the plan is still correct and if it's not shift are we doing the right thing or are we building software? That's wonderfully functional that nobody will use and there's a third one which I Call Jedi and this is the teams. It's an acronym JDI God These are those teams that ask the question plan Just do it We don't need no plan for those in the software industry the the typical word Is cowboy? Jedi teams and cowboy they're one of the same. They don't need a plan Not only the PM's all Potential the next Steve Jobs, so is the dev team We're always right. We don't need a plan. We're smart. We'll get it done. I have never met a cowboy dev team that Wasn't chock-full of five-star devs just asked them Of course the Yeah, do we cover both of those popular? I don't know. I don't know where you're going with that. Oh so the main thing I wanted to cover was iterative and adaptive and with that and to me agile is adaptive that learning part is Absolutely critical and just being iterative has nothing to do with agile Well again, I hear that the groans from the audience that haven't heard this through the time machine through the internet already Yes, just because you iterate doesn't mean you're agile I've been on many very non agile opposite agile products that were iterative and you don't have to iterate to be agile Yeah, that's exactly and that's the main point I wanted to make I think that main point is can you adapt and learn? you do have to be iterative to be waterfall and scrum and You don't have to be agile to be waterfall and scrum All right, and apologies if you're listening to this and I made fun of your email, but it did lead to a good topic So I know you meant well, so you can actually be agile in the traditional waterfall method as well That's much harder to learn when you have phase delivery But if you think about the example I said on the penny game, right? So the problem is is that each individual? Completed their all their work before they got it done if they broke it into the smaller pieces Wait, they turn it into a food. You just said they completed their work before they got it done I'm sorry each individual so I had teams of four and then no to answer your question I didn't hear what I said. Yeah teams of four and let's say those teams are four were I don't know make something up a Design guy a PM guy a dev guy and a tester guy Right what we see nowadays is you have design complete spec complete dev complete test complete and All of this work gets chunked as full completeness in order to get to done a simple fix Cut that crap out do one small item Design gets it done hands it off to PM he works on that while the design guy starts working on his next thing and Shift it through and if you do that you can turn turned waterfall into something significantly more agile and perhaps even Agile that's what you described is very close to Kanban. It's exactly combo Except even then like so did you just say Kanban is waterfall? No, you can you got you can waterfall with but by letting I'm just trying to shove words in your mouth piss you off But the other thing to also keep in mind Based on the context that we're talking here, right? You can do Kanban and not be agile. Oh, yeah I can see that right you can just constantly flow if you're not evaluating that if if what you're doing is correct or valuable This is again why Elizabeth's thing is so so important and it's so easy to gloss over Yes, I agree and I was gonna say something else clever and important, but I forgot what it was So we're gonna go on to item two, which I don't know what it is. Why don't you kick it off Brent? Okay If you think about it in terms of power and words Like here's here's another phenomenon that I've noticed we've talked about in the past. So we've talked about me joining the data science team And we've also talked about Data science as a buzzword. I think most listeners remember the high school sex metaphor But the thing that's interesting is even the people with the title Aren't really trying to improve themselves What you're seeing is a lot of people spinning up Reporting only teams and saying oh well, I built a report that's data science. Yeah It's an insight no They ever share with you my last manager one of the metrics one of the KPIs he wanted to judge me under was TTI Time to insight and I said wow That's a fantastic one. I can Completely understand what you're trying to say because he wanted me to help shorten the velocity of insight production But I just need one thing he's like after hearing me being so positive of his feedback He's like, yeah, what? What's an insight? How do I measure it? How do I know if it occurred? The When when you get that little tingly feeling in the back of your neck, that's an insight. I'm One of the things that's happening right now there's there's a So people are just producing reports and it's sort of the build it and they will come Hope and then what they're discovering not very adaptive. It's not Hey for those of you who are in this space, I'm gonna share with you a very critical KPI that I've developed That I suggest that you use if you're in this world where you're essentially doing report production and not necessarily doing Analysis and helping to try to shorten insight Value or insight production and tie together relationships between key variables if you're just doing reports instrument your reports and measure one thing and that is the number of people who are using your report the day after The key executive review or whatever the hell you built the report for Alright, because the fact that because they found it useful it would be your metric there, right? If you finding yourself building reports that are only used the day before Essentially for slide where then you're not really Providing value. These are reports that a PM you need to figure out a way to Those things done. Let me let me one up you or go a different angle here I think the build it and they will come thing drives me crazy. I work with orgs that are They love this they want to build the thing that's for everyone, but they don't unveil it until it's not ready yet We got to do more here and my approach is if I'm if you ask me say hey Alan Can you do a report for me that shows the food bars the fish bats? But a bit of that I don't go yeah, and I'm gonna draw it on the whiteboard for you You watch look something like this and you know, no, I'm gonna erase some stuff and I go like yeah something like that It'd be good. That okay. I got feedback from my customer I take a little picture with my phone then I go to the web browser and it gets them Excel and I mock it up I don't even use real data I make a picture of it and I and it's and maybe it's it's pulling like mock data from a database something very simple I put it in a web page and I go hey brand is what we talked about. He's gonna check it out He goes. Oh the fizzle puzzle doesn't I rather have that be more important and a little feedback from him And maybe some of his peers look at it, too I start spreading it out and they go yeah, it's pretty I think I could use it like this And the fizzle boss could the food die to the flu die So we get that happening and then actually get some pull in some real data I know there's a lot of normalization they want to have down the road But I want to make sure we get all the pieces in there So it isn't until we've gone that far that actually I'm not looking for I don't care about insights yet I care about usefulness. I think the insights will come once that becomes useful. I do one before you go too much further I do one thing different. I do everything you just did but I do one thing first I Ask what are you gonna do when you have this report? I do that's what I asked. I do two things I say Who do you expect to use this report and what actions do you expect them to take upon? Viewing the data. Yeah, I do those things too, but I got so excited about starting off With the with the implementation being something stupid simple That's you can do in five minutes figure out if you're on the right track or your understanding is correct But yes, and there's the the Jim Moore question. Let's say you had this then what do you do with it? That's a great. Let's say you have this this is the report. Yeah Very question. I almost always ask I Say almost sometimes I forget but rarely I always ask for something if any significance So what are we gonna do when we have this so I get some idea of the user case Anyway, I'm going to it's gonna be very simple until I don't need to start adding things that I think are clever and interesting and and pretty stuff until I Actually think it's going to be useful for a large part of the audience that was designed for and I can iterate through that and learn Very very quickly. Yep. I'm undergoing that right now with a with a project that I just picked up I just hate to go build it and they will come approaches cuz they happen so often The the the initial approach so One of my peers has fallen ill he's he's better again but he had been designing this thing and Basically what he had been doing is getting the requirements from from p.m. And when then I went I saw this I'm like first question. I saw the design from RPM and I said who's the customer of this? What decisions are they trying to make off of this data? And what actions are you gonna take based off of those decisions? And then I came back a day later with a new design optimized for That decision-making process I said hey look if this is what you're trying to do with the data I can simplify that for you It's frustrating to me on the on the report side Because what we see is a lot of PM's still doing this this requirement driven model. Mmm I have this awesome intuition and I'm awesome and I'm just gonna write up a document with the Requirements and send it to you and then you implement it and I'm like look dude I'm a data science team not a dev team you try that crap someplace else Okay In data science. I want to know what your decisions are and I'll happy to help you iterate towards them the The problem is even the PM Doesn't know what the decisions they're trying to do. They're not identifying the goal This is why that key PI I was mentioning is really critical Yeah, it can be shown up in in in this executive review and it essentially ends up being a bunch of vanity metrics But if you want to drive real value, you want to drive real change you want to accelerate the business you need to Make sure people are Acting on what you're doing and you need to make sure you're providing the right action ability into your design This is a why I think actually agile and data science are critical that they go hand to hand But the topic I wanted to talk about is the next thing That's happening is as these teams are building all these reports and not measuring that no one's using them They're they're beginning to understand the maintenance costs of keeping all these reports that no one uses online Because what they did is they followed your model for for building a prototype Except they call it the product and I see I see a lot of these folks that may not have a lot of expertise in Data science yet, but they came from friggin dev and they suddenly just forgot oop Like okay, you got the prototype now we need to harden this and we need to operationalize it So why are you trying to? Create a lot of the projects I have Literally have thousands of input streams and instead of trying to manage this like in an async model They pull all these input streams together and they wait for all of them to coalesce and all the data has to be there And then they're gonna aggregate it up and such that if one fails No report that week if if and of course because you have so many data streams one fails every day and Just befuddled that they're forgetting this the how to design The second thing is I'm finding that again the power in words Data science being a buzzword. That's absolutely a buzzword and something If it means nothing if the current Microsoft culture continues to persist it'll eventually mean something That's entirely opposite of how the rest of the world uses it Right am sorry world Sorry in advance It's our fault We view it as innovation but things like normalizing your data Doing data conformance These are concepts that are key to data engineering to be able to light up data science and And people are just skipping over these things In I had a I had a long discussion yesterday Where I had to sit down and explain to them Normalization does not mean everybody uses the same schema now Alan I don't know that you if you have my data engineering skills But I do not in this case trust me it doesn't and if ever that word comes up in database you call Unky Brent and I'll help you. Thank you, Brent. What's the database? It is a it is any file that contains data Sure is All right We're doing a bunch of ranting today. I was gonna say something very cynical about data science and about what you're talking about But I'm feeling good. I want to move on and Let's jump right into vanity metrics, but we're not gonna talk about vanity metrics, but Brent wanted I sent Brent some mail this week. I Finally for the first time ever went to look up the downloads for our podcasts and Gave Brent the numbers, but am I wonderful provider lost all of my downloads stats for 2014 and 2013 So we only have 2015 Brent Seem to think there was some insights there I thought the numbers are kind of small they the variance isn't that big They sort of taper off and in orders that make sense to me But wait the order makes sense to you. I Yes, it does the order of the counts the order well Let's talk about what you think is an insight and I'll explain to you why I think it is It is within the realm of normalcy Okay, that's that's not like a good way to do this sure. All right. So what what was something that you thought was What popped out as you as well? That's interesting there There were two things that I found interesting and and I will say the first one I would I would agree with you When we're talking about statistically interesting we're talking about the degree to which Random chance Also explains the behavior Yes, or that would I guess be? Statistically non-interesting right right and there are methods to to sort of show how much random chance could explain this relationship that's being observed versus a relationship being there and you're right in terms of The numbers are are relatively small I think the highest number in the list you gave me was 400 No, if you look at partial streams plus full downloads the top one was probably closer to 600. Okay, I Didn't even look at the partials. I just looked at the the full list. I actually interpreted as a subset I didn't understand that it was Yeah, it's weird. We're the way those are tracked. Yeah So that data that that Alan had was it showed how many people did a full download and then apparently in Addition to those how many started listening and then stopped and then what he was saying is that some total was somewhere around 600 Now the first thing that I noticed we had just finished episode 21 Mm-hmm and episode 16 and 17 were in the were in the top, right? Right, they've been out longer more chance for download Sure completely great the And it could also have just been statistical chance but one of the things that I did wanted to do is see if there was a correlation between Say links there could be other in additional information It could be random chances as you describe, but it could also be additional relationships that we're not paying attention to For example, how many people are linking to episode 16? What did Alan write in this blurb is is is search engines? Capturing that blurb and it's redirecting traffic there. Yeah, I have none of that data you do I I don't have a I haven't looked at any of that data the but the the one pattern that I found the most interesting and And again that one because the numbers are so tight and they're small. There's a very good chance. It's just random chance That's that's that's my gut But what I have observed Particularly with blogs Although you did the aggregation for the last month The sum total for the last this is no, this is the total since January 1st. Yeah the one thing that I did notice though is episodes one two three and four were relatively high in the list and episode five was the bottom one and That shows me we have a lot of brand new listeners that haven't got all the way to episode five yet maybe Or they listen to the first four and said I've had enough of this crap, right? Or hey, let me skip the current events or whatever, but I do think that that is an interesting pattern it's not what I would have expected looking at the data and the the difference between number four and number five was Five or six times higher episode four and episode one. Mm-hmm. Right so Something is going on there. The is there or is it just random? I don't think it's random The other data that I have is is both you and I link to the podcast from our blog sites Yeah, and I do look at my blog stats and I know Introduce the the blog I wrote introducing a B testing is Consistently one of the higher items in my list. So I actually think people are finding Episode one via search engine off of our blog and going and starting listening in episode one there's an Then get to four or some of those folks sort of get to episode four and then they Go off and do their regularly scheduled day and then they forget to circle back to a B testing maybe maybe so let me Give you some quick data here on the fly and then we'll go on from here. So that's a hypothesis So let me give you a little bit of this. So in January our top downloads were for episodes 16 14 15 pretty spread out one shows up somewhere down around number seven and nothing interesting there But February gets a little more interesting if I remember maybe it was March February is interesting in that our top episode 17 came out that month then three one two and four follow it in order So there are this tells me we have maybe new listeners showing up. Yeah, I don't know that would be my hypothesis. Where's five? Five five is five is far down there I think maybe those I don't know why I'll check episode five over time See what happened or what we talked about the made episode five so bad when I look at March It's 18 19 and then two shows up and then 17 11 4 so that one not as much One farther down the list and then real quick look at April and May and then we'll Wrap up here. So in April it was 2019 three two and one and then in May To cap it off here It was 21 and one two and three show up wait on the line That kind of tells me my my insight my hypothesis from that that again an athlete March April we got some new listeners who started listening and that's and that's why those those earlier episodes started popping up on the downloads March was our one-year anniversary. I don't remember I did I did a blog post in January All right, you know what I think we just contributed to a lot of partial downloads as people stop streaming our episode right now Anyway, I Want to see more of this data because I think I think We can help to defend the the honor of data science against what will this will be that we won't return to this for a while Don't worry those who are scared away, but we'll We'll come back to this once we have some more Data and see how we'll see what it means. You're gonna give me the data. I wish I could export it to Excel The weasel. All right. All right. I'll give you your own special password that I will use with my keystroke logger Okay All right, I'm not Brent I am all right. See you later. Bye guys. Thank you
