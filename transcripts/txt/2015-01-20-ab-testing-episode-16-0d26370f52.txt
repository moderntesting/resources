Everybody hi, hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we're back again For the a B testing podcast what episode are we on here? Well, I actually had to look up that this time Alan and we're 16 You had to look it up because there's a number too big for you to count It's too high for me to keep in my head. That's that's excellent Excellent job there Brent and our first episode of 2015. Yes Look at that. Hey, happy new year everyone. It is it spent a month We took the holidays off and what you doing your holidays Brent? I did very proactively Nothing. I was very forcibly doing nothing It was fantastic Wow, I'm impressed. I was hoping to draw a little bit more out of you. No, no I did it was hard to do like family wanted to do things Did no work. I'm on my couch work my lazy boy recliner You know I've actually thought about going out and buying a lazy boy recliner We want to we want to upgrade the the our living chair We want it well, we want to upgrade our living room, but that would have violated my principle of doing nothing So it was fantastic. It was um, so we had a big release just before the holidays Power bi is the the team I'm on we have now several new features and Those features are all free. So if those who are interested in the the power bi space you can go create use our new set of features and Go create your own account for free and start messing around with power bi dashboards. It's a fantastic product But it took a lot out of us to build it and so by I shut up Matter of fact, I had to do a password change You know, you know how our past Data with the bifurcation double ginger of the globe. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep. We can do that in a whole bunch more That's awesome. I did a lot of junk and did nothing we didn't Try well, gosh, we did travel. I ran a 12k The 12k is a christmas run. I finished without puking. That was nice took me just over an hour So I was happy with that Okay is five miles six miles eight miles eight miles. I was and in fact, it was so much fun that I In a fit of stupidity that I will sure i'll hate myself for later. I'm gonna do a half marathon in march Um around this march this march around murse around You have support staff? No, you have my phone number. So if you I'm eight miles in and i'm doing fine. I just need a beer. I got your back. Alan. I'll be right there And then sort of on uh, we had a nice holiday at the house and Sort of a little bit of a whim the wife and I Took off on new year's day for a quick trip to vegas Oh, we saw oh the night we got there next night. We went to the final show the justin timber lake tour And then and flew back the next day. So are you a a beat a big jt fan? My wife is It was a good show though. It was it was done really well, but I was listening to the radio the other day and he is Uh last year he was the number one or number two um Number one artist in terms of bringing money in I believe it. Yeah, like like and he's funny too billion dollars one bajillion Um cool. All right. So Those of you that haven't turned off the podcast yet Let's actually talk about software and this week because we've been gone so long and we actually had some feedback Let's go right. Wait So so actually before we begin there's there's there's one shout out I wanted to do Those who are listening to the podcast uh as well as a blog post Um, you guys have known that i've gone back to to school and i've actually surprisingly i'm halfway done with it Not really certain how where the time went um the but one of my professors, uh Uh just recently passed away So I just want to basically shout out and say this this this man has been a key part of my Uh personal growth towards my career trajectory Very sad to see him go and I I really do hope that um He rests in peace It was actually very sudden. It was my my last class my last semester. He was my professor And we were doing this conference call and he does a video call and he suddenly started coughing And he and he mentioned just sort of uh at a hand that He was gonna go see the doctor, uh the next day and Turned out he ended up having uh lung cancer. He had never been a smoker. So it might have been a genetic version of it And the word had been that he was coming back this next semester. Matter of fact the the class i'm taking now He was supposed to teach. Uh, but um January 8th, he passed on so Uh professor, uh, if you are able to hear thanks Uh, you have at least one student that appreciated what you did for him. Very cool. Yeah Well, not cool, but thanks for the shout out. Yep uh so without further ado Let's go right on to the Mail Wow, that was fantastic, you know, I I work on these so yeah we have and by definition Obviously, no one sends regular mail anymore So there's no mail bag and people don't even send us email and often they don't even actually most the time They don't post any comments On the blog site or on itunes or stitcher or wherever they usually tweet Random things in the hallway. So the mail bag for us is anything any sort of interaction you have with us is the mail bag Yes, anything that we can spend a half a second And turn into an interesting question is a mail bag and we appreciate it And once again those youth haven't turned everything off although we did have actually a mail from um, Jinsung Oh internal this last time. So yeah, well that'll come up for that area Yep, so first off I want to give a shout not a shout out a shout back Uh, it's really cool. Um Back in december just after our last podcast came out michael larson Did a post on some of the podcasts he listens to and mentioned us pointing some people our way pretty cool I think we were number one on the I don't think it was I think it was alphabetical Number one That's why we start with a we're a a a a a b testing. We are number one podcast In the in the so so anyway in the category of culture change for software testers starting with Starting with the letter a So so anyway, um, I got to meet michael four or five years ago at uh, um briefly at Pnsqc conference down in portland and then i've been reading his blog for a long time He did a great review of how he tests software at microsoft when it came out on his blog But then just recently last month I had the blog post here so I can pull up the date here Uh, he did a post on a on december 19th. No, that's actually the podcast one was on december 19 He did another post that i'm not going to look for right now, but but it was on Now i'm gonna horribly paraphrase this but it's it's it's interesting It was something like organizations of horror vacuum and the story he told was Somebody at their company just left and they're the person owned all the vm stuff and he said well I have some background there. I can I can jump in and And sort of the moral being hey, you know, if there's stuff you can do go ahead and jump in which I fully believe in So much so that it reminded me when I read it that the week before There was some work that wasn't being done and and I love learning new things and jumping in on things and my superpower is I can learn Things really quickly and I figured things out really well. So there was some work that needed to be done And that'd be really interesting. So I lied I said, hey i've done something like that before I can help out I said, oh great and I I Did never done anything like it before but I knew I knew I could I knew I could learn it It depends on how you abstract it. Yeah, I guess so i've worked on products before yeah I've i've Yeah, yeah, i've uh, i've read words in english before I can do this. Yes Now I mean There's a sense of fearlessness that actually alan and I both share um I think we've been testers for too long to believe that that code is is anything Even remotely resembling magic It's just another bunch of lines of code put together to solve things Yes, it's not hard to figure out what it does and how to make it do the right thing. It's hard for some people Not for me, it just takes diligence Yeah Anyway, I I related a lot to that because I did that all that post especially but from the recent ones because I that's exactly What I do. So I I like to Uh, I like to be a generalist wait, which oh Let's not let's not go there again. So anyway, thank you. Michael, uh his website Uh mkl test head.com Uh, and he's I believe mkl test head on twitter, but if i'm wrong, you probably already follow him Anyway, so um, yep, I I I do follow, uh, michael and read his blog, uh quiet ops Cool. Yeah, he's a great he's great All right, let's get into oh, oh twitter conversation was this from gear in norway? Yes About he thought it was we were talking about, you know, one-on-ones and coaching and mentoring and He mentioned that in his workplace or in his culture They the managers that just managers didn't do that Yeah, the he he sent us a tweet and in his feedback was after listening to one of our podcasts And I think it was some comment that I had made around um, the frequency in which I I talked through my guys um And he he found it, uh odd or befuddling i'm i'm i'm paraphrasing here uh to have management that syncs up with their employees on a weekly basis and in the even when as far as to say uh He found that like culturally odd like he was he was going to talk or ask around and see if any of any of his friends or co-workers Experience such a phenomenon All right. So what do you think? I The the opposite to you and I the opposite seems weird and it's not like you need and yeah And this is one of those things where it's really easy to get the pendulum the wrong way and I see managers who Are so busy because they have these eight or nine direct reports Want to meet with each of them for like an hour every week and sometimes the weird thing happens Like we'll do an hour one-on-one a week and then you won't you just won't see them the rest of the time because you're doing other managerial stuff and my I'm not a manager, but my management style when I choose to be a manager is The even more frequent shorter kind of check-ins. Yes, you have to have longer discussions around Career and kind of what's going on when you need to dig deep But i'm really big into the one-minute manager give get out of people's way But dive in and find out what's going on and see if you need to intervene there was um There was another on that same thread. There was another reach out uh, or another Another person I forget the name at the at this moment in time reached out and sent a thread around sort of the role of a manager and a belief that A manager who holds on to the idea that they remain technical was bad particularly in the in the feedback context And and I think the way to really address this feedback problem And I guess the third thing I would I would Bring into play for those who have heard of it or not. Uh, there's there's this new sort of um software engineering model The way I'll wait till you're done. Sorry. Yeah that that Zappos is really What did they call it the holacracy? Yeah, it's holacr the holacracy I was saying zappos is the primary example leverage throughout the but holacracy. There's no managers at all. So Actually, and that was the thing when I first saw gears twitter he's like He was uncertain about this world where managers have one Have weekly one-on-ones with him and I wasn't actually certain which direction he was talking from was he talking from the old school world where where Basically managers get promoted because they're super technical and they suck at that actual job Or more of the future world where there are no managers and he doesn't have sort of a command and control of or a head He's expected to get feedback from when you look at we're gonna be all over the board on this because I have a whole bunch of ideas on this yeah, that's the way, you know zappos is Sort of famous for that holacracy culture and but They don't have managers. This is I don't know which direction to go somebody signs paychecks Somebody signs, you know off on purchase orders or whatever. So people do have authority to do those things People don't report to each other It can kind of work and I always thought I always It's a great thought experiment to walk through. How would this work? I'm going to talk through it when I think about any sort of complex concept It helps me to think about extremes Like what would it be like if there's no managers and whether I work at zappos not I can think about it Well, somebody's got to step up and you're gonna have people Now in a leadership role, I'm talking about No, you already you brought up zappos. I'm going this direction. Okay When you don't have any managers People will still step up to lead you you're gonna get Self-organizing teams. Yep, big believer and those are going to happen and Want to force them to happen don't have any managers. Yep They'll absolutely have to happen. You'll see that work out And there are companies that have very few managers very flat and the same things happen And there's not a lot of difference between a company with Very flat company with very few managers, maybe 10 20 reports. I don't know that the employee counted zappos Where you're going to see that because the org is big enough that manager's job As the org gets flatter ends up being a lot more just kind of Keeping overhead under control and I wonder if in I love the thought experiment because I don't know any of this I wonder if in an organization with no managers where you do have people that kind of end up in that same sort of role, so my you know for example I may Be on the self-organizing team where the strength that I give to the team is kind of keeping everybody organized and making sure the work is moving forward and That people have someone to come talk to when they have a question around anything from how to do something to career In many worlds. I would be the manager of that team, but i'm really sort of the self-organized will say leader. Yeah The whining it back to to feedback though So you pick you are are organizing the process That the challenge in that world that in terms of exploring your thought experiment is How do you improve? How do you? How do you get better at doing that role? Let's say that's something you go you sit back and you reflect and you say man I am good at this But now you have the challenge of how do you get better? You go. I want a special I want to become a specializing generalist and this is where i'm going to spend my specialization time getting better at How would you do you look for opportunities where you can do that? You look for challenges look for challenges. Sure. Say I want to I want to add performance, you know testing performance analysis to my To my specialties i've never done it before but it seems really interesting and a friend of mine does and he's pretty good at it the so i'm going to look for Opportunities, you know, let me let me shadow you. You know, somebody else is doing this. Let me shadow you on this Nobody else is doing it. I'm going to take some time to go read about it and and cope with some ideas I can try on my own and i'm going to try things i'm an experiment and then as I get a little farther I realize wow I can do these performance activities, but to really understand what they mean I need to understand a little bit more about statistics and how to analyze this data effectively so we can make choices So i'm going to dig in a little bit there and if you want to get better at something um You need to learn it right you need to learn and practice. Yes and deliberate practice So you need to grow your ability towards those challenges. Yeah, and and the only thing the only Advantage having a manager Gives you if we're still talking about that thing. Yep In that situation is If you don't know where to go You can ask your manager where you can go, but there's a weird there can be a weird code dependency there Because you can ask anybody that doesn't have to be your manager. You can ask anyone that you need You need a suitable means to discover what you what you don't know and what you don't know you don't know Correct and that you need to leverage your team for that more than You know or at least as much as I don't know where a manager the person you work for provides any additional advantage there Let me let me ask you One additional question. Oh, yes. I love you. Is this the bonus round? It is. All right. You did well in the first round. All right How would you know? That you're not just blowing sunshine up your ass How would you know? That you are actually doing good versus You thinking you are The work I do needs to provide value to the product Okay, and how would you know if it's doing because what you just described is that you're now Uh, the way I kind of envision what you described you are the world's best as far as you concern Are we making? product decisions that improve the customer experience and Depending on your definition of customer. Yep, but are we making product decisions that improve the customer experience? Based on the work that i'm providing to the team. Let me um, let me let me be more precise Because like I believe you can do that and be good at organizing the process and still be pissing off everyone that you're working with Yes And that feedback I get where you're going. Probably important Yeah, so how do you find out? Okay, so I I can figure out the work i'm doing is helping the product But you're asking me. How do I figure out if I am doing it in a way that is? uh I was gonna say socially acceptable, but how am I a good team member as well? And we've talked about the things I value, you know on a team I work on i'm pretty straightforward, you know, does the work you do provide? Value to the product. Uh, do you have what's your output? Yeah, are you getting a reasonable amount of that work done and do you play well with others? Yeah, those are when I look at someone I want to think how well you're doing I look at Those things yes, and so how do I know if i'm playing well with others? I always do no. I this is this is tying it back to awesome. I just know Um, you can well in absence of a peer feedback system, which we've talked about before which I which I love and and sort of an ad hoc Uh, if you can get people to really use one and rate people it's great. But ask people ask If you don't have A way to figure that out I would ask people i've done that before Um, i've asked someone to ask someone else about me if you're afraid to get that feedback directly uh, but I really would prefer a sort of either a Feedback system could be anonymous or not or maybe even both Uh, do you have an answer for that? How do how do you find out if you're pissing people off the actually you're always pissing people off So, how do you find out when you're not pissing people off? Uh, i'm also uh turns out i'm not pissing people off. Whoa, I'm pissing people off. Yeah Particularly the times during the day where i'm sleeping and everyone else is nope pissing off No, or hardly anyone at that time. Um no, so You just did a great thought exercise and and I think you kind of concluded that in a holacracy world In order to to really succeed and not only as a team and a project But when we're talking about a feedback system, we're really talking about the role of the individual Mm-hmm and and how to help grow them um You you you have to have Some sort of peer feedback tool and it turns out holacracy acknowledges that and um You have to reduce the friction Uh to enabling people to give their uh feedback um uh in a in a way that's actionable and uh nearly immediate The the other thing most I have not seen any article That discusses holacracy in sort of a waterfall context Right, uh, mostly most oftentimes you'll see holacracy. I'm going to say most currently i've it's all that i've seen Uh are doing some sort of agile process And agile, uh, one of the great benefits is it really tugs out Transparency everyone knows what everyone knows The in a holacracy world you really have to have collaboration collaborative teams Really helps to instill trust and that really helps to light up the sort of peer feedback mechanism Going back to the other extreme though. Um talking about managers right I am a technical manager, um I I have gone through several years. Uh, i'm actually surprised honestly surprised when My manager feedback scores are below. Uh 90 percent and it hasn't happened in decades the the main reason why I think most managers when when they go into that role and they stay super technical It's because they don't understand the problem that they're trying to solve Their their job isn't primarily to get the project across the wire They have to do that But it's it's more medium term long-term thinking and and Um, you cannot just do that without paying consequences. You will see your people going Um stymieing you'll see your people getting to a point where They're not getting support from you and they've kind of run to the end of of their ability to create a method To get additional feedback and they move on and You can't do that. I I think you can't do that as a manager period but you absolutely can't do that in the software world Because the number one asset Is the knowledge that's between their ears? And if you let if you let that go and you don't invest further in that you are short Shrifting project acceleration. Did you say shrifting? I did I said short shrifting. What is shrifting? Uh, that sounds like something that happens in a jail I wish that's shiv shrift. I'm sure that I don't know Uh short changing then all right, i'm gonna go with shrifting to make captain synonym here happy Although you if the knowledge that's in their their heads and and allen's in another podcast he he's he's done multiple Discussions around the the importance of recognizing that we're not in the software Industry we're in the knowledge worker industry That we just happen to be using software So the knowledge is the the primary asset therefore you're you're best motivated to Motivate and challenge and grow the person with that knowledge And if you failed to do so, uh, you you better have a plan For dealing with that knowledge leaving your team And far too often I find these hyper technical managers either uh They they approach this as they're the guys that are going to do that Or not. Let me give you a particular one Quick story and then I think I think i'll end this topic. No, no, I I have more once you finally shut up. Okay um a manager Years ago the best manager i've ever had He shared with me his number one rule of of management Okay He's like if you do nothing If you do nothing You have to do this and that is Your task as a manager is to earn your team's loyalty number one earn your team's loyalty uh You don't you can either be a technical manager or you can be a um, a people manager or you can be like me someplace in between but whatever it is And you can do this in any of those styles if you're a technical manager Then that means you're helping them grow by look doing code reviews and in helping them think of other algorithms or or other ways to solve the the problem via an architectural stance But it means you can't just fire and forget You can't say Alan you will do this by tuesday And then come tuesday go why haven't it been done? Although alan would get it done um Loyalty is everything now and i'll i'll just years ago Michael hunter blogged on this For those who I think it's actually his last blog still Um, he asked me to write up about the best bug i've ever encountered And the best bug I ever encountered is when I completely screwed the pooch as a test manager We had this product We had these test plans of all the operating systems that we were going to work on I had a team of 40 people Uh, the dev team had a team of 20 people Remember the days when test outnumbered dev? And that was so stupid and we had like five pm's and we still couldn't test quality in no um So we had a team of like 60 people And long story short our product relied on dcom and We were going to ship with office And they were on windows 95 or 98 that did not have dcom And we didn't discover until after office greenlighted That we didn't work on on that os And we never did So we had gone through a series of interrupts and changing plans and in that whole process. We had forgotten to test on that os Okay As the the test manager involved and the one responsible for quality If I had been my manager that day, that would have been my last day of this company Think thankfully I wasn't and I was on my way Um to go have a conversation with my manager because he needed to know one of my uh Managers that reported to me knew what I was about to do And he interrupted me and he said brit Do not do what you're going to do. He's like, I I don't know what what are you talking about? I was trying to own the message what what i'm not doing anything He knew better He said before you do anything Go home sleep on it and if if what you are what I think you're about to do if you still want to do it I won't get in your way I said, okay deal I came back the next morning That guy came and talked to me um But he was still wearing the same clothes He and my entire team had done an all-nighter Working with dev they found they fixed the problem. They did an entire month's test pass in one night And it was entirely Because they didn't want me to um fall on my sword which was Absolutely what I was about to go do um, oh yes now The thing I would say When it comes to to giving feedback the most important thing is everybody needs to know What actions to take next and it and it doesn't matter if it's um, if it's a poor performing employee Or it's one of your stars everyone wants to have Ideas and thoughts of what's the next thing I can do to improve myself and a lot of the times Managers, even if you have a manager doing weekly 101 so that doesn't mean it's going to be good A lot of those managers all they do is adjectives Right. Uh, oh, you're great. You're excellent Uh, or you suck or you need to improve or any of these type of things And it's not concrete enough um that's My secret to success as a manager is you got to give them um An action you got to give them action ability you have to earn their trust so that you can actually tell them the truth And they'll hear it Anyway You have more to say I I got so lost in there So what is I think I figured out I had a question on what a technical manager was and it's But I think you answered that part way through so that's good Um, I think most managers Yeah, we're kind of mixed At least on the test side with whether managers are technical or not But most I think most managers these days have are technical to some level I wanted to jump on another extreme because what we're talking it reminded me of Sort of the well, let me ask you this see if it gets where i'm going if not we'll see we'll all adjust Okay So we talked about holacracy and uh self-organizing teams. What's the opposite of that? What's the other end of the spectrum describe the structure and just briefly of what would be the other end of an extreme on that? uh, the the one that The one i'm thinking of is is kind of when I was introduced to to management I was told this rule of thumb for each employee you have you should be spending 10 of your time uh working with that employee to improve them or to to Talk with them is good. Even back 10 of your time is invested in them, you know Yeah, looking at in some hand wavy thing is is basically that's communicated Which basically means if you had back in those days if you had a team of 10 That's all you should be doing Um, so I think that's that's the opposite extreme Someplace where you have due to some team size and your accountability That's all you do. Yeah, I wonder if so my take on that is if that's your and somebody may have that that Idea still in their head, but I wonder if your team really grows It's kind of like you gotta set them free and my whole my one of my principles around management is Give people a framework they can work in and then get out of their way and then I combine that with uh, Sort of the one-minute manager concept. It's it's a nice little business parable book easy to read I suggest you fly through it, but you just need to know when to dive in and and when to intervene and and you do that by Knowing what's going on in your team doesn't need to be uh, You know a constant monitoring and sometimes people more monitoring than others, but it's it's not hovering either It's getting out of their way until you need to be Need to know what's going on I completely agree the One of the speeches that I give often to my teams Is in order to learn and grow? You have to take on challenges And you have to make mistakes. Absolutely Um a lot of managers I've talked to when I when I say no, you need to let your team make mistakes They look at me like oh my god, they're too afraid. My project's gonna fail blah blah blah too afraid And you don't and but they don't understand that The reason why you need to make let them make mistakes is so that you can help them learn from it Yeah, I just wonder if you are the overbearing, you know 10 percent of your time Dedicated to each employee if they have that room to grow and you sort of develop this Dependency or codependency where as an employee i'm not sure what to do unless my manager comes by and gives me that You know invest that hour a day and I didn't do the math. They're not that much but you know, um Diving in and telling me, you know what I need to be doing. I need to figure things out on my own One of the things with my current job Microsoft is I mentioned this a lot and someone asked yesterday How do you figure out what to do? I said there's always work to do and i've had a good track record of being able to figure out What's the most important work to do? But I haven't had a manager tell me what to do in Since I can remember it's been since like late 90s since I had a manager actually gave me assignments That's I think that's Positive I think so too. That's not a bad thing I'm not saying negative things about my managers with with they trust me to figure out what needs to get done with one possible thing Is like you only know what you what you are capable of knowing and I do think Um, the only weakness to that is it would have been good uh At least annually a manager assigned you something That's somewhat out of your Comfort zone and not your wheelhouse or something that you would normally choose to do because that helps you grow I know but as going back to my comment on uh, michael arson's blog and and and my uh Relation to that is that I do pick things that are hard. I do pick things out of my comfort zone Alan is an active learner. So so yeah, I don't say yeah, I this is not a A a path that's maybe automatic for everyone. Yeah The the other thing uh, the last thing I think i'll say on this topic I thought you were done already I was and then and then you said something that I liked I don't know if you have figured out how this podcast thing works. We like talk and bounce the ideas off each other. Anyway We'll work that out Maybe maybe that can be an action for you to take. Hey brant. Take take this action Alan yet again indicated that brint is number one One thing I think these technical managers because you you you did say an insight Around that they're afraid they're afraid to do this And one of the things I think these these super technical managers need to get over or or hopefully it'll give them some some help And hope to experiment But the reason why you want to let you uh People make those mistakes Actually, why do you think why would it be valuable to that technical manager to let those people make mistakes? Valuable to him valuable to him. I don't know tell me it's it's primarily because Learning is what causes an acceleration If you don't let them make those mistakes and you don't give them the the the ability to actionably grow Then you're going to be dealing with a static world from exactly. Yeah, right You don't have the ability to accelerate this forward progress. You don't have the ability to scale And quite honestly for those managers growing your team and getting them to to do that ability to scale Is important to your career growth. Yeah, I i'm a also a big believer in the learning organization and yeah singe's work there Absolutely with the 100 and not enough that happens uh, the last thing that reminded me of as we continue to babble around this is uh In holo in a holocracy Where does the decision making happen? It rotates it happens at where it needs to at the closest point to where it needs to happen and I believe in that for a team too, I Uh, I think a lot of managers have you shared your world of warcraft story on podcasts yet. I'm sure I have So yeah in brief I believe a lot in the world of warcraft theory of project management where? You form a group You know to accomplish a specific task You work on that task together share the rewards then you either disband or take on another task Yeah, and and who's the leader in the the world of warcraft model it rotates right? It depends I think that model is all about holocracy and you know, i've done this dungeon before i'll be the leader great I've rode this pony before. Um So, where was I going? Oh so decision making in hawks and in a self-organizing team in general it happens where it needs to Many managers I know and i'm going to tell a quick story here Uh want to be the single point for that decisions for their team Slows the team down a lot Now think about what happens and as microsoft people going oh god I have stories for you and I will tell you the same story you're probably thinking in your head. I worked on a product once where our vice president Not my favorite vice president at microsoft, but you can't don't know what i'm talking about because they have like 150 of them But you know, I I think I mentioned this to you right at apple They have like a cto a cfo a couple vps and that's it I'm trying to guess the vp and we have 150. So anyway, is this a vp? So anyway here? Yes Okay, not the one I was thinking of Anyway, I better not say the name because um, yeah, it'll be obvious to some And if I say his name i'll just start going off on him and this will be my final podcast recorded on the microsoft campus but anyway, but anyway, but anyway, he was He wanted to be involved in every decision and talk about a technical manager. Here's where you can go too far to the extreme is We would be in he would show up to uh, like a ship room meeting we're going over bugs and he would dive in and want to discuss Everything down to which reg key we are going to modify to do You to make this work At some point as a manager you can be you can be I mean even if you i'm a technical manager of a team of eight people uh, I There's a point, you know, i'm I can see myself fairly technical beyond the line. That's like way I know on the line like You need to trust people to make decisions and get out of their way and at some point There are bigger problems you need to worry about than minutia implement minutia of implementation When I see managers at that level like the first thing um I go This guy seems like he's being defensive like yeah And and typically people who aren't being defensive In this case, he wasn't defensive. I really think that he In a way, he sort of validated himself. It's like yeah, I can i'm a vp But I still dive in here and you know if I had to I would write this code I will tell you a a Different story the best vp I ever worked for and i'll even mention his name. It was bob muglia He was highly technical I I remember, uh very fondly a day he and I spent three hours uh Bullshitting, uh outside Talking about uh his exchange server deployment that he did all by himself At his home now why a vp needs his own exchange server deployment at home Doesn't matter He did he had his own domain and pop wasn't enough, but he um He at that time was vp uh of server and tools division right, so That was his I would I would say what he was doing and the reason when he went through those actions He was highly tech the most technical vp i've ever worked for But in terms of the space that he owned I would argue what he was doing and why he was doing it was more so around customer empathy and helping his business grow Not I mean he never got in our business. That is Completely different. Yeah, I mean that's passion for technology which is completely different from Diving in way too deep on day to day implementation details. That's a great example of get the you know, get out of their way I'm just i'm just imagining your your last vp going through like a code review and going hey Hard-coded string that shouldn't be there My last vp. No, he definitely wouldn't have done that He was the one you were talking about. I don't know that's the last one. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's the last one the last one's actually Um, I you know, I like him He's not my vp anymore. I have a different vp I can't keep track how many different vps have I worked for? Oh my god I don't even want to count. Yeah. All right, even certain which you're talking about I I don't think we have time to dive into our last topic. So I have to shelve it We will and I think actually There's going to be some more interesting things coming up over the next two weeks on that topic So let's shelve it and yeah, and there's so much to talk. There's so much going on But it's been fun to be back Yeah again. Happy new year Yeah And I apologize that we didn't actually talk about anything But we did get a few nuggets in there about management and structures and holocracies and other cool words I can put in the summary when I get this posted short shrifting short. I gotta look up shrifting that sh r i f t ing. Yes All right. And another word for you to look up is G-o-f-f-o Okay, we're we're gonna call that good i'm alan i'm brent and we'll see you next time see you guys
