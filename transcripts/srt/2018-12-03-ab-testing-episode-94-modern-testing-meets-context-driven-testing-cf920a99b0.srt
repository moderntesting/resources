A B. Test

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,400
The Modern Testing Podcast.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,940
I am mindless agile robot.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,320
I must iterate.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,880
As we talk about software engineering, software quality,

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,500
leadership, and whatever else comes to mind.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,280
Now on with the show.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,120
Hey, we're back.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,920
Howdy everyone.

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,880
Hey, welcome to another episode of A B testing.

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,680
This is what I thought when I drove to work this morning,

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,920
95 that it is not in this episode 94.

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,440
Nope. 95 is our infamous.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,200
End of the year extravaganza.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,040
Right.

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,480
Where we try and come up with predictions

18
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,200
and you know, predicting things is hard,

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,360
especially about the future.

20
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,220
We'll also review some of the things we liked and loved

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,430
about 2018.

22
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,310
I don't know if you saw my tweet.

23
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,670
Did I just tweet this?

24
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,150
I put it in our channel as well.

25
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,070
You slacked it.

26
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,350
I tweeted it and slacked it in one of the three.slack.com.

27
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,990
Do you slack it?

28
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,670
I'm going to say I slacked it.

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,990
I was searching for, I was actually looking for something.

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:21,950
It was based on a conversation we had

31
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,430
where I was trying to find my strength finder information.

32
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,270
Did you?

33
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:29,690
And I did find it because it's weird.

34
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,790
Probably one of the only accounts I have left,

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,390
I'll probably keep discovering more,

36
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,450
where it used my Microsoft email address as the login.

37
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:40,830
So luckily I remember my password

38
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,990
because there was no way I was getting the password

39
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,830
with the email that to me.

40
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,910
Did you, oh, so you didn't do the blog search,

41
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,590
I suggest, because you do your blog on it.

42
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,630
And I did the blog search.

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,270
I did not find a blog on it.

44
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,150
I don't think I blogged it.

45
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,610
So while you remember that,

46
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:00,230
but what I did find interestingly,

47
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,030
interestingly it was what I found

48
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,910
is some predictions I made about trends

49
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,670
in software testing in 2014.

50
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:10,670
And I made it as a result of someone saying,

51
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:11,790
these are the trends.

52
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,990
I thought, these aren't trends.

53
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,830
These are established things.

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,630
Like one of the trends was mobile testing.

55
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,070
It's like, what the heck?

56
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,270
Oddly, you can go find my tweets

57
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,430
because I've forgotten what the things are.

58
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,710
But you posted it on.

59
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,030
I did post it on Twitter.

60
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,370
20, no, 2014 was when I think the date.

61
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,430
Yes, it was mid 2014.

62
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,950
So three and a half years ago.

63
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,610
And it ended up being a lot of things

64
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:35,490
that we're seeing a lot of,

65
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,370
I was actually right for once.

66
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,510
But I don't think it was a tough stretch.

67
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,350
It was stuff.

68
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,170
No, this is.

69
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,990
It was stuff we had been talking about.

70
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,950
Even before we, at that point,

71
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,070
I don't think we had named modern testing.

72
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,910
No, no, no.

73
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,030
But we had talked about it indirectly

74
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:51,070
because we had talked about our struggles

75
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,590
with traditional testing.

76
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,790
We just hadn't come up with the opposite term yet.

77
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,630
But anyway.

78
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,910
We had to come up with names.

79
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,830
It was interesting to look at.

80
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,790
It was funny, I got a comment, a fresh comment

81
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,150
based on the tweet from someone who didn't realize

82
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,670
it was three and a half years old.

83
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,870
It said, oh, these are good.

84
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,230
Some other trends I see are blah and blah.

85
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,310
I think you missed the point.

86
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,150
Yeah.

87
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,730
Time out.

88
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,570
Time out.

89
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,650
Timing.

90
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,030
You were gonna get me a cup of coffee.

91
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,870
No, it's cool.

92
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,230
It's cool, I'm just saying.

93
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,630
I'm just saying.

94
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,030
I was.

95
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,630
I epically failed the coffee.

96
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,470
Anyway, go on.

97
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,880
I don't know, five, six years ago.

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,480
Not Whitaker, so this is a story about Whitaker.

99
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,360
Not his current.

100
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,320
Matt Whitaker, the Ace Attorney General.

101
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,160
No, James Whitaker.

102
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,480
Oh, James Whitaker.

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,960
Not his latest book on stories,

104
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,940
but I think the tours one.

105
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,780
Yes.

106
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,380
What was the name of that book?

107
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,580
I think it was called Exploratory Testing.

108
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,940
Oh, right.

109
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,340
Mainly to piss off some folks.

110
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,180
Yeah.

111
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,580
Successfully done, I might say.

112
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,020
And yeah, that was funny.

113
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,180
I wrote the forward for that book, by the way.

114
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,140
Did you?

115
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,580
That's the best part of the book.

116
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,420
The one thing.

117
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,260
Arguably.

118
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,960
So it was one of the last few times

119
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,960
James had a regularly scheduled lunch with me.

120
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,520
And it may be possible that I pissed him off

121
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,760
on my comments on this one.

122
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,870
But I'm like, James, this book

123
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,870
is exactly the same as How to Break Software,

124
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,590
except with this tour spin on it.

125
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,950
And one of the things that I, yeah,

126
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,460
he didn't appreciate that comment,

127
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,420
but he did accept it.

128
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,340
And he's like, dude, you know what?

129
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,700
Sometimes you just repackage the same thing.

130
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,830
And I'm like, I think about that a lot on MT

131
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,150
and I think it's related to your stuff.

132
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,150
I think MT is going to be contextually relevant

133
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,040
for much longer than either you and I have patience for.

134
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

135
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,310
Right, I think it'll still be relevant

136
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,110
potentially five years from now.

137
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:24,950
Oh, I think it's-

138
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,470
But if you and I are still talking about it

139
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,950
five years from now, we either came up

140
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,390
with something really fresh that excites us

141
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,670
or this podcast is gonna be super boring.

142
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,070
Going to be, continue to be.

143
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,470
No, this is a relative discussion.

144
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:50,170
A couple stories, we do have one topic today, one,

145
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,730
but a couple stories which are relevant,

146
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,770
this is not the normal preamble you should skip,

147
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,650
so get your fingers off of the fast forward

148
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,290
plus 30 seconds or plus 10 minute button.

149
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,240
A few more stories about walking the talk.

150
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,150
I'm continuing to shrink my team.

151
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,430
I'm finding new places for them to work.

152
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,070
One of the things, one of the techniques

153
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,750
I should probably mention I haven't gotten into is

154
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,110
I do regular one-on-ones with all of the Dev Leads

155
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:21,300
I work with and that's been super helpful

156
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,900
in kind of keeping the culture going

157
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,260
and enabling the people who no longer work for me

158
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,220
to continue to be successful.

159
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,140
So I met with another Dev Lead this week

160
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,100
and we talked about moving one of my leads

161
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,700
to work for him and what that meant

162
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,260
and part of the deal was that I of course

163
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,780
continued my one-on-ones with the lead

164
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,460
and I would begin regular one-on-ones with this Dev Lead

165
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,260
as part of this transition for indefinitely.

166
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,260
And I think I've got to a tipping point

167
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,740
where I haven't counted, but I believe

168
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,220
I have more one-on-ones, and these aren't just chat,

169
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,290
these are about careers, about solving problems,

170
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,650
it's about mentoring and coaching.

171
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,250
I have more one-on-ones with people

172
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,250
who do not work for me than people who do work for me.

173
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,970
Is that primarily because you've made them

174
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,250
stop working for you?

175
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,090
Yes.

176
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,930
Okay.

177
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,050
Yes, but we still meet,

178
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,330
because they still find,

179
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,130
that's one of the primary questions I get,

180
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,450
which is as I move people away,

181
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,250
it's like can we still meet?

182
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,610
I said yes, of course, I think it's necessary.

183
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,250
But I also find that one of the techniques

184
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,970
I use that we haven't talked about

185
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:26,050
is meeting regularly with those Dev Leads.

186
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,970
Culture change until it sticks

187
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,690
and is able to run on its own volition

188
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,440
needs a lot of care.

189
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,920
I think it's, yes, and I think the value of communication

190
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,000
and keeping lines of communication open

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,070
and establishing trust are severely underrated.

192
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,870
There is...

193
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,310
Not in my particular business,

194
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,160
trust is everything for what I do.

195
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,600
But you're talking about trust of the data.

196
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,280
I'm talking about trust of the people.

197
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,400
Not just the trust of the data,

198
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,840
but the trust of my team.

199
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,720
There is still a high degree

200
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,080
of data science and magic are synonyms.

201
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,870
There's a quote about this.

202
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,710
Yes.

203
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,650
And when people do not have the time

204
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,030
to get deep in the math,

205
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,130
they don't have the patience to do it

206
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,270
anyway, a large number of people don't wanna.

207
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,270
But I am asking them to change their decision-making process

208
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,360
based off of a human, me, my team's analysis

209
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
of what the data is saying.

210
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,000
But I'm talking, I am talking about

211
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
a different kind of trust,

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
because that is definitely needed there

213
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,880
and I understand what you're saying.

214
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
I'm talking about this foundation of trust

215
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,600
you have to have that enables us to have conflict

216
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,760
and sometimes severe and active conflict,

217
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,420
meaning we'll argue.

218
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,160
But it's not, we don't matter to each other,

219
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,880
but we can have, because we have trust,

220
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,620
we know we're flushing out the idea.

221
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,200
And I believe that only the-

222
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,200
The difference between debate and argument is trust.

223
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,000
Very well put, very well put.

224
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,400
And that's where good decisions and good ideas come from.

225
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,760
The way we've talked about where ideas come from

226
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,400
while other ideas get together,

227
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,280
the way you get them to get together

228
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,160
in a more meaningful way is to have debate.

229
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,200
Yes, debate, it doesn't sit right with me,

230
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,200
but I think I'll, I think I'm going down a semantic road.

231
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
You are, you are.

232
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,880
I completely agree.

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,280
And I'll go back to conflict.

234
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,520
There's a fear of, I just talked to someone this week,

235
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,040
one of the dead leads has a massive fear of conflict.

236
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,120
And one of the things I, my job is to do

237
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,200
is to draw that conflict out of him.

238
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,720
But I have to establish that trust first.

239
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,880
So we do it slowly.

240
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,560
I don't just say, what the hell were you doing?

241
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,100
I have to draw those things out.

242
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,600
So I met, speaking of meeting with Lee, dead leads,

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,760
Brent wants to say something.

244
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Yes.

245
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,480
What is worse, a yes man or a no man?

246
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,300
Oh, that's actually a very good question.

247
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,310
I think, I have no preference

248
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,790
because I think they're both,

249
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,830
they're both equally bad is my best answer.

250
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,110
I don't know which, I can't decide if one's worse or not.

251
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,350
Do you have a preference?

252
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:40,710
Yes, man is absolutely worse.

253
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,080
Cause their last rider wins

254
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,320
when you don't have the ability to.

255
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,380
But at least somebody wins, but the no man, nobody wins.

256
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,040
No, the no man is predictable and trust,

257
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
you can trust what they're going to say.

258
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,060
And they don't always say no.

259
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,230
The long-term being a no man, the risk is of course,

260
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,750
that you'll establish a reputation

261
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,050
of not being a team player.

262
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,860
But the yes man, when they say yes,

263
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,700
it's just a matter of time before, they'll say yes,

264
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,220
but then their actions is actually a no.

265
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,860
One of the attributes of leadership

266
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,660
and actually one of the people I talked to

267
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:29,110
that's been working for me, asked me,

268
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,100
we were talking about the quality culture transition model,

269
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,940
which someone called the constantly improving quality model,

270
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,440
which is pronounced Sycam, which I kind of like.

271
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,280
But he said,

272
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,440
I thought you didn't want it to be a model though.

273
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
What about his transition guide?

274
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,800
Yes. Okay.

275
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,500
He said, what would that look like for leadership?

276
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,260
And the problem is, is there are leadership models

277
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,900
and they suck.

278
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,120
So I'm a little afraid to do it,

279
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
but in thinking through it,

280
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,440
I promise I might think through it.

281
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,760
And I think I will do something that I'll share even

282
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,360
on a much smaller basis.

283
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,520
By the way, I am not going to dump,

284
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,220
at least in the time being,

285
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,400
the quality culture transition guide to the masses,

286
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,640
but it has been shared in our Slack channel.

287
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,240
So you can join that or ask me

288
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,680
and I'll give you a view of a draft of it,

289
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,800
but I'm not just gonna dump it out on the blog

290
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,480
or the website at this point.

291
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,560
But I was thinking about this growth path,

292
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,640
this transition guide for becoming a new leader

293
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,800
to an experienced leader.

294
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,580
And one of the attributes is,

295
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,880
this is actually all coming back,

296
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
is decision making.

297
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,820
And a yes man can't make a decision.

298
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,200
Well, they can't make a proper decision

299
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,280
because everything's yes.

300
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,360
So anyway, I was talking-

301
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,420
They're deferring to a different decision maker.

302
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,060
Yes.

303
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:51,900
And they want to please.

304
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,940
They don't want to cause conflict.

305
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,900
They want to please,

306
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,780
but that's not the way to be a leader.

307
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,000
It does not help anyone.

308
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,160
So I was meeting with,

309
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,100
there's a story I'm getting to here eventually.

310
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,040
I went to San Francisco Tuesday for the day,

311
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,060
met with a bunch of important people down there.

312
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,740
And one thing,

313
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,220
and a lot of them are just normal,

314
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,620
like talking with leads on how things are going,

315
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
getting an idea of how their quality is going,

316
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,420
quality, culture, et cetera.

317
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,060
Not that exciting.

318
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,980
One interesting thing happened internally lately.

319
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,540
We did a little bit of a reorg,

320
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,060
nothing to do with my org directly,

321
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,250
but we moved where some of our internal tools,

322
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,210
substrate engineering happens,

323
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:40,250
to work through the ads team.

324
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,410
And tell me if this sounds familiar.

325
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,250
I want to get back to that point.

326
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,830
You moved into Microsoft GitHub?

327
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,680
I'm guessing not.

328
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,780
Your body language says no.

329
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,120
No, we use, what's it called?

330
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,580
Azure DevOps?

331
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,810
You're right, Azure DevOps.

332
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:03,590
Is it Azure DevOps for GitHub?

333
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,430
Great name.

334
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,510
No, it's not a great name.

335
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,630
It's the stupidest freaking name in the world.

336
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,830
This from the team who brought you XT.

337
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,670
Oh God.

338
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,320
Yeah, yeah.

339
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,480
So we moved around.

340
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,320
So there's a central tools team,

341
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,400
it's the best way of putting it.

342
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,560
We made a small reorg.

343
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,200
So central tools team now reports

344
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,830
through my ads organization.

345
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,590
And while I like it,

346
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,710
it's in a much better place

347
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,260
than the lead was, I knew was good.

348
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,020
I worry because, and you can relate to this,

349
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,820
how many times at Microsoft

350
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,420
do we have some sort of tool used

351
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,500
that was or set of tools

352
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,140
that were to be used by the whole company

353
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:52,470
but were owned or owned and managed in a specific org?

354
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,950
Okay, now Brent's making a face.

355
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:59,610
How many of those were successful?

356
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,250
Brent's counting on his fingers.

357
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,170
Yeah, so I was understandably worried.

358
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,310
But, so, go ahead.

359
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,470
And then, because I,

360
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,710
there is a happy ending here.

361
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,750
I don't want the Unity listeners to go,

362
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,870
oh my God, what comes next?

363
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,350
So get to your thing and I'll evolve my thought here.

364
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:28,020
No, so there's systems ebb and flow.

365
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,180
Okay, and then this is a particular,

366
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,100
what you're talking about is a particular system.

367
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,860
I have been aware of, particularly at this company,

368
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,420
and I think it's more than just this company,

369
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,810
almost within the first few years.

370
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:52,210
And that is the pendulum on how engineering tools

371
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,620
should be built constantly swings.

372
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:02,440
It goes, oh, duplication of effort.

373
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,760
We should centralize.

374
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,250
Well, and then that over pivots

375
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:13,250
because then once it's centralized and it's valuable,

376
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,330
these guys stop having a relationship

377
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,330
with the actual consumers.

378
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,050
And they start doing make work exercises

379
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,610
to adjust their continual existence.

380
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,680
They eventually get called out

381
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,840
because their dependency teams aren't able

382
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,160
to solve the problems that they need to from this team.

383
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,330
And then that begins to swing back towards decentralization.

384
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,370
And then it's just a matter of time

385
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,730
before duplication of effort.

386
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,410
And it just goes back and forth and back and forth.

387
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:49,730
Microsoft especially likes to swing pendulums

388
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,680
in its decision making.

389
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,040
There is a way to do this in a centralized manner.

390
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,280
No, and I agree with that.

391
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,880
And I'm actually, I'm 100% confident it will work

392
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,760
because the thought models of the lead in charge

393
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,620
of this org and I are super highly aligned.

394
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,700
That's one reason I think it will work.

395
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,980
But also, let me ask you a question, Brent.

396
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,390
What are the Microsoft values?

397
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,870
Yeah, I never knew either in my 22 years there.

398
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:24,750
No, I mean, they've changed so many times

399
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,480
and unfortunately here I am, I will absolutely-

400
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,800
I can't name a single Microsoft value.

401
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,970
I will absolutely state with high confidence

402
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,050
that if I had it loaded up, I would agree with it.

403
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,250
Because every time when new set comes out,

404
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,770
I look at it and go,

405
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,130
I first evaluate it against some manager buzzwordy stuff.

406
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,930
I don't know why I still do that

407
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:55,870
because it passes that test 100% of the time.

408
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,330
But then I go, okay, if I look at the intent behind this,

409
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,810
do I agree?

410
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,930
And more often than not, I do.

411
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:07,170
But while that part is good,

412
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,610
the way I look at it is you have a vision or a mission

413
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:13,570
for what you're doing and what you're going to be doing

414
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,250
and the values guide you in how you make decisions

415
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,690
along the way towards your mission and vision.

416
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,930
So if they're not really,

417
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,430
if they're not accessible,

418
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,060
if they're not part of how you make decisions inherently,

419
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,500
and maybe the big thing, maybe the challenge is there is

420
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,050
a lot of times when I worked at Microsoft,

421
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:36,650
I felt Xbox One was a difference.

422
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,130
Windows 95 was an outlier.

423
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,250
I always felt like I was too many degrees

424
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,080
separated from my customer.

425
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,920
Sure.

426
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,740
So anyway, back on track.

427
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,180
I would argue that was mostly because

428
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,460
a lot of that was number one,

429
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,740
you were in a test role.

430
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,220
Number two, you were in a traditional test role

431
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,100
most of that time.

432
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,380
And number two was...

433
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,300
Was that two number twos?

434
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,140
On-prem product.

435
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,980
No, I was...

436
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,020
Yes, yes.

437
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,460
And so...

438
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,300
No, I get it, I get it.

439
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,140
So anyway, so I am going to loop this back in

440
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,540
and get to our other, our mailbag question.

441
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,820
We have four values at Unity.

442
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,620
Value one, then there's value two.

443
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,620
Yes, users first.

444
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,420
Okay, that's okay, whatever.

445
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,540
The customer is the only one able to evaluate

446
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,380
the quality of the product.

447
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,220
Best users first.

448
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,900
So yep, I can totally support that.

449
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,740
Yep.

450
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,940
Meanwhile, actually the people that argue with that one

451
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,960
don't listen to the podcast, so we're cool.

452
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,040
Best ideas win.

453
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,680
This is where conflict and trust and actually

454
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,960
doesn't matter if you're the hippo,

455
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,720
as Ronnie Quavie puts it,

456
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
the highest paid person in the organization.

457
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,960
The best ideas win.

458
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,560
Yeah, the problem with that one is often who gets to judge.

459
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,840
But if you have...

460
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,940
As a value, I completely agree.

461
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,620
I'm gonna refer directly to it

462
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,340
because I eased around it,

463
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,740
but Pat Linceone's book,

464
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,060
The Fight is Functions of a Team,

465
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,980
probably his most popular business novel.

466
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,860
I've read all of them.

467
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,060
I'm a huge fanboy of his.

468
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,020
It talks about if you have that trust,

469
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,940
you can get over the fear of conflict.

470
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,540
You can then have people,

471
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,260
if they feel like their voice is heard,

472
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,340
even if they didn't go with their decision,

473
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,420
they will have buy-in and accountability

474
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,540
for achieving whatever or acting

475
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,380
on whatever decision was made.

476
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,460
So I believe all that works together

477
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,780
and that's where best ideas win.

478
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,010
Come from the judge is maybe consensus.

479
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,170
It may not be,

480
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,210
but at least you feel like your voice was heard

481
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,050
during that discussion

482
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,210
and you weren't like stifled out.

483
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,770
It's like, shut up, newbie.

484
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,090
Doesn't happen.

485
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,770
Yeah, I'll stop testing your principles

486
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,890
because I do agree with them.

487
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,810
There's no such thing as a best idea either.

488
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,570
Okay, now I'll stop.

489
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,880
Are you sure?

490
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,650
No, but I'll try.

491
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,930
Anything else?

492
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,300
What's value number three, Alan?

493
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,380
And for the sake of time,

494
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,340
I'll skip to the fourth one,

495
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,660
the one that I wanted to be relevant.

496
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,300
I probably should have just mentioned this one

497
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,540
and skipped to the other one

498
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,460
so I could not have your damn value testing,

499
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,820
but in it together.

500
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,220
When I think about this,

501
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,500
and again, these values can be words on paper

502
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,900
that you can agree with,

503
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,220
but as a culture,

504
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,340
the company does work very well together.

505
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,340
People try to and want to help each other

506
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,860
regardless of what division they're in.

507
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,780
And while it has improved, admittedly,

508
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,380
the org chart cartoon

509
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,780
that shows all the divisions pointing guns at each other

510
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,580
is still partially to largely true,

511
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,860
or at least it was two years ago when I left.

512
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,940
And that's what I saw on these tools

513
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,620
or these systems that were developed in one org

514
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,340
but shared is when push came to shove,

515
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,220
100 times out of 100,

516
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,380
the work was done,

517
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,460
the preference was for the local team

518
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,380
versus helping the other teams.

519
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,580
And sometimes people would get worse.

520
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,800
I watched at Microsoft,

521
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,080
teams would get completely bought in

522
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,920
and committed and integrated into using a tool

523
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,320
developed by another team

524
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,870
who wanted to be used by everyone.

525
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:20,470
And then they decided they were too busy

526
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,470
and just stopped supporting it

527
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,950
and said, no, you're on your own.

528
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,950
Freaking committed,

529
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,750
we built all our adapters on our end

530
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,910
and now we're screwed, thank you very much.

531
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,150
And said, not our problem.

532
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,160
Yeah, there's...

533
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,480
That happened, that happened.

534
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
Did you get the culture

535
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,000
that your incentive model inspires?

536
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,840
Yes.

537
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,440
Absolutely.

538
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,680
I was thinking about,

539
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,970
what is it, Jack Welch, right?

540
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,170
A lot of the foundation of this company

541
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,170
was based off of Jack Welchian philosophy,

542
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,410
which I do think probably applies to sales.

543
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:07,110
But unfortunately, one of our big leaders

544
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,630
in the history of this company

545
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,110
was just a masterful salesperson.

546
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:14,800
And I don't think the culture

547
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,960
that they put onto the company,

548
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,760
I don't think enough thought was put into

549
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,560
as to whether or not

550
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:25,140
that is applicable outside of sales.

551
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,320
Oftentimes, I don't have the data here,

552
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,350
but I hear that it is often the case in sales

553
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,700
that the top 10% of your sales force

554
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:48,960
is providing greater than 50% of the value,

555
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,740
the business, the sales.

556
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,560
And so there's this idea of,

557
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,490
well then we should reward that.

558
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,090
I don't know that management science

559
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,850
has found a good solution for this one yet.

560
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,530
I do know, for example, they have discovered

561
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,680
that if you wanna grow company performance,

562
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,140
you randomly promote people.

563
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,580
You randomly switch between the best employee

564
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,740
and the worst employee,

565
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,980
because a lot of times the worst employee

566
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,140
isn't suited for the job that they have.

567
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,450
They should be in more of a strategic role.

568
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,290
No.

569
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,330
I've seen it over and over again.

570
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,210
Okay, whatever.

571
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,090
Anyway, I'm not sure why your microphone

572
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,090
is not pointing at your neck,

573
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,890
but I'm just gonna ignore that.

574
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,850
And we'll go on.

575
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,130
I have a question from a coworker.

576
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,910
Actually, if I could draw better,

577
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,230
and I've been working on it,

578
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,670
I really should do better.

579
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,270
Monty, Monty.

580
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,950
We got a cartoon, we need a comic strip

581
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:54,950
to go with this recording

582
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,190
that just goes through the hell

583
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:58,030
I go through every week.

584
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,190
Every other week, or sometimes every third week.

585
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,910
So a coworker asked a question,

586
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,950
and one thing I wanna mention is,

587
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,630
an odd thing, and maybe slightly uncomfortable

588
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,670
for me thing at Unity is,

589
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,670
despite Unity being 1 1 hundredth

590
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,270
of the size of Microsoft,

591
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,260
I have more podcast listeners at Unity

592
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,300
than I did at Microsoft.

593
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,620
And sometimes it's surprised like someone.

594
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,340
As a percentage or as a person?

595
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,640
As a number.

596
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,480
As a number.

597
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,360
And maybe there were more Microsoft listeners

598
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,000
or there are than I think,

599
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,520
but there are a chunk of Unity listeners

600
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,840
and hey, shouting out to you,

601
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,320
this is for you.

602
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,640
Well I hope if I say things that piss you off,

603
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,550
you tell me.

604
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,630
That's all I'll say.

605
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,230
But anyway, Klaus.

606
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,070
Who was awesome?

607
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,610
Klaus.

608
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,090
I love the name Klaus.

609
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,090
I always have to say it in a German accent.

610
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,170
Yeah, he's Danish.

611
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,970
I am too-ish.

612
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,490
You're something-ish.

613
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,930
Anyway, in general, Klaus asked if we could talk more

614
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:09,320
about how the context-driven testing principles

615
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,720
compare, contrast, interact, whatever

616
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,960
with the modern testing principles.

617
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,160
Sure.

618
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,120
So I will quickly read through,

619
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,800
actually Brent, should I go through all seven?

620
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,840
Actually, if you can limit your,

621
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,680
no I'll read them.

622
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,840
And I want you to comment,

623
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,040
but I don't want you to comment like

624
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,320
the diatribe story upon story interwoven

625
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,560
into an inception-like view of the world.

626
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,720
I just want a few comments on each one after I read it.

627
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,720
So one commonality between the modern testing principles

628
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,000
and the context-driven testing principles

629
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,210
is that we both have seven.

630
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,610
Yes.

631
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,140
Number one, the value of any practice

632
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,740
depends on its context.

633
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,640
Is that a principle or a statement of fact?

634
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,480
Between the-

635
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,320
I guess it's a principle

636
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,470
because you could actually,

637
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,280
I would phrase it differently, but yeah.

638
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,680
Remember how I said I was gonna let you comment?

639
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,570
I'm sorry.

640
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:18,900
Yeah, so I think it's not a principle.

641
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,980
I don't think this is what we should do

642
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,750
for the CDT stuff, but for me,

643
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,230
a principle is sort of a philosophical,

644
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,230
unproven vision direction setting.

645
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,210
This is the direction we're heading.

646
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,570
To me, the principles kind of reads more like a proof,

647
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,720
mathematical proof.

648
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,560
Yep.

649
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,440
Like, is there anyone who would say

650
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,090
the value of a practice doesn't depend on this context?

651
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,370
That would imply the value of,

652
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:59,370
there are some practices where the value of the practice

653
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,710
is context-free.

654
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,290
I can't think of an example.

655
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,330
I actually can't either.

656
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,810
When I talk about the modern testing principles in,

657
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,010
and actually I gave a webinar on Thanksgiving

658
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,970
to an audience in Ukraine

659
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,690
because I had nothing else going on.

660
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:20,130
By the way, happy late Thanksgiving there to you, Brent.

661
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:20,970
Hey, thanks.

662
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,130
And I've done this, I think,

663
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,320
in all of the presentations I've done on modern testing

664
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,360
where I go back and talk about why I decided to start

665
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,960
with modern testing principles

666
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,400
and it goes back to,

667
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,360
I happen to be reading a book by Ray Dalio called Principles.

668
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,680
And then you think, yeah,

669
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:50,560
I had, of course I had known about principles before.

670
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,800
So I use that as the starting point.

671
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,960
So I use Ray Dalio's definition of principles,

672
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,120
which are principles are what allow you

673
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,600
to live a life consistent with those values.

674
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,840
Principles connect your values to your actions.

675
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,800
And when I look at the,

676
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,120
anyway, I don't wanna critique,

677
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,080
like these aren't principles all day, but that one's.

678
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,360
No, I don't wanna either.

679
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,360
Cause the one thing that I've observed with,

680
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,040
with another commonality between CDT and MT

681
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,440
is they both target testers

682
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,690
and testers just love tearing things apart.

683
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:31,530
So let's not do that here

684
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,330
because what I see with MT is when that happened,

685
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,250
the message gets lost

686
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,760
because everyone's busily piecing through semantics.

687
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,450
Right, so the value of any practice depends on its context.

688
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,680
I don't think MT says anything pro or against this.

689
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,480
Agree?

690
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,320
Agree.

691
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,160
Agree.

692
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,000
Agree.

693
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,240
So these are more of beliefs than principles was my point.

694
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,640
There are good practices in context, this is number two.

695
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,460
There are good practices in context,

696
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,500
but there are no best practices.

697
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,340
Okay.

698
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,420
Again, MT doesn't say anything for or against this.

699
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,260
Correct.

700
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,630
I do agree with it.

701
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,950
Yeah, yeah, because you said something about it earlier,

702
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,980
which was actually interesting.

703
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,860
And it depends on your definition of best.

704
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,300
And if you use the dictionary definition,

705
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,340
yeah, I agree with it.

706
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,620
There's always something better.

707
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,220
People working, number three, people working together

708
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,180
are the most important part of any project's context.

709
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,180
That's very similar to agile principles.

710
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,020
What?

711
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,060
It's people over, oh my,

712
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:47,720
fuck, edge today.

713
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,560
All right.

714
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:54,840
So one day I will come through on my promise to Periscope,

715
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,240
one of our sessions.

716
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,440
Again, you must experience the hell

717
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,800
that is an A-B testing requirement.

718
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,920
Oh my God.

719
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,440
People working together are the most important part

720
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,720
of any project's context.

721
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,020
Dude, you need some meds.

722
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,580
People working together.

723
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:17,100
So people working together.

724
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,180
I don't disagree.

725
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,380
I don't disagree.

726
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,620
And we could potentially argue the community principle

727
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,140
is related to this one.

728
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,260
They don't contradict.

729
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,500
In terms of the most important part,

730
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,250
that would be something,

731
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,290
so the spirit of it, I agree with.

732
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,090
The literal interpretation,

733
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,890
I'm not certain I agree with yet.

734
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:45,930
And I don't wanna spend the time thinking about it now.

735
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,170
Number four, projects unfold over time

736
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,650
in ways that are often not predictable.

737
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,000
True?

738
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,960
I think that's a bit of a tautology.

739
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,560
But yeah.

740
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,040
I guess it really lies more with an agile principle.

741
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,430
We believe there's something about being adaptable.

742
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,510
What is it, principle two?

743
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,910
Continuous deployment and-

744
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,390
Continuous improvement.

745
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:16,780
So MT does sort of address this.

746
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,300
But in terms of more of an actionable thing,

747
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,380
like the continuous deployment theory of constraints,

748
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:29,380
that is an MT principle because we agree with number four.

749
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,300
So this was interesting.

750
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,820
Number five, the product is a solution.

751
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,880
If the problem isn't solved, the product doesn't work.

752
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,600
And this actually aligns exactly-

753
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,800
With the customer principle.

754
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,160
With the principle number five of the MT principles,

755
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,540
which is the one, well, they're like saying,

756
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,500
if someone who is a believer or follow these principles

757
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,260
did not like number five,

758
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,180
it would be like them saying the product,

759
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,300
if they believe this, that the product isn't solved,

760
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,860
the product doesn't work,

761
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,740
well, only the customer is able to tell

762
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:03,220
if their solution is, if their problem is solved.

763
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,030
I am willing to bet, I have not done the research,

764
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,590
but I am willing to bet that there is

765
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,010
as much controversy on this one

766
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,790
as there is on our principle.

767
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,310
Interesting.

768
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,390
But to me, it's just like, yes,

769
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,390
we've talked about the Tom Popendike quote

770
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:23,430
about customers don't want software,

771
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:24,590
they want their problem solved.

772
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,150
I believe that 1 million percent, if that was possible.

773
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,050
I could imagine it would be,

774
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,550
but in a certain context, it is a solution.

775
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,470
So does that mean the problem,

776
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,350
I could see that they-

777
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,990
Oh, listen, this doesn't make any sense,

778
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,830
but I wanna say it.

779
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,100
In a certain context, is a context really a context?

780
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,060
Not enough coffee, dude.

781
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,480
Okay, there's not enough in the world.

782
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,660
Number six, good software testing

783
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,710
is a challenging intellectual process.

784
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,390
Good software development

785
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,990
is a challenging intellectual process.

786
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:01,210
Good cooking is a challenging intellectual process, et cetera.

787
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,920
Yes.

788
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,760
Good, and I will object-

789
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,920
Place verb here.

790
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,160
Good knowledge work.

791
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,980
And often we forget that testing is just knowledge work.

792
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,680
I shouldn't say just, but testing is knowledge work.

793
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,300
Yes, yes, it's a challenging intellectual process.

794
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,340
I guess it's, again, a belief?

795
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,380
No, it's not a belief.

796
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,360
As you just called out.

797
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,840
The one thing I think where we might disagree,

798
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,540
we will absolutely agree that good knowledge work

799
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,780
is a challenging intellectual process.

800
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,780
I don't think we fully agree with what I interpret as

801
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:50,170
an implied over ascension of the testing rule.

802
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:59,280
Because specifically calling this out is interesting.

803
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,340
Why did they say testing and not knowledge work

804
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,520
or development or whatever?

805
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,360
Right, they're trying to elevate it.

806
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,360
When I see this principle applied even from whoever,

807
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,200
whether they're followers of the principles or not,

808
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,440
it's more them trying to justify,

809
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,370
what I see more often is a justification of their role.

810
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,690
But my job's important, it's actually very, very hard.

811
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,050
I wasn't there for the development, so I do see that,

812
00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,130
but I don't know that the developers

813
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,730
of these principles intended that.

814
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,730
There's some things I wanna get beyond here.

815
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,850
So number seven, only through judgment and skill,

816
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,890
exercise cooperatively throughout the entire project

817
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:42,130
are we able to do the right things at the right times

818
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,930
to effectively test our products.

819
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,610
Which is kind of a summation of a lot of these.

820
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:51,810
But how is this trying to figure out

821
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,650
how it fits in with modern testing?

822
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,010
If it fits in with MT principles

823
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,000
any more or less than the others?

824
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,240
It occurs to me that there's another similarity

825
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,320
between MT and CDT here.

826
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,670
And that there is only one principle

827
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,050
that contains the word test.

828
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:13,370
Very interesting, that's good.

829
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,530
And actually one, and remember these are much, much older

830
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,690
than the modern testing principles.

831
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,490
I believe, I think the first time I saw these published

832
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:24,450
was when lessons learned came out.

833
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,810
They may have been revised since then,

834
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,730
but that was many, many years ago.

835
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,620
But the one thing I like is when many people have read,

836
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,380
and despite those of you, again,

837
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,420
you listeners aren't the art.

838
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Besides those who have argued

839
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,640
with principles number five and seven,

840
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,600
a lot of people, many people, read the principles

841
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,360
or see a presentation on the principles and go,

842
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,400
oh yeah, that's just common sense.

843
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,960
And I think maybe at the time,

844
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,000
and maybe for some people today even,

845
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,200
these read like common sense.

846
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,560
Because you can nod your head and go, yeah, yeah, yeah.

847
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Again, I think this was, so looking at it now,

848
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,680
and then thinking it through the light of,

849
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,680
you know, if we change the word testing in number six

850
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,240
or the word knowledge work,

851
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,000
the spirit of this is probably nothing

852
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,680
I would disagree with, right?

853
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,040
But might even argue it's a bit of a tautology.

854
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,040
But.

855
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,280
There's not much here that I could think,

856
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,240
I think you mentioned number five,

857
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,560
but may cause some disagreement,

858
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,920
but I don't know where disagreement,

859
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,760
again, so much has changed in the 10 or more years

860
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,600
these first came out.

861
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,800
And that's actually the point I was gonna next make,

862
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,940
is essentially when these were developed though,

863
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,200
and if there's something,

864
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,880
this is something we have explicitly called out

865
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,000
in the modern testing principles.

866
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,400
We fully acknowledge, we don't know when,

867
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,320
when we observe it, we'll both stand up and say,

868
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
yes, this has happened.

869
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,680
But we know there's an expiration date

870
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,440
on the usefulness of the modern testing principles.

871
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,350
We know, we don't know what it is,

872
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,040
but we know there's an expiration date.

873
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,260
This came out in the, I don't know,

874
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,100
the golden age of traditional testing.

875
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,940
Oh yeah, for sure.

876
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,780
I'll show it.

877
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,100
Right, and one of the problems that happened

878
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,820
back in those days,

879
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,100
people were hiring armies of.

880
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,540
Unskilled testers.

881
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:40,620
Unskilled testers.

882
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,860
You know how to turn on a computer?

883
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,740
We needed a tester.

884
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,220
I was there for that.

885
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,640
Manual testing happened all of the time.

886
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,000
It was heavily unskilled.

887
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,240
It was a thoughtless process.

888
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,920
You still see a fair chunk of that in the gaming industry.

889
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,720
Hiring people at minimum wage,

890
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,120
to bang through a game over and over and over.

891
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,880
And quite honestly, I don't have a problem with that.

892
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,160
I don't either.

893
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:18,350
If that is the most efficient and cost effective way

894
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,150
of going from A to B,

895
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,950
A, knock yourself out, business.

896
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,550
The thing I'm actually,

897
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,700
but when I look at this now,

898
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,900
instead of looking at it from a historical point of view,

899
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,100
from a historical point of view,

900
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:39,540
I think this helped add value.

901
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,020
It basically said testing is knowledge work,

902
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:50,760
not a thoughtless exercise.

903
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,220
I think it helped solve that problem.

904
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,060
I think it did too.

905
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,260
One thing maybe missing is the wrap up.

906
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,860
We have accelerated the achievable quality

907
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,940
and the principle support that mission.

908
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,780
Yes.

909
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,940
I wonder, and I'm not gonna scroll through the whole page

910
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,980
here, but there's some statement that wraps all this up.

911
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,680
But yeah, I'll agree with what you said.

912
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,440
I think there's nothing wrong with these.

913
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,120
Some are a bit tautological,

914
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,370
but given the time these came out,

915
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,950
yeah, totally valid.

916
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:24,970
I'm not gonna dive into,

917
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,410
if you go to contextdriventesting.com,

918
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,210
if I'm smart and I'm not,

919
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,360
I would add a link to that in our show notes.

920
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,680
There's illustrations of the principles in action,

921
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,920
which we will,

922
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,840
I don't wanna dive into

923
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,720
because we will disagree with those in many ways,

924
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,680
but they do support the principles

925
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,480
and they do support the time

926
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,640
in which these were written and came out.

927
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,300
Yeah, I would say, looking at it now,

928
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:54,170
there's nothing in here I really find a problem with

929
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,810
except for potentially the highlighting,

930
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,390
or what I was saying about-

931
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,990
Testers have to be smart.

932
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:02,990
No, it's,

933
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,870
this is,

934
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:08,070
these are in alignment

935
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,710
with modern testing,

936
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:15,140
except perhaps how you interpret number six.

937
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,320
I completely agree,

938
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,100
good software testing is a challenging intellectual exercise.

939
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,860
If you use that to justify your position or over elevate,

940
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,020
that is where I'm going to disagree

941
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,120
with using those words.

942
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:32,300
I completely agree with what's written there.

943
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,340
My biggest gripe when these came out was,

944
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,180
I read them and said,

945
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,420
yeah, but all good testing is context driven.

946
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,300
I think at the time though,

947
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,900
there was a lot, a lot of bad testing.

948
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,900
So the authors felt the need to find a way

949
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,740
to step out of that.

950
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:49,580
And it's kind of the,

951
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,380
it's ish is a way we came up

952
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,540
with the modern testing principles.

953
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,540
We viewed traditional testing practices,

954
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,260
whether they're context driven or not,

955
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,740
as a bad way to make software.

956
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,740
You could actually even argue MT is following

957
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,140
the principles of CDT.

958
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,460
We could say that MT is the context driven solution

959
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,460
for shipping software at scale to millions of users.

960
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,380
One of the things I was gonna say is that

961
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:25,420
one thing that is common between these two sets

962
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,540
of principles is,

963
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,540
and I don't think MT actually explicitly calls it out.

964
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,640
And I would actually argue

965
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,840
that's pretty much all they're doing in CDT.

966
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,360
In that taking the systems view is critical.

967
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,480
Now we've laid that out as a fundamental basis

968
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,720
for how we develop this.

969
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,680
I actually kind of look at this now and go,

970
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,230
that's actually what they're saying, right?

971
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,630
You have to take a systems view.

972
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:54,730
And system view has multiple different moving parts.

973
00:42:54,730 --> 00:42:57,700
We agree, totally agree.

974
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,180
One of the things I would actually say is MT

975
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:06,180
is built around the context has changed.

976
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,900
We are now dealing with a new context

977
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,960
and the traditional methods are kind of not applicable.

978
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,720
What got you here isn't gonna get you there.

979
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,400
Right, but context has driven that fact.

980
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,020
Yeah. One could say.

981
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,240
I think we're out of time.

982
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,880
So that was fun.

983
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,720
Thanks Klaus.

984
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,360
And hopefully that answered your question.

985
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,280
Anything else to add, B man?

986
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,940
No.

987
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,100
All right, we'll see you next time

988
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,220
for our end of the year extravaganza.

989
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,380
Please send us your requests for things you want us

990
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,380
to make predictions about or talk about or reflect on.

991
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,860
Otherwise we'll fake it and do it ourselves.

992
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,700
Yes.

993
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,800
I think I'm winning an Emmy this year.

994
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,670
Not sure, I think I am.

995
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,510
Okay.

996
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,350
All right, that's my final.

997
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,170
Congrats.

998
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,070
Okay, see you next time.

999
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:04,910
Bye.
