1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,710
Everybody hi, I'm Alan and I'm Brent and guess what we're back for episode Brent tells me 14 13 14

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,450
No, it's 14

3
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,450
episode 14 of a be testing

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,590
We had to take we missed a week

5
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,350
You may have noticed we usually get something out about every two weeks

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:36,450
But with holidays and things and we had to skip a week. It was kind of a bummer. Yes, it was but we're back and

7
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,890
I guess we have some things to talk about so you're ready to get started. Yeah. I have one thing that's not on the board

8
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,510
No, not on the board feature. We have podcast creep. Yes, we do and that is

9
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,970
very recently

10
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,970
My partner in crime has gotten older. So happy belated birthday

11
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,290
And before all of you send him a Twitter

12
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:08,210
He did not turn 50 in no way shape or form should you send him a Twitter?

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:15,150
Congratulating him on turning. I did not turn. He did not turn. I am one year away from a ARP

14
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,330
I'm a nice square number

15
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,270
Anyway, that happy birthday you geezer. Yeah, I'm

16
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,580
As they say down at the dog park effin old

17
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,990
All right. What were we gonna talk about besides age and forgetfulness?

18
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,090
so

19
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,050
Microsoft has gotten through just recently a bunch of layoffs

20
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:43,210
Without commenting anymore on the good or bad or both of those

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,510
One of our the guy I really respect

22
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,350
Was it wasn't it was given sort of the layoff package were you?

23
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,530
Here's a couple must find a job. You're still employed and he just couldn't find a good fit

24
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,690
it was tough because he's a really smart really well respected guy and

25
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,590
He sent he sent a mail saying

26
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,520
Two things I thought it was things we've hit on here before I want to kind of just bring him up again

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,560
He said there I'll paraphrase a bit two cultural traits that are holding Microsoft back

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,950
He said the first holding back from what?

29
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:25,360
Making faster progress making you're doing being as successful as we should be okay

30
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:29,530
One I'll go in reverse order of his one is something we talked about

31
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:37,290
At least a few podcasts is the non invented here syndrome and and Brent's team is working on breaking that congratulations, Brent

32
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,570
Yes, and I think that's awesome. I I I

33
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,290
Might without its own trials and tribulations

34
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:51,390
Yeah, and what was worse? I should come back to not event in here, but so I will okay

35
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,690
the other one was and

36
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,680
I'm sure Brent can relate to this because I certainly can is the

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,520
Valuation the the value we put on heroes and individual

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,840
Versus team and collaboration. Yep, and something we're trying to break

39
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,240
But it's sort of the the long-standing culture here is you know, we want

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,880
we value the people that come in and stay late in and

41
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,800
Fix the bug at the last minute that they created in the first place

42
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,670
That's one way to put it

43
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,950
We value highly

44
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:34,390
So the one thing that you didn't mention is also the the evils of command and control

45
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:38,550
I would add that to the to that list. Well, it wasn't in his list. So it

46
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,190
falls in there a little bit. I I

47
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:47,080
Agree with that. Let's just talk a little bit about those two points. Well, no, so so

48
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,490
right, we have we have

49
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,450
Heroism we have not invented here

50
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,610
We have command and control and we also have our review process and I would argue all of those things

51
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,210
Work together to increase this behavior. Yeah, I think it's a system

52
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,510
Heroes, why are the heroes coming in working 40 hour days over the weekend?

53
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,450
Right there. They're doing it because

54
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,610
Their command and control structure because they don't have the data

55
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,170
Came up with a bad plan and this guy's coming in and saving the day

56
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:29,210
And why is he doing it because he he perceives he's going to get a better review likely likely

57
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,550
Um, I do believe it's a system

58
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,770
I think I'm sure we've mentioned like all the things that have to change it wants to make it to kind of get that

59
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,770
Culture change to happen

60
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,260
What do you what do you think how what what sort of things could Microsoft do to?

61
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,820
Eliminate that value on the hero and put more value on the team

62
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,180
Peer-based reviews

63
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,860
Okay, something we talked about. Yeah, I've didn't that we spent a good amount of time last time

64
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,800
The the one thing though, that's that's sticking in my head

65
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,620
So Alan puts together all sorts of

66
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,960
Presentations you're like the chair of sasquake right? No

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,970
And I'll put it out here cuz I know those sasquake members are listening, but I'm looking to kind of back out of that role

68
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,980
Okay, but you currently are or no. I'm I'm I just I'm on the steering committee. Okay, that's it

69
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,320
Well, so one I was it you who put together the Jim Benson?

70
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:39,890
Yeah, yeah, I put I put together most of talks. Okay, so one thing that I went to the Jim Benson talk around personal

71
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:48,180
Which is interesting. This is under a topic of agile and one of the things he brought up that has has stuck with me is

72
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,540
teams need heroes

73
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,590
Teams need those people who are willing to

74
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,580
Dive in and just get it done through brute force if worse comes to worse

75
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,180
But the difference that he proposes is if you're a hero

76
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,500
That's your job

77
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,660
It's not going above and beyond your job

78
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,750
Your job is to firefight for the team. And so when you

79
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,090
Every two weeks end up spending

80
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,030
40-hour days

81
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,260
Well, thank you. And I I

82
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,110
Might is very hand wavy as a manager. I don't know how I would

83
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,500
Manage that or track how whether or not my hero on my team is exceeding or

84
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,580
Achieving their job, but I do like that philosophy. I do like that perspective. I have found

85
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:54,950
On the agile process that that I run which is sort of a hybrid between

86
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,270
Kanban and and lean agile

87
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,260
It's kind of allergic to heroes

88
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,020
The team is working together. So kind of heroes get

89
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,770
Not suppressed but pushed down in some regard

90
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,210
The the process doesn't like people

91
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,700
Going their own doing dark matter exercises

92
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,360
There's a perspective that the hero on the team ends up being a bottleneck

93
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,230
eventually

94
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,590
Yeah, did you ever read the Phoenix project? No, it's a it's

95
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:39,030
Took with the bottleneckers. I forget the guy's name. I used to have it memorized for but anyway book Phoenix project. It's

96
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,750
Three of constraints if you're the goal. Yep, so it's sort of the goal written as a

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,480
Little novel about this IT shop and

98
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,790
They have this guy who's basically the hero on the team. He's the bottleneck

99
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,350
He is the constraint and how do you you know?

100
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,510
What are some things you can do to make it so you don't rely on the hero and maybe you're right

101
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,990
That's okay. You can have a hero on the team and it's his job

102
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,390
But you don't you can't be a bottleneck. You can't rely on him like you can't be in a stage where

103
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,170
Well, it's okay that we suck because the hero will bail us out

104
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Yes, and then what happens? I think his name may have been Brent. I gotta think about this

105
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:28,320
I totally forgotten now just popped in my head, but great book on on figuring out how theory of constraints and and and heroes

106
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,840
Relate it's really cool. It's called the Phoenix project. It's been a good

107
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,720
gosh

108
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
ten years since I was

109
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,540
Content being a hero on the team and yes, I've done my time. I'm totally motivated by

110
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,020
Not just me, but the team getting crap done. I like seeing progress

111
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,260
And it if for me, I don't know when the team does it

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,840
When there's no heroes I I feel like the team did something when the heroes did a little work

113
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,800
I feel like the hero did something. I don't know what

114
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,530
So it reminds me of a story. I was one of the last test managers for the the Zune

115
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:12,610
PC client what's a Zune?

116
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,610
And

117
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,170
For those who I think it has a look at that from the Windows 7. I think it has a Wikipedia page people can look it

118
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,170
up. Yes, you can

119
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:29,390
Zun e yes, thank you. Go on you totally put me in the weeds again

120
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:36,240
And there was an individual on that team who was sort of a old-school

121
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,440
STE

122
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,440
alright, and

123
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,360
She was a hero in in the in our vernacular we're talking about today

124
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,260
And it was it was interesting a calibration

125
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,850
this individual

126
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,930
was someone who I

127
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,970
Their manager was saying

128
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:05,340
Oh my god, all the devs want to work with her. She finds every single bug possible

129
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,380
and it was someone who was trying to go get into the senior band and

130
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:16,620
The the challenge I had with that is

131
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,670
in the senior band I expect people to

132
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:28,740
Get trained in leadership be showing how to help others grow and

133
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,370
and

134
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,970
this individual

135
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,220
wanted nothing to do with that and

136
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,940
It turned out that it would be it had the cause

137
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,060
was

138
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,380
There was a fear that if others got taught

139
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,330
then

140
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,330
She wouldn't be special anymore

141
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,050
And there was I have a story very talented tester

142
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,410
I'll say I'll share a story when you're done go. She was a very talented tester and one of the problems that I had with

143
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,960
with with with that approach is

144
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,120
So I remember one day I was talking with with their manager at over over lunch

145
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,660
And I said her existence on the team is actually heart

146
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,060
harming our

147
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:24,850
Organization and he was like what she comes and saves the day. I'm like, okay. Let me ask you a question

148
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:30,430
Are you saying that the whole rest of the test team is?

149
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,830
so inept

150
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,030
That if she weren't here

151
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:43,340
We wouldn't deliver the same degree of quality and he's like

152
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:50,500
Well, of course we would okay, so but we would be late. No. No, we wouldn't be late and I said well

153
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,990
What are you talking about? If?

154
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:02,130
What's the difference why what do you if you just got through telling me that she's coming and saving the day and

155
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,610
You also said if she weren't here

156
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:11,830
The team would still hit the same dates in the same quality bar. So what's the difference? He's like, oh well in that case

157
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,770
If she weren't here

158
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:19,810
Then what we would do is we would train up the rest of the team to be better testers and I said

159
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,890
How is that anything other than her presence is causing harm?

160
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,920
Right. The what had happened is is that the management had taken the lazy way out

161
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,920
relied on on the over relied on the presence of a hero and

162
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,840
it had gotten to the point where

163
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,400
They were a review based bottleneck

164
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,360
And what I mean by that is is that there was a huge fear that if if well, we got to do everything to make her

165
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
happy

166
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,160
Because she leaves our strategy is screwed

167
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:02,280
Because we didn't invest in the rest of the team and they're not prepared to pick up the slack. I think it's

168
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,630
really easy too easy and

169
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,230
for a lot of managers and management teams

170
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,310
to

171
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:16,580
put so much emphasis on the product and

172
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:24,180
You know the date and the features that they forget about the team that makes that software

173
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:30,380
I'm a believer that a healthy software team makes good software quality software. Mm-hmm and

174
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,290
Dysfunctional ones make good software, too. Um

175
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,770
Rarely, I think that's I think that's luck when they do that. I think I think it's a lot you

176
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,450
You'll generally find

177
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,510
20 to 30 percent attrition after they ship

178
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:54,380
Yeah, that that's great. That's good. The biggest the biggest thing I find that when you when you actually

179
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,860
Get agile working

180
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,110
What ends up happening is people's intrinsic?

181
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,550
motivation and their

182
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,110
extrinsic motivation like the

183
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,100
End up being aligned. They're one in the same the challenge now is it's sort of the carrot and the stick

184
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,540
This is why I'm saying dysfunctional teams will do it because if you don't I'll fire you

185
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,660
Right. Okay, so I'll get it done

186
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,820
but it's way more powerful and

187
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:29,460
It'll go a lot faster if people are doing it because there's some internal

188
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,340
Motivation

189
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:40,020
That's driving them. I believe that good management good leadership especially of a larger team is this I call it

190
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,780
Orchestration because I have this music background, but it's figuring out how to best utilize your generalizing specialists

191
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,160
recognized where your bottlenecks are and

192
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,460
Actually that second step something we forget about maybe step one is okay

193
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,100
I'm using my team effectively and I have this hero. They can only do one thing

194
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
I got one place to plug them in and

195
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:07,220
In then taking a step back and recognizing the next step is recognize. Okay, this person could just do this one thing

196
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,740
I'm sort of bottom up to them. How do I how do I relieve that and one thing is to you know?

197
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,980
Find people that can shadow and learn from them and whether it's the whether the woman you're talking about or something

198
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,540
somebody who's here's the only person knows how to configure our our

199
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,500
Our network switch in our data center or whatever something specific. You know, that's kind of bad

200
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,180
Yeah, the thing that ended up being super dysfunctional and in that particular team, right?

201
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,820
Is the management news she was a bottleneck and kept on sending people to her. Yeah train

202
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,460
She wouldn't yeah, and that right the story I was gonna tell earlier is on my very first team at Microsoft

203
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,940
I tested networking on Windows 95 and

204
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,380
and

205
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:56,620
One of the reasons I got the job was that at my previous company. I was the network administrator. This was in mid 90s

206
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,580
I knew a little bit about network. We had a network server that was not even around anymore

207
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:07,020
Really, but we had a network server. I knew some basic administration. I had to set up some we had some accounting software that

208
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,100
Only ran on a network system. So I knew a little bit about it. They needed they needed

209
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
kind of my match of skills plus some

210
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:22,060
Networking a network experience was perfect. We also had a guy in the team who was a network expert

211
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,660
he knew tons about it and

212
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,410
Our manager asked us asked him could you just spend an hour going through?

213
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,790
There's some details that Alan and so the guy don't know about just kind of give them an overview. He said no

214
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:44,620
And he said why says well, I've I've taken classes on this stuff and this is my value to the team

215
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,090
I'm if they know this then I'm not as valuable anymore

216
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:54,980
He actually told the manager that and then the manager told him okay, and then two days later. He was gone

217
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,980
He was walked out of the building

218
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,220
No, you're wrong

219
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,060
You're not so so even then 20 years ago

220
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,600
It was I guess I have to give some credit to our management chain for saying

221
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:16,200
Alright, you know we do value teamwork to some extent and sharing was that was that guy a full-time or

222
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,440
We're but we were all contractors. Oh, yeah, I'm my manager wasn't so why so you don't know my history

223
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,440
I started at Microsoft as a contractor

224
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,240
almost exactly 20 years ago. It was January like 4th 1995 and

225
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,080
I was hired full-time after five months by June by 20th official anniversary is coming up in June

226
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,760
I was 20th. Yeah, I'll be 20 years at Microsoft in June my official ones coming up in February

227
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
I didn't realize we were that close. Oh

228
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:51,090
This February see you're hired six months before me. I started at Microsoft in in fab of 95 December

229
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:56,140
94 I did six months as an intern then eight months as a

230
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,940
contractor and then saw

231
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,780
That's weird. That's a weird progression. Yeah, usually we hire our interns. We don't put them in the the

232
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,180
A-dash you not heard my intern story

233
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,460
Um

234
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,780
Did you like intern in marketing or something legal? No, what'd you do?

235
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:20,540
Once again a be testing often the weeds, but this is how we get the good stories out of branch. Yeah, so I got hired as

236
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,660
As an employee, okay

237
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,790
Guy came to my school

238
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,790
Pasty interview got flow flown up

239
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,620
went through a whole bunch of interviews in December and

240
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:39,050
and

241
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,890
Got the offer. Okay

242
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:50,130
When you come in your first day you go into this thing called new employee orientation. Mm-hmm and

243
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,020
the

244
00:18:53,020 --> 00:19:00,670
The printout they gave you just says new employee orientation now I had

245
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,340
So I came into a building

246
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,150
It was actually

247
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,580
22 21

248
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,630
Came into a building and the room that it told me to go to was to the right and

249
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,420
There was another new employee orientation to the left and I was

250
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,740
Confused because the room it was sending me to

251
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,060
now on that placard said

252
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,480
intern

253
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,120
or orientation to the right and

254
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,340
To the left was full-time and I was confused

255
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,600
Because that was the first time in the entire cycle. So Microsoft was not quite as

256
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:55,410
So you could then you thought you were coming for a job. You're coming for an internship. Yeah, and it wasn't until the day I was there

257
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,730
Now the thing that was handy is HR was there as well that their offices were in the same

258
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:08,210
And they just laughed you and said silly boy. No, no, so I went I went and I went and immediately went and talked to

259
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,930
My my HR person because back in those days

260
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:19,970
HRs people were assigned to people as opposed to there was like one assigned to a group or an organization

261
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:27,250
So I went and talked to my assignee and I said, I'm confused. Why is this telling me to go to that room?

262
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,660
not the full-time room and

263
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,790
She gave me a well-practiced speech

264
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,150
She back in those days they done this before

265
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:44,310
So not this she gave me a well-practiced speech that that so

266
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,150
Back in the day and I think it's still true today if you come in for an intern

267
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,070
one of the problems were people weren't going back to school and

268
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,600
And Microsoft had a commitment with the school that they would send them back

269
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,500
So that they would finish the degree. So she's like Brent

270
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,300
We're not gonna offer you a full-time position because we want you to go back in and and

271
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,380
Finish your degree or get your degree. And I had just graduated in December

272
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,540
With two degrees and I said I I just got two degrees

273
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,020
How many more do I need?

274
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,660
And she's like, well, this is Microsoft. Two's not enough. Yeah, she said bring you graduated

275
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,520
I'm like, yeah

276
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Just a month ago. She's like

277
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,490
You're not even supposed to be here. And I'm like, oh

278
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:50,120
I guess I'll go to my meeting now. So I found out the very first day that I was an intern

279
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,700
And that was that was the first time I had ever been made aware of that

280
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,630
And I went back

281
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,390
Talked to my manager. I'm like

282
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,030
Hey, what the heck?

283
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:10,900
When does this thing in I'm moving my my fiance up here in a month, right?

284
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,600
I thought I'd landed a job not not an internship and

285
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,290
Back in those days. They were very flexible. So

286
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:26,170
You could have an internship I think up to nine months. So they extended it as a six-month internship and

287
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,910
Then once that was done that the team

288
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,220
suffered

289
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,740
They ran out of their head count

290
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,020
so

291
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,020
And the we never ran out of that's a line in those days. We never ran out of head count

292
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,900
Head count grew on trees. So the other thing that ended up happening

293
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,900
Was I learned a new lesson

294
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,180
which was

295
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,980
Back in those days if you spent six months as as a tester and didn't know how to test

296
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,140
That immediately damned you I went through actually at that point in time

297
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,380
I went through 14 full-time interviews and I failed every single one of them

298
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:14,540
Because the team did you fail a little better each time I did. I good good at the team at that time

299
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:21,450
The team that I was on they were actually using interns as even cheaper contractors. And so oh

300
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,330
I then

301
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:27,210
one of my final full-time interviews and I I

302
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:32,730
Wish I knew who this was but I've gotten pretty good at reading people's body language and I I basically

303
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,690
Said okay

304
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:40,440
My last interview. I said it's clear that I'm not passing this interview

305
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,020
I've gone through a series of these no one's giving me any feedback. Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong?

306
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:50,350
And he said he walked through

307
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,680
three things and that those three things

308
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,080
I

309
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,160
Just snapped my head. I'm like, oh my god

310
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:07,030
I totally get this now and after that I went through a series of contractor interviews and I passed every single one of them

311
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,430
Ended up lending an exchange which ended up being one of the

312
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:17,110
Best places for me in my career. I wish I could go back and I wish I knew who that guy was

313
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:19,310
I could go back and shake his hand and thank him

314
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,270
But

315
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:28,710
Yeah, funny story that one, but it really as a manager. It wasn't an after a contractor

316
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,350
I think it was a year and a half before I was a manager

317
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,170
So I started as a contractor in a year and a half later I was a manager and

318
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,730
From then on out. I was very passionate around how to use interns

319
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,330
I'm like look at the end of this internship

320
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,570
Whether you know whether or not you want to come back into a test position

321
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,770
You will know how to do it

322
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,250
Anyway, that's that that's a cool story

323
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:02,930
I promise to touch a little bit on on non-invented here, even though we've talked about that in the past and yep

324
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,930
I do see

325
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,830
Us getting better. Not only is it non-invented here, but

326
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:15,970
We'll take like we're gonna have a Microsoft solution that could work said no the Microsoft solution doesn't work

327
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,290
We'll we'll write our own, you know test harness and

328
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:23,050
Or whatever and for those who aren't clear we didn't clarify it

329
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,010
Alan and I are both on the same page

330
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,460
That not invented here is awesome

331
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,230
If we can bring a solution that was not invented here and it solves a problem

332
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,970
Fantastic correct

333
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,810
For those who who aren't familiar with it or maybe

334
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:47,560
Just started listening to the podcast. All right, not invented here is in essence

335
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:54,840
People rejecting other other people's tools or solutions that because it wasn't invented here

336
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,140
The typical reason is oh if we do that it'll be much more complex and we'll have to maintain it

337
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,640
And that'll be harder or we'll take a dependency on the team and that'll slow us down

338
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,280
Well, let me give you just one quick example of them. We'll move on

339
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,880
My team uses get for source control

340
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,110
one

341
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:18,030
Massively huge advantage is a learning curve. It's new for a lot of people and but

342
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,230
What's great is that so many people use get is that any question I have?

343
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,150
And this is even happen what I've been often the weeds doing crazy things

344
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:35,390
Stack overflow and the internet in general has answers and when you're using your thing you built

345
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,390
Here's another theory of constraints using using something that's used widely is

346
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,180
is

347
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,740
Scalable when only the guy down the hall knows how to use a certain system or tool

348
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,300
He's a bottleneck and you get stuck trying to learn things and how many times have you used an internal tool for something you get stuck

349
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,820
You have to ask a question. You don't get an answer. So then you just okay. No problem

350
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,500
I'll just write my own version of it or I'll fork it this

351
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:10,820
It's just ridiculous. The the bottleneck theme is coming up a lot and it occurred to me that when you go with

352
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,500
agile

353
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,580
like one of the biggest things you really need to have is

354
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:26,690
Kong or visibility to a concrete team-based goal that individuals

355
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,100
Resonate with and they know how to

356
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,170
Influence it and drive towards it

357
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:45,420
For example the Kanban method will use Lytle's law Q theory and say hey I

358
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:54,670
Ideally you would have some sort of customer validation some way to say this is the number of value points that this feature

359
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,100
Realized but failing that you can use throughput as a goal

360
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,880
And you use that as a team-based goal and you say how fast are we getting?

361
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,730
tickets to done

362
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,890
And I've been doing this for for four years now and all the training with with lean

363
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,690
it

364
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,610
really makes you

365
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:20,690
aware of where bottlenecks are and

366
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:27,570
It's sort of a mix of motion because you love to know it's fantastic when you know where your bottleneck is

367
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:32,130
So you can go squash it because it also makes you hate bottlenecks

368
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,530
So this conversation is reminding me

369
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,970
once again of my love for the

370
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,290
Business fables of Patrick one's Yoni and one of them. I've read them all I forget the name

371
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,210
I forget which ones which but

372
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,010
One of the things he talks about one of the rules one of the tools

373
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:54,250
I use a lot in what I'm in my own leadership is I believe a team needs a rally and cry something that

374
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:59,780
That helps them figure out what their focus is and in the business novel what he uses is

375
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
teams in in

376
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,660
Peril like oh my god, if we don't get this figured out. We are gonna be out of business

377
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,260
They get that rally and cry then and they rally around it and either they fail or that usually they succeed

378
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,260
it gets the everybody on one page and the premise of what Lencioni says is

379
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,380
You should have a rally and cry no matter what something the team can center around. Mm-hmm

380
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,700
and here's a famous example of that is I

381
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:32,290
Don't know if it was the CEO or who it was at Flickr who said all right everybody

382
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,250
we are going to release and we're gonna be able to release every single day and

383
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,020
As he told me oh, you're crazy. We can't do it. We have for this and this and this here's all the reasons

384
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
It won't work, but that was the rallying cry

385
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,140
Our goal is we're gonna release once a day and his goal was we can just get like once a week

386
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,580
I'll be happy and they got to once a week. He said he was happy

387
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,060
I said no the rallying cry is once a day

388
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:02,070
We're still working and they got there that they do like twice a day and it's pretty much continuous

389
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,870
The speed doesn't matter don't jump on that part

390
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:11,610
But the idea is the team together the organization had a rallying cry they could work around and I believe that's true for a company

391
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,250
It's true for an organization. It can be true for a team. Here's what we do

392
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,270
Here is the number one thing

393
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:23,750
We you know make your decisions based on this rallying cry is the work does the work I'm doing does the work

394
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,630
I'm doing

395
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:29,830
contribute towards this goal which is so much part of the what I think about when I come to work that I can't not

396
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,410
Think about it. And if it isn't

397
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,160
You know

398
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,700
Do I need to do it?

399
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,710
Do I need to how much effort I need to put into it?

400
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,390
But I'm a huge believer in a team having that that

401
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,020
rallying cry that

402
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,940
Goal that everyone knows what it is and what it looks like and what how their work every day contributes towards getting there

403
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:55,820
I think it really helps the team. I've been on teams that have had I mean, I was just thinking through that

404
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,180
been on teams that have this rallying cry, but

405
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:09,560
There's more to it and I'm trying to think through what what that might be the the you could have this rallying cry

406
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,430
but it has to

407
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,750
It has to resonate with the troops

408
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,950
It has to be something that so that the carrot on the on the stick and the string that's just out of reach

409
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,470
Versus the one that's a mile away that you feel well that that's that's the leadership. Yeah challenge of this

410
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:30,190
You said a goal that here's what we're gonna do has to be attainable

411
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,930
Even if you know you be perceived as attainable

412
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:37,830
Yeah, and even if you know, it's gonna be hard and so people that don't believe it's going to be attainable

413
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,790
You have to believe as a leadership team

414
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,060
That that goal is attainable and then you need to live that too

415
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:51,460
I think one of the best ways to lead a team and to communicate these rallying cries to a team is

416
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,340
Celebrate examples of it. We cut off

417
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,780
Two hours off our build time. This is awesome. Let's celebrate this. We're on our way. Let's keep on working

418
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:05,460
There's there's I don't know if if if Reese is the one who started it

419
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,780
but there's a lot of wisdom in in

420
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:15,860
His book when he talks about the one metric that matters because the yeah, I think it's highly related

421
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:22,260
Yeah, I think I think one of the issues is that becomes a rallying cry it does exactly the same thing

422
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,900
It I'm thinking in terms of the the opposite of experience when you see teams

423
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:31,340
That have their four page long exit criteria filled with

424
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,820
numbers and

425
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,820
Right and it becomes diluted the one thing the driving towards the

426
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:45,060
Convergence points you need it a few number of things that are actionable and matter

427
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,320
Yeah, so

428
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,920
Let's move on Brent Brent gave me the hand signal that says let's move on and

429
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,000
And and I think we just created

430
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,960
surprisingly the perfect segue mate perhaps and our

431
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,790
Board says that Brett wants to talk about the difference between bean counting today and yesterday

432
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:17,110
So bean counting describing me by bean counting real quick and then just go on so I've spent a good portion of my career as

433
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,750
a test manager

434
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,550
right on for on pen products

435
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:28,470
I'm sure you've you've attended more than your fair share of ship rooms towards the the

436
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:35,190
The last period of shipping week the love of my life. Yes. Yes where everybody and their mother

437
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,650
presents again these massive spreadsheets of

438
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,770
Test pass rates and bug counts my eyes hurt just thinking about it. Yes, Em

439
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,380
What what this idea came to me is there was a

440
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:58,620
Individual that I was interacting with over the weekend on a blog post and he was talking about

441
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:05,380
Metrics and statistics and how how that will

442
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:12,800
I'm I'm exaggerating but how that doesn't eliminate the need for

443
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,260
testers in

444
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:24,440
It real I realized that there's a huge difference like I recognized the world he was describing

445
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,730
It was the world that I would had been in. Mm-hmm. Gosh even six years ago

446
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:37,540
But I wanted to see what you thought in terms of the use of

447
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:44,410
Metrics today versus yesterday. Would you describe it as as

448
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,890
different

449
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,890
Getting there. Okay getting there. What's the difference?

450
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,850
I think the difference is and you're gonna correct me when I'm done

451
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:01,220
But in the past I saw a lot of metrics about measuring the process of making software

452
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,740
bug counts

453
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:10,690
Remaining work items left a lot about how the process of making the product was going

454
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:18,810
These days as we moved more to what we're calling data-driven quality a lot of the metrics we look at come from

455
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,740
How customers use the product

456
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:28,990
Mm-hmm. So get idea of download rates and download success and installs and they come back to Xbox

457
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,230
We could see what errors people were hitting using which applications

458
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,350
So that gives us a better insight and sort of not an entire insight

459
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:43,150
But a better insight into what was happening with customers in the field help us identify real hot spots

460
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:45,390
and

461
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,370
we all know that as

462
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:56,160
An engineering teams we have found bugs that no customers really would never find we fix them because it's a bug

463
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,980
Or we don't and then as much as we do customers will find bugs that we never found. Oh, whoops. Sorry miss that

464
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:15,240
So I think using the data from actual customers helps us a lot in getting in that direction part of his article was talking about

465
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,640
again, that's stats can't

466
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,680
replace testers

467
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,120
They can't

468
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,760
Why not? I think there are some things

469
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,160
Well, a lot of it depends on context. I think you know when I look at

470
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:40,180
What testers do I don't stats can replace well, I could go off in the weeds here

471
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
but I think some of the things that

472
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:47,220
Testers or test specialists on a as I prefer to think about it

473
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,780
Some things about looking at performance and reliability and some of those

474
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,780
more complex

475
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,660
Non-functional attributes of the software

476
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:03,020
Even before it's the customers hands are a valuable thing for a tester to do and also looking at things end-to-end

477
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:10,220
To anticipate some of the problems customers write it might run into I think while it's okay for you to use and I've preached this

478
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:16,060
In the past that hey, let's just let customers find these issues and as long as we can fix them quickly

479
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,900
But I do think there's value in

480
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,460
Having your software good enough in the first place where people will come back

481
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:29,380
And that's gonna require some testing or test special specialization up front

482
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:38,540
Yeah, the the I agree with that the the biggest difference though that I that I walked away with is

483
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:45,660
Statistics to me now means something different than it did ten years ago

484
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:54,090
Ten years ago when I was publishing this this stupid spreadsheet and I've I've I've spent hours

485
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,930
producing these stupid things

486
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:07,060
Versus my view on it now is is fundamentally different like you and I have both been proponents of shifting

487
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,540
Reducing the head count on

488
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:17,660
Tester specialists. Yeah, right towards more of a data-centric

489
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,380
culture and

490
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:29,020
To me the reason why I'm a big proponent of it is because I now have a more of a data science II view on

491
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,740
on what statistics

492
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,540
Mean and how they should be used and how to use them correctly

493
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,300
Whereas before I would go

494
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,360
We're at 97 percent pass rate and we need to be at a hundred

495
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,080
We can't ship till we're at a hundred and all the bugs are fixed or you turn those tests off

496
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,120
Right

497
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
It's don't do that

498
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,350
That my point is is I think

499
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,550
If we're gonna drive towards data driven

500
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,670
quality, right

501
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,790
view

502
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:10,990
statistics as as a means it's still not the ends and that there's all

503
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:18,340
Alternate we've talked about this a bajillion times before right exposure control if you just did statistics

504
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,900
If the only thing you changed was you got rid of testers and you added statistics

505
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:30,170
I will not work on that team because they're

506
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,360
They're not necessarily using the stats

507
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,120
The the way they need to be in terms of driving towards the goal of creating quality

508
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:43,760
and if you realize that your goal is is is quality and then you have

509
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,210
one or two metrics that

510
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:53,130
Mad matter that it's gonna force you into alternatives for dealing with risk

511
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,530
That we used to solve with an army of testers. Mm-hmm

512
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:02,570
and just that whole talk just reminded me that so many and

513
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:05,330
so many attempts at

514
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:08,250
Organizational change or change or you know restructuring of a team

515
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:14,210
Fail to look at the whole system of things that need to change how many teams, you know, that said, okay

516
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:15,850
We're gonna do agile. So we're doing scrum

517
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:22,700
Like what this there's more there's more to think about

518
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:31,100
But not scrum scrum, yeah, we read the first chapter and yeah

519
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,860
We we recognize it either won't fit or we're really smart and we're gonna tweak it. Yeah

520
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:41,780
All right. So I think before we're out of time we should go on to

521
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,380
the

522
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:52,770
Okay, Brent, what do you got today in the mail that was pretty good

523
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,610
Reach your reach your hand deep in the mail that it's not in the diaphragm

524
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:02,570
Well, I had to stick my head into the bathroom. Let the echo happen, but it was I'm back now. All right, so I

525
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,630
Got a I got a comment on one of my blog posts over the over the

526
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,730
last week

527
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,290
Alan you have more exposure to this. So I'm gonna shoot this question out to you

528
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:22,640
So this was in my blog posts around shifting the tester mindset if you recall that one

529
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,440
We're how very aligned with what we're talking about

530
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,600
Remember what I have to dinner last night, but yeah

531
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,540
It was very around how we can take these testers and turn them into more quality oriented

532
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:39,800
Yes, add reactivity to their regimen. I do recall in the the individual

533
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,540
called out that

534
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,140
Large companies like Google and Facebook and Microsoft

535
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,460
Right. They have all these resources and they could potentially get away with

536
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,900
Removing testers but smaller companies still need them and any he mentioned this term of

537
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
PM focused testers

538
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:10,980
Which resonates to me sort of a combining the PM role and a tester role in the single individual sounds like a generalizing specialist to me

539
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,820
Go on and then I'm gonna add a third

540
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:21,170
Characteristic because he talked about small companies. I'm gonna add just a peer startup and go

541
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:27,890
What do you think about that? Do you think that there are in terms of the needs?

542
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:35,250
for for having testers does it differ based off the type of company you are I

543
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,520
don't think so when I think of

544
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:47,520
You know our small arm our Microsoft small team is a huge huge company to anybody else at about 200 people

545
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,670
We definitely need test specialists. I think

546
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:55,610
At that size we do rely a lot on data

547
00:42:55,870 --> 00:43:00,270
But we do need people thinking about those non-functional things and end-to-end how things work

548
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,870
We need that test specialization on the other end if I think of a five-person startup

549
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:10,430
Let's go with five. That's pretty that's a pretty good small size. Would you have one of those people?

550
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:17,390
Dedicated to testing. No, I don't think you could afford that. Do you need someone that kind of it doesn't have to be a

551
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:23,510
When I think of a tester, I think that tester mindset that systems think of the big-picture thinker knows how the pieces fit together

552
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:25,590
Often it's the architect

553
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:31,920
You know one of the best test minded people actually several of the best test minded people I've known in my life are dev architects

554
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,600
They know how all the pieces fit together. They go. Well, that's gonna cause a problem there and and these things aren't gonna go together

555
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:43,400
Again going back to generalizing specials. I think out of that team of five people you definitely need

556
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,280
It can't just be all people that know how to write code and write unit tests for it

557
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,560
I think you need somebody kind of thinks big-picture and can figure out how those pieces fit together

558
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,920
So the that's the long version of my answer is yeah, I think it's the same

559
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,400
From a startup to a large company you need people that kind of you don't need

560
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,040
You don't need one tester for every developer certainly which Microsoft had in the past, but you need people with that

561
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,640
traditional test mindset as

562
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:21,020
Part of their toolbox on any size team the thing that that so this individual explicitly called out

563
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,840
Sort of the evaluation of the user experience

564
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,720
Which I don't know if this is what they meant but it resonated with me sort of the old-school STEs. Mm-hmm

565
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,880
for the thing that I found interesting

566
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,140
Is he kind of called out that his view was smaller companies because their research resource poor?

567
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,380
have a stronger reliance on these type of

568
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:48,310
testers and

569
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:51,590
It that resonated with me is just wrong

570
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:58,030
Right because in the larger company that the problem you have there is that you have this pain in the ass bureaucracy

571
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:02,950
You're dealing with you have this huge command and control

572
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:09,230
It's a lot easier to remove my both beliefs is a lot easier to remove command and control from smaller teams

573
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:15,830
Can't have it there. Just think for a minute. So I'm in charge. I'm this I got this five person startup

574
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:17,830
We're making something, you know, super cool

575
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:20,400
if it's

576
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,920
Actually fun five first start up today. I'm not making I'm making a some sort of app or web service

577
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,630
I may have every architects. I'm gonna take big picture. We're going to

578
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:36,590
Invite fun evaluate that user experience and that five person company probably gonna do a friends and family

579
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,710
We're gonna take their feedback seriously. You guys try this out. What is this working?

580
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:44,710
Then you do these scenarios, etc. I might sort of crowdsource this amongst the same way

581
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:51,030
We do at Microsoft these or a lot of companies these concentric circles of deployment, you know, 1% 5% 20%

582
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,510
I might do friends and family. Okay invited beta you guys try it

583
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,910
We need feedback or to incorporate it so by the time it gets to any substantial amount of people or press

584
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:05,110
That the user experience has been evaluated by users. Mm-hmm

585
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:13,200
I think there is no better person and and I'm sorry testers who you're you you're your personal rallying cry is to

586
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,360
To be the customer is you're not the customer and the best person to evaluate

587
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,660
Really what that customer experience truly is is the customer. Mm-hmm

588
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,880
So the better the better you can get at finding a way to get the customers to do those things in a way

589
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,340
That's not damning for your product or effective. You just roll this thing out to a million people and go it's done

590
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,640
Better you're gonna be I think that's gonna be part of your business plan in a small startup

591
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,440
Have you read Steve Rose blog on this topic? I have read Steve Rose blogs in this topic

592
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:49,440
You where he was talking about one of the problems when that he noticed is when we have these these

593
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,170
teams of specialists called testers is

594
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,370
They believe they're advocating for the customer, but what they're striving towards is

595
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,470
Approving that the product matches the spec that PM wrote

596
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:13,250
They're driving towards the requirements, right? Not necessarily what the customer actually wants. That doesn't actually work

597
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:17,260
Yeah, all right. Um, we are out of time

598
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:22,980
Thank you, everybody. Yeah. Thanks. I keep your questions coming and we'll be back in a couple weeks with

599
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:28,700
Another installment. Yes, all right 16 or one of those numbers. All right, he's Brent. I'm

600
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,660
Well, thanks for listening see you next time
