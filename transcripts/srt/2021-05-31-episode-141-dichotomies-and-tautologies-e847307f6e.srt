00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:11,620
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,580
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,180
Hello everyone and welcome to another morning edition of the AB testing podcast

4
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:29,620
Yeah, how about that for or like getting back to the old days?

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,820
Yeah, I had a conflict this afternoon with which has been our new time for the last several months or so, but as

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,500
Some of you longtime listeners may recall by the way

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,540
I'm Alan he's Brent and he's the one whose microphone still is picking up his no sounds and

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,220
We'll figure out what to do there, but we are recording in the morning now

9
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:54,420
You listen to this whenever you want to it could be the midnight show, but we're recording in the morning

10
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,300
So what that means is I haven't finished my second cup of coffee yet

11
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,020
Brent probably has he looks like he's been up. He has his

12
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
McDonald's coffee the big one

13
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,100
the cafe

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,350
How you doing, man? How I think our listeners want to know most of all

15
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,940
How did that second shot and the aftermath go?

16
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,060
I'm pleased to report. I think I was one of the lucky few

17
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,630
That literally got nothing

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,820
That's fantastic. I'm hoping I'm one of those two

19
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,890
Yeah, I have I have blocked off my schedule for the following day just in case

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,010
Yeah, I

21
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,010
both times for the shot I

22
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:49,090
Went in for it in the afternoon and took the rest of the day off went straight home and I'd scheduled it on Friday

23
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,390
just in case

24
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,770
The only thing I could say every so I

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,290
Physiologically react negatively to strong

26
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:07,690
Pressure changes in the environment. So this last weekend it went from like super sunny to really crappy

27
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,870
so on

28
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,870
Monday, I was

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
feeling like complete

30
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,530
crap

31
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:24,130
But that's close to three days after the shot and there was a huge pressure change. So I'm

32
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:32,090
I'm far more likely to attribute it to to that aspect of my bad genetics than to the shot

33
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,290
Cool enough. Cool enough. Well, I'm glad to hear that. I don't know if I have much else

34
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:44,660
To share tonight. I mentioned last time that I'm I did I will be giving an AMA

35
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,320
Oh, this will go good into our some of our topics today, but I'm giving an AMA ask me anything

36
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,740
For those who don't like it when I speak in acronyms

37
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,660
The future of test automation, it should be a lot of fun

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,360
Yeah

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,120
Because I of course I have I have a different view of the future than a lot of folks do

40
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,170
it's

41
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,960
It's interesting because to my perception you've actually done that talk

42
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:21,960
I don't know feels like three or four times in the I've done a future of testing and you know pretty

43
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,560
Predicting things is hard, especially about the future

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,640
I think this is just a chance they know

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,460
That given this topic in my opinions people and given

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,280
the

47
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,880
How many people I've pissed off on the internet?

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,360
About my opinions that this will bring I think this is to bring in lots of questions and viewers

49
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,970
So we'll see it might might be might be just the three our three listeners there in the AMA

50
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,770
Saying yeah, you're right. Now you go. This is boring, but we'll find out anyway

51
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,210
That's the only upcoming a thing. I have coming up. There's another conference

52
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,640
this summer

53
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,520
Someone just asked me over LinkedIn and and in this day of these days of pandemic and everyone's at home

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,930
I'm saying yes to a lot more of these than I

55
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,650
Probably would if we were in a different global situation, but I'm doing another one this summer

56
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,650
I'll talk more about that when we get closer

57
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,330
Nice. Okay. All right, man. You want to get into our

58
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:30,250
Our A B testing podcast topics. Sure. Yes. And by the way, this is episode 141

59
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:38,380
Counting down to 150. Should we do something special for 150 when we get there? Sure. Okay. Yeah, that's

60
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:46,260
Up to our three listeners if you would like to want maybe to segue into our first topic

61
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,980
We have a slacker group one of the three dot slack calm

62
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,460
You go to modern testing org and find a sign up link

63
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,180
where you can join our slack and drop in and ask us questions or

64
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,780
Ask questions to the the other two listeners who are there this week

65
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,700
We had someone drop into the slack and ask us some questions about some of our stances which we can get into or not

66
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,580
I'll leave that up to bread. The thing I want to call out is

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,300
We welcome everybody if you're listening to this podcast and you think we are crazy

68
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,700
Create maybe crazy. It's not the right word. If you think we are our ideas are

69
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
invalid or if you think

70
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:30,380
That we're just dumb old guys who don't know anything. You're partially right all questions are welcome

71
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,620
You don't have to just come in and be a be a fan. You can come in and challenge us. We like it

72
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,740
we

73
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,180
Stand by the fact that we're we believe that we aren't inventing anything new that was never our intent

74
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,550
But that we are just trying to identify

75
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,710
And explain what's already happening happening happening happening in many parts of the industry

76
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,770
So those are the discussions we have and if you don't get it

77
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,630
Or if you don't get how it works

78
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,750
Or if you don't get how it works for you or again, if you think that you need to explain to us

79
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,470
Where we're right and where we're wrong all that's cool and welcome. The community is there

80
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,850
For the open

81
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,810
Objective

82
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,090
Conversation on these on this front like in in my view and I'm fairly certain

83
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,690
Alan shares this view

84
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,690
There's a lot of places in what we talk about where

85
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,050
Honestly, we kind of know we're right

86
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:41,370
Science backs it up a good portion of it experience backs up the rest

87
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,570
But it is context sensitive

88
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,410
The we want that conversation

89
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,050
To be happening within the test community. That is the absolute

90
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,300
Even if we're wrong in your context

91
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,460
We think the single most important thing is

92
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,060
to

93
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,060
Get the conversation going it one of the things that a term that I don't

94
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:19,020
It was a term that I'm fighting against this sort of intellectual laziness within the test community this prevailing belief that

95
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,060
It ain't broke. But Brent we're the only ones with critical thinking

96
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Yeah

97
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:34,690
Walk that talk buddy. Yeah, I don't think we can make that statement because and I forget

98
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,970
Because we're we're we're lacking serious study and something I forget. Yeah

99
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,610
social sciences

100
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,410
Yeah, oh

101
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,970
Can we um, maybe one topic not on the list of yours?

102
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,890
Can we do one thing I wanted to talk to you about that isn't on our list? I'm gonna do it

103
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,570
Actually, I'll do it now cuz I already brought it up along those lines something

104
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:01,230
This wasn't in that now moving on from the one of the three you can discuss this more with me explain it to me

105
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,950
You're welcome to come to our slack community talk to me there or just message me on Twitter

106
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,500
So you've heard us rant about checking versus testing how we don't really care. There's another

107
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:19,220
Pair a false dichotomy coming around that I'm seeing more and more in tweets and articles

108
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,340
This is an idea of shallow versus deep testing

109
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,020
Okay

110
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,420
It's from the look on your face and the sound of your voice you haven't seen this argument before no

111
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,740
It goes back to my developer mindset thing

112
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:37,100
Which a lot of people versus a tester mindset versus BS which a lot of people disagree with my stance on that and that's fun

113
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,000
I I call it like I see it and if I see it differently from you, that's a discussion we can have

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm not trying to prescribe anything just trying to describe what I see so the shallow versus deep

115
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,920
The idea is yeah sure developers contest think Oh compromise

116
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,460
But they can only do shallow testing because they don't care about deep testing and you need to do deep testing to have high quality

117
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,980
That's the statement

118
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
What's the evidence of that?

119
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,240
Study of the social sciences and

120
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,720
Sure because the study of the social sciences is going to address the question or rather around whether

121
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,920
Software products are better with or without deep testing. I would like to understand that

122
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,440
Well deep touch Brent we could do devil's advocate on this and I yeah, maybe there's a whole

123
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,520
Modern versus we still have to do a rehash of a modern versus traditional on some of these topics

124
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,520
but the argument is that

125
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,160
deep testing

126
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,440
Defends the customer against risk or those are words

127
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,840
I made up not not the actual words

128
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,420
But deep testing is where we find the issues that that impact the customer all these edge cases and things like that

129
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,920
Part of me when I when I hear this around shallow versus deep

130
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,880
Right part of me feels like it's code words for the checking versus testing conversation. Well, it's not I mean

131
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,520
It's a different it's a different conversation

132
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,280
But my arg I don't want to go deeply into this but it's often described as shallow versus deep and I think

133
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,560
There is no dichotomy there

134
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:12,330
You do deep enough testing for the context of the software that you're shipping if I'm shipping 50 times a day

135
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,330
I'm my deep testing is

136
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,150
my analytics and monitoring

137
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:23,540
The dichotomy of shallow versus deep I think it's

138
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,720
Constructing and a needless argument

139
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,680
Its purpose to me it feels is to sort of create a

140
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,170
Foundation for an argument

141
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,650
or a debate

142
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,650
That's that is

143
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:48,330
So purpose is to say only test can do it right? So if if you agree to that point

144
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,250
Then to me, it's a debate argument. It's not really much to do with with

145
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,930
technicality because

146
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,930
the reality is

147
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,290
You should test

148
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,770
Exactly the amount of things that you should test

149
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:14,290
And it doesn't actually it in my in my experience. It doesn't actually split around deep versus shallow

150
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,830
right it more

151
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,830
splits around

152
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,230
customers

153
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:28,030
Customers need customers value that doesn't mean you should be intellectually lazy when you go through it. Obviously

154
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,030
Deep versus shallow is something

155
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,890
that you should

156
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,920
Think about but when I think about deep I

157
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,580
tend to think of it more along the lines of

158
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,480
Systems thinking type of things that we've been talking about before

159
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:51,910
You gotta know how the dots are connected together and and how it may

160
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:56,580
Have those integration points. Yeah, maybe again

161
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,320
Have to let the context dictate the depth of your testing

162
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,880
I think there's an argument that all and

163
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,950
Well, it's not stated correctly. So someone will correct me and say that's not what they're saying

164
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,190
I will say that there's an assumption that I've read about it and maybe you're right

165
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,870
I think it's there as a point of controversy and to justify

166
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,750
kicking your heels in and saying the way we've always done it is the way we are and

167
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,430
one way I've described it recently is

168
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,990
If you want to compare

169
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:38,710
Proponents of people in checking versus testing and shallow versus deep versus what Brent and I I think our intent is the same

170
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,110
We want to help testers cope with the changes going on around them

171
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,830
Our approach is to help people navigate the change and be successful in flowing forward with the change

172
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,790
Whereas I feel like a lot of these

173
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:04,000
Discussions around deep versus shallow and checking versus testing and tester mindset, etc. Are a lot about

174
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
helping testers

175
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:13,220
Continue to justify the need not to change while the world changes around them. Yeah the

176
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,540
Completely agree the one thing I was thinking of piggybacking and I don't know if this is something that you find interesting to

177
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,760
think about

178
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,880
how

179
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,320
might

180
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,810
the modern testing principles

181
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,850
In your view Alan be used for evil

182
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,980
Let's imagine. Let's imagine some some

183
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,980
executive

184
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,420
Happens upon it and says oh my god

185
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,470
These guys are completely

186
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,310
Justifying me doing this and the this is bad

187
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,390
Like what's your thought? I I love that question, especially since

188
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,620
You know some of the crowd likes to blame the challenges in testing on

189
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,540
Management and executive management. So let's go ahead and assume that all managers don't know what they're doing

190
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:11,980
I think very easily you look at number seven and go. Okay, let's get rid of our test team

191
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:18,980
We look at number six and we use that to collect a whole crap ton of data

192
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,260
We don't know what to do with this not strategically planned

193
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,230
That's what says we use data extensively

194
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,990
So you have a so you now you have no testers and a crap ton of data

195
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,270
With no one who knows how to look at it

196
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,910
And even if they did they would go this is crap data in believing the customer is the only one capable judge quality

197
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:40,650
I'm working backward that is you don't do any testing. You don't ask your developers to do testing

198
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,110
You just ship stuff trade out to customers

199
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,070
No matter what regardless of the context and you hope that this massive dump of data that no one knows how to look at

200
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,070
Will help you solve your quality problems

201
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,890
So how's that for a start? Yes so far though the path you're going

202
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,910
If a company I don't think a company would do that strategy for too long because I think that that company would fail

203
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,150
Oh, of course they would they would massively fail. So you know, so you're asking like

204
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:11,060
How could an executive use what we're proposing?

205
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:19,740
To do evil but still succeed. Oh, I don't I don't know. I don't I I don't see a way to do evil without success here

206
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,300
You could you can be dumb and implement them and egg and this is the my last statements

207
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:33,180
We're all about the continuous barrage of straw man's that come up in the world and especially software development

208
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,540
Agile doesn't work because I tried it. I did a really poor job and it didn't work

209
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:44,020
X does it work for anyone because we tried it and used everything did everything wrong about didn't work

210
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:49,400
You could you could straw man through you can find straw man arguments against all these but there's no

211
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,120
As far as I can tell unless you are thinking it's something I can't I don't know how you use these force

212
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,280
For evil and success at the same time you can be dumb and dumb can be evil, but you can't I

213
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:07,640
Don't see a way to use these and be evil. Am I missing something? No, I was I

214
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,240
I struggle with that as well. Right? It's it's the like the the one argument I've seen

215
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,680
waged against us on this one is

216
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,920
essentially

217
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,560
an executive could use it to justify the removal of their test departments

218
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,340
it sort of the

219
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:38,660
Sort of we're feeding the automation argument, right? We're encouraging the industry to kill this

220
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,560
Discipline, but that falls into the dumb and not evil though, right?

221
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,320
Well, it depends it depends right it depends on where you stand

222
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,280
right if you're if if if you view testing

223
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
or being a tester as

224
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,080
As essentially you're a member of an important craft

225
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,320
Towards the software development lifecycle like you and I both were in in in

226
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,440
strong in testing back in the day, we both

227
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,770
had many arguments around

228
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:24,370
Defensive I would argue defensive arguments around the importance of our role, right? We were always kind of defending

229
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:27,330
the the value of

230
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:33,090
of tests through a variety of means like actually back in the day

231
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,970
You when you were running the big

232
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:42,850
The big tlt meeting, uh, it was a test leadership team test leaders and execs from around the company

233
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,490
right definition overdub

234
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:48,210
Alan Alan played a a

235
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,390
central role

236
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,410
in sort of

237
00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:01,090
Evaluating salary equivalency between tests and in development as an example. Yeah, we had

238
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,050
a lot of

239
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,010
Yeah, a lot of emphasis was put on

240
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,570
protecting and value and valuing test as a discipline across the company and this is

241
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:19,010
You know, there was a time microsoft had just short or just just right around 10,000

242
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,230
dedicated testing specialists

243
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,670
right

244
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,830
and even as we we made

245
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,790
We we gained wins

246
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:36,790
Around sort of salary equivalency like the the defensiveness of the arguments that we would make defending how important we were

247
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:41,270
In my view, maybe your experience was different never really stopped

248
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,950
Right, and that was because part of part of it

249
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:49,270
It's still i've made a statement before like the number one

250
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:52,230
value proposition of a test team

251
00:18:53,110 --> 00:19:00,950
from those not within the test team and again defined by actions not by verbiage is uh

252
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,630
Where the organization scapegoat when when shit goes out the door

253
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,680
So I think part of what modern testing is trying to do is say hey

254
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,920
Look, there's a these are a set of people with with very strong critical thinking skills

255
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,440
And they can bring way more value

256
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,280
Than just simply the team to blame when when the sky falls

257
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,960
and a lot of the activities that that

258
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,160
We see that that we're honestly very important in

259
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,680
In the world where with on-prem products or shrink wrap products

260
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,240
And that world is not yet dead

261
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,600
There are lots of products going out the door that aren't aren't updated or shipped

262
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,360
via

263
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,560
via the cloud or or you know app updates

264
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,200
But in the service world, there are are better techniques and and again

265
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
pivoting off of accelerate

266
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:18,440
Which is one of my favorite content sources, but you combine ryan

267
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,520
Of everyone i've spoken to and i'm not aware of any formal study on this but literally a hundred percent of those folks

268
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,560
who who claim

269
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,840
agile doesn't work

270
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,800
It doesn't take much to realize that

271
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,800
that team

272
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,120
Never got to a point where agile was adaptive

273
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,160
Adaptive right right. It was still iterative. So they never

274
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,230
They never actually got to yeah, of course, of course, and I think

275
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:56,230
Rewind the stack here a little bit a lot of the arguments against what we're doing

276
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,720
are

277
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
Based on I just don't get what you're talking about. We don't do it that way or

278
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,640
But the arguments are based on just

279
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,460
That hasn't worked for me. I haven't tried that even I do want to

280
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,900
Rewind that stack so shallow versus deep and the whole

281
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:21,640
Set of tangents they're worth talking about but that makes me in real time because we are an adaptive

282
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
Not predictive podcast

283
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,740
I'm gonna change the order because I think that makes me want to go into

284
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,540
You're talking about traditional testing

285
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Let's talk about this link

286
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,740
You sent me and why you sent it to me and the point you want to make there because I think it's I think it's

287
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,780
Relevant most relevant to this conversation we're having right now. And while brent if i'll if i'm a good

288
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:51,140
Podcast editor i'll put the link in the show notes, but you know how good I am at that

289
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,100
but brent sent me this thing of

290
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
Well, actually why don't you describe what the web page is?

291
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,580
And the point you want to talk about yeah

292
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,860
so

293
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,620
There is a company called own net online

294
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,580
And I sent this to alan late last night. So I will

295
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,540
Admit that there is

296
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,740
A good deal of research on on this

297
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,460
That I have not

298
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,900
done

299
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,020
um

300
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,980
so

301
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,420
listeners should definitely not walk away with

302
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:36,800
Uh, at least brent's opinion is that this is hardcore facts. Okay. I don't know who this company is. I don't know

303
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,360
who funds them

304
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,380
however

305
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
They do seem to be

306
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,780
Tracking summaries around various occupations and there is a thing

307
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,480
Uh

308
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,040
Down below and for those who wish to

309
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,920
Follow along ideally not drive me add some missing context

310
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,360
So brent described what onet online is and what we're looking at the page. He specifically sent me

311
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,440
Was a summary report for software quality assurance analysts and testers. That's a mouthful for testers

312
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,520
Right, so we're talking about it

313
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,120
So it has like the typical tasks they do the skills they require what knowledge they need etc, etc

314
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,800
So the thing now brent is scrolling to the bottom or talks a little bit about where uh

315
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
Where jobs are going, right?

316
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,360
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so it's very interesting in terms of

317
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:43,040
Like the activities and the sort of things that they talk about right. I look at skills and tasks

318
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,480
Right the tasks very much align with sort of

319
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:53,920
You know the old what we call traditional testing, but you look at skills. You can definitely see

320
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
uh, there is a lot of

321
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,600
Technology that is viewed as important to this like I if you look at the technology skills, they have a thing

322
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,240
They have a little fire symbol that flags hot technology

323
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
the technological

324
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,440
requirement

325
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,440
technological requirement

326
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,600
And you look at it and you go, okay

327
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:27,520
There are a lot of things here that are a little bit more technical than say what we what we see in the traditional test roll

328
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,410
right, um

329
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,210
Although it does humor me because cobalt is listed in in uh

330
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,850
software

331
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,130
Don't quite understand that connection but at the very bottom

332
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,240
it talks about

333
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,640
They they're doing some sort of predictive analysis

334
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,340
And they have projected growth from 2019

335
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,440
to 2029

336
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,470
and it says

337
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:59,270
much faster than average eight percent or higher

338
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,260
so they are

339
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,100
absolutely

340
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,980
Uh, this site is absolutely predicting. Uh

341
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,960
a growth

342
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,240
in this

343
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,200
space

344
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,160
Now, uh, one of the things I wanted to talk to to alan about is okay

345
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,280
What's that mean alan? What do you think like are we are we?

346
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,520
Are are we on the side of of wrong here is all of the the uh,

347
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,670
Mtp

348
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,280
opponents

349
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
correct in their thinking that

350
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
that essentially our bubble is

351
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:46,040
It is basically just in uh unity and microsoft in seattle

352
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,670
Well, you know, it's at many more companies than that. So that's that that's that's that's a

353
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,190
Real straw man. So I think you could look at that and go that eight percent is based on one point

354
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:04,310
Projected 1.5 million current people in software testing and a growth of whatever eight percent of that is

355
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:10,070
So yeah, you could say oh there's lots of growth here testing testing is not dead

356
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,380
So you could say that and of course that data is in a nutshell. Uh

357
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,140
I went to look at the reason i'm pausing here

358
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:26,660
Is I went to look at software developers to compare is testing growing?

359
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:34,710
As fast more or less quickly than software development and now i'm questioning the data on this site

360
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:42,470
Because their numbers for software developers are exactly the same as they are for software quality assurance and testers

361
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,390
So there's some weird rounding and bucketing. I I now have questions about the data entirely

362
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
Well, okay, so yeah, maybe

363
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,580
But but overall let's assume these numbers are correct. Uh, it's fine. I think

364
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,320
If we look at that cost of innovation curve that we've the

365
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,480
Bell curve of where people are on moving towards things that sound like what we're talking about with modern testing

366
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,680
We there's a growing number of people

367
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,100
Adopting things that are like modern testing whether they know the name of it or not teams are

368
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:25,620
It's really just agile and lean and we're thinking more about again modern testing isn't that modern. It's not about testing

369
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,920
It's the reaction to our reaction to what we call traditional testing where testing is done often by a siloed test team

370
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
or even by a

371
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,000
air quote agile team where a tester is

372
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,280
Where a dedicated tester does all of the testing for that team?

373
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,800
We're talking about how teams move to being able to ship

374
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,440
multiple times a day and

375
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,240
Base their changes on customer feedback

376
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,920
And use data in order to make sure that the customer is always first in how

377
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,990
Crap is getting done

378
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,190
so

379
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:06,470
The fact that a chunk of the industry is still going to live in the world

380
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,430
They've lived in for the last 20 years i'm not surprised at all

381
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,670
Uh, but of course predicting things is hard, especially about the future

382
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,150
I definitely see more and more teams, especially as more and more software moves to the cloud

383
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,600
Doing things more like modern testing and needing

384
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:30,520
Not zero necessarily but fewer testers going forward again. It's a data. It's a

385
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:37,480
One piece of data amidst a system of changes. So it's hard to tell what it really means but actually

386
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,120
Yeah, I dove in deeper because I noticed when you went to dev which was a very interesting idea

387
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,840
Like when you went to dev at the very bottom of it it it warns that data collection is underway

388
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:59,560
But then I started thinking through and going for example, I just looked at program manager and they don't have that listed

389
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,320
Now i'm actually thinking they they might actually be combining

390
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Devops roles

391
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Because there's no position for that as well. Well devops is a culture not a role

392
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,790
it's

393
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,430
From the context of this database. It's both alan

394
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:23,510
Yeah, and i'll give you another interesting thing because they they need to find the right equivalence classes or find a way for us to group those

395
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,150
Because if I look under computer programmer

396
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,220
The trend there is well one

397
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,620
It's wrong because the the median wages are completely wrong

398
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,540
But they say the trend there because I think because nobody's using that title anymore

399
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,180
Here's the challenge. I think that title's going away because that one's declining by 1 percent and they say there's only

400
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,570
214,000 of those employed

401
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,190
That might actually I mean that last fact might actually be true

402
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:58,870
Like I I haven't met anyone that went by that title. Yeah, so what I think here is there's there's something here

403
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:05,830
But that you need to actually apply some data analysis to all the data here to tell a story

404
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,370
That's my take

405
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:13,890
So sure someone could take this and I have a book usually on my desk. It's on the floor. So I could go grab a called

406
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,690
How to lie with statistics and i'm sure I could find some quotes to use from that with this data

407
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,640
But i'm not

408
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,440
so

409
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,440
Let's uh drop this and move on to a mailbag question. I found the mailbag

410
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,280
Wave file by the way, so we're saved. I don't have to make a

411
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,440
I've been purposely making bad ones to force myself to

412
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,280
Find the original slightly better one slightly less bad. So we'll use that this time

413
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,430
But

414
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:52,630
The question essentially is if you want to ask a mailbag question, by the way, you can ping me on twitter you can

415
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,550
You can send me an email the easiest way is to

416
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,350
Go to one of the three dot slack.com and ask a mailbag question

417
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,270
Or you can ask a question and you just tag it with the mailbag emoji

418
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,870
And it'll show up in our mailbag channel and we'll remember to talk about it

419
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,100
Ringo

420
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,340
aka, richard starkie asks

421
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,500
Could you discuss in the next episode on what to automate?

422
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:24,580
How to coach devs and testers on defining criteria on which tests to automate and we all know the answer

423
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,820
That's what we're going to answer and the answer is obvious

424
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,380
You should automate

425
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,780
All of the tests that should be automated

426
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,340
and

427
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,340
Not one more or one less. That's exactly it. So we're done with that. So the next topic

428
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,620
We should probably go a little bit deeper because that's the challenge

429
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:50,180
That's the challenge in test designers is of course figuring out which of those tests are to be automated

430
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:56,470
If you are in the oh my god, I love selenium. It's my life camp

431
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:03,190
Your tests to automate are everything I can possibly do in the web ui of my application

432
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,990
Which uh probably isn't right?

433
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,800
This goes back to and i'm going to get up on a soapbox

434
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,760
And I don't think it's this one people won't argue with

435
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,360
the manual versus automated and

436
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:24,100
Teams that have separate automation teams and one one thing worse than having a separate isolated dedicated test team

437
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,220
Is to have a dedicated test team that split into manual testers and automated testers

438
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,860
recipe for disaster

439
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,840
I think when you think about how you're going to test something you need to think about it holistically

440
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,880
And then you automate the tests that would be too difficult

441
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:47,240
Or too time consuming to conduct with your own hands

442
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:52,360
In fact, I can't even use the word manual anymore because someone will jump down my throat telling me

443
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,600
It's not manual programming. So I call it manual testing

444
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,000
Uh, because I because I use the words that are commonly known across a million people in the industry. That's why wait wait

445
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,480
But it is manual programming

446
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,920
It of course it is but we don't use that label. So anyway testing

447
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,840
Uh, and really it goes back to the original problem. I said is that

448
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,210
testing is testing

449
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,580
Wow, that's even more of a tautology than you should automate all of the tests that should be automated

450
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,260
But it's true testing is testing and we're going to use the computer to help us do some of the hard parts

451
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:31,190
So we're going to do this real time

452
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:33,750
Give me a feature brant

453
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,270
This has not been pre-planned. He's going to really make it hard for me go on

454
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,060
Feature like give me something something you want me to test

455
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,220
uh

456
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,500
calculator

457
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,060
Oh, that's a lot of stuff in there. So do I have

458
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:53,860
Maybe the first thing I do so say i'm a tester at a company and say we're making a calculate yet another calculator app

459
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,580
How are you going to test it?

460
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,460
There's a whole bunch of stuff. I want to know I want to know

461
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,530
If it's accurate

462
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:05,610
I want to know if it has different modes they have to display. Let's just say it's a plain

463
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:11,930
Standard calculator with no extra modes for right now. We can add those later. So I want to know if it's accurate

464
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:19,660
I'm probably not going to do a bunch of accuracy tests through the ui. In fact, there's very little I want to automate through the ui

465
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,820
On this but i'm going to assume it has a model where I can pass numbers to it do the calculation compare it to an oracle

466
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,460
this is a case where

467
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,460
The test may duplicate

468
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:37,420
The actual code so maybe i'm going to sit down with the programmer if i'm not the programmer of it and look through it and see

469
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,740
Is my idea for an automated test just re-implementing the code?

470
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,580
Which i'll have to tell a story about the time I had working on uh, I tested gdi the graphics device interface

471
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,140
And and user interface which was all the user interface elements on windows 98

472
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:59,500
Lots of automated tests and some little bit a little bit of exploratory testing that I won't go into right now

473
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,620
But uh had a late night discussion with a programmer and maybe I don't know a couple people

474
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
in the org on whether

475
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,360
Whether or not we could use get pixel to test

476
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,360
Set pixel set pixel would set the color of a pixel on the screen and get pixel retrieve that color

477
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,990
absolutely not alan because

478
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,350
Well, well what happened in that discussion was

479
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,630
We dug into it. I was like, okay, what I can do

480
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:37,430
Is I can go query the memory of the device of the graphics device driver get that same bit of information

481
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:41,990
Pull that out and then compare that to the result of get pixel

482
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,790
And do the same thing on set pixel

483
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:51,430
Well set pixel and to use it i'll go query that memory on the graphics driver and see what it's pointing at which was

484
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:55,910
100 duplicating the work that get pixel and set pixel did

485
00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:02,470
So the answer so the question is can you use get pixel to test set pixel? The answer is of course who cares?

486
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:08,230
Because if the pixels on your screen are wrong, everybody in the world is going to notice i'm not going to write any tests there

487
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,740
Rewinding that back to the calculator. Yeah. No and the other one is it's like

488
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,300
on this one

489
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,940
like i've had these discussions in the past and the the thing is is

490
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:28,140
Is you don't know how it's implemented it could call right? Is it the the reason why you wouldn't use?

491
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,380
Get pixel to test set pixel or whichever one that you just mentioned

492
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,780
is

493
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,180
Because assumption could be applied

494
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:43,260
To both sides and there was a preference to view it as a black box, right and to me

495
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
The the answer is

496
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,240
Okay, let's just go look at how it's implemented

497
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,320
I think more often than not it's going to be some stupid property

498
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:59,720
That that isn't manipulated within the class. It's just a set and get part of the answer to

499
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,160
Automating all the tests that should be automated is to understand

500
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,200
How the feature is implemented?

501
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:11,000
There's some investigation work to do there to figure out how i'm going to test to make sure calculations are correct

502
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,230
one way to do it is

503
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:20,310
Something that the excel team used to do a long time ago is they had some

504
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,070
custom hand crafted assembly that that

505
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:26,870
did all the calculations in

506
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,310
excel

507
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:34,230
What they did on the debug version of that there's one way to do testing is to don't do testing just have a debug version that

508
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:41,750
Checks the crap out of stuff the debug version had a much easier to read c if you can imagine c being easier to read

509
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:47,030
But a much easier to read c version of all of those calculations that ran in parallel

510
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:51,270
And if those two calculation engines ever disagreed you hit an assert

511
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,910
One thing maybe not done enough as I think about it

512
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,830
Is testing on debug versions that have massive amounts of diagnostics in place. Let me even back up that

513
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,860
observability

514
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:10,900
Maybe I don't want to write tests because I have a way to turn on some diagnostics and see the state of the calculator

515
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,100
And see what's going on see if anything's corrupted its memory, etc, etc

516
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:17,860
All those things go into consideration when i'm figuring out what to automate

517
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,460
so let's say

518
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,940
Calculation is fine. I probably want to test that

519
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:27,500
Two plus two great three divided by one. Oh, I know i'll divide by zero

520
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,940
You did you can check all those things quickly manually and they're probably never going to break again

521
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,460
but

522
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:39,980
One thing where I maybe would do automation finally in here, of course in addition to just I would probably write a series of

523
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,500
Common like a sanity check like a unit test that ran against the model super fast that ram

524
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,620
A thousand different calculations made sure they work that would make sure I didn't break anything as i'm iterating on this

525
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,340
But also I want to know if and where I may even use a ui test

526
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,060
Is not to automate that two plus two, but what happens if I have that calculator?

527
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,780
Oh, say i'm doing my taxes or some extensive calculation and I have it open for hours and hours doing calculation after calculation

528
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:14,700
That may be something I may brute force automate i'm not looking for results because I I trust the engine i'm looking for

529
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,220
After I do thousands of operations, maybe even I might write a smart monkey

530
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:23,900
That's what i'm getting at to see if I could get the calculator in a state where

531
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,180
Again using diagnostics as my oracle not using a result of the calculation

532
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,620
Can I see if the calculator gets in a state where it is either?

533
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,780
Some of the internal diagnostics are incorrect or maybe just monitoring memory usage

534
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,140
Right now. I was actually I was actually thinking, you know memory leaks

535
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,180
Is this implemented like do we see that as we keep adding operations?

536
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:55,100
It did the dev essentially implemented as every time you add a new operation

537
00:39:55,180 --> 00:40:01,260
It remembers the whole history and the way it produces the results is it recalculates the whole thing every time

538
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,700
So yeah, so as you kept on adding operations, right?

539
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,340
You need to perform it slow down

540
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,380
But here's actually something I think is really important that you didn't address in this particular example

541
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:20,060
Pinned that for one second because I realized I went way into solution mode, but my answer to that question on what to automate is

542
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,220
Take time up front to think about all of the testing you want to do

543
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:29,980
Or all the testing that could be done and think about the most optimum way to do that and some of that is automated

544
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:35,100
The ui maybe some is automated at a lower level and some you decide not to automate

545
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,460
But that's that's really my that's the short version of that whole answer

546
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,820
But what's something we're still going back into solution mode?

547
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:48,700
You're saying and you're probably right in this brainstorming of what sorts of things I could test or write automated tests for

548
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,940
I missed something big. So what is that?

549
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,420
Well, um, well, I don't know that I said that you

550
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,380
Did something big i'm trying to put words in your mouth and add drama to our podcast right play along

551
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:06,020
Sorry next time on yeah, you'll never believe what happens next

552
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,660
In the example test the calculator

553
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,100
Right you went into a place where?

554
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,880
All right. What i'm trying to do is test the calculations

555
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,570
But nowadays if I ask you alan to implement a calculator

556
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,280
What would you do?

557
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
like would you actually

558
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:32,220
If you were to go and implement a calculator to me with all the libraries we have now

559
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,780
GitHub and find someone's to fork

560
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:39,900
That npm install calculator, right? It's that's

561
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,380
That's true

562
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,940
But if you were to build a new calculator today

563
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,060
More than likely all that work is is ui

564
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,820
Uh connecting to well known

565
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,540
Well tested well established

566
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:03,660
Libraries like you wouldn't even write the library. You're the one who gave me this example. No, I know

567
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,700
uh, but I did it kind of purposefully because in this case the the

568
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,880
You really don't need to test. Uh a good deal of the

569
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,600
underlying library except for maybe a handful of regression tests to be used for acceptance like because

570
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:26,600
For example, I deal with python and python libraries update all of the damn time

571
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:33,800
So, how do you make sure that it's righteous to integrate the the library update into your project?

572
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,920
It's so by the way, I gotta mention it's so cool to hear

573
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,360
About someone at microsoft using a programming language invented in this century. That's great

574
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,790
Yeah, thanks for that I don't

575
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,430
I mean, I don't know that

576
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:57,270
Actually every language i've used since my career here c was in bit. Oh this century, I guess. Yeah. Okay. Got it

577
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,030
um

578
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,190
But here is the thing I think that is

579
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:05,910
Is valuable around automation because we also you kind of

580
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:09,990
You kind of didn't talk about the cicb aspect of this

581
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:11,910
for me

582
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:13,910
a decision to

583
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,590
automate

584
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:19,670
Is essentially how repetitive is this work?

585
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:27,750
And that's it if it's not repetitive don't automate it if if if it's not going to be part of your

586
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:33,430
Check-in suite or necessary for cicd. Don't automate it

587
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:40,870
The other thing I I think is great to automate which doesn't lend itself to this calculator example unless it has some sort of way to pass it

588
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:42,950
a file of calculations is

589
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,510
I automate a lot of data generation

590
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,110
repetitive

591
00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,750
Right because it's repetitive and and also you can randomize it. I love the idea of

592
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:56,470
Data-driven tests where maybe am I maybe it's a a messaging app

593
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,660
I want to see how many contacts it can handle I would bet that somewhere there's a tester

594
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:07,020
I noticed I didn't say manual tester, but a tester who

595
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,590
Would by hand careful with my words create

596
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:18,150
10 000 contacts to see if it would it would wreck the app but something like that again repetitive

597
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,390
I would write an engine to create me

598
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:25,430
You know using the big list of naughty strings all kinds of fun, which is a cool project

599
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,510
You should look up if you haven't on github

600
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:31,190
All kinds of cool inputs for everything

601
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:37,350
For everything that now I I literally in my career have done that test case

602
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,070
Yeah, yeah

603
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:44,310
Those are great things to automate that if you I don't know if you recall. Do you remember what my very first project was?

604
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:49,190
Oh is the answer. I don't know the answer and and

605
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,870
It's the only one of these things that I have still kept

606
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,800
Oh my god

607
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,260
Brandt is showing a copy of schedule plus for windows 95

608
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:05,720
Which was the cali which was the original calendar app from microsoft right calendar and contacts

609
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,120
and um

610
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,720
And we used to have a thing that every every time you ship something you

611
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:18,760
Everyone it it was even a verb for a long time even after we moved to exchange calorim

612
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,980
People would say could you sked plus me?

613
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,340
uh

614
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,340
It's much rarer now

615
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,500
uh, but people hope

616
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,500
but people still

617
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,420
Still actually say can you s plus me but it's significantly rarer now. Um

618
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:38,260
I and I forgot about that verb until you showed me

619
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:44,100
Uh, so you showed me that box. Yeah, so that was that was my first product of I've I've

620
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:49,860
I've gotten rid of all of the other shrink graft products that that i've gotten over the years

621
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,500
But that was the first one I kept it to me

622
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,380
What you test

623
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,180
The the traditional aspect of of testing

624
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,580
Right. It's around risk control and as a result

625
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:09,060
Uh, there's an uncertain amount of value back to the business with this work and it definitely is

626
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,820
An ever increasing cost to the business. So I think like allen's

627
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,100
Totology is actually quite

628
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:21,700
Wise it is essentially you should

629
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,860
Automate what you should automate, but the way I would suggest driving that

630
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:36,340
Is essentially automate those cases where they're over the lifetime of the product you're expecting a high return

631
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:43,340
Right. You do not want a developer or or any human being that have to go through

632
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,580
Uh manually say a

633
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,380
an hour long

634
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,100
Integration test for sure for sure

635
00:46:53,030 --> 00:46:56,230
If it's valuable, then you should automate it, right?

636
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:02,150
Yes, the point I want to get to and now I want to close this and do our last topic and then close out today is

637
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:08,150
I think a lot of folks just approach the the automation process wrong. They go. What can I automate?

638
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,790
Which is the wrong thing wrong way to start that it's

639
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,870
What is the testing we need to do for this product?

640
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,060
period

641
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:22,420
And it's it's highly contextual and then once you brainstorm that testing you should look at that

642
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,140
Okay

643
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:29,620
These are the things of the overall testing need to be automated and very likely in many cases could be all of it

644
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,100
But at least you thought through it in some cases. It may not be all of it. That's okay, too

645
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,780
but

646
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:39,060
There is a problem I see in a lot of testing

647
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:48,020
especially again from these test automation engineers who they focus purely on i'm gonna automate everything I can figure out how to automate

648
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,580
instead of thinking about

649
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,860
What's the best way for us to test this what actually or

650
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,180
like I said before

651
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:02,500
What needs to be tested in order for us to reduce the amount of risk we need to in order to get this thing out to

652
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:09,060
Customers I was just about to push back on that right because we don't the goal isn't to test something

653
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:11,140
The goal is to reduce

654
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:16,420
Business slash customer risk, right? The goal the goal is never testing

655
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,220
And yeah, and that gets lost, right?

656
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,340
And and we didn't talk about it this time

657
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:30,340
Unless we can get to the other one, but again, I remain a huge proponent particularly in in today's environment

658
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,740
around

659
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,740
leveraging the data and

660
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:39,540
Optimizing, you know flight control rings of exposure

661
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:46,340
And and doing a react in services. There's all kinds of safe deployment techniques

662
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,260
You can use to reduce risk because again, that's the goal not testing

663
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:56,020
one last thing I want to mention so we can close on time here because I have a hard hard stop in like a minute and a half is

664
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,380
Modern test con or as it's been suggested. We call it test of this

665
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:06,420
I think we should do this. I don't know how to host a conference and

666
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,620
But we've had a number of requests for we talked in the past about having like a test bash seattle

667
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:16,260
But I think we're still and and do a follow-up day, which still may happen someday

668
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,740
But I think we're all still working virtually for a while

669
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,860
Maybe we can start brainstorming this on our slack channel. I think we could get

670
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,820
Several of the three there

671
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:32,500
We could get several of the three. I'm not even sure what it would look like how we do if it would even be

672
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,420
I don't know

673
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:35,380
I

674
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:40,340
It's worth thinking about i'm not sold on it. I don't want to do it just as a

675
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:46,100
Oh, look at us. We have a conference. I want to actually provide some value to the overall testing community

676
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:53,700
I do too and and honestly and I struggle with the same thing right with with test bash

677
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,660
uh and

678
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,660
online test conference

679
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:05,050
Right my perception with those two, you know, there's a good deal of modern testing

680
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,170
There are most conferences

681
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:13,770
These days there's some one member of the three seems to show up talking about something

682
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:17,450
Modern testing ish if not modern testing directly

683
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:23,530
So that may be the better avenue, but i'm just wondering if there's a one day

684
00:50:24,810 --> 00:50:26,860
Uh thing

685
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,180
I don't know yet, but I love to brainstorm that more

686
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,060
So if you're not in our slack community, you have some ideas, please join in or you can tweet me or whatever

687
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:39,500
But something for us to think about no plans, but I want to plant the seed and see if it grows

688
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,220
Yeah, it'd be if

689
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,500
if if there's if the three have great suggestions on what sort of is the

690
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:53,420
Distinct value prop i'd love to hear it. Yeah, we'll get that going. All right

691
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,820
Uh, this was fun

692
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,620
Thanks for getting up early. It sounds like you've been up for a while, but uh, good job

693
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:06,620
I did finish my second cup of coffee during this podcast. That's a good thing also. Yeah mine's halfway

694
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,180
I still have halfway to go. All right, probably might need to go put that in the microwave for a minute

695
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,860
It might be a little cold by now

696
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:16,220
Okay, everybody. I am still the a in ab testing

697
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,980
And I am not and brent's a big old b

698
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,060
See you everyone

699
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,060
Bye
