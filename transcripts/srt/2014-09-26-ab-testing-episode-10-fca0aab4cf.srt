1
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,620
Hey, I'm Alan.

2
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,620
I'm Brett.

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:18,620
And if you remember us, we're part of the AV testing podcast.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,620
It's been a long time, right, Brett?

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,620
Guys, how long has it been?

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,620
Well, we...

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,620
Last time I saw you...

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,620
Three months?

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,620
Last time I saw you is the beginning of July.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,620
We recorded episode number nine, which means...

11
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:30,620
Big double digits!

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,620
Woo hoo!

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,740
Well, we were in double digits if you used octal.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,740
Never mind.

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,740
Yeah, true.

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,180
Okay, using a 10-based accounting system, we're in episode number 10.

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:49,420
And man, I leave for one little summer and Microsoft goes haywire crazy doing all kinds

18
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,420
of wild stuff.

19
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,340
Yeah, there is a saying around here that at least there used to be that we work in dog

20
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,340
years.

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,340
Maybe, maybe.

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,380
I used to say that Xbox, my two years on Xbox, was the best five years of my life, but

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,540
I think more time may have passed by since that shift.

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,960
Yeah, you know, the last two months, I think we lost...

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
We progressed a couple of years.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,040
Yeah, and speaking of the last two months, for those of you that don't recall or don't

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,200
even know who I am, I took the summer off.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,040
My last day of work was around July 9th, and I didn't come back to work until just after

29
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,520
Labor Day, week after Labor Day, somewhere in there.

30
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,080
I spent most of time in France.

31
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,680
Shouldn't you do that with like a rich, sweaty, sweaty person's voice?

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
I should, but you know what?

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,480
I was on the beaches of Provence.

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,760
I was in the south of France, very laid back, drank a whole lot of rosé, spent most of

35
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,240
our time in Exim Provence, did some traveling around the southern coast of France.

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,600
Because we were so close, we were in Nice, we took a little day trip along the coast,

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,360
went to the Museum Ocean d'Agráfique in Monaco, where Jacques Cousteau used to work.

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,880
It's fantastic of aquarium, nice museum.

39
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,120
And then because we were so close, we drove across the border, had a nice, huge pasta

40
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,780
dinner in Italy.

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Where?

42
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,780
South Italy?

43
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,180
No, I guess it would be North Italy somewhere.

44
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,180
Excuse us, while we have a geography lesson.

45
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,180
I don't think there's a bridge.

46
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,180
We took a spaceship.

47
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,180
Anyway, it was a great summer.

48
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,260
People joke about the way I put this, but we stopped on the way home in Japan for a

49
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,540
week and visited some friends.

50
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,500
So I made it all the way around the world this summer, took the kids to the Pokemon

51
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Store in Osaka.

52
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,460
Oh, I bet you they had a blast at that.

53
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,340
They had a good time.

54
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,380
Our friends gave them some money to spend there, and they spent three hours trying to figure

55
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,660
out what they were going to get.

56
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,260
My daughter is all into Hello Kitty, and I'm sure that that would be one of the first

57
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,330
places I would have to go.

58
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,890
Anyway, good trip.

59
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,850
A lot happened while I was gone.

60
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,850
Maybe...

61
00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:01,450
Yeah, so if you guys remember, back in episode nine, one of our closing discussions was,

62
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,560
hey, what do you think will happen once you come back, Alan?

63
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,340
So let me ask you, how far wrong were we?

64
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,580
You know, we weren't far wrong, and there were other predictions I made that even were

65
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,580
crazier.

66
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,500
So, just fill me on what's going on.

67
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,260
I'm going to look at some technical things here that are kind of bugging me with our

68
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,300
podcast while Brent talks about what's going on.

69
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Well, so one of the...

70
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,920
I would say the biggest prediction that we seem to be off on, just slightly, is we didn't

71
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,740
think Windows would begin the big change.

72
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,460
Well, what changed...

73
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,060
Tell me what big change Windows made, because I'm in Windows, and I didn't notice it.

74
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,420
I noticed it less than Windows than other parts of the company.

75
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,820
So while you were out...

76
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,820
I'm still catching up.

77
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,020
This is my second full week back.

78
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:02,980
While you were out, quite a few of the Windows orgs, my connections in those Windows orgs,

79
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:09,920
reached out to me and said, holy crap, Brent, we're starting that change.

80
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:20,960
For example, one of the comments was saying is sort of a rethinking of the quality orgs.

81
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:28,100
We shifted to a quality-based system, I don't know how long, four or five, six months ago.

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:33,460
But yet, even though we rebranded this quality, and some groups within the Windows org, it's

83
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,220
kind of still viewed as sort of the test org.

84
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,580
And we're seeing, I think, a stepwise sort of dismantling of that towards a combined engineering

85
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,800
role.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,980
Well, let me tell you what I saw.

87
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,140
And without digging myself too big of a hole here.

88
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,740
And maybe I should go back and talk about some other predictions I made at a community

89
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,090
event that you weren't able to make it to.

90
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,530
We talked, probably, I'm sure I mentioned, we do this soapbox event every year for

91
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,130
one of the communities we're involved in, where everybody gets five to seven minutes,

92
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,610
I can't remember what time limit we used, on stage to rant about whatever they want to,

93
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,930
the wilder the better, and there's some entertainment going on.

94
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,930
It's a good time.

95
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:20,210
And the theme for this year was if I were CEO, and I got a little, we gave everybody

96
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,450
a little name sticker that says Sachi Nadella, and they got to talk about whatever they

97
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,450
wanted to.

98
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,210
And I talked about revamping management at Microsoft.

99
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,570
I made three big points.

100
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,520
And one was self organizing engineering teams.

101
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,000
And do that with a flatter or structure, where you have engineering managers that are in

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,280
charge of 14, 15, 16 people, and people that are capable of leadership of organizing and

103
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,760
orchestrating that team into something that can, you know, into self organizing teams that

104
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,040
can fill in gaps, etc, etc.

105
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,280
And those two things, there's actually a memo from Sachi this summer saying, hey,

106
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
we're doing these two things.

107
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,160
I thought, hey, maybe he said maybe he saw my talk, probably not, because this is all

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,880
this is not me inventing something.

109
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,520
This is me paying attention to what works in the real world and goes, oh, that kind of

110
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,200
makes a lot of sense.

111
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,680
That's something we should probably do.

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,640
But here in A.B.

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,560
Testing, we're going to get full credit talent.

114
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,080
Yeah.

115
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,960
So the third thing was it's like, how do you find those engineering managers

116
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,960
capable of orchestrating a larger team and doing the right thing?

117
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,560
And one thing at Microsoft we have is moving from position to position at

118
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,520
Microsoft is you have to go through a full interview loop just like when you were

119
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,640
first hired at Microsoft.

120
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
And I think it's sort of silly.

121
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,040
And there's a lot of restrictions around managers could put up, well, we're going

122
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,600
to need this person's mission critical.

123
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,680
We're going to need it for six months.

124
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,860
And it's, although it's certainly, it's not totally difficult or completely

125
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,460
difficult to move from position to position around the company, it's much

126
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,740
more difficult than it needs to be.

127
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,060
So my third premise in that was to make that as easy as possible.

128
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,020
So you'd be in agreement between the current manager and the hiring manager.

129
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,700
Hey, they're going to move over here.

130
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,020
You know, minimum transition times.

131
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,940
You can work half and half if you want to for a while, just help with the

132
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,580
transition, but people want to move, let them move.

133
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,960
And if you make that easy, and then some of the details that I won't go into today,

134
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,040
but if you make that easy, the way you identify your poor managers is they

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,200
don't have anybody working for them anymore because it's so much easier

136
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
for them to lead.

137
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,560
I think, believe it or not, my prediction is we will get there very soon

138
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,560
because there was a hint in that memo that said something coming up around

139
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
internal transitions.

140
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm hoping we make that super easy.

141
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,550
I think it's going to help solve some other problems as well.

142
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,940
That would be so fantastic.

143
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,580
In addition to that, we should be able to make the EMs, the engineering

144
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,560
managers, move as easily.

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,840
Like in the world that you're talking about, right, the EMs will likely end

146
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,240
up having to have two big skills.

147
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:59,220
One, the ability to successfully execute on whatever their domain is, but in

148
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,180
an empowering fashion, in order to do that, they're going to have to cleanly

149
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,570
understand the value proposition of what they're doing and communicate down

150
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:14,170
the value principles versus sort of micromanaging command and command.

151
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,570
Yeah, came up with a friend of mine, sort of a metaphoric.

152
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:22,450
I spent a lot of time in France eating some fantastic food.

153
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,050
I was thinking, we have managers, and I'm going to be blunt here, we have a

154
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,650
lot of managers at Microsoft who are very good at turning the crank at the

155
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,930
sausage factory.

156
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,610
They make awesome sausage, but they turn that crank.

157
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,170
They've been turning this crank for 20 years, and they make some great

158
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,850
frickin' sausage.

159
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:43,050
The problem is the dishes we're making are much more complex.

160
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,450
Sorry for the metaphor, but it really needs a little of this,

161
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,140
little of this tasting as you go, letting it simmer, kind of just...

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,060
It's a much more complex...

163
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,180
What we need our leaders to do is much more complex than turning the sausage

164
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,180
crank.

165
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,780
It's a transition we need to make.

166
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:06,180
Honestly, there's a big chunk of our managers at Microsoft who only know

167
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,300
how to crank the sausage and don't know how to do anything else.

168
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,780
Your metaphor got slightly weird, but there was one thing I'll attempt to do

169
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,460
to add to it.

170
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,460
What the hell?

171
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,320
The other thing too is our competitors have learned, hey, wait a minute, we can

172
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,620
automate sausage cranking.

173
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,700
So then their people, instead of focusing on turning the damn crank, are

174
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,980
more focused on what kind of sausages should we make to enhance these more

175
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,780
complicated dishes that you're referring to.

176
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,620
Whereas we're spending all of our time going, no, we must turn the

177
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,820
crank.

178
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,060
Now we must take time off in order to maintain the crank.

179
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:54,260
Whereas our competitors, they've got the whole factory figured out.

180
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,180
The second thing I was going to say in terms of what engineering

181
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,180
managers then would need to focus on is I'll say customer delight, but in

182
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,780
a different angle.

183
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,220
This is employee delight.

184
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,240
One of the things when I introduce myself to my employees, I refer to

185
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,460
myself as their MSP.

186
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,780
They are my customer and I am their management service provider.

187
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,900
I'm fully aware that them choosing to leave the team is a big portion of

188
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,070
them choosing to fire me.

189
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,710
I make that part of my active practice because I don't like to be fired by

190
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,710
anything.

191
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:34,390
We need more managers think that way.

192
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,430
When somebody leaves, this works with my comment before, but let that

193
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,230
movement happen freely.

194
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:44,320
When I decided to go work for the manager, I fired you.

195
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,660
I like thinking about it that way.

196
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:51,240
One thing I mentioned before because I'm a huge fan of Pat Lincione,

197
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,040
the first person I actually read this in writing from, but direct

198
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,220
correlation between organizational health, how much do I love my job

199
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:03,260
and a bunch of other things around there, and product quality.

200
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,060
Those things are not completely independent.

201
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,240
They're very tightly related.

202
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,160
All you got to do is spend a few months in a team that has poor

203
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,420
organizational health.

204
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,940
The quality of the product will directly correlate it.

205
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,340
You know what's worse is when is this blind oblivion.

206
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,700
I see teams where they do because they never look outside their team

207
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
for anything.

208
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,780
They don't realize that their team's unhealthy.

209
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,540
Often, those are the same people that don't realize their

210
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,660
products unhealthy.

211
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,700
They're on a dismal team and they're making a mediocre product,

212
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,020
but they don't know any better and they're happy.

213
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,380
It hurts me to see that.

214
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,460
I shouldn't say they're happy.

215
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,180
They don't know what happiness is.

216
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,380
It's even worse than that because they do know better because

217
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,260
they have an engine typically around self-justification and

218
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:05,260
they are well skilled in going to look at those feedback

219
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:12,020
sources that affirm their subjective bias.

220
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,420
They go a more tortoise of ignorance.

221
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,540
They know what they know and they have a whole lot of that.

222
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,580
I've been talking to a couple friends of mine who were part

223
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,300
of the layoffs this summer.

224
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,340
Brett and I are somehow still employed.

225
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,180
I know a lot of people and I get good, good people who got

226
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,180
laid off.

227
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,700
Actually, all of the good people I know, I think most of

228
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,380
the found jobs, most of them, not all of them have found jobs.

229
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,380
We went through two layoffs.

230
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,120
All the good people I know from the layoffs that occurred

231
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,600
a couple months ago, the beginning of your vacation,

232
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,260
they've landed in great jobs.

233
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:57,460
Still have a few more from this last layoff.

234
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,440
Guys out there, we're very approachable.

235
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,760
If you work in a company that's looking for data science guys

236
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,080
or data pipeline guys or testing type guys, reach out to me

237
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,400
on Twitter because I know a bunch of really good people

238
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,400
right now that are looking for a new home.

239
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
The reason I brought that up.

240
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,560
By the way, I don't think it will take long for them

241
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
to find it.

242
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,560
No, no, no.

243
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,760
I think there's a couple things people are finding.

244
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,200
A lot of people that got laid off have been at

245
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,880
Microsoft a long time which is both good and bad.

246
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,080
It's good that they get a really nice severance package.

247
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,480
They're paid for quite a while.

248
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,760
What's bad is everybody I've talked to, to varying degrees,

249
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,950
is sort of blown away by the shelteredness of being

250
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,350
in the Microsoft walls and a lot of people don't

251
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:52,550
pay attention or haven't paid attention to what goes on

252
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,670
outside of Microsoft.

253
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,630
It's been very eye opening for them as they look around

254
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,350
at the rest of the software market and go,

255
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,510
oh, this is kind of how things are going.

256
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,670
My group was kind of hinting at going this way.

257
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,070
It's weird this team is full on doing this.

258
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,350
Or they're blown away by how much software tech

259
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,470
is in the Seattle area.

260
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,190
How many companies have offices and the number

261
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,190
of positions available.

262
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,150
They can actually be a little bit selective,

263
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,990
which is good.

264
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,510
But the main thing is, oh, there are other ways

265
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,710
to make software than the way I've been doing it

266
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,270
in my little sausage factory for the last 10 years.

267
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,830
Yeah, no, the people I've talked to on that front,

268
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,960
a good portion of them were very much anti-everything,

269
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,860
not Microsoft before they left.

270
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,270
And now some of the folks are coming back and going,

271
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,500
wow, I did not know what I could have had.

272
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,820
It's one of those things when I'm fighting the big fight

273
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,040
to getting people towards agile here within the company.

274
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,360
When I can get a couple of teams executing the rules

275
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,070
as they should be laid out, and they go, holy crap.

276
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,710
Now I completely understand why you were saying all that.

277
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,990
When I first walked through it and heard it,

278
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,030
I thought it was this hugely complex thing.

279
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,870
But once I got the muscle memory,

280
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,190
I don't ever want to go back.

281
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:21,350
Yeah, and I think the meta point to make there is,

282
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,230
and of course, if you listen to this podcast,

283
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,910
I'm preaching to the wrong people,

284
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:27,590
but it's really important that you actually pay attention

285
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,390
to what's going on in your profession worldwide.

286
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,040
You don't have to memorize the engineering practices

287
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,680
and organizational structure of every major software company

288
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,520
out there, but you should have an idea

289
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,560
of what their approaches are,

290
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,640
what their engineering values are.

291
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,720
Those are freely available.

292
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,800
We know that you want to think about flat org structures.

293
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,440
Let's look at how Zappos do it work.

294
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,400
If you want to think about who does some really cool stuff

295
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,320
with data science, let's look at what Netflix is doing,

296
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,000
especially with reliability and their chaos suite,

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
their simian army.

298
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,480
So everybody needs to know,

299
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,680
I mean, these are basic things that everyone should know,

300
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,400
but if I were to go to,

301
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,020
I can probably say the majority, man, that's a little harsh.

302
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,420
Maybe the majority of engineers I know at Microsoft

303
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,860
and ask them about those things, they go,

304
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,380
I don't know.

305
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,740
And this kind of goes back to,

306
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,460
this is not a Microsoft civic thing

307
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,860
I want to pick on our company,

308
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,460
but this goes back to DiMarco.

309
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,380
What was the darn book he wrote?

310
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,020
He found in his research that some high percentage

311
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,380
of the people had never even read a book

312
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,620
on software engineering,

313
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,860
since they got a professional job.

314
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,820
And that same sort of principle is true.

315
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,340
People, I just can't imagine being happy with my job

316
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,660
if I wasn't constantly learning

317
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,700
and trying to expand what I know,

318
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,380
what I've discovered throughout life.

319
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,500
And I wouldn't even be here if that wasn't the case.

320
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,460
I wouldn't even be employed at Microsoft.

321
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,380
People aren't censored by different things.

322
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Yeah, I totally get that.

323
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,300
But I think one of the reasons I'm still employed

324
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,620
is because I'm learning and I'm adaptable

325
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,540
and I'm flexible and I can be put in a lot of different

326
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,220
situations and be successful.

327
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,660
And you're one of those guys who do pay attention

328
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,540
and bring it into the organization

329
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,720
to help enhance their forward progress.

330
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,600
And unfortunately that makes you a differentiator.

331
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,030
Why do you say unfortunately?

332
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,990
Because a lot of the things that we're bringing through,

333
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,470
this is a common discussion between you and I.

334
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,150
A lot of the things that you and I

335
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,510
are trying to bring to this company.

336
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,870
I've been teaching people Agile stuff for three years.

337
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,220
And I'm just like, it's making a small chink in the armor.

338
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,500
But my sense is if we don't figure this out as a company

339
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,790
within the next three years,

340
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:49,630
there's not gonna be a following three years.

341
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:53,830
Well, we've talked a lot at length in the past

342
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:56,710
on organizational change and getting people,

343
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:59,470
there's some sense of wanting to need to change as well.

344
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,270
And I think I'm kind of excited

345
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,910
with Satya's leadership on this.

346
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,230
I think we're definitely heading in the right direction,

347
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:09,310
but there's a lot of resistance even,

348
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:12,150
I would say even among the higher up executives,

349
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,670
because again, they've been making sausage.

350
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,950
They've been making some darn good sausage for decades.

351
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,830
And it's hard from top down to make those changes.

352
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,750
The other thing in terms of not only looking outside,

353
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,590
like you were saying,

354
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,230
people should be spending some time looking outside.

355
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,790
There was a study I read a few months ago.

356
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:31,990
The basic study, it must be true.

357
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,030
And basically what the study concluded

358
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,430
is that if you read one hour in any topic

359
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,350
that you have an interest in,

360
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,110
if you just read one hour a day for seven years,

361
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:51,340
you would be an international expert on that topic.

362
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,020
Sure, sure.

363
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,740
And the stuff that we're talking about,

364
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,860
I don't know that we need a ton of international experts

365
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,020
on all these variable topics,

366
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,820
but it doesn't take much time

367
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:09,650
to stay connected to global best practices.

368
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,250
The first thing you gotta do though,

369
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,370
is careful man, you use the best practices.

370
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:18,340
There's people that will freak out about that.

371
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,180
Yeah, it is.

372
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,020
I'm one of them.

373
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,980
So you mentioned this polling of engineers

374
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,820
and some of them would go, no, I don't know.

375
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,700
What's even worse is if you take that subgroup,

376
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,980
I'm willing to bet the majority of those people

377
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,570
who don't even do it, you ask them why they don't,

378
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,290
is because, wow, that's stupid,

379
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,130
because a chaos monkey is stupid,

380
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,780
because how are they gonna keep track of all those bugs?

381
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,540
Right, that's just gonna generate bugs and cause interrupt

382
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,760
and how are we gonna move forward?

383
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,040
And it's sort of a zero sum game for them.

384
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,890
When we hit one of the challenges about a year ago,

385
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,810
when we were talking about the changes coming up with test,

386
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:04,810
you and I both knew it's gonna happen.

387
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,690
All the forces are in place.

388
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,810
This has got momentum that is unstoppable.

389
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,850
But yet I would still go and talk to directors

390
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,170
and say, hey, all of this work still has to be done.

391
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,880
So what's the difference if we have a test discipline

392
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,920
versus a dev discipline?

393
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,480
They view it as a zero sum game.

394
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,480
They wouldn't acknowledge that tests are dead

395
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,160
doing their own testing

396
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,040
actually increases sausage production.

397
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,400
You give for a lot of inefficiency.

398
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,400
Right.

399
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,480
It's nice to look at,

400
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,200
I don't wanna send the metaphor anymore,

401
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,120
so I'm gonna stop.

402
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,520
What do you wanna talk about next, Mr. Random Order Guy?

403
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,170
Are we still in the changes category?

404
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,980
Let me talk about the third sub-folder.

405
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:52,750
So one of the things that I'm seeing now,

406
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,390
there's a new change of questions

407
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,070
people are coming and asking me about.

408
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,950
We have a lot of these new startup

409
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,390
data science groups throughout the company.

410
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,230
And as a-

411
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,470
Oh, wait, actually, let me go back.

412
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,820
Have you yet heard about blended engineering?

413
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,380
Is this where I used the metaphor,

414
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,900
the little, I threw it from my mouth thing?

415
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:19,090
Yeah, this is possibly where Alan Beeps himself.

416
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:24,090
So one of the more innovative groups in Windows

417
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:28,820
has decided that combined engineering is stupid

418
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,820
and that they're going to enhance it

419
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,900
with this topic of blended engineering.

420
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,500
And blended engineering, just in a nutshell,

421
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,380
is where the test team still exists

422
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,580
because the same level of testing still needs to occur.

423
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,180
Try to, I mean, the quality team.

424
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,460
Anyway, go on, I'm gonna shut up.

425
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,740
Yeah, they do testing.

426
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,020
But blended engineering means

427
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,190
that team now reports to the dev manager.

428
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,470
Huh.

429
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,270
Do you need to take a sip of water?

430
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,050
I don't know what I need to do.

431
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,900
I think I don't wanna comment on that.

432
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,300
All right.

433
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,540
I need to write, and I've started this

434
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,380
and I haven't finished it.

435
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,220
I need to write my thoughts down

436
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,250
on how an engineering team works

437
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,530
and why people over-complexify.

438
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:23,370
Is that a word?

439
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,210
Sure.

440
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,350
They make this, they decide, okay,

441
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,030
I recognize the inefficiencies

442
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,910
of passing stuff back and forth from dev to test

443
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,710
and back and forth and back and forth.

444
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,670
So my solution for that is to create an engineering team

445
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,110
and I'm gonna implement it in this amazingly stupid way

446
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,130
that ensures that I can never, ever have success.

447
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,610
So there's, as you can tell, going down that path,

448
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,330
write intent, wrong implementation.

449
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,290
So I think, or I don't even say wrong implementation.

450
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,410
I think it's okay to be wrong,

451
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,730
but it's not okay to not think through,

452
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,930
it's a systems problem.

453
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,130
There's many moving pieces.

454
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,890
Let's think about what this change is

455
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,410
before you actually implement it.

456
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,660
And that's where I see a lot of teams fail.

457
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,320
Yeah, I do as well.

458
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,680
The challenge that I'm facing a lot lately

459
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,100
is I do spend a lot of quality time on system thinking,

460
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,580
but the challenge for me is being able

461
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,580
to take the conclusions from that process

462
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,060
and then simplify it in a way that's consumable

463
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,200
by those who don't have that strength.

464
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,280
Yeah, this goes back to everything we've talked about,

465
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,440
about organizational change

466
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,160
and letting people know what's going on

467
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:40,280
and let them see success quickly, blah, blah, blah,

468
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,360
et cetera, et cetera.

469
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Those things all apply.

470
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,250
You need, it's not a single crank.

471
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,050
It's not a single thing you change.

472
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:52,370
You have to do a lot of things differently.

473
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,970
It requires, as you mentioned before,

474
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,130
a different style of leadership and management

475
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,330
to make this work.

476
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:02,400
It requires just a lot of pieces to move at the same time.

477
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,920
And if you miss that, you're just not gonna be successful.

478
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,360
You're gonna think it doesn't work.

479
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,600
And it really can work.

480
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,320
One thing I wanted to mention, as I mentioned this,

481
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,340
I might've mentioned this before,

482
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,560
but worth bringing up again is the team I'm on.

483
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,320
I'm on a very small team, so we're a little unique

484
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,600
in that we have our quality team

485
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,560
and we do a lot of analysis, data pipeline,

486
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,640
make sure we can get the data back from our

487
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,140
flighting, et cetera.

488
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,000
My manager is the quality manager.

489
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,440
His peer is the dev manager.

490
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,640
But in a lot of companies I know outside of Microsoft,

491
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
because I actually pay attention,

492
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
my manager would just be another dev manager

493
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,320
and his team owns infrastructure and data analysis.

494
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,240
They would call him a development team.

495
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,280
They would be seen as a peer

496
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,000
to the other dev organization.

497
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,760
They could report up through a dev director at the top,

498
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,760
but in a way, in a slightly contrived way,

499
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,960
we have a combined engineering team, an engineering team,

500
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
but we do have a separate, on paper,

501
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,880
we have a separate dev and quality org.

502
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,740
I think I'm not gonna lie and say we're an engineering

503
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,160
team that works together like an engineering team,

504
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,080
but we're closer than the old back and forth,

505
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,120
back and forth of the past.

506
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,040
We don't really test stuff for the developer.

507
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,400
And we look at scenarios

508
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,720
and a lot more customer experiences

509
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,980
than on product functionality or feature functionality.

510
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,220
I don't wanna, that's just not what we do.

511
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,760
So the team that I'm on now,

512
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,160
very similar to the way you describe your team.

513
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,160
We do, everybody's title is engineer something.

514
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,700
I report to an engineering director.

515
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,000
His peers are all engineering directors,

516
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,320
except for the PM org.

517
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I am an engineering manager, my ICs are engineers.

518
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,400
It's one of those things.

519
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,510
A rename doesn't change the perception of your role.

520
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:01,160
And that's the largest challenge.

521
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,200
So a lot of the folks in my org,

522
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,240
so when we did a recent reorg,

523
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,260
we took a whole bunch of testers

524
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,360
and we integrated them into the dev teams

525
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,350
and then reframed them as product engineers.

526
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,870
My team, we don't have a tight framing,

527
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:19,870
the way I communicated,

528
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,870
we kinda own the the horizontals of the org.

529
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,870
System testing, perfs, stuff, data pipeline analysis,

530
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:33,740
very similar to how you described your role.

531
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,840
Something is still holding the majority of the org

532
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,710
as a view of this is the place

533
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:43,950
where we can push quality downhill

534
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,710
and they're the ones accountable.

535
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,550
And it's been a non-trivial amount of me,

536
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,990
my peers and my manager's time going,

537
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,190
guys, you gotta stop this behavior.

538
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,630
Yeah, at that stage, it really comes down

539
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,230
to a leadership issue and making sure

540
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,310
that everyone knows what you're doing

541
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,670
and why you're doing it.

542
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:04,670
So a couple of new problems that have been popping up.

543
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,310
The situation that I described for my team

544
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:12,950
is a common situation throughout the company.

545
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,490
There's a lot of people in these quality orgs,

546
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,890
so they're sort of facing those same things.

547
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,930
A specific new problem that's popping up.

548
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:29,000
So when all of these data analysis teams came into being,

549
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,880
there was this belief that their role

550
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,500
is to feed the PM org, to help the PM

551
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:41,500
do usage analytics and really firm up

552
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,730
the type of features that are valuable

553
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,930
by the customer and help to create differentiators.

554
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:52,250
But the new problem in a nutshell,

555
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,620
you should be leading a horse to water,

556
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,100
but you can't make them drink.

557
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,260
So not a new problem is the PMs are like, great.

558
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,420
Like, where's my report?

559
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,020
Where's my answer?

560
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,260
Right, so there's a problem right now

561
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,300
where the PMs don't wanna give up sort of intuition mode

562
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,940
and they don't see the benefit of a fact driven.

563
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,340
It's a system.

564
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,000
And one thing, if you're gonna change,

565
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,300
we're not just changing what test or quality does,

566
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,900
changing what development does.

567
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,500
And it's not just change for change is sick,

568
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,220
it's change because we think we can get these efficiencies.

569
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,860
So the system or the model goes that way in direction,

570
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,540
but every engineering discipline involved,

571
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,380
the role changes.

572
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,140
And we're starting to see the PM role,

573
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,700
the program manager role at Microsoft begin to change.

574
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,360
I think it's gonna begin to change very rapidly,

575
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,400
almost what you call an overhaul of the role

576
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,520
as part of the system.

577
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,920
Ideally, all these things would move at once,

578
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,320
but any of you familiar with systems thinking,

579
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,080
no, it's really difficult to get all the pieces

580
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,360
to move at once in the right direction.

581
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,600
You can get all the pieces to move at once

582
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,360
in the right direction.

583
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,100
If you do it one step at a time,

584
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,960
what I'm seeing happening is we're changing one piece

585
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,540
all the way to where we wanna go.

586
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,960
And the other pieces aren't changing.

587
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,920
And to me, I'm bringing back the sausage metaphor.

588
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,280
It's like we decided the sausages aren't good enough,

589
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,650
we're gonna start making calzones.

590
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,720
And so we got one team manufacturing calzone cranks

591
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,000
and everyone else is still over there

592
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,850
trying to figure out how I stuff sausage meat

593
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,450
into a calzone crank.

594
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,330
Yeah, and what I've seen, and to be clear,

595
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,570
I'm bullish on Microsoft.

596
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,610
I see from Sotis leadership,

597
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,210
he knows exactly what kind of, it seems to be,

598
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:47,000
he seems to know what kind of food factory

599
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,240
he wants to build.

600
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,920
And it's a challenge for him as well.

601
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,260
He has to get his leaders,

602
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,780
people that have been at Microsoft a long time,

603
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,920
making sausage.

604
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,120
And he used to say, look, maybe sausage

605
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,000
isn't the right thing to make.

606
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,640
Let's make a boogie base.

607
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,760
Like, I don't know, man,

608
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,720
can I make that with a crank?

609
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,080
Cause I know how to use the crank.

610
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,240
This requires pots and fish and shelling and things.

611
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,560
And skills I'm not comfortable with.

612
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,200
I don't know how to make broth with a crank.

613
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,000
Yeah, exactly.

614
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,840
What do I put in?

615
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,920
Do I put in pork, beef, come on.

616
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,120
Yeah, so my limited exposure to the Satya,

617
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,360
my perception of what he's doing,

618
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,360
is he's actively paying attention to those teams

619
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:31,080
that have figured out a process

620
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,080
that helps rapidly convert the culture.

621
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,310
Yeah, and one thing, I'll go ahead

622
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,790
and I won't be in trouble, no one listens to this podcast,

623
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,430
but we have three listeners.

624
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,470
No, we have like nine.

625
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:45,430
I think only a couple work at Microsoft

626
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,670
and they won't report me anything,

627
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,190
but he sent a memo around flattening org structures

628
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:52,910
and a bunch of other things.

629
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,750
I thought this is fantastic.

630
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,030
This is gonna help the larger organization I'm in.

631
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:03,030
And one of our engineering leaders sent mail to the org

632
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,790
saying, I read, sure you're all right, Satya's mail.

633
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,710
He says to do this.

634
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,860
We're good, don't need to do that yet.

635
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,700
He said to do this.

636
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,220
We're good, don't need to do that yet.

637
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,660
And it makes sense.

638
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,020
We're in the middle of a,

639
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,660
there's been a lot of change already.

640
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,900
It's a very large org, a lot going on.

641
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,300
It'd be difficult to make it.

642
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,980
On one hand, I understand that,

643
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,260
I understand the logic.

644
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,140
It's like, we've had enough change going on.

645
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,660
This is gonna be very disruptive.

646
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,940
The size of an org,

647
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,820
very difficult to make some of these changes now.

648
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,660
So I think those will happen later.

649
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,940
But my druthers would be, let's do it now.

650
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,780
Let's make it happen

651
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,700
because I know about the efficiencies it would bring.

652
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,060
I've seen the inefficiencies that are caused

653
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:50,300
by a very squished, heavy, heavy middle management layer

654
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,540
and organizational structure.

655
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,900
And I would love to see that go away.

656
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,040
My problem with, anytime I see a messaging like that

657
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:03,290
around later, the opportunity later in one aspect

658
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,810
is beneficial, right?

659
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:09,810
Because you have an opportunity to then stepwise progress

660
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:12,130
towards making later happen

661
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,970
and you can hit the ground running.

662
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,360
But no one ever executes it that way.

663
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,160
It basically ends up, in my experience,

664
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,840
it ends up being a deferral tactic.

665
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,720
And it gets deferred, deferred, deferred, deferred

666
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,640
until it can't be anymore.

667
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,640
And then it's the ripping of the band-aid

668
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,440
in a way where the band-aid yanks the person's arm off.

669
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,880
There's so much dysfunction that you could have,

670
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
dysfunction and pain that you could have mitigated

671
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,010
by leveraging later.

672
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,810
Yeah, we'll see what happens.

673
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,800
I do think, so I do think anybody who thinks

674
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,880
engineering flattening is done is wrong.

675
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,720
Oh, definitely.

676
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,560
Definitely.

677
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,440
Anybody who thinks PM is safe is wrong.

678
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,280
Matter of fact, I think PM's up next.

679
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,360
And I think we're gonna see, my prediction here

680
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,550
is we're gonna see the PM ratios impact PM by 50%.

681
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:25,730
50% of the PM's will be looking for a new way to add value.

682
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,970
And I do think the high order bit for those PM's

683
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,650
are gonna be the ones who have successfully

684
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,050
and proactively figured out how to use

685
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,210
the new data-driven engineering culture

686
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:43,490
to differentiate themselves from their peers

687
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,260
in a way that adds business side.

688
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,020
Hey, we are getting low on time.

689
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,380
This is one of the things I wanted to talk about today.

690
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:56,380
Did you see on the news the iOS update?

691
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,860
I have not.

692
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:03,020
So what happened was iOS did an update

693
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:07,980
and for some segment of the brand new iPhone 6 phones

694
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,330
caused cellular to stop working.

695
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,610
Oops.

696
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,690
Being a Microsoft guy, fantastic.

697
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,770
They should ship more of those.

698
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:17,730
So it's interesting.

699
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,050
Every time, what I find interesting is that

700
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,190
almost every time there's some major bug,

701
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,750
I see some tester pop on Twitter or 50 of them go,

702
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,760
oh, maybe a testing problem at Apple.

703
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,000
When healthcare.gov came out,

704
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,560
actually, these are two with their issues.

705
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,000
Like, oh, maybe they should have tested more.

706
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,880
No, that was a software engineering problem.

707
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,120
So let's talk just for a second about,

708
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,480
so if you shipped a bug that-

709
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,080
Subjective bias.

710
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,760
Enough users that it would hurt.

711
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,920
I have my own answer.

712
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,960
I'll see if it matches with yours.

713
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,560
But if you were an engineering director at Apple

714
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,960
and you had this new update rolling out,

715
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,960
what do you think you may have done differently

716
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,330
to have avoided a bug like this?

717
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:07,410
So did it happen across the board?

718
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,130
No, it did not happen across the board.

719
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:11,490
And that's very important to mention

720
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,210
because I see the comments from the people that don't read

721
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:18,010
or something saying, well, they obviously didn't test this

722
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,610
because it wrecked phones, but didn't.

723
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,330
It was some, but many.

724
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,650
And did it wreck phones?

725
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,770
No, no.

726
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,490
People could go into iTunes, into a restore.

727
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,730
They'd lose some stuff,

728
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,450
but they'd get back to their factory settings

729
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,850
and then not update.

730
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,410
Apple ended up pulling the update.

731
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,850
And I think they have,

732
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:39,410
I haven't paid attention since the issue came out.

733
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,970
But anyway, I think it's all okay now,

734
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,250
but you had an update that broke cellular

735
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:49,920
on a significant number of your brand new phones.

736
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,800
All right, so here's a couple things.

737
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,160
So Apple, they have a product people love

738
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,960
and is all over the world.

739
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,600
In terms of risk, there's a non-trivial chance

740
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,560
that if you do make a mistake

741
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,160
because the product in general is loved,

742
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,280
that the majority of the audience will still bounce back.

743
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:20,000
Like there isn't, with Apple, because it's a love product,

744
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,240
although I haven't paid much attention

745
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,440
to Android and Samsung.

746
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,960
Those are climbing dramatically.

747
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,370
In addition to that,

748
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,010
like the one thing I'm thinking through,

749
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:36,370
my normal practice would be, you know what?

750
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,170
Do some due diligence proactively.

751
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,850
You should have some bed of machines.

752
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,650
This isn't like creating the end all be all system test lab

753
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,770
that you and I are used to from the old days.

754
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:50,610
I don't wanna do that.

755
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,170
In fact, I'm gonna interrupt.

756
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,410
I think this is a perfect example

757
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,520
of where flighting circles are being able to deploy,

758
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,840
that was the next thing.

759
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,680
I do think-

760
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I think that's the key to this

761
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,280
because you wanna deploy this new update.

762
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,970
You're not gonna deploy, can't take any update

763
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,450
when you have enough diverse ecosystem of carriers, et cetera,

764
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,210
and deploy it to the world at the same time.

765
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,130
What I'm saying is that before it goes out,

766
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,530
there is some small element of preventative testing

767
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,370
that you should do.

768
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,450
Absolutely, and they obviously did that.

769
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,650
Most obviously did-

770
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,730
If they didn't, they'd see them on them, right?

771
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,450
Because there's a complexity around the options

772
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,610
and different providers,

773
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,490
and I'm certain that they get hardware

774
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,490
from different places.

775
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,370
I know they had tight controls on their hardware,

776
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,090
but flight control is the answer here.

777
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,530
Absolutely, it's like we deployed this

778
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,050
to 1% of our users and you look across the board

779
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,450
because this is not just for iPhone 6,

780
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,650
this is for some previous versions as well, the update.

781
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,650
Hey, there is a percentage of our iPhone 6 clients

782
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,770
that we've sent the update to,

783
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:03,450
and they've never sent a phone home after that.

784
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,290
The only challenge with this strategy,

785
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:08,050
the only challenge, this is why I brought up

786
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,330
Apple's domination in the customer love world,

787
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:13,770
for lack of a better word,

788
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,970
is even with the flight control,

789
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,210
even our exposure control with the flighting

790
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,050
of these updates,

791
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,080
if it hits a couple people,

792
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,560
if you did it right, it will be affected, right?

793
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,520
And it's gonna be a challenge to figure out

794
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,040
how to turn the crank and turn it back.

795
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,000
But the question is, if you don't do it accurately,

796
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,480
and when people get impacted,

797
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,120
is it a case that even two people in Apple

798
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,240
hitting this issue will be a PR nightmare for them?

799
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,720
I wanna be really clear in bringing this up

800
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,760
because I get annoyed when I see people do this

801
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,320
elsewhere on the internet, is I don't work there.

802
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,000
I don't, you know, it's completely possible

803
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,640
that they did all this and they just couldn't recognize it

804
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,360
in the analysis of the data.

805
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,760
So this is, it's like armchair software engineer

806
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,880
is a lot, is very easy.

807
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,400
Thought it was a worthy topic of discussion.

808
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,280
But the thing that I would love

809
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,960
if I were engineering director,

810
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,450
like the thing that I would try to do,

811
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:23,580
is how can I do seamless continuous updates

812
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,140
with an exposure control?

813
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,460
Because a lot of these problems happen

814
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,460
because they changed so much

815
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,820
that you really don't know cause and effect along with them.

816
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,340
It ends up being another systems issue

817
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,980
because there's carriers that say,

818
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,860
no, we only want updates at this frequency.

819
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,380
And the way carriers, with their radio stack,

820
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,680
there can be a lot of different things can go on.

821
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,880
So it's, anyway, it's interesting to talk about,

822
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,680
but I'm always blown away every time

823
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,160
there's a public bug of any company,

824
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,400
you know, it always comes out,

825
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,400
what bothers me is that a lot of people think,

826
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,920
what was the testing issue?

827
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,720
And maybe this one was, but quality issues aren't,

828
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,680
or frequently, or most often not an issue of testing.

829
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,760
The people we hang out with,

830
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,480
or the community we're associated with,

831
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,920
right, a lot of those guys are gonna go,

832
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,200
it's a testing issue,

833
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,800
as an, primarily, cause we still live in a world

834
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,840
where they're trying to create arguments

835
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,040
for why the old ways are the better ways.

836
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,560
Right, and it's time to move on, actually.

837
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,520
And if that's true, like,

838
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,680
Apple had a major update issue,

839
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,750
what, three years ago?

840
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,860
Where they were brick and phones?

841
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,800
Like, why didn't they change their process?

842
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,240
I mean, they probably have, but it'd be interesting.

843
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,360
I wonder if they have an exposure control program.

844
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Yeah, again, our armchair software engineering is easy.

845
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,840
Doing it from our seats here, we'll figure it out.

846
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,880
Great, I'm gonna, I'll get back to the mail bag next week,

847
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,720
cause we're about out of time,

848
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
and someone's gonna come in here

849
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,920
and give us a dirty look.

850
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,760
Yes.

851
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,000
So, it's good to be back, I'll say that,

852
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,800
and thanks for listening this far,

853
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,120
and I'm Alan.

854
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:07,960
I'm Brad.

855
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,360
And we'll talk to you soon.

856
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,200
Yep, see ya.
