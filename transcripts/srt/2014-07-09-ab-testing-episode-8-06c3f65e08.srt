1
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,230
Hey everybody, I'm Alan.

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,070
And I'm Brent.

3
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,270
And we're here for episode, are we on,

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,390
what number are we on, Snowman?

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,230
Eight, I think.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:26,020
Eight, I call that number Snowman.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:26,860
I understand.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,380
All right, when I used to golf a long time ago,

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,880
when I was younger and stupider

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,560
and had way more free time,

11
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,660
and every time I got an eight on a hole,

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,620
instead of crying or feeling bad,

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,060
I just called it a snowman and I felt good.

14
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,480
Random Alan Trivia.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,160
I have nothing to say to this.

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,720
Random, random, random, random.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,080
All right, so, you ready to get going?

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:47,920
I am.

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,400
Well, let's look at the agenda for today.

20
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,480
We have a bunch of stuff,

21
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,280
or maybe not much at all, we'll find out.

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,360
In our last podcast, I cut Brent off

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,200
because I didn't want to hear about his IRR thing.

24
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,000
But this week, maybe I want to hear more about it.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,840
So I thought we'd just start off

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,200
and let him finish his thoughts on there

27
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,250
while we are guaranteed to have some time.

28
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,330
So one of the problems,

29
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,890
let me start off with the problem.

30
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,740
As we move into this new world,

31
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:23,100
one of the issues that people are facing

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,860
is we have this new review model

33
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,500
where we're kind of judged on three different things.

34
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,900
One is how awesome we are individually,

35
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,260
how awesome we were at listening

36
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:37,820
and incorporating other people's ideas,

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,380
and then how awesome we were around taking our ideas

38
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,940
and helping others with them.

39
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,060
And we, me, as of course, Microsoft,

40
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,820
and I wonder how much, is that the HR guidance?

41
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,220
It is. Those things.

42
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,100
Well, maybe with a little less awesome.

43
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,540
Little less awesome sauce.

44
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,620
I haven't heard that as much.

45
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:00,980
I wonder if it's as transparent

46
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,580
or as clear across the company.

47
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,860
Just a side little editorial comment.

48
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,500
Just with the people that I've talked to.

49
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,300
You saw from my values a couple podcasts ago

50
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,420
that when we talked about those,

51
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,220
is I'm really big into transparency

52
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,100
and let people know exactly what you care about.

53
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,620
And I think if we could get, that's the right mix.

54
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,580
We get that into everybody's head

55
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,340
and they kind of get it, the right things will happen.

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,380
Because in the past, as you know,

57
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,700
it was all about being, the rewards

58
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,380
was all about being awesome yourself,

59
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,700
no matter who you crapped on along the way.

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,880
Right.

61
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,680
And as long as that awesomeness you did

62
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
was something that management remembered.

63
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,740
Peak in May, he used to be.

64
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,460
Right. That was exactly right.

65
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,580
So Alan and I have talked about one thing

66
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,690
that one of our big competitors do.

67
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,250
And that is every week on Friday,

68
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,460
everybody in the company writes a status report

69
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,820
that gets submitted into this giant index

70
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,020
that anyone can read.

71
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,770
So it, it, it.

72
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,490
Not only can anyone read, but it's searchable.

73
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,330
Right.

74
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,810
I wonder if anybody else is stuck on this same,

75
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,210
you know, linked to SQL issue that I am.

76
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,770
I mean, and here, here's four people working on this.

77
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,930
Oh, cool.

78
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,290
And so what, one of the things that that does

79
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,530
is it really makes it easy for people

80
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,410
to find other people who have similar passions.

81
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,450
So if there's something, so Alan mentioned a problem,

82
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,330
but let's say there's something big.

83
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,360
I want to create a small little niche book site.

84
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,360
I wonder if anyone else in the company

85
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,880
might be interested in working with me.

86
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,160
He gives me the ability to kind of search through that index

87
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,120
and then find a name that I could reach out to.

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
Okay.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now, one of the, one of the things that I realized

90
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,080
very recently, because my strategy to try to influence

91
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,360
this company to do something similar

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,140
was basically talking to any and everybody that would listen.

93
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,950
And then I realized just a couple of weeks ago,

94
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,790
wait a minute, we already probably have that asset.

95
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,500
Just no one's using it in that way.

96
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,020
I will start.

97
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,860
This is where-

98
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,140
Trailblazer Brent.

99
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,100
That's right.

100
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,380
This is where the IRR idea came from.

101
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:27,380
What it stands for is an individual retrospective report.

102
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,500
Okay.

103
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,900
And then I just communicated it with my team.

104
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,620
Give me a moment to ponder.

105
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,460
The name sucks.

106
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,260
But what I'm trying to do is this is something

107
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,780
that I want every week and it is not a status report.

108
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,820
Do you go to them and go, yeah,

109
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,140
we're gonna need your IRR report.

110
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,100
Yeah.

111
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,180
Yeah.

112
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,500
And if you could bring some donuts on the way

113
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
and that'd be great.

114
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah.

115
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,140
I don't know about our four or five.

116
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,820
How many listeners do we think we have now?

117
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,940
I think we lost a couple.

118
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,020
Anyway, go on.

119
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,300
Yeah.

120
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,620
I just don't do passive aggressive very well.

121
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:17,980
It's not, not winding back to a nutshell.

122
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,170
Okay.

123
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,420
The biggest value of our competitor,

124
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,380
putting all their status reports

125
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,560
into the central store that's searchable.

126
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,480
When you mentioned status reports at this company,

127
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,600
what it generally means, it's pain, bureaucracy,

128
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,360
and some jerk wads somewhere is trying to use this

129
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,600
to create a paper trail so that they can hold me accountable

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,200
for things that they don't understand.

131
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,040
Yeah.

132
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,240
I fricking hate status reports.

133
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,920
I had to write, you know, the story like three months ago,

134
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,160
I was interacting with this team

135
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,480
and they wanted everyone to write on this sort of

136
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,960
virtual team to write status reports.

137
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,480
So people would write pages.

138
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,670
I would write two bullet points.

139
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,710
Like one of them was.

140
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,030
Done, not done.

141
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,630
The first one I did, one of my accomplishments was,

142
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,950
wrote my first status report in 15 years.

143
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,670
Actually, Alan forwarded that to me.

144
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:16,070
It was a great giggle.

145
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,990
You see why we didn't talk about this last time,

146
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,940
why there wasn't enough time.

147
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,140
There was plenty of time.

148
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,780
I was on a roll at that point in time.

149
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,740
Now I'm, now what are you, now you're like,

150
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,580
I'm like coffee's not working.

151
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,380
You're like a square wheel trying to roll down the hill.

152
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,340
Trying to roll up a hill.

153
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,780
On its own.

154
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,740
An IRR's purpose, and yes it will undergo a name change,

155
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,340
but in the short term it's not a status report.

156
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,380
Go on.

157
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:45,180
Its purpose is to fish.

158
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,660
What I'm trying to do with it,

159
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,660
is make my team easy to find for people who go in search.

160
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,880
And the type of people that I want

161
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
to reduce that friction towards,

162
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
is the ones where they have a solution

163
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,940
for a problem that we're facing,

164
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,540
or we have a solution for a problem they are facing.

165
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,980
I don't have a problem on my team.

166
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,620
My entire team is awesome on individual contribution,

167
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,820
but we do a lot of collaboration,

168
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,340
and we spend a lot of time talking about,

169
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,860
man we know that this expertise exists,

170
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,770
how do we find them?

171
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,930
Well one way to do that is make yourself easy to find.

172
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,370
Yeah I think as a side note,

173
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,330
the editorial comment is,

174
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,530
almost every problem I run into,

175
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,130
I stop and think surely someone has solved this before.

176
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,130
Then the challenge is,

177
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,570
how do I find that right connection?

178
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,890
Especially now I'm not working with a lot of

179
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,010
widely used tools.

180
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,730
Yep.

181
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,850
So right now we will iterate over it,

182
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,930
and when I laid it out to my team,

183
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:01,170
I said I laid down a baseline in terms of the content

184
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,150
I wanted to contain.

185
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,290
Just four items,

186
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,250
it's essentially what sorts of things are you working on?

187
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,110
What problems are you facing

188
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,310
that others might be able to help you with?

189
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:20,090
What sorts of things,

190
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,910
what sort of solutions do you think you've now done

191
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,950
in this last week,

192
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,430
that others might be able to capitalize?

193
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,910
And then are there any critical learnings

194
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,540
for knowledge sharing?

195
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,420
Hey I learned that this is a really bad way

196
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,660
to try to solve this problem.

197
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,310
Things like that.

198
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,590
And that'll be our first baseline,

199
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,670
I told the team.

200
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,790
Have you done one yet?

201
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,630
No.

202
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,470
Oh.

203
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,740
This is all theoretical.

204
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,400
It's all.

205
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,580
Unimplemented.

206
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,760
Not yet fully started.

207
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
The first set.

208
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,160
Half baked idea living in Brent's head.

209
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
No, it's already rolled out to the team.

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,200
All right, it's fully baked.

211
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
It's already rolled out to the team.

212
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
They will start this today.

213
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,760
No, I'm teasing you,

214
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,720
but I like the idea.

215
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,840
And I think as long as you keep it short,

216
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,680
to the point,

217
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,910
it's almost like the stand up.

218
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,490
Let me see if this analogy works.

219
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,550
The status report meeting is to the scrum stand up

220
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,100
as the written status report is to the IRR.

221
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,340
Yes.

222
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,380
Oh, I'm good.

223
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,500
Yes.

224
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,660
So the other thing too is,

225
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,920
I've already told the team,

226
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,800
I don't know what this prize will be,

227
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,300
but we will reward people who figure out

228
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,940
the right format that decreases the time it takes

229
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,190
for people to find us.

230
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,030
Right?

231
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,730
It's, I mentioned it's like fishing.

232
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,710
Well, we got to find the right bait.

233
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,350
We can't just throw empty hooks out.

234
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,750
Probably won't work.

235
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,300
The other thing too is,

236
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,380
I want the team to figure out how to adjust this format

237
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,740
so that anyone can do it within 15 minutes.

238
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,640
It-

239
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,140
I was going to ask how long it should take.

240
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,980
I would,

241
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,300
I would expect it would take less than 15 minutes.

242
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,140
In fact,

243
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,300
Yeah, but you're a brilliant writer.

244
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,260
What you take 15 minutes to do

245
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,700
generally takes me four hours.

246
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,060
The point is,

247
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,220
regardless of the brilliant or non-brilliant

248
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,250
level of the writer,

249
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,770
it doesn't have to be perfect.

250
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,460
It's learning.

251
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,300
It doesn't.

252
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,380
The point is,

253
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,900
if you are good at search foo,

254
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,140
if you are good at typing in,

255
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,540
figuring out,

256
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,620
you have to ask some really crazy question,

257
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,020
finding the right search terms to find,

258
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,980
to get the hit,

259
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,180
you probably are able to write a very good IRR

260
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,320
because what you're trying to write

261
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,970
is what you did in searchable terms.

262
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:50,890
Right?

263
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,730
Don't use big words,

264
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,930
use small words.

265
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,770
Use-

266
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,330
And use-

267
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,570
Well-known-

268
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,210
Well-known words.

269
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,330
World, you're right.

270
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,970
So there's a little bit of an art to it,

271
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,490
but it shouldn't be quick.

272
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,370
You don't want to write Hemingway.

273
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,210
You want,

274
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,850
you're asking for not very many bullet points.

275
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,450
It's for a week, so.

276
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,450
So the,

277
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,290
we're gonna,

278
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,970
we have a public Yammer group already in place.

279
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,570
I'm gonna follow your Yammer group.

280
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,610
Anyone can,

281
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,250
anyone can join it.

282
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,450
I've made it as easy as possible

283
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,070
for people to get aboard.

284
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,940
And the value of this,

285
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,020
at least me and my team,

286
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,340
is not theoretical.

287
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,780
I did a different version of this.

288
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,520
I had a community alias about a year ago,

289
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,480
and I let people join whenever they wanted.

290
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,960
And suddenly people who I had no idea who they were,

291
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,920
started joining.

292
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,100
I'm like,

293
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,620
okay, if they get value out of it,

294
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
knock themselves out.

295
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,100
Was this an email alias?

296
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,420
It was an email distribution.

297
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,980
Did you call it free beer?

298
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,020
No, I called it,

299
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:03,270
it's Power BI telemetry community.

300
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,470
Okay, so it's around.

301
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,630
Anyway, go on.

302
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,470
They worked as a-

303
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,310
People joined.

304
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,150
They did.

305
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,990
You know why?

306
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,790
People are desperate for information.

307
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,430
Because I used the T word.

308
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,270
The T word.

309
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,310
Software design engineering telemetry.

310
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:19,900
Yeah, it means everything and nothing right now.

311
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,260
Within,

312
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,900
once that event's out occurring,

313
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,660
people who I didn't know who they were,

314
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,500
started joining.

315
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,340
Within three weeks,

316
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,060
I got an email from a guy.

317
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,980
Hey, it seems like you're beginning to work on this problem.

318
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,580
Were you aware that me and my team

319
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:40,430
already have a fully operationalized data warehouse

320
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,530
for that exact problem?

321
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,440
To which I respond,

322
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,780
no, I was not.

323
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,940
When shall we meet?

324
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,180
And that ended up being a great partnership.

325
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,500
And it shrunk easily four months off of my schedule.

326
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,310
Yeah, I think one way to find that often,

327
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:03,310
because we don't have a good way of discovering

328
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,910
what we don't know, we don't know,

329
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,590
or what other people are doing right now,

330
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,430
I think often the best way,

331
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,430
at least in my experience,

332
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,270
at our company,

333
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,550
the best way to find out if someone else

334
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,850
is working on a particular project or item or a problem

335
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,690
is to say that you are working on solving

336
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:23,650
that particular problem or project.

337
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,290
And then the person who's,

338
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,210
people that are also working on it

339
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,740
will pop out of the woodwork.

340
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,090
Yes.

341
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,090
It's just funny.

342
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,710
There's got to be a better way.

343
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,630
So a lot of people,

344
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,950
what they try to do is

345
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,870
try to solve this problem proactively.

346
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,910
I'm gonna have,

347
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,230
Alan, you are now,

348
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,670
whether or not you are an expert,

349
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,230
you are now the expert on

350
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,560
natural language programming.

351
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,400
We're all doomed.

352
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,780
Just so that everyone,

353
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,060
so that I can send a mail out to the whole world

354
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,620
and let everyone know,

355
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,100
Alan is now the expert.

356
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,860
He will take care of all of these questions.

357
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,460
That doesn't help.

358
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,900
Really what I'm trying to do is say,

359
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,940
hey, proactive is one aspect,

360
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,300
but how do I shrink reactive?

361
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,420
I know I'm struggling with finding people.

362
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,740
I know Alan has this problem now and again.

363
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,660
Alan has a fantastic people network

364
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,940
and a lot of people know this and leverage it.

365
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,070
I think we've talked before.

366
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,750
I have a half written Think Week paper.

367
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,510
I never finished it.

368
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,070
I didn't know where it is anymore.

369
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,630
Gosh, I might have lost it in a hard drive crash,

370
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,030
but I've called on this concept of,

371
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,020
if only Microsoft knew what Microsoft knew.

372
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,860
Right.

373
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,140
So I like the IRR idea because I think it's a great,

374
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,420
it's a method for discovering

375
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,500
what you don't know, you don't know,

376
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,180
for discovering, for making those connections.

377
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,540
What, when Steven Johnson,

378
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,940
author talks about where good ideas come from.

379
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,260
One of the things it needs is a network.

380
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,140
You need great ideas or most often

381
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,420
a connection between other ideas.

382
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,540
And those ideas need a real network

383
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,180
to swim in and define connections.

384
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,940
So anything that provides that network,

385
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,900
whether it's searchable terms,

386
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,690
sorry, I was thinking through Yammer,

387
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,090
how do you filter through,

388
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,130
I guess if you're just searching that one group,

389
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,690
I don't know, I'd figure how to use Yammer

390
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,570
for this technology, but for a company wide thing.

391
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,410
You just go to the top and you hit search.

392
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:31,890
I know, but there's so much other,

393
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,170
there's technical groups and there's social groups on Yammer

394
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,810
and I'll have to see how search works

395
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,010
and I want to look for.

396
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,130
So one question,

397
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,130
because Alan is a much better Yammer-er than I,

398
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,330
so you said you're gonna join my group.

399
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:53,470
Do you know, I didn't give you the name,

400
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,550
does that block you?

401
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,030
I could search for,

402
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,150
what I can do is I can search for you

403
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,190
and see what groups you're in.

404
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,830
I could probably guess which one it is,

405
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,590
but really I was probably just gonna email you

406
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,870
to ask you for the name.

407
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,830
No, I was hoping that you had an out,

408
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,390
your former algorithm would be there.

409
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,190
Because again, if I have this,

410
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,910
if I have this obtuse name

411
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,510
that doesn't necessarily align,

412
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,030
then people are gonna, it'll be hard.

413
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,310
Certainly they'll associate with me.

414
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,430
My search foo is not bad.

415
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,350
I would probably try IRR,

416
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,670
see if that shows up.

417
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,470
I don't remember what it stands for, infrared something.

418
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,030
When that didn't work,

419
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,110
I would probably just search for you

420
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,190
and see what groups you're in.

421
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,470
Okay, good.

422
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,070
Yeah, the company is a-

423
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,830
A sufficient measure or a method exists

424
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,790
for which people can find out what they don't know.

425
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,630
Yes, yeah.

426
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:44,470
It's funny.

427
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,630
I'm sure a lot of companies are the same way,

428
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,950
but well Yammer is, it's funny.

429
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:53,270
Our company is in love with email.

430
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,550
Yes.

431
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,950
It's hard for them to get out.

432
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:58,270
So we have Yammer, they're part of Microsoft now,

433
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,750
and we're using Yammer internally.

434
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,710
And some people are into it,

435
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:03,950
but for a lot of people just haven't,

436
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,430
it's just not there yet.

437
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,910
I hate email and I worked on the email team.

438
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm trying.

439
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,750
And now that we're part of this larger organization,

440
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:17,630
the operating systems group, even more so.

441
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,990
And it's not that phone calls can be intrusive.

442
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,230
It sounds like you need to walk to my office every time,

443
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,390
but I don't think people realize how much

444
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,510
what a black hole discussion lists are

445
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:33,830
for sharing information, email discussion lists.

446
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,670
Yeah.

447
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,630
You don't have threaded,

448
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,870
well you have threaded conversation, but it's lost.

449
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:41,190
If I join, if this was a distribution list,

450
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,510
I could put all your emails into a folder

451
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,070
and search from that folder, it'd be great.

452
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,030
But if I join it late, I can't find any of that stuff.

453
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,340
I can't make those connections.

454
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,340
And if there's a reply to one, that gets lost too.

455
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,780
There's a degree of persistence missing.

456
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,180
Yeah, I was talking to someone who's working

457
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,620
with the Yammer team on something

458
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,900
and they were frustrated because

459
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,820
they will not respond to email.

460
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,820
If I want to get a response,

461
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,620
I have to send something to them on Yammer.

462
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,460
Great.

463
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,300
And they were frustrated.

464
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,740
I thought, well, doesn't that make sense?

465
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,580
Come on.

466
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,530
So that's a hard,

467
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,130
I don't know what it is.

468
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,690
Maybe it's because I have a thirst

469
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,850
for discovering what I don't know, I don't know.

470
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,170
Where I want to, I would prefer to use Yammer

471
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:28,170
or some sort of archivable, social,

472
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,610
discoverable, open, public, transparent group

473
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,490
for discussing and figuring out my problems than email.

474
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,810
In fact, I just solved this huge problem this week

475
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:40,770
in some work I'm doing and it's all an email.

476
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,170
There's no way, you know,

477
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,210
we document it for our team in our OneNote,

478
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,570
but when some other team, and I guarantee you,

479
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,730
some other team will run into the same problems

480
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,730
I had to solve this week,

481
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,080
they have no way of discovering the solution.

482
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah, well, they do have a way,

483
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,560
but it's gonna rely a lot on magic and hope.

484
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,280
Right?

485
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,800
If for some reason someone has the idea

486
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,960
that connects that person's network to yours somehow,

487
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,800
then there's a chance they could do it.

488
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,640
Yeah, we have an archive.

489
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,760
My problem with email right now

490
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,520
is the signal to noise ratio is just awful.

491
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,520
It is, and email is a very good medium

492
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,080
for sharing announcements, it's information sharing.

493
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,440
It's not a great, email is not a great,

494
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,840
for a corporation, not a great discussion mechanism.

495
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,320
It is information sharing, not knowledge sharing.

496
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,040
I like that.

497
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,720
So we got a new boss,

498
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,640
and one of the things that I think is fantastic

499
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,200
about this guy, he has done now three different slide decks,

500
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,480
and one of the things he talks about is-

501
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Wait, the other thing we do too much besides email

502
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,920
is PowerPoint, but go on.

503
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,720
No, no, PowerPoint is fine.

504
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,560
No, no.

505
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,600
What we need is more,

506
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,640
we need more communication and less babbling.

507
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,240
I'll let you, now I will rant on PowerPoint

508
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,720
for one second and go back to your manager.

509
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,640
So we are so addicted to it that I review,

510
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,480
I'm one of the reviewers for Think Week papers every year.

511
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,720
Which are internal papers,

512
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,440
people trying to write about their great ideas.

513
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,320
Every year there's at least one or two yahoos

514
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,080
who submit their Think Week paper

515
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,360
as a PowerPoint slide deck.

516
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,200
Sweet.

517
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,900
Guess what rating they get from me.

518
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,980
It's the same number of fingers I hold up to Brent

519
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,200
when I'm mad at him.

520
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,200
All right, onto your boss.

521
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,420
Yeah, I know how I'm gonna post my next one then.

522
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,570
All right, anyway, one of the things

523
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,930
that's really cool about him

524
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:44,210
is now in three different slide decks,

525
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,050
he talks about Google Alerts.

526
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:47,930
And I think it's cool

527
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,570
because he talks about our competitor

528
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,130
and what they're doing awesome.

529
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,810
And he subscribes to Google Alerts.

530
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,150
And what Google Alerts does

531
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,470
is it gives him a sort of an intelligent agent

532
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,170
sitting back behind the scenes

533
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,130
and he's able to customize and say,

534
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,220
hey, these are the sorts of things I care about.

535
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,620
Let me know when something that I care about

536
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:14,180
pops up and make everything else go away.

537
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,970
And I would love to be able to do that with email.

538
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,370
Tell me what I care about or should care about

539
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,380
and make everything else go someplace else.

540
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,740
I used to have a rule, in fact, I still have a rule.

541
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,980
A rule suck.

542
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,940
Well, I have a rule where only mail

543
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,900
or I'm on the tour CC line comes to my inbox.

544
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,900
But even with that, these days,

545
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,980
single to noise ratio is awful.

546
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,520
Well, yeah, because people will start off sending,

547
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,040
well, Alan needs to know about the noise level

548
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,840
or this monitor thingy

549
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,400
or the fact that his test case suite is...

550
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,360
Not so much.

551
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,200
None of this.

552
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,360
Somebody else decided that you need to know this.

553
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,720
And then they very quickly realized

554
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,840
that you're ignoring the announcement to the DL.

555
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,310
And so start putting the DL plus Alan Page next to it.

556
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,430
Right?

557
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,270
I hate that.

558
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,050
It's no, Alan needs this information.

559
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,140
And I will work through his wall of whatever.

560
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,840
Anyway, manager slide deck.

561
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,020
What's going on with your new boss?

562
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,900
No, the whole point was talking about Google alerts.

563
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,300
My new boss is completely awesome.

564
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,260
I am just...

565
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,980
He must listen to the podcast.

566
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,820
I don't think so.

567
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,660
Not yet.

568
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,500
Not yet.

569
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,910
Yeah.

570
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,980
I am just a tad shy of just blatant hero worship.

571
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,940
This guy's awesome.

572
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,940
All right, yeah, we'll talk about him more later.

573
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,220
Give me names and stuff.

574
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,680
All right.

575
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,560
I read a blog post this week.

576
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,840
It was said there's no such thing as agile testing,

577
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,800
which yeah, makes, I mean, there's, to me,

578
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,160
it's all just testing.

579
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,120
The post was talking about sort of what does the tester do

580
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,960
on the agile team?

581
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,360
And I want to talk about the post

582
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,000
because I thought the premise of the post was good.

583
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,300
I didn't, I thought the arguments the author made

584
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,000
were totally off the wall.

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,120
What primary argument?

586
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
It was a lot of hearsay.

587
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,080
But it made me think in relationship to we're talking

588
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,800
about with more and more teams moving

589
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,400
to being engineering teams, you know,

590
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,800
whether they're agile or not.

591
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,800
And agile is this label that means now means 850,000

592
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,640
different things.

593
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,240
So on an engineering team of generalizing specialists

594
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,440
or specializing generalists or specializing specialists,

595
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,840
maybe not the third one.

596
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,780
Well, it's going to start up.

597
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:42,460
So generally when I see agile testing,

598
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,640
it's when I've seen that deployed,

599
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,560
it's basically a group of specialists trying

600
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,400
to work together.

601
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,240
All right.

602
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,360
So let's reiterate one thing we've talked about before

603
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,310
is that if you try and make an engineering team,

604
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,630
you know, a team of, you know what I mean,

605
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,470
engineering team.

606
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,710
So it's titleless people.

607
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,370
If you expect everyone to do everything soup to nuts,

608
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,210
you're screwed.

609
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:08,490
You're totally screwed.

610
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,490
So that doesn't work that way.

611
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,770
You're going to have specialists.

612
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:14,330
So what is the role or what are some examples,

613
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,250
nothing about mine as well,

614
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,930
but I want to hear your answer first.

615
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,930
What are some examples of the test specialist role

616
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,290
on an engineering team?

617
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,010
So first and foremost,

618
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,820
I am very much against that idea in the first place.

619
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,800
Against having a test specialist?

620
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,980
Uh, yeah.

621
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,820
Talk about that.

622
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,260
And I'll argue with you.

623
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,280
I think I've talked about before that when I first went

624
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:55,430
into development, that I had a mix of folks.

625
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:03,630
Some came from more of a dev centric specialization

626
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,820
and some came more from a test centric specialization.

627
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,120
And when I started off, I'm like,

628
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,200
I will have none of that.

629
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,600
Everyone's going to work together and solve

630
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,040
the same problems.

631
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,040
And I viewed coding and testing as skill sets, not roles.

632
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:29,870
The team we talked about before where the team really

633
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:33,160
started to click with that.

634
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,160
And as they started getting better and better,

635
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,680
what we found is when I first put down and say,

636
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,440
everyone tests their own stuff.

637
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,400
What I found just in summation is that the code got better,

638
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,600
became a lot more modular.

639
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,520
We found less bugs slipping through the cracks.

640
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,520
And it became more modular because writing complex code

641
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,400
is a pain in the ass to test.

642
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,600
And once I said, go ahead, write complex code,

643
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,080
but you're testing it.

644
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,040
And then when I started harassing them about why

645
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,680
the hell is this thing that we estimated for two days

646
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,920
is taking three weeks, right?

647
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,480
It basically ended up forcing them to modularize

648
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,000
and make it easier to test and easier to validate.

649
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,660
But that same process of modularization ended up

650
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,980
making it easier for us to add new features

651
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,300
to the product.

652
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,020
I'm all on board there.

653
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,900
Well, so the punchline is once the team clicked

654
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,940
and was really going through high throughput,

655
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,490
I then started asking myself, at what point in time

656
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,590
would I hire a tester to augment this team?

657
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,410
And quite honestly, I really struggled with that.

658
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,810
I still don't have an answer that I'm very happy with.

659
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,130
So let me answer it.

660
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:54,970
So I'm all on the board.

661
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,290
I think there is no, on an engineering team,

662
00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,690
there is no role for a functional test specialist.

663
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,050
So I think, absolutely.

664
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,360
I think the huge benefit of someone writing tests

665
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,240
for their own code is they end up writing better code

666
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,160
because they realize, oh shit, my code can't be tested.

667
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,480
So that's great.

668
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,320
But what I would hire a tester for is I need someone,

669
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,160
how do I evaluate this thing end to end?

670
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,840
Maybe through instrumentation, maybe through analysis,

671
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,000
maybe a data job.

672
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,360
Who's the person to figure out,

673
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,800
how am I gonna make sure we do adequate load testing on this?

674
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,440
Or looking at some of the, we call the NFRs,

675
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,880
the non-functional things.

676
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,640
Those are things where I see

677
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,280
where a test specialist fits in there.

678
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,760
Because I think the people from the old test role

679
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,800
who are good, are good systems thinkers,

680
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,680
they can look at the thing and figure out

681
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,320
where the holes are.

682
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,200
They're also process improvers.

683
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,640
And again, this is weird, because it's not really,

684
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,400
I'll talk about what I'm doing right now,

685
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,050
which is not at all testing, but it's valuable.

686
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:56,890
I'll get to it in a moment.

687
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,450
But I think what the test role is,

688
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,730
is not really a test role.

689
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:04,010
It's a engineering productivity,

690
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,490
and maybe a quality role.

691
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,690
There's some gaps that the person who's,

692
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,690
I'm developing the code, I'm running my test for it.

693
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,170
They may not be as good at thinking about,

694
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,690
now how does this fit into the whole system,

695
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,410
not architecturally, but how,

696
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,410
what does the threat model or security look like?

697
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:21,930
Maybe I have some expertise there.

698
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,450
There's a bunch of little gaps

699
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:26,290
that I think need to be filled in,

700
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,930
that may not be able to be filled in

701
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:30,450
by the traditional software developer.

702
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,890
So, couple of things there.

703
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,410
First off, when I first went into dev,

704
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,210
my team was around six, seven people.

705
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,070
And that sort of specialization,

706
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,360
there's really not an ROI for bringing in,

707
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,160
on that team, that small.

708
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,200
There's no economy of scale there.

709
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,320
The second thing is,

710
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,960
but we still had this integration problem.

711
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,880
And what we ended up doing very dynamically,

712
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,120
we ended up creating sort of a monitoring site

713
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,760
that allowed anybody on the team,

714
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,160
whether or not they had written that component,

715
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,480
to very quickly visualize

716
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,040
how the system was operating end to end.

717
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,960
And we got actually very good at,

718
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,040
one person within 30 minutes could figure out,

719
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,220
hey, our customer value proposition,

720
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,160
what we own end to end,

721
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:29,080
is in the weeds and it's because of this right here.

722
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,660
Yeah, I think on a larger team,

723
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,400
you're gonna find more need

724
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,800
for some of those specializations.

725
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,320
And for example, and I wanna.

726
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,320
So actually, and I agree,

727
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,480
but your question was,

728
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,440
what's the role on an agile team?

729
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,280
No, no, that wasn't really.

730
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,800
Not necessarily on an agile organization.

731
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,160
That was the inspiration for it.

732
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,520
I say, what's the role of a test specialist

733
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,560
on an engineering team?

734
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,800
So what I think actually,

735
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,640
I don't think they're test specialists.

736
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,740
I think that is a team,

737
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,700
a specialized team of these same engineers

738
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:04,150
who are focused on solving that security problem

739
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,030
or that performance problem.

740
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,690
They are, the one thing that they,

741
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:12,090
as a whole have in common,

742
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,110
is deep knowledge on this area of expertise.

743
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:18,610
And what I have found to be the most valuable

744
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,110
is what they do is they figure out

745
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,510
how to automate that expertise so that the other teams.

746
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,950
I think a lot of people worry that,

747
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,670
well, I don't know what to do on this team.

748
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,670
I have these areas of expertise.

749
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,030
I think there are,

750
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,550
I don't think we need nearly as many test specialists

751
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,990
as we have today, these large test teams.

752
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,550
But I think some of the attributes,

753
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,430
I'll give you my example in a second.

754
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,090
Some of the attributes of things

755
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,750
that make people good testers are very valuable

756
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,700
as a, almost a generalization to the team.

757
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,570
My superpower, if I were to probably have any of my last,

758
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,770
several managers describe it,

759
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:00,130
is I just can figure out how stuff works.

760
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,210
I can figure things out,

761
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,410
even if they're kind of outside of my wheelhouse.

762
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:05,910
So because I'm leaving on sabbatical,

763
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,130
coming up here a while, I wanted to take on,

764
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,890
but I wanted to have some work to do

765
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,890
that would have an end date that would,

766
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:14,730
but wouldn't be critical path.

767
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,330
So I've been working on a lot of work

768
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,360
getting our Git repositories moved to Visual Studio Online

769
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,580
and getting builds working

770
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,780
and on-prem build controllers

771
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,640
and learning all kinds of crazy stuff.

772
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,300
And the biggest one finally solved this morning

773
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,700
was the coordination of active directory credentials

774
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,340
with online credentials.

775
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,740
So anyway, some interesting things

776
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,820
and everything's working great now.

777
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,660
So we're gonna be ready to migrate before I go.

778
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,820
So I'm pretty happy.

779
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,940
But is that testing not even close?

780
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,340
But is it, did I learn a bunch of new stuff

781
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,380
and that I provide value to the team?

782
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,220
Sure, and that's my role.

783
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,380
So it's definitely not a test specialist role.

784
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,580
That's a very generalist role.

785
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,180
I was able to expand my field of knowledge

786
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,160
and learn some new things.

787
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,100
I think there are roles for people who...

788
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,160
I don't, so I actually gave a brief speech

789
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,480
to my team recently,

790
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,200
and I thought I talked about it on the podcast,

791
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
but because I can't remember,

792
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,520
I'm gonna go ahead and go ahead and do it again.

793
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:25,960
The testers, I don't think testing is what's valuable

794
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,960
in the way we've been doing it.

795
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,160
Like even from my own experience, as I just discussed,

796
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,160
there's better ways of doing it to deliver quality.

797
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,560
However, one of the things people are freaking out about

798
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:44,240
is, hey, does that mean I'm no longer valued?

799
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,200
And I've said, no, no, no, no.

800
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,240
Testers, they have four key things

801
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,520
that they are attributes.

802
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,040
I'm uncomfortable calling it a role,

803
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,060
but I'll say attributes that testers seem to have in common

804
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,000
from my experience.

805
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,560
Number one, they are very good

806
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,360
at considering code quality issues.

807
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,860
We're good at looking at code

808
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,400
and going, you screwed up right there.

809
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,280
I remember like yesterday, about 10 years ago,

810
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,080
the dev architect did an off by one bug in his if loop.

811
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,280
And oh, I mocked him forever.

812
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,080
What the hell's an if loop?

813
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
I'm sorry, if statement.

814
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,000
All right.

815
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,880
Would be a, yeah, whatever, moving on.

816
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,140
Code quality, we're good at that.

817
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,720
Finding bugs is how we think of it,

818
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,820
but that's not the value.

819
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,880
It's about getting code quality up.

820
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,580
Customer quality, we're good at that.

821
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,000
Considering how the customer thinks

822
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,560
and what sort of things would make them happy,

823
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,200
that's something we're good at.

824
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,300
Coding, we know how to code.

825
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,160
We're not gonna, I mean, the best of us

826
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,660
isn't going to be better than the best of,

827
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,660
say, the current development,

828
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,560
but there is a great deal of things

829
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,420
that we as a function, as a group,

830
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,780
are quite good at doing.

831
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,980
Large number of us could write a high-performing web UI

832
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,140
without batting an eye.

833
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,660
And then lastly, we're very good at systems thinking.

834
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,420
We're very good at thinking things through end to end.

835
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,820
And none of those four things,

836
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,460
no matter what our role is,

837
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,030
none of those, the value of those four things diminish

838
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,330
in any way, shape, or form.

839
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,600
Those will always be valuable.

840
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,320
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

841
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,240
I think what goes away is the,

842
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,640
give me your code, I'll play with it for a while.

843
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,600
I'll tell you where the bugs are.

844
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,560
I give it to you, you give it back to me.

845
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,080
That stuff's gone.

846
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,240
Good riddance.

847
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,080
Good riddance.

848
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,960
All right, we got about five minutes left.

849
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,090
We better get to the mailbag.

850
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,780
All right, Brent, you have the first question

851
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,620
from the mailbag.

852
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:03,460
Yep, so I had a 101 with a guy I hadn't talked to

853
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,100
in a couple of years.

854
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,940
Found out, by the way, that in some regards,

855
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,820
our podcast is going viral.

856
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,420
Meaning he found the link and forwarded on

857
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,540
to several people.

858
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,500
Yeah, I don't think that counts.

859
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,860
Viral's viral, baby.

860
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,220
In our next podcast, I will teach Brent definitions.

861
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:30,400
Yeah, I look forward to that conversation.

862
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,780
I'm all about virality.

863
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:36,980
Anyway, what I'm saying is that we've clearly

864
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,620
have moved away from, hey, just people just listening

865
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,460
for themselves that are now at a point

866
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,060
where they're sharing with others.

867
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,520
Good, what was the question?

868
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,400
As we were talking through it, he asked,

869
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,960
hey, Brent, this is all great, episode seven.

870
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,440
However, one question I had is,

871
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,730
I'll leave it to you to answer this.

872
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:59,930
How will it work when we're in this world

873
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:04,870
where managers have 10 to 30 direct reports?

874
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,410
How the hell are they gonna scale?

875
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,330
How will my manager know what I need to do

876
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,950
at review time?

877
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,970
That was sort of the, how will he be able

878
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:16,210
to prop me up correctly at review time?

879
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,140
And how will he grow my career?

880
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,980
God, people are-

881
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,580
He says, asking the guy who's not a manager.

882
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,780
People, well, I will tell you that I think 30

883
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,020
gets a little bit hard.

884
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,780
I think if 10 to 20 freaks you out,

885
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,300
you're probably not cut out to be an engineering lead

886
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,660
in the new world.

887
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,100
I think when I talk to people about this,

888
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,260
I recommend The One Minute Manager,

889
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,660
which is, if you ever read the book,

890
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,060
it is about manager is overwhelmed

891
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,460
with how much stuff he has to do,

892
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,620
and the stuff's not getting done,

893
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,660
talks to the guru,

894
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,060
tells him how to be the one minute manager,

895
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,100
which basically means that instead of spending

896
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,980
all your time monitoring your employees,

897
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,300
you dive in and out.

898
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,620
You give them guidance when needed,

899
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,380
praise when needed, you get in and out,

900
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,180
and let them, and guess what happens

901
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,960
when you get in and out and get out of their way

902
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,680
and give them what they need to do?

903
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,940
They grow on their own.

904
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,780
Yes.

905
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,140
They figure stuff out.

906
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,580
One of the reasons your team doesn't grow

907
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,500
is when you spend all your time trying

908
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,960
to micromanage them.

909
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,380
It's effort on you,

910
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,580
and it hinders your employees' career.

911
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,220
What should the micromanager do differently?

912
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,060
They need to learn how to step.

913
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,980
They need to give your team a framework

914
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,880
they can work in and be successful,

915
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,900
give them the right coaching they need

916
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,460
to continue to achieve that success,

917
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,540
and then get the hell out of their way.

918
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,820
So, Alan, actually, there's a reason

919
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,700
why I wanted you to ask or answer this.

920
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,540
Yes.

921
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,340
Alan has stated over and over again,

922
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,420
he's super allergic to being a manager.

923
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,860
No, I'm super allergic to being a manager at Microsoft.

924
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:54,320
Okay, now, let's say you're a current team,

925
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,440
but you have no management chain now.

926
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:00,650
Is your team gonna go into the weeds,

927
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,140
and are you guys all gonna get bad reviews?

928
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,620
On my team, no.

929
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,540
Why?

930
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,540
Because we have a value of being super transparent

931
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,340
and a value of collaboration,

932
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,540
everybody on the team knows to do that.

933
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,560
Everybody knows what everybody else is doing.

934
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,960
Say that we got rid of all our managers,

935
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,220
and we all just reported directly to my boss.

936
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,700
I think we would probably rely even more

937
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,620
on peer feedback for, along those things

938
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,460
we talked about earlier, on collaboration, et cetera,

939
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,680
for how we're evaluated.

940
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,100
But also what's gonna happen is

941
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,660
you're going to have leaders pop up

942
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,020
out of that team of 30 people.

943
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,420
You're gonna have people who rise as technical leaders,

944
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,740
who rise in and out, World of Warcraft,

945
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,340
project management style I talked about last time.

946
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,860
Leaders pop in and out, groups form.

947
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,620
As a manager, you see those in your brief

948
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,140
coaching and monitoring sessions,

949
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,420
so you know what's going on.

950
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,220
And if you're not transparent,

951
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,580
and you don't value collaboration,

952
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:00,080
and you don't share with each other,

953
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,780
it is gonna be very difficult to tell

954
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,520
who I need to give big rewards to versus smaller rewards.

955
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,140
But I think, Chris, my manager,

956
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,500
mentioned having the whole team report to him,

957
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,940
which is about 35 people right now.

958
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:14,420
I think he's still gonna go to his senior people,

959
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,620
his technical leaders, even though they're not managers,

960
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,660
and ask them about people on the team

961
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,740
to get more information.

962
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,740
But if you have 30 people,

963
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,620
won't everybody go in random directions?

964
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,980
No, if you have 30 people and no leadership on the team,

965
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,940
but you have your engineering manager

966
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,180
who's in charge of managing the team,

967
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,820
coaching, make sure everybody has what they need,

968
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,380
people are going to do peer mentoring and peer coaching,

969
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,590
and you're gonna have leaders on that team.

970
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,070
We should move on to the next.

971
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,910
Well, no, because actually I wanna bring something up,

972
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:45,750
and we're gonna have to do the other question next time.

973
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,830
So one thing I'll just say on this is,

974
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:48,990
my answer to this,

975
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:51,070
and you just talked about it a great deal,

976
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,550
but we talked about the IRR earlier, and the reason why.

977
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:56,810
My answer to this, in this world,

978
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:01,550
reducing the friction around knowledge sharing

979
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:05,190
is absolutely the key to making this succeed.

980
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,950
Yeah, I think it's a huge part of it.

981
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,790
So I wanna bring up,

982
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:12,230
I was thinking about this topic since our last podcast,

983
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,990
and I remember Brent and I have been having lunch together,

984
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,710
meeting together for like five years,

985
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,110
and I remember one of our-

986
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,110
Feels like 10.

987
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:21,090
One of our first meetings,

988
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:22,990
we're over at a place called Saigon City,

989
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,390
having some Vietnamese-

990
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,350
They're closed now.

991
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:26,190
No way!

992
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,030
Yeah, out of business.

993
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,560
Oh no, oh god, I love that place.

994
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,400
In a moment?

995
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,440
All right, back in business here, wow.

996
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,000
It's a good thing we have a new favorite place.

997
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,800
Where am I gonna get a 21?

998
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,640
Oh man, the 21 was so good.

999
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,960
Black check table, please.

1000
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,120
The number 21 on the menu.

1001
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,480
So we're having lunch there,

1002
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,600
and Brent's talking about, we're talking about Google,

1003
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,040
and Brent says to me,

1004
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,680
this is just a few short years ago,

1005
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,680
Brent says to me, I could never work at Google.

1006
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,800
I said, why not, Brent?

1007
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,660
He goes, they expect managers to manage up to 15 people,

1008
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,380
and there is no way I would manage on a team like that,

1009
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,820
because I couldn't give my employees

1010
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,100
the amount of career growth and coaching

1011
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,780
they needed to be successful.

1012
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,390
Yep, and ever since,

1013
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,390
so I remember that conversation.

1014
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,030
I'm glad you did.

1015
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:22,710
No, I've used that over and over again.

1016
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,150
But one of the things that I do do

1017
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,190
is I spend a lot of time thinking through,

1018
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,870
why the hell do they think they can?

1019
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,590
What did they figure it out?

1020
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,230
I've now learned that.

1021
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:34,270
Yeah, and that's actually a good mode for anything.

1022
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,910
When you see something you disagree with,

1023
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,070
somebody says something,

1024
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,470
what's their motivation behind that?

1025
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,390
Why are they thinking that way,

1026
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,750
and see if there's some value there for you?

1027
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,500
And how do they do it?

1028
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,140
How do they make it scale?

1029
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,460
Yeah, that was, so back then in those days,

1030
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,500
and it was longer than five years ago,

1031
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,360
I had a rule of thumb,

1032
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,040
and it's something that I even taught my leads

1033
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,040
who reported to me, is that my expectation is

1034
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,320
that you're spending around 10% of your time

1035
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,960
with each of your employees.

1036
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,800
So if you have 10, that's all you're doing.

1037
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,160
Well, over there, it was common to have

1038
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,280
20 to 40 direct reports.

1039
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,390
And I'm like, I'm sorry.

1040
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,630
I don't see how my current tool set

1041
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,590
will enable me to scale that.

1042
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,700
And people management is critical to me.

1043
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,660
If I can't even consider a position

1044
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,020
where I would fail on that.

1045
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,580
Yeah, I would love to talk more about this,

1046
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,740
but we're losing our room,

1047
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:30,780
and I'm late for a meeting.

1048
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,180
So thanks, everyone.

1049
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,140
We're gonna get to the other mailbag question

1050
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,980
next time, and I'm Alan.

1051
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,820
I'm Brent.

1052
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,660
And we'll see you later.

1053
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,480
Bye.

1054
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,320
Bye.
