00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:11,900
This is the AB testing 343 podcast a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,380
three questions about almost anything

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:21,180
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,580
We're back again for another ABT

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,740
343 and this time all the way from

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,540
Germany, I think is

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,540
Andres warm

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:37,140
One yeah. Hi. Thanks for having me. Yeah one just like the one on the ground and

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,420
But spelling wise it's it's spelled worm

10
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,220
Okay, that's a pronunciation. Yeah

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,100
For the for the Americans, which is I only bring that up because your nickname on our slack is really cool

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,100
It's it's a nice little pun

13
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,840
global warming and I love it I guess I

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,280
always

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,480
Always thought it's called one because earth one Jim is I think we have it's one

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,440
It works. Just just just just ignore my American ignorance. I love the name

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
I'm super glad to have

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:26,440
You know on this podcast I ask a few questions usually three plus tangents so more three or more questions

19
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,720
To one of the three listeners of the AB testing podcast. So as sort of a pre question, I'm curious

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,160
How did you learn about the podcast or modern testing?

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,240
Where did you learn about this thing that Brent and I call modern testing? I

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,560
Somehow stumbled upon your podcast. I'm not sure if I saw it on LinkedIn or on the MOT slack

23
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,880
someone linked me to episode 104 and

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,840
That was the first time I heard about the podcast and your your seven principles and

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,040
Yeah, and a few episodes after

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,760
Joined the one of three slack. So what did we talk about in 104? Oh, that's a great question

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,360
Maybe we turn off investment

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,280
Maybe I'm sure I could look it up

29
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,240
Just curious Brent sometimes remember these of course we have some episodes that we

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,040
Always remember like we know like we talked about so-and-so in such episode

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
It's caught leading quality with one

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,080
Sean

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,760
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that one was a good interview with a bad recording

34
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,720
On the old equipment. We have better equipment. That's why this one sounds so much better a bit

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,920
How have you applied modern testing to any of the work that you've done, you know since you found the podcast

36
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,180
Since I found the podcast, that's hard. I

37
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,220
Because I didn't really do much. I

38
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,490
Just discovered it like a week or two weeks ago, and I'm currently without a project. So there's no real

39
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:09,290
real code base or team or product I could apply anything to I

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,480
Thought about starting an old part of my own podcast. Maybe I can

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,120
Introduce some quality there or get rapid feedback

42
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,760
Whatever

43
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:27,800
No, I discovered. Well, I basically lift the or some of the principles

44
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,150
for a long time

45
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,470
most things on the list I

46
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:40,250
Already did because I had the had the luck to to learn in a very quality focused environment

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,910
so

48
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,110
things like customer first

49
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,390
Quality inbuilt from the beginning and sharing knowledge and continuously improving

50
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:57,350
Have been always there as you said, as you said the quality the principles are very old

51
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,350
You

52
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:04,830
They're not so new nothing nothing. Yeah, nothing new you've made my point for me

53
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,910
So let's get the softballs aside

54
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,110
Let's talk about scrum. I know you are a

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,470
supporter of scrum and I want to talk about that and

56
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,350
also

57
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,070
That you have seen scrum used incorrectly a lot. So

58
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:25,550
Let's just go with that. Tell me about your experience with scrum

59
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,350
How your problems you've run into how it's helped with modern testing and I'm gonna sit back and listen to you

60
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,910
Teach me for a while

61
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,630
after I

62
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,830
finished my three years of learning to be a software developer, I basically did the

63
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,790
scrum master certification and

64
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,390
the place where I learned and worked

65
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,570
Knew about scrum. My my boss was a supporter of scrum and

66
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,090
As like scrum as like one of the best

67
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,050
methodologies to develop complex

68
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,970
software products

69
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,970
we had a team of like

70
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,490
five six people and

71
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,050
We tried to do scrum to be agile

72
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,680
no

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,160
No scrum implementation is perfect. We were always learning but

74
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,080
We were very aware of some of the

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,880
Missing parts of scrum. We didn't do scrum correctly, but we

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,560
applied as much as we could or as we wanted to

77
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,040
have an environment of

78
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,600
continuous improvement and learning and not doing the same the same about twice and

79
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,480
yeah

80
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,520
having having a customer focus and working with data and

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,360
one of the

82
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Maybe I should tell about the project

83
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,440
So we have a little bit of context that I'm what I'm talking about

84
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,080
our little company of six people

85
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
mostly developed

86
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,120
event ticketing

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,560
system the storefront where you could buy tickets for for concerts and

88
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,280
museums and these things online

89
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Pretty local and we had like

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
at any time

91
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,480
6,000 events active, which is I guess nothing compared to huge

92
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,080
I don't know what your local equivalent is

93
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,280
yeah, but for our team pretty pretty nice and

94
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,000
yeah, we

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
did this for our client and

96
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
one problem we

97
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,560
Often came back to was our missing product owner

98
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,880
because

99
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,280
When you when you go with the scrum guide you want to have like

100
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,480
self-sufficient

101
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
autark what was the term?

102
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,880
The word escapes me, but you want the team to have all the ability to do and make decisions and

103
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Develop the product we

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,660
Were working for a client. So the client had

105
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,660
much say and

106
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,520
Which direction we went and what to develop and

107
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,570
Yeah, sometimes the the

108
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,860
So you could you could say the client was the product owner

109
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,920
but

110
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,240
you could

111
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:44,440
Yeah, and the role the role the person's the person's changed from time to time and we had better product owners and sometimes worse product owners and

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,220
and

113
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,420
Yeah, that was one issue

114
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,380
In hindsight, it would have made maybe made sense to

115
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,650
to fight for

116
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,690
autonomy

117
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:06,310
To say hey come we we align on the basic goals you want to achieve the basic like the customer segments you want to to

118
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:14,940
Talk to to have more conversion with whatever and let us handle the the tasks and how to do it and

119
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,140
How to get the feedback and

120
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,660
But in hindsight, that's easy to say

121
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,840
I'm gonna have you I'm gonna put you on the hot seat here with some special questions because I

122
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,320
have my I

123
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:39,040
Can't say that I hate scrum because I don't I think it's valuable and useful and often

124
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,980
Misused so I don't think I'm gonna tell you anything you haven't heard before I miss use

125
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,500
Let me give you some complaints I have about scrum and just kind of give me your answers on them

126
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Just for those you listening along there has been no prep for these. He is completely on the spot. So I

127
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,490
will ask try to ask these in an open-ended way, so one is

128
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,820
The rituals of scrum there are a lot of meetings that go along with the scrum framework. There's the daily stand-up

129
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,620
Which we can go into which it has some pros and cons

130
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,880
When done right or wrong and as a tangent

131
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:23,140
It seems like every day on the internet someone publishes an article saying why agile doesn't work and they describe some horribly

132
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,060
Bastardized version of agile and you go. Yeah, of course you don't get it. That's why it doesn't work

133
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,620
so so going back to scrum rituals, there's the

134
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,700
There's the backlog grooming and the daily stand-up and the retros and there are probably a few other ones. I'm forgetting so

135
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,260
What are some pros and cons of?

136
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,100
Let's just stick with daily stand-up and

137
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,420
Actually, let's talk about all that lead up. What are the pros and cons? What are the ways the daily stand-up is?

138
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,420
Extremely important part of scrum and what are some ways in that meeting can be useless

139
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,190
Let's let's first distinguish between age and scrum

140
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,890
a child when I talk about a

141
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,750
When I talk when in my mind agile is the main resource for agile is the age of manifesto and

142
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:21,380
I love okay. I like talking about scrum more because scrum has a more concrete

143
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:29,060
Rule set you can compare to it and I'm gonna stop go on go on

144
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,760
I was gonna interrupt and give away your answer for you. So keep going

145
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,210
so

146
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,930
Whatever the actual implementation is you're you are doing

147
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:45,290
all the all the rituals mentioned in the scrum guide and

148
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,520
You can okay. That's our main source for doing scrum is a scrum guide and

149
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
These rituals have a purpose

150
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:02,470
These rituals don't add meetings or are a waste of time because any everything you do in these rituals

151
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,390
must be done to

152
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:09,060
build something and

153
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,660
scrum tries to

154
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,720
Say, okay. Why don't you use at regular intervals these ways of

155
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,460
communicating and collaborating to build something because you have to do it anyway, that's why the most

156
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,700
effective way of communicating and collaborating and

157
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:33,000
sharing new information aligning on goals

158
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,200
and get feedback from stakeholders and

159
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,430
Quality what what's the second part of the question?

160
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:51,570
Because I have a love relationship, okay stand up without leading you I'm gonna see if you can guess why I think the stand-up

161
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,070
It can be awesome and why it often isn't

162
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,490
through discovering I'm doing a lot more on

163
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:05,360
On the learning side because I have a project and I also discovered the liberators network and

164
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
the

165
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,480
Zombie scrum, do you know of that?

166
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes, you read my mind you're in my head. Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it's very very interesting

167
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,920
You can boil that down to you have to have

168
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,180
passion excitement new things you don't want to have to

169
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:36,100
Trot over into the meeting room. Yeah yesterday. I did this and that now I'm not blocked. Okay, see you tomorrow

170
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,060
Yeah, you have to keep it fresh exciting and

171
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,850
one thing I'm

172
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,770
Recently learning is the importance of the sprint goal and in hindsight

173
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:52,890
That was something which could have helped us very much in our

174
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,230
Eight years of developing this event ticketing system and doing scrum there

175
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,380
Keep it. Yeah

176
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,110
Keep it interesting

177
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,150
Yes

178
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:11,590
The difference with you over a lot of people that have done scrum is they kind of pick a little bits of it

179
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,590
And it doesn't quite work. I think the sprint goal

180
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:20,270
It's a pat lunch. You only calls the rally and cry getting a team to a line about around something

181
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,270
I think that's super important as well

182
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,070
And then the zombies the zombie stand-ups people

183
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:33,110
Every day saying they're working on the same thing and it's the same thing that did yesterday and they're never blocked on anything

184
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:39,430
Which is really comes down to the importance of a good scrum master for the team

185
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:45,930
And I am missing out on there's a really good book. I read and recommend on

186
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,570
Being a scrum master and if you're doing scrum, I think go ahead

187
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,970
We didn't have a scrum master either

188
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,850
So that's the challenge that I think

189
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,090
It's

190
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,970
Incredibly important to have a good scrum master

191
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,850
Someone who knows what to do and can dig past those things and this book that I'm talk I can't find

192
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,430
I don't want to search for it any longer while I'm talking here

193
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,010
So I'm not going to but it does a good job

194
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,970
talking about the role of the scrum master as a servant leader for the organization and

195
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:25,290
Helping the team be successful and aligning them on what they're doing

196
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:32,050
Asking the right questions to get the team that did the right level of communication for that team to be successful

197
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,370
Which aligns very well with the agile manifesto and agile principles

198
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:42,850
Which I think a lot of people who do scrum haven't they think of scrum as being equal to agile for so

199
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,290
Thanks for calling that out that they're not and then

200
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,220
You are talking about people saying

201
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:58,700
Agile doesn't work because we are doing scrum wrong and I'm saying yeah, we are doing scrum wrong

202
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,100
But agile did work. I have seen enough people

203
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,380
Make mistakes with scrum that I prefer not to use it

204
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,960
But I have nothing against scrum being used properly

205
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,100
But I think you are gonna need someone to play the role of scrum master for it to really work well for the team

206
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,460
Honestly scrum is a nice transition for those used to more

207
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,540
Traditional models because it gives you you get nice little tight iterations. In fact

208
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
done poorly

209
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:35,360
Scrum is an example of the spiral model of software delivery can be a way of accelerating waterfall done poorly

210
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,580
but if you actually

211
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:45,260
Understand how scrum works within the frame of agile it can actually be very effective. So I have nothing against it

212
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,660
I just seems to be done wrong a lot

213
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,460
So it's kind of scared me away from recommending it to a lot of teams

214
00:15:51,940 --> 00:16:00,200
Versus just coaching them towards understanding the principles of agile in the first place. I'm off of myself box in your notes

215
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:08,360
You said that you like scrum, but mostly for egocentric reasons. I'd like to hear some more about that

216
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:14,160
yeah, the the the best part about the wedding cry and and

217
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,570
the

218
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,170
consumer and customer centric view is

219
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,160
Motivation

220
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,000
Because I'm I'm deriving lot of purpose in my life for my work

221
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,760
So as long as you can convince me that my work is valuable

222
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,360
I will be much more motivated to work and

223
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,190
doing doing boring stuff doing stuff where I

224
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:50,390
Don't see the value for the customer doing something which is just thrown in the bin

225
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:58,830
Which was clear before and will totally demotivate me and I guess many people

226
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:08,080
Will suffer from this fate when they don't see the bigger picture then they don't see the value added when they don't make lives better

227
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,400
it's

228
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:19,240
It's easier to follow when you have some someone who's really passionate and has has you has you convinced that what you are building is great. I

229
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,230
Don't see that as

230
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:27,190
Egotistical to me that's about having a sense of purpose for your work

231
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:30,430
And I tie that back to Dan Pink's works like you need to have

232
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,910
autonomy mastery and sense of purpose you need to be able to figure stuff out and

233
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,910
Be able to do it and feel like you're in like what you work on matters and that's not egotistical

234
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,470
That's just it is taking care of yourself

235
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,630
But it's you know when I look at Dan Pink's those three principles that I just mentioned

236
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,790
It's kind of like Maslov's hierarchy of needs. It's what we need to do to be successful in knowledge work

237
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,310
So I'm okay with that. I don't call that egotistical

238
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,230
But it's if you give people work they enjoy that they feel like matters

239
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,410
They're going to do better work and create higher quality output. So I am all over that

240
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,320
Okay, good to hear that's good to hear as a much younger person than me. It's good to hear the younger generation

241
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:21,900
Figuring out that's important. So I like that. Yeah, I don't know if I figured that out of it's just really the

242
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,700
The awesome environment I was learning and we didn't have a scrum master, but we had

243
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,380
We had two people with scrum master certifications

244
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,940
my boss a really really great mind and

245
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,180
Always pointing out the the the problems

246
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,700
We had by by applying the scrum guide and saying okay

247
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:53,780
We have a problem with doing three weeks week sprints come let's try to let's try one. Okay, what is what? What is happening?

248
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:57,420
So he was basically a teacher coach mentor

249
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,060
And a great scrum master, but also the world shifted sometimes sometimes I was a scrum master and

250
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,260
He was focused on more on development. Sometimes someone else was

251
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,060
for the sprint

252
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
having trying to have more like an

253
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,820
overview about the the team and the the things we do

254
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,820
But that was very hard because we were all

255
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:25,860
developers and we all wanted to develop fancy stuff and great things and

256
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,740
Yeah, it's the focus sounds like a good boss excited about that

257
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:36,340
Hey one last thing I'd like to talk about which is the thing on everyone's mind these days

258
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:43,770
Covid so first off, how's it going with you with do you have a family you live by yourself?

259
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:45,770
How's it going with you dealing with?

260
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,930
Whatever is going on in your part of the world. I think in Germany things have opened up a little bit more but not much

261
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,930
Yeah, I mean it's

262
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:59,410
Comparatively good you see low numbers like thousands

263
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:06,070
But you see an increase now that schools and businesses are reopening again

264
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:08,730
Yeah, that was to be expected. I

265
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:15,110
Was lucky to to just have finished project and I could just go to the office

266
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,290
By myself or I could stay at home. I

267
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,610
Basically the whole April was on vacation

268
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,570
Yeah, and after that I was alone in the office

269
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,630
So no no contact there no risk. I have a wife I

270
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,890
Have a son who is going to be three years old

271
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,840
That's the really stressful part

272
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,120
Because yes, I have noticed that too

273
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,300
I have a lot of employees with young kids and I have had a lot of young kids join meetings

274
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Which can be funny

275
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:59,920
but but related to the the risk of infection even even though the early data suggested that

276
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:09,020
children below a certain age aren't really suspect to the virus and don't face like severe consequences, but the long-term effects and

277
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,040
We have a grandma who couldn't visit

278
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,820
Yeah, and the soul

279
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,480
24-7 being a dad at home was quite a

280
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,780
challenge sometimes

281
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,780
Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep

282
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:30,540
So there is safety however in online communities and I believe you just joined LinkedIn recently

283
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:37,460
So what's that experience been like? Yeah, I thought because projects are slow. I just try to be more

284
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
active on LinkedIn, maybe

285
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,020
there's

286
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,100
Business value in that I'm quite

287
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:53,020
Surprised I'm it's already and it's already been proven valuable just to

288
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:03,140
It's just funny learning aspect. I'm I discovered a lot of interesting people a lot of interesting thoughts and a lot of updates on my

289
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:11,860
Knowledge of scrum and some different philosophies and advancements

290
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,790
Try to to to get into discussions and maybe

291
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,950
post one or two things I'm really

292
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:28,330
Confident about that's not we hashed that's some of which no thoughts and hopefully helpful to someone

293
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,050
Yeah, engaging in discussion and debates are great way to learn. Yeah, definitely

294
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,530
Congratulations on on get now. I should have done. I should have done that earlier. Oh

295
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,980
It is what it is

296
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,820
Great. Well, that's going to bring us to the about to the end of our time here today

297
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:52,220
But I enjoyed the conversation especially kind of dive in to scrum a little bit and kind of hearing what's going on in your world

298
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,020
I want to thank you again for joining our

299
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:01,820
Community at one of the three dot slack comm and then for volunteering to be on this podcast where we try and get a little

300
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,180
bit more information around people on the podcast

301
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:11,620
So thank you for that and any final words or or actually maybe share some ways people can learn more about you or get a

302
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,620
Hold of you out in the real world

303
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,200
It's hard in the real world. You can you can connect to me on linkedin

304
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
but I don't really have an a

305
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:27,160
Channel a personal channel to spread my my thoughts and joined one of the three dot slack calm

306
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,440
Warming or global farming there. Yeah, and also on the Ministry of Testing podcast

307
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,800

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,570
Well, that's basically it. I think a lot of our community is bound to come across you at some point if they haven't already

310
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:53,930
Yes

311
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,930
