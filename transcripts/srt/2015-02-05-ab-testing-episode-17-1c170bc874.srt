1
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:19,780
Hello, everyone. Jesus Christ.

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,740
What the hell was that?

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,020
I am going to leave that out there just for you. Hey, everybody, I'm not Brent.

4
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,380
And I am not Alan.

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:32,500
And together we make A B testing as Alan Brent. Get it? Alan Brent,

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,420
for those of you that haven't figured it out.

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:34,980
Right.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,940
Because we haven't really talked about experimentation A B testing, have we?

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,180
No.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,500
So I was thinking on the way here we should have.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,740
We should talk about that someday. But even more importantly,

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:50,420
maybe there should be like an A B tester persona. It's just like a total dick and

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,900
gets on the Internet and says funny things. No, maybe not.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,180
Sure. Oh, speak.

15
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,580
I'm like, why do we need the persona? We have the two of us.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:04,100
Right. We have two of us already. Hey, I don't know if you follow the the

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,420
Swift on security on Twitter. No.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,620
Oh, it's hilarious. There's somebody with way too much free time and way too much

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:19,220
computer knowledge tweeting as Taylor Swift as an I.T. and security specialist.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,540
They are great.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,030
How do they do it as Taylor Swift? Like song quotes or something?

22
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:29,230
Sometimes. Sometimes lyrics rewritten.

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,990
I mean, it's really easy to impersonate any celebrity on Twitter.

24
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,990
Absolutely. No. And she is really adamant about saying this is not a parody account.

25
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,110
I am Taylor Swift.

26
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,350
And I care about security and software in general. And there's this underlying theme in all of

27
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:52,160
her posts about end of times due to computer computers taking over the world.

28
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:59,540
Yes. As as we continue with the data science stuff, one of the things that I often tell my team

29
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,740
is we need to treat this very carefully so that our robot masters look look back upon us fondly.

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,180
Exactly. Anyway, just thought that thought I'd bring that.

31
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,480
Oh, and speaking of which, like HoloLens. Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,800
Sign up. Have you tested that yet? No, I'm I'm I signed up to go do that.

33
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,120
Check it out. I am. Thursday, I think.

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,800
That's going to be cool. The only thing I mean, obviously, we can't speculate too much, but

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
I just hope the price point isn't too outrageous because it's going to be pretty cool.

36
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,870
I don't know. But you know, there's nothing like that out there.

37
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:35,230
I have to hide it from my kids because they find out Minecraft is available.

38
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,390
Oh, I already showed my kids. My kids were like, you're doing really.

39
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,670
You do. And so so Alan and I have friends.

40
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,510
We have to buy three pair. Alan and I have the friends that work in that that group.

41
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:56,580
We do. And I sent one of them a mail after I'd looked at the YouTube marketing PR piece.

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,980
And I said, dude, does this thing even do half of what is on this video?

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:09,950
And he's like, Brett, it does it all. And I'm like, done done done.

44
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,990
And then he said, this thing is absolutely going to change the world. And if it if it

45
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,910
does do anything close to that, I think it absolutely will.

46
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,950
Yeah, I think it's just like when the first PCs came out, I think, you know, my hunch is and again,

47
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,660
don't go Murray Joe Foley quote me. My hunch is the price point is going to be a little high

48
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:32,260
at first, just like PCs were at first. Like 3D printers.

49
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,940
Like 3D printers. Yeah. I read somewhere that as we go off on our 80D tangents,

50
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,140
I read somewhere that the primary output from 3D printers are parts to fix your 3D printer.

51
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,300
Is that correct? I haven't actually.

52
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,220
There's a friend, another friend of ours. I don't know if you know Matt, Matt F.

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,480
No, I don't. He's really cool. You work with them on the Xbox team. He's over on that team.

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,120
And he has three 3D printers. So I asked him, so did you use the first one to print the next two?

55
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,060
But no, no, he's just really into the technology. And I haven't played with that. I really,

56
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,420
really want to. My son has actually gone through a class last year.

57
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:25,860
What was basically a whole semester long just on 3D printing. He actually taught the instructor.

58
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,680
It was a brand new class and the instructor was like, I don't know. Here's the manual.

59
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,610
Good. We value people that can figure things out. Hey, just for the heck of it,

60
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,420
do you want to talk about software? Sure. Or people or something like relevant to our

61
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:47,220
limited audience? Our topic. We don't have topics, come on.

62
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,450
So the one thing... We have three words in two bullet points. Actually, there's three

63
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:57,570
bullet points, one of them is blank. And we have three words in the backlog today.

64
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,050
Yeah. Let's start with whatever your first

65
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:08,370
thing is that you wouldn't tell me about. Yeah. So Alan doesn't do this, but I do. So

66
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:15,730
on my blog, I often go in and I check the stats. I'm very interested in

67
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,890
where people are coming from. It's the primary...

68
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,970
Like country or attitude? Website.

69
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,330
What folks are linking to... I think my number one referring site is Twitter.

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
But you know what's fun for me? Twitter and Facebook.

71
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,880
Nah, I don't do anything on Facebook. I'm thinking of just deleting my account. I never

72
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,400
go there. I go there once in a while just to snark. And to look at what losers all my

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,600
friends from high school are. Sorry if you're listening. Sorry. Not you, the other people.

74
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:54,700
Yeah, not you. Yeah. And then this link showed up just this week. I went back to see

75
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:02,460
how people were linking to my site. And I found that the folks over at testbuffet.com

76
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:15,380
have put together the top testing blog sites for 2014. And my dear partner is number 10 on that list.

77
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,510
He's looking at it now. I'm so excited. I brought it up. I brought up testbuffet.com.

78
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:28,350
Which you know, these lists, I don't know how they come... I mean, they're kind of ridiculous, right?

79
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,260
He actually has a criteria, although the criteria is essentially says things about testing.

80
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,460
And well, cool. Sadly, I should actually blog about testing.

81
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,460
Actually, so I'm ranked 76 in that list. You're on the list.

82
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:56,580
I am on the list. He believes, I think he said that there's a total of like 200 testing blogs

83
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:04,270
that he was able to find. And it was interesting. You just made a snarky comment about, hey,

84
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:08,910
maybe I should blog about testing sometimes. What me, snark? Never. And it's interesting.

85
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:16,430
And we also talked about A-B testing. And I'm starting to view not only the podcast,

86
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:25,950
but definitely my blog as beginning to shift away from the testing concept and much more towards

87
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,590
the quality concept. Yeah, mine has too, if you haven't noticed. And yeah, we've talked about this

88
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:40,340
before, so I'll shut up there. Yeah, I think it's a natural progression as sort of we and

89
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,740
the industry kind of change how we make quality software. I can pretty much guarantee I will blog

90
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:54,420
more about testing. So then what? Testing activities. What? You said you'll blog more.

91
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,260
That means you have at least one more testing blog. Yeah, there are lots of testing activities

92
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,060
that go into what I do, what my team's doing, what I care about. I am giving, did I tell you I'm going

93
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,700
to Star Canada? No, I didn't even know there was such a thing. Yeah, there's a Star Canada. This year,

94
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:18,240
it's in Vancouver. Oh, when? June, middle of June. Interesting. So check it out. I'm going to give

95
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,960
Lee, Lee asked if I give a keynote there. So and he saw my post, my last post about

96
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,200
how I test software at Microsoft and how we've changed a lot. He goes, I think it'd be

97
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,640
interesting to talk about some of the big changes that have happened over those six or seven years.

98
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,820
So I'm going to do that. It's going to be fun. And then he also asked if I would do a tutorial.

99
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,260
I thought, no, I don't want to do a tutorial because I don't really want to talk about.

100
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:47,660
I do want to talk about some stuff. So there's a lot of that. And I couldn't figure out what

101
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,620
to talk about. So this was my thought process over a week. I'll rolled into 20 seconds for you or

102
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:59,820
the way I ramble 10 minutes. So you are going to do a tutorial? Yes, I am. Would you shut up

103
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:06,060
and I'll tell you, please do. So I was thinking, well, I could talk about that. I look at the

104
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,580
tutorials and I go, you know, I don't want to give a tutorial like these. I want to,

105
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,940
and I really valued the generalist, you know, and being able to have a toolbox of things and cool

106
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,500
things you can do. And I said, heck yeah, that's what I'm going to give a tutorial on.

107
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,780
And I am going to fly through stuff. You don't know that you should know for a tester. I'm

108
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:32,140
going to go through probably 45 minutes to an hour on security testing. I'm going to go through

109
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,860
some ideas on performance testing and then also a little bit of statistics because you can't really

110
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:41,820
do perf testing without understanding how to apply mean, median, average, and a few other sorts of

111
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,020
analysis beyond there to figure out what's really going on. So I'll get to put a little bit of,

112
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,460
I'm not going to be so bold as to call it data sciencey stuff, but a little bit of statistics

113
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,800
for testers, things testers should know about how variant. Interesting. So again,

114
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,600
a little hodgepodge data enhanced testing. I don't, don't, don't worry about it because I don't

115
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,480
like your words. So anyway, I thought I could easily feel I'll do like a half day thing and

116
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,300
it'll give me room to be flexible because I, for tutorials, I've had to be with you for four hours.

117
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,260
I really can't can exactly what I'm going to say, but I'm going to give myself some rails to go on.

118
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,700
I'm going to make sure I talk about these things and about this much time on each thing. And if we

119
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,380
go off on some tangents, great. But the goal of people walk out of there going, you know,

120
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,860
not knowing one thing pretty deeply, like you get in a typical tutorial, but walk out of there

121
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,740
going, wow, I have like five things I can go do on my team and, and provide some value. And then

122
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,420
as I get more interested, maybe there are things I want to dive deeper on and become that,

123
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:54,240
that specialist in that area. That's my goal. So Lee said it sounded great. I think I'm doing it.

124
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,280
Unless something better comes along for Lee and then he'll go, Alan, you're out.

125
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,760
I think it's a good idea. I'm, I'm thinking through. So Alan's done these type of things in

126
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,840
the past. A lot of times his testing tutorials. I've done a lot of dark things in my past.

127
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,840
I've never actually attended any of the stars. So I've never experienced the,

128
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,000
or done the Alan Page testing experience. Oh, the Alan. Yeah. It's actually going to be a

129
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,560
ride at Disneyland. I'd like to announce, no, sorry, Disneyland is copyrighted. I can't say that

130
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,120
probably, but go on. But yeah, I should do, I should not say the thing I just said. Quit my job

131
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,800
and do a tour. Like I'll go, I'll go to every city in the world and get it like a hotel room.

132
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,320
That fits like six people. And we'll call it the Alan Page testing experience.

133
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,480
I can't fill an arena. I can't fill a conference room, but you could probably fill a bathroom in

134
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,120
most hotels. Probably fill a motel six. Yeah. Yeah. Let not the whole motel. Like, you know,

135
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,800
a room, right? Small room. Well, I'll put the PowerPoint on the TV and I'll, I don't know.

136
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,600
How do we get here? Test buffet. No, no, I'm not done on the other one. We didn't know where we

137
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:16,430
are. I did. Although, no. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's interesting that you're, so his typical,

138
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:25,550
Alan's typical tutorial, as I understand them, were in the past, much more related to a pure testing

139
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:34,450
discipline. And I would say in a nutshell, it was kind of like testing one on one. No,

140
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:39,490
the only, actually, I had to think here's how to, the only tutorials I've done at a star before

141
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:46,450
have been the, I did two Alan page on testing, AKA the Alan page testing experience. And I,

142
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,610
what did I do for those? I, well, the first one, here's what I did. The first one,

143
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,970
I just did total, uh, lean, lean coffee style. I took a bunch of quite, what do you guys want

144
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,240
to talk about? To that for about 10 minutes, took a whole bunch of questions. I gave them a

145
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,040
five minute break. Why organize them into buckets? And then that's what I talked about. Then I got a

146
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,440
bunch of some feedback said this was great. And I love those people and you gotta take the good with

147
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
the bad. And I don't, you know, I don't, I read all the feedback and don't get too high for the

148
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,160
highs or low for the lows. But some people said, didn't really have any structure and he didn't

149
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,960
follow the slides. I thought, okay. So then I had to do this. I did the same thing. I can't

150
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,560
remember which one was first. I think I did it at star East first. And then I agreed to do two

151
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,160
in a row. So I did it at star West the next year. But what I did then was they can tester testing

152
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,120
audiences. Don't really change. So I looked at my groups of questions for what I did at star East.

153
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,320
And I made up some slides that kind of aligned that. And then you, you group the questions

154
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,320
and made up slides in five minutes. No, no, no. So I, I went through the thing at star East is

155
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,400
done. I look at the feedback. It says, some people say, great. Some people say no structure.

156
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:10,290
So before star West, I had six months. I used the output of how the star East presentation

157
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,530
went to kind of make structure and slides for those that like those things. And then I did

158
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,130
the same thing where I asked a bunch of questions at the beginning, grouped them. And I said, okay,

159
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,570
I think I covered that in my presentation. And I went through my slides and we talked about that

160
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,350
stuff worked out very well. Oh, interesting. It was the exact same presentation. I just,

161
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,150
I just cheated a little bit and use the data driven presentation. I use the data,

162
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:42,030
the feedback data from my star East presentation to manipulate the audience and to think I was

163
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:47,920
magically prepared for their questions for star West. So you did that. And there was a lot of

164
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,960
ad lib in there because I can, as you can tell from the babbling going on in this room,

165
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,200
I can sit and talk about a subject and usually more interesting than then because the audience

166
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:03,950
honestly is usually more interesting than Brent, but we do our best. Anyway, it was, it was fun.

167
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:10,750
So if I had, I am not doing that sort of thing. I'm actually preparing a full, a full new sort of

168
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:16,990
smorgasbord, which is like a buffet. I'm going to call it a buffet. I'm preparing, preparing a

169
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:23,500
buffet of cool tools for testers, not just like tool tools, but you're like, you know,

170
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,100
here's what a, here's how to do SQL injection. Here's that. Here's how to get a free book from

171
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,140
your mom and pop website, that kind of stuff. So tools and techniques. Yeah. Anyway,

172
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,140
star, how did we get there? Well, I don't know. We rewind a little bit.

173
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,740
Sprinkling, sprinkling in data stuff.

174
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,660
Figure out what you're talking about. Yeah, some data stuff. Yeah.

175
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:51,900
Um, wow. Uh, a little plug there. It might be interesting. So let's, let's, let's sync up.

176
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:59,140
I don't know if, if, if this is something that's viable, but, um, do you think there

177
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:05,780
would be some advantage in doing a podcast up there? Uh, why are you thinking of going up?

178
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:13,890
It's not that far of a drive and I have six months to plan. Uh, yeah, yeah, definitely. I,

179
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:20,180
in fact, even if you're not there, I'd be, if any listeners are going there and

180
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,460
Brent can't make it, or even if you can, maybe we should just, uh, yeah, we should think about that.

181
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,340
And I'm thinking, sorry, my head is going three different directions as usually does,

182
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:32,180
but yeah, if you're there, we should do a podcast right there in the fricking lobby.

183
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:39,260
And, uh, cause I'm not going to your hotel room. And that is not where the Alan Page

184
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,140
testing experience happens, but it'd be fun to, uh, if somebody wanted to get on the show,

185
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,740
get a little plug their own stuff, talk about what's going on, ask us some questions and

186
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,780
see what kind of, I know it seems like an obvious place for a mailbag.

187
00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:01,490
Oh yes. Mailbag for the mailbag. Anyway, guys, we will, uh, that that's an interesting possibility.

188
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:07,170
We, we will work those details and, and, and, uh, get back to you. You want to go on to topic?

189
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,170
Two. No, no. Um, you got me thinking about how you bring people to your sites. I brought up my stats

190
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:18,930
and yesterday there were three search terms that brought people to my website. Those were,

191
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:24,530
and this is that we're not going to talk about these. One is dichotomous key for dummies.

192
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,330
I don't even know what that means. Alan Page testing. I think they knew what they were looking

193
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:34,610
for. And then I'm not sure if I helped with this or not, but the search for false negative

194
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,770
app Microsoft job interview. Uh, I don't know how to look, I don't know how to look back farther.

195
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,370
Otherwise I'd look for some really cool ones. Click that link. Because once in a while,

196
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:49,890
as you guys with blogs know, uh, you get some just awesome, uh, search terms. I'm gonna look

197
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:53,650
over 30 days and then we're going to get back onto the next topic only because this is fun

198
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:59,490
and I, this is totally unprepared. I don't know what to see. Um, I'm going to skip the ones

199
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:05,230
that seem obvious. I'm a thank you for all you that search for Alan page testing because you're

200
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:14,340
finding my blog apparently. Um, somebody searched for Alan in parentheses, the weasel.

201
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,780
That's funny. I do that search tear down the wall. Hillsong United. Probably not what they're

202
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,820
looking for. Hey, Brent, someone looked for Brent Microsoft blog testing and found me.

203
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,940
Sorry about that. I stole one of your searches. They probably found me through you. All right.

204
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:38,060
Anyway, nothing, nothing too weird in there. Once in a while you get a really crazy one, but, uh,

205
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,660
I don't really see any trippy ones to share. In fact, I should probably do this offline and

206
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,980
find the good ones and, and then actually I'll be a board. I'll never do it again. All right.

207
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,380
The, the referrals, the, the referrer sites is the one I find the most fascinating. Yeah.

208
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,220
I don't really have time for any of it to be fascinating. Um,

209
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:04,060
when will the 2013, 2014 Australia pool finish and they got to my site? I'm hoping they used

210
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:10,130
Google for that one because if being brought me there, that's that's I gotta talk to the, yeah.

211
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,260
Okay. I'm closing that site. Let's move on. Test stuff. Oh, one more thing about test buffet.

212
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,900
That's interesting. That list is there. I got some mail from the guys over at appletools

213
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:30,660
at what appletools. Yeah. They, um, they had game, Apple L tools, no APP, Li tools. Okay.

214
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,740
They make a pretty cool. It's I'm not a big fan of record playback, but there's,

215
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,300
it's actually pretty good for, for what it is. I got, I got a demo online. I thought it was,

216
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,780
it's pretty neat. It was, if I was ever into that stuff, I would use that. It has some interesting,

217
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:50,140
uh, uh, features that, that gets rid of a lot of the things I hate about recording playback.

218
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,980
Although it's still recording playback. Are you talking about recording playback

219
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:59,660
automation? Yeah. Okay. So anyway, they are, uh, they're going to publish a blog post with a list of

220
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:07,180
the top. And this is the guy that wrote a book, um, sort of, well, I didn't, I made a book from

221
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,380
a series of blog posts about, you know, all the things wrong with automation kind of yet they're

222
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,620
on February 18th, they're going to publish a blog post with a list of the top 15 thought leaders

223
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,660
and test automation. And they're one that was okay if they could include me on that list,

224
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,420
but it's okay to include you. And I want to say, well, it depends who else is on the list,

225
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,220
but no, I'm going to let it go. And what's my ranking?

226
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,500
Well, I hope they go alphabetical by first name. I know. I, I bought one of those books and I

227
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:45,810
advertised it on my, um, on my, uh, blog post. All right. So can we move on? Yes. Let's move on.

228
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:54,380
Now, is this a male bank item? No. Okay. Then I won't do the song for you. No reverb this week.

229
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:05,020
Yeah. We didn't do our research this morning. Sorry guys. We Brent, this has been carefully

230
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,020
researched. I spent six hours last night and researching this and probably 28 hours the day

231
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,740
before putting in the preparation and research for this show. So don't, don't, no, there was,

232
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,620
don't try and sandbag and let them, then let them think that we are not ultimately prepared

233
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,820
for everything we do. So the next, the next topic item on, on the list today, uh,

234
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:36,940
I actually think did come from mail bag, but I no longer remember enough of the email to really,

235
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,110
give the person the right credit and, and move forward. The topic. So it's kind of

236
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:54,930
related to, uh, my most recent blog posts. That's, that's how I'm thinking of it. Um,

237
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:01,970
we've gone through a transition around getting to combine engineering where by no means done.

238
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:09,010
But combined engineering and most of that concept is, is viewed as incorporating test into the

239
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:19,890
development practice. Um, we're also on the way of flattening the org. Um, yay. I was, uh, at a meetup

240
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:28,770
last week at, um, an external company and it seems they're kind of following the same practice.

241
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:36,080
I don't know if they're taking their, their leadership from, from Microsoft or if it's

242
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,200
just a phenomenon that's actually starting to go everywhere. Yeah. I, yeah, I, I've seen it

243
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,200
everywhere. So I don't know if I don't, I really don't think they're following Microsoft, uh,

244
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,280
because it's happening. I know. It's an area where Microsoft's really following a lot of other

245
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,680
companies. So if they're really weird to say, it's, it's, it's kind of circular. I know up here

246
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:04,320
in the Seattle area, a lot of the companies, for example, Amazon, um, they took our review

247
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:10,640
process from 15 years ago and that's what they do. Yeah, that's too bad. It is. And yet they still

248
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,870
managed to succeed. So way to go Amazon. Um, the, depends on your, what's your def? Well,

249
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,500
I was going to say, it depends on your definition of success. I don't want to go off on an Amazon

250
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,860
tangent forever. So, uh, I'll let you finish. Oh, by the way, I'm not going to let you finish.

251
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:31,260
Um, as you know, I really don't like the term combined engineering. I do know that,

252
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,620
but I hear teams use the word, the phrase unified engineering, which doesn't grate on me as much.

253
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:50,700
Just FYI go on. Okay. Anyway, in all of these transitions, um, PM has essentially been left

254
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,660
untouched. And PM is program management at Microsoft. We call them program managers,

255
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,220
which is funny because they don't often program and they don't often manage.

256
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,940
They're very rarely managers in general. Uh, from my experience, you'll see, uh,

257
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:15,780
PM supporting an engineering team roughly at the rate of, um, two to three PMs per manager of an

258
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:24,100
engineering team. So the PMs themselves are often viewed as having the same sort of scope of

259
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:30,140
influence as a, as a manager of an engineering team. Um, but they are not managers. So let's

260
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:35,100
talk about, um, just for context for people that don't work at Microsoft, sort of maybe the

261
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:42,020
traditional role of a PM at Microsoft. What do you, what, what if PMs, what do they do traditionally,

262
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:47,780
not now as we transitioned, but traditionally what's their role? Uh, I've seen PMs go into two

263
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,780
distinct phases. When I first started here, the first decade, I would say they were highly

264
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:59,220
technical. Um, it was very common for the PMs to own, for example, the API definition,

265
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:07,300
uh, documenting the requirements and then handing off to, uh, engineering to execute those.

266
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,900
That's very waterfowlish.

267
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,460
It was, but that's what it was 10 years ago. Nowadays, I actually, most of the PMs are,

268
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:24,690
there's a PM, a GPM I worked with, um, years ago that he described PMs as essentially the guys

269
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,370
who do all the crap that engineering doesn't want to do.

270
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:38,100
And that's a bad definition. It is, but it's not, I mean, it's not an honorable definition,

271
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:44,180
but it's not inappropriate. What you see PMs nowadays mostly are doing scheduled driving,

272
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,820
um, uh, setting up meetings, owning communications, but the technical aspects,

273
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,900
uh, not as strong as they were the first decade.

274
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,860
That's not entirely true. That may be a little bit of sample bias. Look it up.

275
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:07,500
Maybe on your part because, um, uh, Birkin's book, which has since been renamed, but Scott Birkin

276
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,340
used to work at Microsoft. He wrote a book called the art of project management,

277
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,380
which was modeled a lot after what PMs are doing then. He left Microsoft at least 10 years ago,

278
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,940
if not 15. So what's your, so what's your subjective bias on this?

279
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:27,740
By the way, I don't care what your role is. If you care about, you know, any sort of influence or how

280
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,380
to, uh, make things happen. Actually, the book has been retitled as it's called, it's called

281
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,700
making things happen now. Okay. It's the same book with a little bit of edits and things,

282
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,500
but it's a great book on how to manage a project, whether it's a scrum team or a, or a virtual

283
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,900
team, Brent, um, or any sort of thing we have to organize people and get them to work together.

284
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,980
So I think for a long time, um, and PM sort of a catch off people that aren't,

285
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,380
you know, diving in the code every day sometimes. So, but I think for a long time, some PMs, uh,

286
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,580
their job has been to make sure to manage communication between dev and test and

287
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,140
customer and marketing, et cetera, the liaison, uh, schedules, yep. Uh, getting, making sure

288
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,740
the right people are in a room when you need to get, when you need to have a discussion in

289
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:23,440
a room to figure something out, um, sort of all that sort of overhead that helps the team

290
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,100
work together to make software. And you can see where that's leading, right? That that's the,

291
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,060
that's the positive, positive spin on what I just said. So I don't disagree.

292
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:40,610
Don't be a negative Nancy. So let me go ahead and I led there. So I'm going to start and let

293
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,410
you jump in, but you can see if that's been the traditional role of program management,

294
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:52,430
what that kind of means now, because if we have a unified engineering team and again,

295
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,630
there are generalizing specialists, not everybody's doing the same thing. There are people that are

296
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:00,190
doing more testing than more testing activities, then development activities. So that we're doing

297
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,390
more development activities and testing activities, but the right thing happens and they have

298
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,860
the right standups for communication. So they know what's going on. They know what the

299
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:15,260
roadblocks are between them. A lot of those traditional program management jobs are now

300
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,500
handled by the team. There's no reason to be a liaison between dev and test. Cause there is no

301
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,940
dev and test as an engineering team. Yep. As far as schedule goes, teams are working off back,

302
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,060
prioritizing backlogs and you may need somewhat a traditional program manager to help, you know,

303
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:35,340
either to be the product owner or to handle with the organization of, of grooming the product

304
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:39,260
backlog, some things like that. Sometimes the team may handle that a traditional PM.

305
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,780
It's often a very good role for them, but you certainly don't need as many, I think.

306
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,500
You don't. And even on the, the backlog grooming, I think initially you'll see

307
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:59,520
PMs take on the PO role, but as we see the data coming in and as we ship more frequently, and

308
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,620
Alan is messing with my mic. Yeah. I like how Brent like puts the mic in front of him that

309
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:11,820
looks at me and talks. It's really creative. Okay. They talk like people talking out the

310
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:20,240
side of their mouth, but it's really not possible. The trying to put myself out of the weeds.

311
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:29,860
So PMs will take on the PO role for, for due to prioritization, but as people get more

312
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:40,100
accustomed of doing MVPs, continuous deployment, as well as light up a solid feedback stream

313
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:50,900
from the telemetry. I even think we'll see PMs as the PO role kind of disappearing. It's not

314
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:58,500
necessarily going to be about what are the next tweaks that we need to enhance. Right.

315
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,780
What about that?

316
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:06,740
I think the agent itself will be able to optimize the current local product. The thing I think that

317
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:10,980
we'll be missing, actually, what do you think we'll be missing? What will be the role?

318
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:17,940
Let's imagine the world where the dev team has communication, collaboration has gone up. They've

319
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,340
actually gotten accustomed to a lack of command and control. So they're doing what's right versus

320
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,500
what management tells them to do. Hopefully those two are aligned, much more empowered.

321
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,100
There'll be some weakness in terms of like cross team dependencies.

322
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,940
That's exactly where I was going. I think a couple of gaps, when I was thinking of going,

323
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:45,060
the obvious gaps to me are everybody talks about scaling agile and there's things like

324
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,940
safe, which are, Brent's gone through training on that.

325
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,540
I am the first certified safe professional for Microsoft.

326
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,020
That's great.

327
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,340
It's cool.

328
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,540
But whether you use safe or not or something, I think there's a big challenge. We have companies

329
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:05,380
as huge as Microsoft and product teams. I tell people, I work on a relatively small

330
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:15,140
team at Microsoft. It's 200 people. I think there is definitely room for people to make sure

331
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:22,740
coordination happens, especially around dependencies between teams working together

332
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,900
to make those things happen. That's a great role for that big systems thinker P and make

333
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,460
sure the right pieces are happening and getting that communication going.

334
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:38,620
I think we don't really have very many technical assistance at Microsoft anymore. Definitely not

335
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,900
at levels lower than some of the VPs or presidents.

336
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,540
I'm not certain. I'm not used to that title.

337
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,580
We've had technical assistance in the past. Bill Gates used to have a couple.

338
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:54,220
I was in engineering excellence. I interviewed three different teams. Basically what they did

339
00:31:54,460 --> 00:32:01,340
was they made sure that any time there was any sort of roll up to executives, that their job

340
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,940
did not waste executives' time was to go talk with each of the teams that was presenting and

341
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,940
making sure they had their ducks in a row. Last time he gave you feedback that said,

342
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,060
do A, B, and C. Let's make sure you get those done before you come back. Otherwise,

343
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:19,900
it's going to get mad. That grooming there. I think that sort of role is obviously valuable

344
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:25,340
for an executive, but even as you're communicating up the chain, sort of that person to coordinate,

345
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:32,560
the coordinator of coordinators almost. I was just thinking about TAs yesterday and how

346
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,360
one of the VPs in my chain, actually the only VP in my chain, now I've given that away,

347
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,120
could sure use that because there's a lot of chaos, I think, in what he hears from his team.

348
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,800
Someone needs to kind of organize that. Then I was thinking as you were talking there,

349
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,800
that sort of role, and really these are all coordinator roles I'm talking about,

350
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:59,810
or sort of the future of PM, but that's something that needs to happen. I guess that needs to happen

351
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:06,770
today, let alone in the future, but I do see a lot of value in people that can do that.

352
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:12,210
That's not typically someone who's come up through development or testing. You need somebody who

353
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:20,770
this that can figure out, get to the crux of the issue, ask the right question, get the right people

354
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,450
in the room, and get the right conversations happening, so as to not waste people's time.

355
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:32,910
I agree with that. The other thing that I thought you were going to go to is a role I foresee in

356
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:41,230
the future for program management. So now we have all these sort of disjoint teams,

357
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:47,550
empowered teams. Command and control isn't really as strong as it is today.

358
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,060
One of the principles around empowering a small team is you basically are trying to push

359
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:59,780
decision making down to the people who have the best information available.

360
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,780
Yes. Let's pause there, because that's important.

361
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:04,100
It is.

362
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,770
We both know leaders who insist on being involved in decisions way below where they should be.

363
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,610
I believe that decisions can be made as close to the product as possible.

364
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:16,450
That was a repeat. Go on.

365
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:25,010
If you have these empowered teams and you have little tribes in a large org,

366
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:32,370
let's imagine you're a 200 person org, it's somehow split into 18 to 20

367
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,450
little teams of 10 or maybe even 10 teams of 20.

368
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:41,810
So the coordination becomes critical, but if you do it in the command and control

369
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,970
model, that's going to be less than optimal. You want to empower these guys.

370
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:52,670
So how do you do that? I actually think it's the PM role that will fill in that blank.

371
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,280
More from a business aspect, as you just got through saying, one of the biggest

372
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:08,900
things that ends up being lacking is where to go next, how to take our current assets and

373
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,860
build a better business. I actually think that's where PM is going to end up going.

374
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,660
Business focused.

375
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,010
More business focused. And then I believe that we still need coordination,

376
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,770
but at a much higher level than the providing today.

377
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,410
And I think we'll have a couple of coordinators. I think that's probably where

378
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:31,970
the release manager type role will probably migrate.

379
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,610
Yeah, I think there's other things too. I think there's a definite skill there.

380
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,130
There is a talent.

381
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:44,220
It almost goes back to that, I don't want to say project management, but I'm reflecting on,

382
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,780
I've read making things happen a couple times now, probably three or four times actually,

383
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:55,250
because it's actually it's really good, even if you're not a PM. And some of those things,

384
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,610
I should go highlight which chapters I think are really relevant in the future,

385
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:04,480
because some of those those core issues are going to be important in the future of PM at Microsoft.

386
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:12,190
I agree. Do you agree with my point in terms of these guys being the business owners?

387
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:16,670
Yeah, but as much as I hate to agree with you, yeah, I think that's important.

388
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:17,230
I think I agree with that.

389
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,030
But in a different aspect, I don't think these are going to be the guys

390
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,270
that are triaging bugs.

391
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,950
No, I don't want them there.

392
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,310
They are going to be the guys.

393
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,750
Too many people in the room already.

394
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:31,230
Looking at the market, looking at our current technical assets and saying,

395
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,710
hey, I think there's an opportunity here.

396
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:39,470
Let's let's call cobble up an experiment or a prototype release it out to that market and see

397
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,230
what comes back.

398
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,250
Now, let me ask you, with the current PMs in our in our organization,

399
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,340
I don't want to answer this question.

400
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:57,620
How many how many of them do you think are going to make either of these two bars that we just laid out?

401
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,600
So I don't I don't think any PMs listen to our podcast.

402
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,200
No, no, we're just.

403
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,280
And actually, I don't think any PMs at Microsoft listen to any tech or software podcasts.

404
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,760
But here's one email me if I'm wrong.

405
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,520
No, here's one thing to be aware of, though.

406
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:24,030
Shinsung, yeah, took my blog post about PM and sent it to the Yammer group PMs at Microsoft.

407
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,990
That's oh, I have to go look at that group.

408
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,160
Yammer, the big echo chamber of Microsoft.

409
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:32,320
Yeah.

410
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,440
I thought about this before.

411
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,810
I think there's a couple of factors.

412
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,210
Hold on.

413
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,620
So I understand why you're cautious.

414
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:42,980
I'm not.

415
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,300
But think of it as we care about our brothers in the PM org.

416
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:53,380
And this is how we can help differentiate those who actually listen to us to be in the right place.

417
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,780
So this is what I would say to anyone, you know,

418
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,710
in PM or thinking at PM.

419
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:00,910
So I'm not going to be too cautious.

420
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,670
I think it's I'm going to be frank.

421
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:06,160
Definitely.

422
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,120
We're going to need fewer PMs in the future than we have now.

423
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,240
For sure.

424
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,000
That that I think that's a given.

425
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,720
If you disagree with that, please think again.

426
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:20,480
I think of the current PM population.

427
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,970
Just to be clear, I actually think it'll be much fewer.

428
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320
So of the current population, there are a chunk.

429
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,800
We do have some that would work fit in just fine on an engineering team

430
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,190
doing some of the design stuff, some of the, you know, as a regular software engineer,

431
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,110
not a P.O., but just jump right in.

432
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,710
We have some of those around.

433
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,670
We have some PMs.

434
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,630
We have a PM on our team who's fantastic at data science stuff.

435
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,150
So I'll put it, you know, that's that would fit right on the engineering team.

436
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,470
Yeah.

437
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:54,910
They've other PMs.

438
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,260
I don't know what percentage.

439
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,660
We have some PMs who get that business focus.

440
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,870
A lot aren't though, as I think through, I'm just thinking through not just my current team,

441
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:09,470
but the PMs I've worked with over the last five years or so.

442
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,190
And a lot of them are feature focused.

443
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:13,950
Feature focus.

444
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,070
Gantt chart monkeys.

445
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,270
Yeah.

446
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,710
So boy, boy, I think, I think a small chunk can fit in.

447
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:32,510
Another small chunk will adapt to the changing role of what PMs will do at Microsoft.

448
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:37,170
And then that other chunk, I'm a little lost.

449
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:41,970
I don't, you know, I don't want to say fear for your, necessarily say fear for your job or anything,

450
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,290
but I'll put it this way instead.

451
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,920
If you're a PM and you don't, you don't get what your role would be as a coordinator

452
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,920
among agile teams, or you don't get, or you're not interested in relating what your team is doing

453
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,720
to the world and having a business strategy.

454
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,840
Or I guess that's it.

455
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,160
If you're not on board with those things, or if you don't think that your skills transfer to

456
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,040
what engineering teams are doing or will be doing in the short term,

457
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,440
those are skills you're going to want to ramp up on in order to continue to be valuable at Microsoft.

458
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:17,680
Yeah.

459
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:24,290
That there's one other aspect that I've noticed in a couple of teams, and I wonder if this will

460
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:26,530
turn into a tipping point and have it be common.

461
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:34,530
I see design teams, which have generally been rather small at the company, beginning to strengthen

462
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,170
and bolster.

463
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:43,790
And I wonder if we'll see many more people shifting over to the design aspect.

464
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,500
And in CPMs.

465
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:54,210
I just thought of something else when you said design is that one reason to keep a few more

466
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:00,050
PMs in one other role there is I would really like to go ape shit crazy on experimentation

467
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,650
across our entire product lines.

468
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,410
There's our reference to AB testing, but I think that's a great thing for PMs to figure out,

469
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,170
to design and drive and figure out, okay, we're going to do this treatment and this treatment

470
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,450
is what we're going to expect from that.

471
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:14,530
And then people can do the work.

472
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:18,530
I don't think your typical dev and test are great at figuring out what those treatments

473
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,410
are for an experiment.

474
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:25,490
That's something, that's a great role that someone needs to do.

475
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,450
And I want to go just like I said, just crazy trying things out.

476
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:31,730
I love experiments.

477
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,850
I love them, love them, love them.

478
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,290
We should definitely use some of our resources to invest in that in the future.

479
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:46,050
In my team, I've been very deeply engaged with my design team on this same space.

480
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,130
They're all about hypothesis testing.

481
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:52,210
They generate a series of different hypotheses and a different set of experiments.

482
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,250
And there's actually two problems.

483
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,130
Number one, the technical assets aren't there yet.

484
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:10,960
And partially, a lot of orgs are having challenges towards shifting up and building those technical

485
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,040
assets to light up experimentation.

486
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:22,560
And the other thing too is they have a sense that there are so many hypotheses that are

487
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:31,500
important for them to test and generate that they even are short on people in terms of

488
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
thinking through these aspects.

489
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:39,100
So they're not able to scale from a people front and from a technical front.

490
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,860
But they have the process aligned of what they want to execute on.

491
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:49,540
Yeah, and I wonder, and this is a good topic to ponder, but I talked about PMs,

492
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,820
but really for anyone, you need to look at where engine, it's pretty easy if you're

493
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,060
at Microsoft or whatever company you're at.

494
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,820
How are we doing engineering today?

495
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,780
And predicting the future is hard, but you have an idea what it's going to look like maybe

496
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,180
six months or a year, what direction we're going in.

497
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:08,820
And am I, you think to yourself, how valuable are my skills going to be in that model?

498
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:12,980
And either if you're lacking things, great opportunity to learn.

499
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,380
Yep.

500
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,660
This is really true for anyone.

501
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,860
You need to be adapt, I think to be successful in software or actually to be successful in any

502
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:23,220
knowledge work, you need to be adaptable and willing to learn new things.

503
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,220
Yeah, there's only, so you just said they need to look at what direction they're going.

504
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,020
I'm going to clarify that because I don't think it's the direction that matters as much,

505
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,580
but the goal that we're trying to achieve.

506
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,500
And we've talked about this over and over again.

507
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:44,700
The goal is amping up the speed to building a solid stable business.

508
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:54,190
And I think PMs can play a very valuable role there, but they need to understand that's the goal

509
00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:00,030
and make sure that their direction is intended when that goal is achievable,

510
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:02,110
that they're already prepared.

511
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,460
Right?

512
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:08,500
The, I think one of the competition is we're going to find, so I've gone back to school,

513
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:15,620
I know that academia is actually teaching kids this sort of skill set.

514
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,700
So there's a lot of college hires coming in.

515
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,480
They're going to be already 50% the way there.

516
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,160
Yeah, be cool.

517
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:24,640
Yeah.

518
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,840
All right, man, we're out of time.

519
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,480
We are.

520
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,240
So I'm still Alan.

521
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,560
I am Brent as well.

522
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:32,720
All right.

523
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,920
And this was, by the way, episode 17.

524
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,560
Yeah, prime number.

525
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,280
We're very good.

526
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:37,920
Woo hoo.

527
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,400
All right.

528
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:38,640
All right.

529
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,360
Thanks, guys.

530
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,000
See you later.

531
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,720
Bye.
