1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,320
Hey everybody, Brent is at a loss for words,

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,740
but he is in the room with me.

3
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:19,940
Hey Brent, you okay?

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,220
No, no I'm not.

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,340
Hi everyone.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,420
Hey, what episode are we today?

7
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,460
59.

8
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,340
We are here at episode 59 of AB testing.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,820
Welcome the three and welcome new listeners

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,330
and welcome all.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,330
We're an inclusive podcast.

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:39,170
Don't you think?

13
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,010
I do.

14
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,390
So I was in, shoot, was it just last week?

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,830
I spent all of last week in beautiful Copenhagen.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,670
I am so jealous.

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,390
I blogged about it.

18
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,170
Although I was in beautiful Copenhagen,

19
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,670
I spent most of the time indoors.

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,150
The full story is on my blog, plug plug,

21
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,310
but we have an R&D training week and I attended.

22
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,470
I haven't written C++ code in a long time

23
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,430
and that the assignment was C++ and I wrote a lot of code

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,310
and damn it if I wasn't gonna work till nine or 10

25
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,350
at night, every night, making sure I could finish

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,470
the assignment to prove that I knew what I was doing.

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,750
If I was successful, I wrote code that solved the assignment

28
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,230
and did it very quickly using multi-threaded code

29
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:22,830
and all kinds of goodness and then when I looked back

30
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,950
at the code after I was done, I realized I wrote

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,430
some of the crappiest code in my life.

32
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,270
That worked.

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,870
So I lost sight of the goal.

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,950
Maybe the goal was to finish it and learn

35
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:36,430
and I got the meta winnings out of it.

36
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,850
I learned a lot how the Unity engine worked

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,090
and I was able to make it work and if I wanna be

38
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,150
optimistic about it, I'll say I wrote a prototype.

39
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,150
If I were to do the whole exercise again,

40
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,870
I would focus more on writing a lot of tests up front

41
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,870
and doing more of a minimum viable product approach

42
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,590
like I normally want to do, but I'm normally not

43
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,550
programming something in a, it wasn't a competitive

44
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,470
atmosphere yet it was.

45
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:10,150
There were 15 of us and I didn't, I wanted,

46
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,790
there were some people that knew what they were doing

47
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,370
and they were getting ahead of me and I wanted to catch up.

48
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,170
I was actually just taking your whole thing

49
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,060
and thinking of it as a analogy for why waterfall sucks

50
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,100
and why the scrum sprint model sucks

51
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,300
because what you just described is exactly the code

52
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,780
I see over and over again when someone's given

53
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,780
something with a deadline that doesn't include.

54
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,460
So maybe the difference is that I looked back

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,220
at my code and said holy crap, this is shit

56
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,060
and a lot of people would just go hey it works,

57
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,950
ship it.

58
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,950
But there was more to this.

59
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,670
The point I wanted to get to, you can read all about

60
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,750
that on my blog, it was a fun exercise, I'm glad I did it,

61
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,550
very educational for me, I feel like I know so much more

62
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,870
about the engine side, I focus on services as part

63
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,910
of my job, so it was good to figure out how that works.

64
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,310
I went through one of the tutorials in preparation

65
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,830
for this, to build this tanks game

66
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,910
and just amazing what Unity can do.

67
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,470
I never, it's, I know I'm just scratching the surface,

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,270
there's an amazing amount of stuff, but the point

69
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,150
was that I, in this weird world of today,

70
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,910
that sounds like the intro to a bad tech article,

71
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,510
in today's modern world of engineering,

72
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,710
it's like shut up, I posted the blog and my blog

73
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,710
sends little ticklers to Twitter and to LinkedIn

74
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,750
and of course all the replies to my blog post

75
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,600
are on LinkedIn, because that's the way

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,000
the world works today.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,600
And yeah, so there are no replies to my blog post

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,120
on my blog site, but because when I post to my blog,

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
it posts little tickler to LinkedIn,

80
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,240
people replied and discussed it there.

81
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,280
And then, I'm gonna make a long story longer,

82
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,040
there was a discussion about whether developers

83
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
could test their code and I said sure,

84
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,480
developers can test their code as long as they

85
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,640
wanna remain employed.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,280
And so I said well, somebody came in and,

87
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
for lack of a better word, and I am a white male,

88
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,040
so the last person that could really use this verb,

89
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,520
someone mansplained to me, that what I was talking about

90
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
wasn't testing, it was checking.

91
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,520
And what developers do with their code is checking.

92
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,360
And so.

93
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,600
Wait, wait, wait, wait, I know where you're going.

94
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
No, no you don't, no you don't.

95
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,250
Well, I don't know where you're going,

96
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,250
but I already have a rant sort of built up in my head

97
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,410
or a suggestion, so before you add too many

98
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,570
of these things, I'm old, let's close one out.

99
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,500
All right.

100
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,410
What do you think would have happened in this assignment?

101
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,170
You said it was an assignment, okay?

102
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,680
Correct.

103
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,060
I wanna change that game.

104
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,100
So the game I'm gonna propose is whatever your feature

105
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,540
or whatever problem you had to solve,

106
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,580
winner of the game is gonna be defined by who

107
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,420
first wrote the first code, okay?

108
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,500
But the game works this way.

109
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,340
The assignment as you've defined it,

110
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,940
as it was laid out to you, whatever the heck it was,

111
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:37,060
you can write this solution in C++.

112
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,480
But you tell everybody up front that this is due tomorrow.

113
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,320
We're not going to tell you the next phase,

114
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,200
but this competition is two parts.

115
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,680
Tomorrow, everybody's name's gonna go in a hat

116
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,440
and everyone's gonna get a new feature

117
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,480
and you're going to have to add that new feature

118
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,250
to the person's code who you draw from the hat.

119
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,250
Okay.

120
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,790
The winner is going to be assigned

121
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,110
to the person who first wrote the code.

122
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,310
That may work in a different scenario.

123
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,670
What would it have done last week?

124
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,990
This whole, the meta points I got out of it,

125
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,430
which was grepping through all the code

126
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,190
to learn how the engine worked,

127
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,710
my hunch is that is the true goal of this.

128
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,420
Yeah, I don't care.

129
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:35,350
I do because I don't wanna get too much into details,

130
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,830
but the assignment really was to one,

131
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,590
write a component that will take,

132
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:43,430
that will put an action on any game object in the game.

133
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,430
It's write a component that you can apply

134
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,940
to any Unity game object and have it do this thing.

135
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,460
Again, don't wanna give away details

136
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,380
in case Unity people are coming up.

137
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,020
And then that one, supposed to test it

138
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:59,060
with like 10,000 objects and the time was for all of us

139
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,780
right around 800 milliseconds.

140
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,220
Fast, but not game fast.

141
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,820
So the idea was then is to multi-thread this

142
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,940
using a job system much like thread pools,

143
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,740
actually almost exactly like thread pools on Windows,

144
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,580
but cross platform for threading.

145
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,020
Learn how to use this brand new job system.

146
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,580
Not documented, but very well documented in header files,

147
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,140
not documented in words and examples.

148
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,460
Yep.

149
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,780
So in doing that, in learning how to use this,

150
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,940
the first part was fairly easy, just doing some math.

151
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,780
Pretty much everyone had that done the first day.

152
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,860
The next day's assignment and the next couple days,

153
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,420
we would have classes in the morning

154
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,820
about all kinds of different stuff,

155
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,940
but the, was to continue to iterate and refine this

156
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,260
using this job system to,

157
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,460
one, to really, the goal was to learn the job system,

158
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,540
maybe it was the primary goal, maybe secondary,

159
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,940
with the parallel goal, I'll say,

160
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,900
of learning how the engine works

161
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,620
by having to grip through all kinds of code

162
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620
to figure out how what you're doing works.

163
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,460
I get that.

164
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,940
And I also get where you're coming from, yes.

165
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,620
I think it teaches code maintenance

166
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,820
and writing code to be maintainable

167
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,860
if you have to build on top of somebody else's code.

168
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,300
If you knew.

169
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,220
It's a different exercise.

170
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,860
If you knew, and I get that.

171
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,860
I'm just trying to, I'm trying to address the,

172
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,420
you solved the problem, screw you devs,

173
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,420
I can write C++ too, get that, pat yourself on the back.

174
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,770
But the, it's not anything that you would check in.

175
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,530
It's not anything that you were proud of.

176
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,930
So what I'm trying to think through is,

177
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:39,850
how do we change the system

178
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:44,850
such that you would have naturally said,

179
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,850
no, I'm not done until I know

180
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:50,570
that the next guy that's picking up my code

181
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,050
is going to be able to move forward.

182
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,290
So ask me a different question.

183
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,770
Ask me how I would improve the exercise

184
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,550
for future people taking it.

185
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,510
Hey Alan, I have a spontaneous question for you.

186
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,790
You are so damn smart, Brent.

187
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,630
Yeah.

188
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,790
Ask me anything you want.

189
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,630
Anything?

190
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,470
Yes.

191
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,310
Anything?

192
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,150
Whatever comes to mind.

193
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:13,420
How about, how would you improve this exercise

194
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,780
in the future?

195
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,420
Well, thanks Brent for asking.

196
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,920
It's something I've pondered just a little bit.

197
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,600
I think I spent a little bit too much,

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,800
and some of this is worth it.

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,440
I think if you've done any amount of coding

200
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,000
grepping around the internet

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,080
and trying to find little samples of how to do things.

202
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,720
There's some learning in that

203
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,040
that goes beyond just coming up with the right solution.

204
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,800
But I feel like there was a little bit too much

205
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,920
of that head banging against the wall,

206
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,560
not sure how this to work.

207
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,600
I would have loved a little bit more documentation

208
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,560
to accelerate, still make you dig around a lot,

209
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,400
or at least examples of other code doing something similar

210
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,340
so I could still have that learning

211
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,860
of grepping around the system,

212
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,700
but made a little bit more progress.

213
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,460
And I would have loved if the goal was to,

214
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,460
at the end, your code is ready for check-in.

215
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,580
Meaning, not only is it complete

216
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,140
and you think it's ready to be reviewed,

217
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,820
but it has tests written for it

218
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,860
and you feel like it's robust and solid

219
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,020
and everything's done for it.

220
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,220
We had a couple tests that were written for us

221
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,220
as part of the framework,

222
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,700
and we could have added to that.

223
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,610
I never got to that.

224
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,270
I could have written them first,

225
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,710
then I wouldn't have finished,

226
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,030
but I would have loved to, given my background,

227
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,390
written a whole bunch of really great

228
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,270
unit and integration tests for this component

229
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,950
to prove its reliability, to prove its performance,

230
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,950
along with being code that,

231
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:38,530
I feel like this is code that really, really works,

232
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,590
but I couldn't get there.

233
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,150
And actually, only a few people got to that stage

234
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,950
where it was, in fact, they didn't even get any tests done.

235
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,670
Nobody, I don't know if anybody that had,

236
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,230
actually, there were two people

237
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,750
who work on the engine full-time

238
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,550
who maybe got some more tests written

239
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,430
and had a working component.

240
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,470
But I think it would have been better

241
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,430
if the goal was to get,

242
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,350
and that would have been more of a Unity developer workflow.

243
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,870
How to get something ready to check in,

244
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,190
go through a couple real code reviews

245
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,750
to see what kind of feedback you would give or get

246
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,790
and how you'd react to those,

247
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,790
learn from each other's tests that they wrote,

248
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,630
some things like that.

249
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,830
So we didn't get to those

250
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,790
because there was too much headbanging

251
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,930
and just figuring out how to make the thing work.

252
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,810
Yeah, so essentially because you got knee deep

253
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,110
in an infinite onion peeling exercise,

254
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,410
you couldn't really move forward

255
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,530
until you completed the onion peeling exercise

256
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,610
and you made a trade-off between onion peeling and TDD.

257
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,330
Now the question is, and this is a common thing with TDD.

258
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:53,090
TDD is intended to help you onion peel at the same time.

259
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,430
And but when you add in this time pressure

260
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:01,530
and you don't add in a requirement that

261
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,290
once you submit this, this is no longer your code,

262
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,120
it encourages this behavior.

263
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
That's my own thing.

264
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,660
And to be fair, there was no,

265
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,430
some people, many people didn't even finish

266
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:18,830
and there was no like belittling of that.

267
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,790
The pressure I put, the pressure put on me

268
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,350
to complete this thing and have it work

269
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,360
was entirely put upon me by me.

270
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,040
It was purely for my ego to show I could write,

271
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,920
I could still write C++ code

272
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,800
and I wasn't just some lame QA director guy

273
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,480
showing up to hang out.

274
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,600
Yeah, but here's the real secret.

275
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,360
What do you actually think is the difference

276
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,400
in your mentality here

277
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,400
versus 80% of every actual developer engineer

278
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,560
you've ever met?

279
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,880
They wanna prove their worth.

280
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,400
And I'm saying the square root of nothing.

281
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,270
That's exactly the same.

282
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,930
Now, the specific reason why you wanna prove it

283
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,350
to yourself may be different.

284
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,070
Right, and that's actually in my view

285
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,100
one of the roots of the problem

286
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,340
around this unified engineering model.

287
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,150
In my team, we solve this because everyone's expected

288
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,990
to be able to work on everyone's pieces of code.

289
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,990
And so it forces,

290
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,170
I don't have to create a gauntlet rules.

291
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,050
It forces a normalization of standards.

292
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:36,890
I'm gonna make a statement

293
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,450
then I wanna pop the stack and go back.

294
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,370
The statement is I think the exercise succeeded

295
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,330
in making us learn a lot more about how the engine works

296
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,650
but failed in making us understand

297
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,950
how to be a successful engineer at Unity.

298
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,880
Because it didn't go into enough of the things

299
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,540
that you really need to do to write quality code.

300
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,240
Yeah, it doesn't sound like that second bit

301
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,400
was part of their goal.

302
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
I don't think it was, but I think it should have been.

303
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,560
If I were a director in Unity,

304
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,640
I might suggest something along those lines.

305
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,360
This was really awesome.

306
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,440
I'd like to add another thing to this.

307
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,680
One of the reasons I attended as a QA director of services

308
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,040
to this thing geared more towards engine people

309
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,280
was so that I could understand its relevance

310
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,400
for people in our org or where we may want to differ.

311
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,160
And I talked to our director,

312
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,560
we have a director of HR assigned to just engineering.

313
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,320
He's just assigned for engineering growth and HR things.

314
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,760
He's an awesome guy.

315
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,240
I talked to him actually even before I started at Unity.

316
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,480
And we talked about this exact thing

317
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,880
and it's definitely something on his radar

318
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,360
how to tweak this training to work across the org.

319
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,760
So we'll talk more about that.

320
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,030
So popping the stack, once upon a time,

321
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,230
an hour or two ago,

322
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:00,510
was talking about how someone explained to me,

323
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,390
persons explained to me that what I was talking about

324
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,270
in these tests that I wrote for my code

325
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,710
weren't really tests, they were checking.

326
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,590
And then there are the checking testing folks.

327
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,910
So Michael Bolton especially,

328
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,190
James Bach isn't really involved on Twitter much anymore.

329
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,030
Who says that I've never seen a case

330
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:20,910
of someone correcting someone else.

331
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,710
You guys are just making this stuff up

332
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,950
and I see it all the time.

333
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,550
So when I saw this one, I had the document,

334
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,310
it's like I wrote a tweet for the record.

335
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,950
I just saw this blah, blah, blah.

336
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,950
And then I have never been in a longer tweet thread

337
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,540
that won't go away.

338
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,660
So many replies and replies and replies

339
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,540
and changes of subjects and examples of defensive testing,

340
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,820
examples of this thing and there's probably a name

341
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
for this you can think of,

342
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,220
but what's it called when your purpose

343
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,580
on Twitter or social media is to just prove

344
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,420
that you know more about something than those around you?

345
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,180
Lot of that going on.

346
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,340
And I look, I fortunately have a do not disturb

347
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,560
on my phone.

348
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,400
Called Blovey8.

349
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,880
I have a do not disturb window on my phone

350
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,840
from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

351
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,480
where there won't be any buzzes or anything.

352
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,560
And I woke up this morning,

353
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,280
look at my phone and I have little,

354
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,960
you know you have new Twitter notifications.

355
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,720
Sometimes there's not any and I don't care.

356
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,820
Sometimes there's three or four.

357
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,800
Last night 87, overnight.

358
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,620
It's like oh my God.

359
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,000
So the thread won't die.

360
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
It just goes on and on.

361
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,920
That's my checking versus testing.

362
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,600
Has it breathed its own life or?

363
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,480
It's gone in so many different directions.

364
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,080
Twitter needs a feature to be able to remove yourself

365
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,330
from a thread.

366
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,170
Yes.

367
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,410
I guess TweetDeck probably has a mute or something.

368
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,770
Anyway, that's my checking versus testing.

369
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,770
Why don't you reply to the Tweet

370
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,410
and say take me off of this Tweet thread?

371
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,410
Bedlam, bedlam.

372
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,030
Hashtag bedlam.

373
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,600
Yeah, I'm just like oh man.

374
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,740
We've talked about checking and testing before.

375
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,280
I do think it's valuable in terms of having to discuss

376
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,270
sort of more precisely what we're trying to do

377
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,950
with these different efforts.

378
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:23,430
But my goodness, it is absolutely not worth

379
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,830
a religious war in any sort.

380
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,430
Well, it's obliviating.

381
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,210
It's an interesting distinction.

382
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,250
If someone had some long winded thing and says,

383
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,090
the way I see it, checking is a blah, blah, blah,

384
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,570
and I replied simply saying, the way I see it,

385
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,210
some of my testing has binary results.

386
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,510
I think it's a way for, and I'm not sure if it's,

387
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,110
maybe it's because I watch testing threads more often

388
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,970
or I think it's really because there's more insecurity

389
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:03,970
among testers that many of them feel the need

390
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,250
to express their knowledge.

391
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,610
Like oh, here, let me tell you what I know

392
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:11,890
because you probably don't know it

393
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,330
because I frickin' rock.

394
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,970
It's like shut up.

395
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:21,100
So it's an interesting distinction that is not worth

396
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,660
bringing up unless the topic is about

397
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,620
checking versus testing.

398
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,570
Otherwise, shut the hell up.

399
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,410
No.

400
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,020
Let's take a break to hear from our sponsor.

401
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,760
This episode of A.B. testing is brought to you by Cobaton.

402
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,960
Remember Cobaton?

403
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,440
We talked about them in A.B. testing 57.

404
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,160
So Cobaton asks this of the three.

405
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,240
Is managing internal devices

406
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,420
one of the best parts of your job?

407
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,520
Doubt it.

408
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,620
Check out Cobaton, your complete mobile device lab solution.

409
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,840
Cobaton allows you to manage the devices you own.

410
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,720
That's right, you can plug in your own devices

411
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,440
into Cobaton's network and access the real devices

412
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,840
you need from manual to automation testing.

413
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,760
Cobaton empowers developers and testers

414
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,120
to build great products faster.

415
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,640
One of the things I like about Cobaton

416
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
is that you can both run automated tests

417
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,320
and connect to these devices and test manually

418
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,000
to see how things look and make sure look and feel

419
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,170
is what you are planning for.

420
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,250
Manage and access internal and external devices

421
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,730
all in one place allowing you to test on hundreds

422
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,090
of devices and configurations.

423
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,650
Identify and resolve issues more quickly

424
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,090
with automatically created activity logs.

425
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,890
Even centralize your testing history

426
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,050
to increase collaboration across teams and locations.

427
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,530
Cobaton does all of that while minimizing costs

428
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,890
and enabling you to get your app to market sooner.

429
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,770
Visit cobaton.com, K-O-B-I-T-O-N.com,

430
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,410
slash A-B testing to sign up for a free trial

431
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,850
and start testing in minutes.

432
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,350
I'll post these into show notes

433
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,670
but I have to tell you if you are building

434
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,190
any sort of mobile solution,

435
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,870
you have to be using something like Cobaton

436
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:14,030
to get your job done otherwise you're swinging in the dark.

437
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:17,790
I would have to say like multiple times

438
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,820
where if I had to do browser compat or device compat,

439
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,900
like we've both worked in the device spaces.

440
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,740
Yep.

441
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,860
With massive internal labs costing

442
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,860
not just massive amounts of money in internal costs

443
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,380
but also in real estate,

444
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,580
that space that could have been used for offices.

445
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,580
Yeah and you have to invent whole new protocol stack

446
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,120
if you want to try to,

447
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,200
like each device has a different means

448
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,240
by which you try to communicate.

449
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,920
It's a real pain in the butt

450
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,120
and you spend 80% of your effort

451
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,980
just putting the infrastructure together.

452
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,700
Definitely, I would definitely,

453
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,980
if I was in the space today,

454
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,490
I would definitely be going and signing up with Cobaton.

455
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,870
Awesome, so check it out.

456
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,370
One other non-sponsored advertisement,

457
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,490
I'm giving a talk, a keynote

458
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,970
at the online testing conference, June 13th and 14th.

459
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:23,690
I'm just on the 13th, I'm 7.15 in the morning.

460
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,450
Left Coast time, that's 10.15 on the right coast.

461
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,810
Do the math if you live elsewhere.

462
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,850
And speaking about a subject

463
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,050
that came up originally on A-B testing,

464
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,460
which is the bazillion different ways

465
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,500
you can do technical testing

466
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,260
or be a technical tester without writing code.

467
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,720
And honestly, what is a non-technical tester?

468
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:54,250
Wouldn't that be what they would say UI testers are?

469
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,630
I don't know, I don't know.

470
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,230
But perhaps-

471
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:01,430
The minimum wage kids they hire to test games?

472
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,750
Maybe, maybe.

473
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,230
Yeah, so I'll talk a lot about that and my opinions there.

474
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,570
My talks, as you know, are always full of opinions.

475
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,710
I will make sure I have lots of pretty pictures

476
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,310
and some stupid things to say

477
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,230
because I need to make sure that I can attempt

478
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,270
to be engaging even though my audience is virtual

479
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,870
and I can't see them.

480
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,750
I do so much better, even as an introvert.

481
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,640
I enjoy giving talks, but I find them much easier to do

482
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,760
when I can interact with the audience.

483
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,900
So these things are always a little bit more difficult,

484
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,720
but I will do my best to make it entertaining,

485
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,560
fun, and informative.

486
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,480
I definitely prefer the presentations

487
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,080
where we just open up, yeah, interrupt us.

488
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,440
We love interaction.

489
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,420
Yeah. Right?

490
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,520
But if you take away the ability to sort of read

491
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:02,490
body language, so much of my presentation style

492
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,310
is to be able to quickly read a body language

493
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,050
and go in a different direction.

494
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,210
Mm-hmm, yeah, me too.

495
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,490
That's gonna be interesting.

496
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,330
It's always a challenge.

497
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,830
If you have no idea if what you're saying

498
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:20,760
is you've lost your audience, how do you fix it?

499
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,220
I will just try and keep it entertaining.

500
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,060
I've seen a lot of, I mean, it's boring enough

501
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,820
when you go to an in-person talk

502
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,580
and someone is reading slides,

503
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,500
but I've seen online presentations the same.

504
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,700
That is a snooze fest.

505
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,820
I promise I will not read slides.

506
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,140
If you've seen my talks before,

507
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,780
I am famous for having about 15 words

508
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:46,230
in my entire 40-minute talk on slides.

509
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,830
So plenty of pictures of Brent,

510
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,550
and no, maybe not Brent,

511
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,030
but there'll be something going on there.

512
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,190
So check that out, Online Test Conference.

513
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,190
If I do my job, I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

514
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,140
All right.

515
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,340
All right, one topic we wanted to discuss

516
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,380
with our remaining time today

517
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,020
is something that's come up directly and indirectly,

518
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,220
and it kinda leads a little bit

519
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,620
out of our checking versus testing discussion,

520
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,540
but I don't wanna call it the future of testing.

521
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,660
Let's talk about what modern testing is.

522
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,260
So Brent, what does modern testing mean to you?

523
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,040
What is, let's start with that

524
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,000
and we'll see where it goes.

525
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Modern testing at a very high level is essentially what?

526
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:39,040
So we agree that the goal of a test team,

527
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,920
a test asset testing,

528
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,640
actually, let's first talk about,

529
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,760
well, I wanna talk about their testing the process,

530
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,340
not testing the discipline.

531
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,660
So modern testing is,

532
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,180
testing's role is to accelerate the achievement

533
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,780
of shipable quality.

534
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Shipable quality, thank you for correcting my own quote.

535
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,020
It's mine now, I took it.

536
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:17,360
So if testing's role is at acceleration,

537
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,200
it's the getting to shipable quality.

538
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,200
In my mind as well, there's a focus around risk reduction,

539
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,280
like testing is like an insurance policy.

540
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,070
How much do you invest in it

541
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,950
so that you get the correct amount of payback

542
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,950
if something goes wry or prevention of a wry?

543
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:49,710
And then the definition of modern in my mind is,

544
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,800
what is different about the opportunities,

545
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,160
what's available to us in terms of how software is used

546
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:04,320
and produced in today's world versus the world

547
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,060
that existed when a lot of these testing dogma

548
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,490
were first created, right?

549
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:21,160
The previous topic lit on checking versus testing,

550
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,130
that in my view comes from that old world.

551
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,930
Yeah, a lot of that old world is, I think, way too prevalent

552
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,930
and in many ways detracts from the evolution of testing.

553
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,450
There was a discussion we had on our,

554
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:40,730
one of the three Slack channel,

555
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,370
around this concept of tester as information provider.

556
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,970
And it was a great conversation,

557
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,650
thank you three for chipping in on that.

558
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,770
I believe that tester as information provider is,

559
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,180
I can almost call it passive, but it's a cop out.

560
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:59,900
When I look at that as the role,

561
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,420
the testing activity and role is so much more than that.

562
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,660
I don't like the idea of a tester is,

563
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,780
here's what I found out, you make the decision,

564
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,620
I'm not involved, I'll just give you the information.

565
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,900
I don't like that.

566
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,740
But.

567
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,140
I will actually tell you,

568
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,890
because I am now running a data science team.

569
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,730
Okay?

570
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,570
You're all about information.

571
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:22,330
One of the biggest problems,

572
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,690
I interview a lot of data scientists,

573
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,290
and I ask them, why are you leaving?

574
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,350
There are two big problems.

575
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:32,110
Number one, all I do is reports.

576
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,590
That's why I'm leaving my current team,

577
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,270
because all I do is reports.

578
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,110
Okay?

579
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,870
Number two, this is more relevant.

580
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,390
I am producing brilliant insights that no one uses.

581
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,390
Now this is very analogous to the test role.

582
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,390
Very much so.

583
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,480
If you are producing insights that are not actionable,

584
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,390
that aren't actionable in a way that is business relevant,

585
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:04,310
no wonder that you're constantly under attack

586
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,950
for defending the value of your role.

587
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,350
That is what I see in testing all the time,

588
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,070
not just with this, is that testers say,

589
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,230
well, management doesn't listen to me.

590
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,710
And assuming that it's automatically management's fault

591
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,710
versus you having the right information,

592
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,150
the right argument, the right leadership,

593
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,030
the way to influence them.

594
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,630
I see way too much of this, oh, it's what was me,

595
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:28,710
it's not my fault, nah, nah, nah.

596
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,550
Right.

597
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,470
And it sounds like sort of the same thing.

598
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,310
It's like.

599
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,150
No, it's the same thing.

600
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,550
I've had, there was a guy that left my last team

601
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,990
on Teams at Microsoft because no one would listen to him.

602
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,190
This was a principle level lead.

603
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,430
It's not no one's listening to you.

604
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,270
I know.

605
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Your argument is not sufficiently convincing.

606
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,120
There's so many things where like,

607
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,780
I have seen testers long, well, you know what?

608
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,700
I understand testing and they fall back on this,

609
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,100
I forget the name of the bias,

610
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,060
but there's definitely a bias here.

611
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,920
Where it is clear that it's a positional argument.

612
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,430
It is clear that of the people in the room,

613
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,180
I know this topic more than you,

614
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,340
so we should be going with my gut, not yours.

615
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:28,040
And it completely ignores the whole system

616
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,760
of how a business functions.

617
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,600
Absolutely.

618
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,440
Right, so what's the consequence of me

619
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,830
going with your gut, not mine?

620
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:37,830
Oh, I don't know.

621
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:41,350
I just know, because the other part with testing,

622
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:44,230
in the old world, a big part of testing,

623
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:53,140
is the basis of our argument

624
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,140
is essentially a logical analysis of right versus wrong,

625
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,420
not a consequence to the product,

626
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,820
a consequence of the business,

627
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,900
or a consequence to the customer.

628
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:10,960
And that one is the one I think that's the most important.

629
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,960
Because so long we're spending all this time

630
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,960
defending a customer that we have no actual proof

631
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,600
if what we're talking about

632
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,500
solves a customer problem or not.

633
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,340
Correct.

634
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:31,620
Right, so a big part of a modern world

635
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,940
is in testing, is you combine

636
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,700
an actual customer-driven feedback loop

637
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,580
as you go through that testing.

638
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,060
This is why we proselytize the active use of data.

639
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,860
And even if all you got is surveys,

640
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,220
if your management says, oh, I don't care about surveys,

641
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,940
then you figure out how to fund and run a survey program

642
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,220
within your own test org.

643
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:03,500
Right, any test team that validates their ROI

644
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,020
six months after SHIP by, see, I told you so,

645
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,700
you should have listened to me.

646
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,860
I am telling you right now,

647
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,260
you are not doing a good job on arguing your ROI.

648
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,000
So I could go on and on and on

649
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,680
about the defensiveness of testers,

650
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,080
but one point I wanted to finish,

651
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,120
which I find interesting,

652
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,360
it always shuts me up a little bit.

653
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,000
In this, I think it was first mentioned

654
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,920
in the Lessons Learned book,

655
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:33,520
that testers provide information.

656
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,160
When I say, but there's so much more,

657
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,660
I forget that B&B also say that

658
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,140
once you're doing any of these other things,

659
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,020
you're not doing testing anymore.

660
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,180
So they've, in a way,

661
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,740
their definition has defended itself

662
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,860
for saying testing is this very small thing,

663
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,820
but someone who calls himself a tester

664
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,100
may do many other things.

665
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,900
I find that confusing.

666
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,650
I look, I am the quality and testing expert

667
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,970
for our organization.

668
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:00,810
Yep.

669
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,690
That is, I have to be that,

670
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,170
which expands so many other things

671
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,530
than information providing,

672
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:09,970
or exploration, or verification.

673
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,490
It's so many other things.

674
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,650
So the definitions just diverge from the beginning.

675
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,590
So whenever going back to testing versus checking,

676
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,650
it diving into that school's dogma

677
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,950
is just so distracting from what I'm trying to do.

678
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,870
So now back on defensiveness,

679
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:35,840
which I see a lot still,

680
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,000
and I see it, it's job preservation.

681
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,480
It is worried about what's happening next.

682
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,860
It's worried about management not listening to me.

683
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:47,680
And I think more testers who feel defensive

684
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,020
need to look at another, back at themselves more

685
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,560
and how they're interacting with the people

686
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,920
and the environment they're in,

687
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,480
than with blaming others for their problems.

688
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,200
Yeah, I completely agree.

689
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,880
So as testing evolves,

690
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,040
and one thing I like,

691
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,560
and I don't wanna completely pick on B&B,

692
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,720
they say that many people can take on the tester role

693
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,800
at any time, including developers, including product owners.

694
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,800
So I like the, it's their backward way of saying,

695
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,880
yes, the whole team owns quality.

696
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,360
The whole team owns quality,

697
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,620
and there's gonna be people

698
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:25,240
who have different domain expertise.

699
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,920
And that's where I see modern testing is,

700
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,640
as I described it from my team,

701
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,800
as I said, I was the quality testing expert

702
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,140
for our organization.

703
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,960
Everyone on my team must be the quality and testing expert

704
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,640
for their feature area.

705
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,880
It's their expertise.

706
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,920
It's the depth they bring to the team

707
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,080
that brings value to what their team is trying to accomplish.

708
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,560
They're either writing tests, checks,

709
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,120
they're writing tests, they're doing testing,

710
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,320
they're exploring, they're looking at data

711
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,120
to figure out how customers using things

712
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,400
to complete that loop,

713
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,980
not speculating for their team

714
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,580
and helping others on the team do those same things.

715
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,500
Uh oh, Brent's pulling his hair out,

716
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,620
but he doesn't have enough.

717
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,820
I don't, I've actually,

718
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,240
I went with a buzzer blade number four.

719
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,770
All right.

720
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:23,120
I think about an old blog post from Whitaker,

721
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,160
where the title of it is,

722
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,400
all of this testing is getting in the way of quality.

723
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,900
And I don't actually recall what he wrote about,

724
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,640
but that title was what stuck with me.

725
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,480
Right?

726
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,120
So all of these things that testing,

727
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,060
in my view, self creates,

728
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,260
I used to have a similar speech on test harnesses.

729
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,660
It's one thing that's interesting

730
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,540
about the test automation space,

731
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,020
that test has created so much language

732
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:59,980
around these components.

733
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,700
Like this is our logging engine

734
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,020
and this is our execution engine.

735
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,980
And there's a degree of specificity

736
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,560
that kind of reminds me of the fact

737
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,360
that the Eskimos have like 80,000 different definitions

738
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,470
for ICE, right?

739
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:21,790
Whereas you take these sort of oop definitions

740
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,830
and you take it to a dev team,

741
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,750
it's just like, whatever.

742
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,030
That's just an object that manages a queue.

743
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,390
Who cares?

744
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,310
Right?

745
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,230
Checking versus testing.

746
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,030
Who cares?

747
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,360
That is the thing that is important for every test team.

748
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,840
Who cares?

749
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,720
It is not me saying, I don't care,

750
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,300
don't waste my time on this topic.

751
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:53,200
I'm saying, if you're holding up this topic

752
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,280
as something that's important

753
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,060
and you don't know who cares

754
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,280
and you don't know why they should care,

755
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,160
you need to figure that up

756
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,960
before you hold this as an important religious dogma.

757
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,080
And what that means in your relationship

758
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,080
to customer quality.

759
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:11,920
And I like that.

760
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,760
Yes.

761
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,800
Because we forget that.

762
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,520
We're so caught up in the activity

763
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,980
and proving our value that we're important.

764
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,840
And if you make the customer's experience

765
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,060
or help make the customer's experience better,

766
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,240
you've done your job.

767
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,140
I always just about, before I went on that rant,

768
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,360
I was actually thinking about entering into,

769
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,200
you know what, Alan,

770
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,640
I'm gonna just make your life easier.

771
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,520
You as a director of quality and testing,

772
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,620
you're gonna say, I don't care anymore.

773
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,460
I don't care.

774
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,680
You could unit test, you could not.

775
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,320
I don't care.

776
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,900
But you're going to measure yourselves

777
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:55,900
on the rate at which your team and your code

778
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,620
increases CSAT of the customers

779
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,180
that are using it as measured by this.

780
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:05,240
And I'm going to do, I'm going to judge you guys

781
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:08,780
by CSAT over time, over calendar time.

782
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,880
You do whatever the hell you want.

783
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,000
And I'm willing to bet that you do something

784
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,280
along those lines, the right amount of testing

785
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,840
will suddenly start happening.

786
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,520
I think too many testers focus on,

787
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,480
I must do my activity, I must give you information,

788
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,520
I must explore, I must do this,

789
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,640
I must write a useless automation suite.

790
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,350
All this stuff that, you've seen this before,

791
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,790
and people, they generate a lot of activity

792
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,110
but little value.

793
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:42,590
And I worry that's happening with too many testers.

794
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,630
They're generating activity versus value for the customer.

795
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,430
No, it's even worse,

796
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,190
because they're not associating that activity to value.

797
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:53,470
They hold it as inherently true

798
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,110
that this activity is valuable.

799
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:58,190
And then when someone pushes back,

800
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,550
they get pissed off and say things like,

801
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,510
management doesn't listen to me.

802
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,150
Management doesn't listen to you

803
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,970
because you're not framing it

804
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,690
in a thing that management cares about.

805
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:13,970
Test is, from most management's point of view,

806
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:16,530
test is a cost.

807
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,290
Absolutely, that's why I think testing,

808
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:21,850
rather than being these teams of people

809
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,170
who are entry level,

810
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,090
and one of my rants a few weeks ago was,

811
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:27,850
in fact, I'll mention this in my technical tester thing,

812
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,610
is we take what I think,

813
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:32,810
and granted, I only have 25 years of experience in this,

814
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,250
but we take the most difficult thing to do,

815
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,770
maybe in software engineering,

816
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:40,850
which is to write reliable, good UI automation,

817
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,850
and we use that as our entry point

818
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,610
for teaching testers how to code.

819
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,250
How stupid is that?

820
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,660
Quite.

821
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,500
So I think the,

822
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,580
talking about modern testing and the growth of testing,

823
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:59,500
testing needs to be this specialist role.

824
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,460
Specializing generalist, specializing generalist,

825
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,300
but not that army of newbies thing.

826
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,420
If you're hiring a tester,

827
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,600
it's like hiring the performance guru to come in on your team.

828
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,120
It is a...

829
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,240
In the way software is shipping today

830
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,280
and what we're doing,

831
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,920
and if you're doing it right,

832
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,000
testing, the testing activity is no longer,

833
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,560
testing role, whatever you wanna call it,

834
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,480
what we need from tomorrow's,

835
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,480
and today's even, testing expert,

836
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,760
specializing generalizing specialists,

837
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,500
is...

838
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,940
A systemic view.

839
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,500
Yes, and not noobs.

840
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,420
I think, honestly, you could see testing as this role

841
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,300
that is grown into from your good developers.

842
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,140
Yeah.

843
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,200
Which some companies have done.

844
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,920
They've moved their good developers

845
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,600
into sort of what they call the QA role,

846
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,800
quality architect role,

847
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,280
and they've actually been a true QA role.

848
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,200
Yeah, I actually...

849
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,400
I'm off on a tangent,

850
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,240
but the growth is not from getting lots of new people in,

851
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,440
and this is hard for a chunk of the industry to see

852
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,840
because there are a chunk of consultants in the industry

853
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,360
that make their living teaching brand new testers

854
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,100
some basics about testing,

855
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,500
and their world is going away.

856
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,330
Yes, very rapidly.

857
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,730
We're out of time.

858
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,410
I do wanna pick this particular topic up

859
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,330
and go deeper in the next episode.

860
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:25,450
We'll see if we do that.

861
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,850
I mean, this is two weeks ahead planning

862
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,170
and that's anti-AB testing.

863
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,400
I was just getting around that, but you're right.

864
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,800
Yeah.

865
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,360
There is a whole bunch of other things

866
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,600
I think it would be good to go in here and talk about.

867
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,720
It may even sponsor, hint hint, some mailbag requests.

868
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,560
Yes.

869
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,040
So if there are topics you wanna hear about,

870
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,880
let us know in a reply to the blog post

871
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,920
or in oneofthethree.stock.com,

872
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,440
and we will pick it up as part of this

873
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,920
what will be a long, continued, and fun discussion.

874
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,760
Yes.

875
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,720
All right, I am still Alan.

876
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,740
And I'm not.

877
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,580
We'll see you next time on AB Testing.

878
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,420
Bye.
