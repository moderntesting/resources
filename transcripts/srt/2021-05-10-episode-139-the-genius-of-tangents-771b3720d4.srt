00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,700
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,480
Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,580
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,970
live

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,030
From our my house and Brent's office. It's the AB testing podcast. Hey Brent. Hey, yeah

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,590
The same place we've been for the last

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,250
14 months actually several of those you were in your house

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,550
I don't remember the last a B testing we did together, but maybe it'll happen again Sunday. I am

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,590
half

10
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,150
Vaccinated as am I I got my first shot. I got a Moderna shot on a Monday

11
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,170
I felt a little foggy a little tired on Tuesday

12
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,230
But other than that I was good except for feeling like someone hit me in the arm with a two by four. I

13
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,670
beat you by

14
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,670
one working day

15
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,940
Got my Pfizer shot

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,740
last Friday no

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,940
No symptoms except for again the two by four thing it basically

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,060
Massive soreness at the injection shot just like any other vaccine I've ever had

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,500
although a couple days ago, I started experiencing

20
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,700
Stiffness. Oh, I thought it's gonna be superpowers because I can fly now. Oh

21
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,660
Dude, not very far. I can fly about four feet

22
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,880
But you know, I'm not sure I'm not sure I could do that before I was expecting

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:44,420
Your your superpower to be to communicate with wildlife particularly grizzly bears

24
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,060
Oh, yes, you missed it in the pre show

25
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:55,100
Which you don't get to hear because it costs money. No nothing costs money here. But in the pre show Brent compared me to

26
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:03,660
Grizzly Adams which much of our demo some of our demographic may remember some may wonder what that is

27
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
But we'll let you Google that

28
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,140
Yes, and I will tell you

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,540
For those who aren't able to see the live stream. I will tell you. Oh

30
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,380
My god, is it similar?

31
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,060
the the the the

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,420
We a couple episodes ago. I don't know

33
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:31,220
Several episodes ago. We started talking about that the B in a B testing is about to refer to Alan's beard

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:39,180
And if you go to our slack group at one of the three dot slack comm there's a link to sign up on modern testing

35
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,300
org you can go to the Alan's beard channel there and

36
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,500
Occasionally get an update on the state of Alan's beard and I am I am

37
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,180
Claiming that is just just a short term amount of time before

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,740
Alan's beard asserts itself and makes that happen of its own

39
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,860
We are maybe a month or two away from the beard reaching a sentient

40
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
Proper. Yeah

41
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,940
You are one of the three if they get to it before you should post a picture of Grizzly Adams in the Alan's beard channel

42
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
just to see if like

43
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,140
separated at birth

44
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,700
I remember watch that show when I was kids so vaccines good

45
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,820
We've all heard that like basically 90 plus percent of the time that second shot is gonna kick your ass to some extent

46
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,680
Yeah, I've heard that that's especially true with Moderna

47
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,700
I will have my fingers crossed for you Alan and anyone else on Moderna

48
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,280
I have I have preemptively marked two days off after my shot just in case

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,200
And then there will be so my second shot is is

50
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,620
essentially

51
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,900
conflicts

52
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,260
With our podcast next time around so we'll we'll have to do some schedule

53
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,180
You can move it we can push that a week we can do other times

54
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,620
I'm usually free in the afternoons because I

55
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,330
work I

56
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,110
Most of my team is in another continent, which reminds me

57
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:22,130
I've been reading a book called the culture map just FYI for any of you that works with a global team

58
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,970
you know, I've been doing it for a long time but still some insights from that book and

59
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,570
understanding the difference across a whole bunch of attributes of

60
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:40,680
Different cultures and just maybe a quick little book report what it does is it takes these eight or so attributes of communication and

61
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,360
Then puts different countries on a scale

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,160
whereas

63
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,360
What seems really strict and rigid in one country may seem like chaos in another country

64
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,760
Just so it all depends on your point of view of how you how you communicate for example

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,520
You're probably aware of this but English being the

66
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:12,080
Hodgepodge cesspool of a language it is has like two or three times as many words as a lot of other languages and

67
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,240
What that means is we can be very in English. We are very explicit usually in our communication

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,200
Whereas in languages with fewer words

69
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:28,640
The subtleties are between the lines communication is much more prevalent and just being aware of that and how you communicate

70
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:35,000
With people from different cultures is very important. So very insightful wasn't even on my list of things to bring up

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,880
But that's what happens on the AB testing podcast

72
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,800
Yeah

73
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
In case there's a new listener

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll let you answer that but no I won't

75
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,480
Alright, fair enough. I was gonna say you could answer that in a moment

76
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,960
But just for any potential new listeners and we had a listener by the way who started from episode one and listened all the way

77
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,200
Kudos to that guy. I think it was a guy now now I know I

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,160
Mean I I offer my deep

79
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:15,080
D

80
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,520
I'm impressed on the other hand. Yeah, some of those it took us a while to figure it out

81
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,920
But why is our podcast called a B testing?

82
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,440
Well because the officially I think the checking meme started after we did the the podcast

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,090
Should have been a B checking

84
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:42,610
Yeah, just think of it ABC. I mean the t-shirt writes itself a is for Alan B is for Brent

85
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,050
We don't know what testing is

86
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,050
checking is for

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,160
No

88
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
You know what?

89
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,080
Let's change it because a B checking is ABC

90
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:05,320
Dude, I literally like 30 seconds ago said that like no, but I I did that thing where I what's it called when?

91
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,040
See if you were a woman and I did that there's a term for that

92
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,680
It's called he peed in no mansplaining is when I explained something to you that you already know

93
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,560
Heeding is when I repeat it from you know being oh anyway

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,360
I'm just it's not that I'm I don't have respect for you. Well, that's actually it. Never mind

95
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:30,210
Yeah, ABC so and we're really not about testing which

96
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,890
The only thing I worry about and in fact if you're listening

97
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:41,210
I don't even know if getting more reviews or we have a lot of reviews and in the stores and we're very well rated

98
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,120
Here's what I worry about. You know, we do this not for the fame and fortune we do this actually

99
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,040
It's still to help testers and people from tests understand how to navigate the new world that is

100
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
Unveiling quicker than some people like in front of them

101
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,600
but I feel like there's a whole world of

102
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,790
People in software development and agile team struggling to figure things out and all over the place who would benefit

103
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,110
from our

104
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,860
podcast

105
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,900
but

106
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,180
Maybe don't listen to it because it has the word testing in the title

107
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,580
I'm not sure if that's true or not, but what do you think how do so my question is?

108
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,180
We have we have a solid pretty consistent thousand ish listeners per podcast

109
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,420
So thank you all of you

110
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,040
It's really only three of you at a time and thank you for logging in for different IP addresses and and fixing our stats

111
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,140
but I

112
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,580
Feel like we've finally gotten to a point as we begin our 139th episode

113
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,470
where

114
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,240
we can

115
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,000
Recognize that we provide value to a maybe a larger audience. So I'm gonna shut up and get your thoughts. Yeah

116
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:02,320
I'll tell you the the thought process for why it was a B testing. It was rather

117
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,660
Alan and I

118
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,660
Were thinking through names. I

119
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,460
Don't remember any of the other candidates we had

120
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,680
Right, but I was thinking through. Okay, what is our desired audience?

121
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:26,050
What is our expected audience? What is our desired audience and where Alan and are my interests am?

122
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,970
for me a B testing

123
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,880
Really resonated because number one, right it it

124
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,520
Covered are you and me and sort of the expected audience?

125
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,360
but number two

126
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,750
It covered kind of where I thought at that point in time we would go

127
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,710
Go really deeper in then we really really have

128
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,990
It opened the door to sort of bringing in data science topics

129
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,790
as well as

130
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,600
Just sort of a B testing by itself is a really great

131
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,140
modern testing

132
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,380
tool

133
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,740
So to me it was just sort of all the different check boxes got marked off with that

134
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,340
The only the only flaw we've seen so far is

135
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,890
In order for Alan to get rid of me. He has to find a good

136
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,890
Co-partnered with a letter B

137
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,290
But then the one of three even stepped up and you know

138
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,690
That people can change to name

139
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,050
right

140
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,170
they pseudonym is is

141
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,450
Is very cheap to advertise on right right burzy?

142
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,050
Okay

143
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,290
Okay, just curious on thoughts are that wasn't again also not on my intended topics one thing

144
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,890
I wanted to mention and I should have put this in my five for Friday. I was stupid. I

145
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,730
as mentioned before I have a new Mac M1 total subject change and

146
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,850
As maybe I mentioned at least in five for Friday. I have a brand new big-ass monitor

147
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,290
34-inch ultra wide

148
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:13,170
They're actually from this century my last monitors only had VGA and DVI inputs

149
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,850
So without an adapter, I couldn't connect my Mac and it wouldn't be great refresher resolution

150
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,190
So now that I have a proper monitor from the right decade

151
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,470
I can have both my Mac and my Linux machine plugged in and they both can run 4k on this monitor

152
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,650
Which is great, so I'm using my Mac more and I thought about getting a KVM

153
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:34,280
I had a separate keyboard for my Mac which I was using me adjust my little bouncy ball

154
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,760
I said on quite a bit, but then someone on slack again. I forget names, so I sorry

155
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,200
Recommended this product called synergy, which is a software solution

156
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,680
Do you write at Microsoft remember do you still have what was the thing called with all the tools toolbox or yeah?

157
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:58,040
Code is that called toolbox toolbox interestingly without any input at all for me or anyone from Microsoft at Unity

158
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,640
We now have a site called toolbox with similar things

159
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,000
But anyway, there was a thing on toolbox called magic mouse which lets you share a mouse between

160
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,520
Between systems which is really cool

161
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,920
But this is keyboard and mouse you can share between systems via a little teeny little TCP server

162
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,320
And it works really really well you can even cut and paste between

163
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,230
operating systems

164
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,910
The two machines you're using are your laptop in your home computer yeah

165
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,420
Yeah, as I mentioned last time I'm not spending a whole lot of time on my laptop

166
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,720
Yeah, my laptop kicks butt the new MacBook Pro M ones they completely rule

167
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:46,080
from my middle son for graduating high school as well as to sort of prep him for going to

168
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
your alma mater actually

169
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
We bought him a Dell

170
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,360
XPS 17 and it's so it's a

171
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:03,040
17-inch screen and I'm like why didn't I buy two of those that thing is sweet

172
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,560
It's so big it's so big okay, yeah, that was that list although honestly the answer to that is at this point in time

173
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:20,020
Like it I'm so trained. I'm like no I don't buy myself a laptop. That's works problem

174
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,940
Exactly exactly you know I feel like we could almost do tech recommendations

175
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,540
But I I feel like the kids out there know more about the new tech coming out sometimes

176
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,660
So I rely on my Twitter followers to make it like I had them give me monitor recommendations

177
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,620
I had to help me figure out if I should get the the 15-inch

178
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:46,460
Intel MacBook Pro or go with 13 inch M1 and I'm super happy with the M1 things like that

179
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,420
Anything else going on we should cover we have a mailbag and something else. I forget. Oh yeah anything else

180
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,980
I had two topics. You know what they are anything else you want to cover before we dive into those

181
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
15 minutes into the podcast

182
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:08,330
No, I'm good. I think it's important that our listeners get to know us and what's going on in our world

183
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:16,290
Before we start talking about stuff that they probably don't care about as much which but which is occasionally informative

184
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,170
Wow

185
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,690
so those

186
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:27,330
Like I'm staring at Alan and he suddenly shifted to like full-blown empathy mode in his body language, so

187
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:34,770
So I'm not accustomed to it normally I the the face I look into is filled with anger around

188
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,450
They don't call me angry weasel for nothing so okay. Where's this going?

189
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:45,770
It's a trap. I've seen see the trap coming always a trap always yeah, okay?

190
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,370
Hey, I wanted to follow up so a couple episodes ago. We talked about personality types

191
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,370
and by the way

192
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:58,130
Ray Dalio the author of principles one of my favorite books his company, and I forget the link

193
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,130
But I just they have yet another

194
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,970
Personality test which I did

195
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,010
It's fine

196
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:10,570
But I'm discovering of all of them as I dig into it and pay attention to this stuff

197
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:14,410
And not all personality, but these little tests the working genius is

198
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,170
is

199
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,410
Giving me more and more value

200
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,010
I'll tell you why in a minute

201
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:25,090
But can you remind me of what your top two and bottom two are if you have those rent?

202
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,880
That would be the two working genius and the two working frustration that is correct

203
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,480
Thank you for digging out the right nomenclature for me

204
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,080
Yeah, okay

205
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,480
my two

206
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
working genius our

207
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,720
invention and discernment oh

208
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,880
Yes, I could see that and frustrations

209
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Enablement and tenacity

210
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:54,960
Okay, so that's good to know so let me as I dug into this more and thought about how this works

211
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,520
And I had some licenses that I had some of my team go through it's been a little

212
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,240
Enlightening if you think about how these work so the geniuses are they spell widget wonder and invention

213
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
discernment and galvanizing and

214
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,300
enablement and tenacity

215
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:19,180
the cool way with the way these work which I didn't mention last time because I didn't actually realize it is

216
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,100
When you think about how we make things

217
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,660
Whether it's software

218
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,240
Processes or whatever you start with wonder and invention

219
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,230
You ponder things you figure out. I wonder if we could do it this way

220
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,110
I wonder the way you come up with a good idea is come up with a lot of ideas or the bad ones out

221
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,670
Wonder is are great at that

222
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:46,310
They just throw stuff out there with the full idea that we're gonna get some stuff torn apart and then invention is what are these new?

223
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,400
ideas, but we don't go straight from there to

224
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
actually implementation

225
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,760
there's

226
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:01,680
That there's these middle steps of discernment of breaking down the idea making sure we're solving the right problem for the right people

227
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,160
You are a discerner

228
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,800
you enjoy

229
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,960
Figuring out if what people think they want to do is the right thing and and making sure it's solving the right problem for the customer

230
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,800
This this brings you joy. It does

231
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Very common phrase

232
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,360
That I now use because as you know, I talked to lots of executives here at the company

233
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,220
I will go to them and say I hear what you want, but it's my job to bring you what you need

234
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:40,060
Yeah, I say that all the time too because I am also a discerner and sometimes they're the same thing sometimes

235
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:46,260
So in the middle there is discernment and galvanizing and I sit right in the middle

236
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,500
I just I'm able to break stuff apart like you do and I like to get people what they need versus what they want and

237
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,420
It brings all that I can't do all of it

238
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,220
Anyone can do all of this stuff

239
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:58,460
But if you do the stuff that are in your frustrations, what I'll get to in a minute

240
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,260
Eventually those kind of wear you out if that's all you do. So I live in the middle

241
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,660
I rely on other people to

242
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,500
In wonder and invent not that I can't wonder an event not that I don't but the things that give me the most joy are

243
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:19,620
Making sure we're solving the right problem and then getting everybody rallied around solving the problem making making the team

244
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,740
Understand what's important about what they do. I like when you go to Dan Pink's autonomy mastery and purpose

245
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,900
I love bringing purpose to the work. It gives me joy

246
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,900
If I feel like I can connect people with the work they're doing in the project we need to get done

247
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,700
That's that's the kind of stuff. I like doing are you saying that your?

248
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:46,540
To you didn't remind us of your I did I snuck it in there. It's it's the middle to discernment and galvanizing

249
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:53,960
So discernment we just go galvanizing is getting everyone together on solving the right problem and your bottom

250
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,840
my bottom two I believe are

251
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
not one oh, it's a

252
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,630
invention and

253
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,350
tenacity and

254
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:08,790
What it means is I can get people rallied around the project and again

255
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:13,270
I've had tenacity before I can just I'm just gonna go crank this workout. So enablement is

256
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,090
Giving you the support you need while you're doing the work and it could just you know

257
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,830
I can do that and I've done that a lot. It doesn't bring me as much. It doesn't bring me joy

258
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,590
if all I had to do is

259
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,270
Get in the trenches and do the work and it could be just how I've changed over time

260
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:36,430
But doing that enabling sorry not enablement in task of the enablement in my yeah enablement Sarah tenacity is in my middle

261
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,430
So it's enablement and I was looking at yours

262
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,550
enablement and invention I don't

263
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,950
I

264
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:48,910
Don't invent things often, but I love to jump in as things are invented and do the discernment

265
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,230
so with you with

266
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,990
Enablement and tenacity at the bottom

267
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,930
Those are the both the things at the end of the building stuff

268
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:01,170
So you start with one dimension you go to discernment and galvanizing and then there's enablement and tenacity

269
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:07,170
So it sounds like you know, I know I've seen you do those things but what this says is that

270
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,890
Those things don't bring you joy

271
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,510
Gettin yeah, it's it's

272
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:22,330
The thing with working genius here right they're talking about so you use the term joy

273
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,290
for other folks

274
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,410
Sort of derive energy from

275
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:34,570
Would be another way of expressing it. It's not a negative thing. It's not that I suck at enablement or tenacity

276
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,810
right

277
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,810
absolutely, right it's

278
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:43,290
Which doesn't mean I don't suck at those two as well, right?

279
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:51,170
It's not making a comment on those on those statements is basically saying it's it's far more likely to be a

280
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,850
energy drainer than a

281
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,190
energy

282
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,230
Refiller correct and the so the addendum I want to add it on today add on today

283
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,230
And if this is all new to you, please go back and listen to a couple episodes ago

284
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,990
We talked about this but what I didn't get before I thought was worth bringing up

285
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,870
Is that the way these fit together around getting a project from inception to customers?

286
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:21,080
Is this working genius? So you start with one dimension you go to discernment and galvanizing

287
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,600
Is that these are leadership attributes of course and then enablement and tenacity is just getting that work done

288
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,960
So I wanted to bring that up because one I learned that and thought it would add a nice cap on to our previous discussion

289
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
but two

290
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,410
It leads directly into a question from our mailbag

291
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,480
Insert grab insert sound here if I can find it crap. I have a new computer

292
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,920
I may have lost it just a second just in case I have to do this again

293
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,650
All right, so the question from Sean

294
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,850
It's been a while it's been a while welcome back welcome back

295
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:09,290
Sean says topic I think might be interesting and Sean we think it's interesting too

296
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:17,450
So you're you're right is walking through the life of a feature from inception to production whether in a fictional or real process to illustrate

297
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,610
how

298
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:22,130
collaboration works how you see roles on a team and what a team without

299
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,490
Dedicated testers look like a lot of details here Alan mentioned in last episode that development is collaborative

300
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:32,770
Of course and on a team without dedicated testers other developers may test the code sure everyone everyone tests

301
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,450
It doesn't need to be the person to develop doing it all the testing. I agree. I agree

302
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:42,670
I remember Brent saying previously that he asks about test process and data proving a feature works

303
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:48,430
Yes, that's part of it that whole everything is a hypothesis. Everything is an experiment approach

304
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,950
Yes, and then I'm sorry

305
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:56,470
I'm adding too much stuff here all makes me curious how you might see a feature from beginning to end who might work on it

306
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,710
Handoffs or whoever might be described from story writing to design to engineering release and monitoring

307
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,270
I know every situation could be different, but what is an example of a process?

308
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,430
Do you think works well maybe with comments and other ways I could work well

309
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,270
Or what wouldn't work well any sort of handoffs never work well tell you that right now

310
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,750
But let's talk through this we have I think we can make it we have like a half hour

311
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:26,350
I think handoffs don't work. Well, I think handoffs are often often cause bottlenecks

312
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:35,170
Yeah, it's it's interesting and I'm wondering if what I my team does

313
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,170
right because

314
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,260
We do a lot of I don't even know what the term is

315
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,980
So intermittent pair programming

316
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,100
Where it's essentially there will be?

317
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:59,020
Folks working together then they'll separate then they'll come back and they'll separate right? It's essentially it's spontaneous

318
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,220
V team of two I maybe that's another way of calling it. Oh cool

319
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,300
Handoffs don't generally work. Well

320
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,940
When it's a situation where you're also

321
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:17,940
You're also hand in handing off out of the blue an unknown context

322
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,340
Right. It's essentially

323
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,540
Alright Alan. I have this spreadsheet that I just finished doing I need you to

324
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:35,460
Successfully cluster the data together, you know, I'm making crap up because I'm looking at my other screen with this spreadsheet loaded

325
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:39,060
Okay, I could see that I was thinking more of what I thought hand I thought

326
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:46,140
Throwing stuff over the wall kind of handoffs versus that's a collaborative handoff really right. So let's

327
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,780
Okay, so

328
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,540
It's the nuance of the handoff non collaboration

329
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,780
Is a bottleneck that all agree with?

330
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,850
Okay, so let's start and I can pick it probably both have several stories here

331
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,570
But let's kind of walk through a fictitious example. So

332
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:15,570
But oh boy my first my first inclination before we wreck it is

333
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:23,930
a suggestion to Sean to go read the lean startup because it probably I imagine where we'll be stealing liberally from

334
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,570
Rees as we talked through this scenario. Yeah, there's there's actually

335
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,450
another book I read

336
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:36,070
And I forget the name of it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that one's really good. I read that a couple times

337
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,870
Actually, you might have it's very old

338
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:43,430
But it had to do with what do you say a man you saying I'm old

339
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,100
Well, yeah, you are. Okay. I mean

340
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,540
Yeah, you you know that

341
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,480
But I'm still kind of

342
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,440
I'm still kind of dealing with the segue from the last topic because I as you rightly call it out

343
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,560
It's not much of a segue. It's more of a tightening of the focus

344
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,420
I'll bring up that that I'll use that as a teaser and if I can tell that story later

345
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,740
In context, I will you'll completely forget the story in the next two minutes. It's alright

346
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,100
All right. So let's start from idea

347
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,460
Let's say I have an idea for a new product or I wonder or something or a new feature

348
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,420
So, oh, let me start here. There's a better way to frame that

349
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,270
How do you figure out what the next feature is you're going to deliver?

350
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,820
Well, you start with

351
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,780
start with a

352
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,540
Need gaps in some fashion. No, no, no you start with

353
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,910
Things you think that would be cool to do I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Do you?

354
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,470
Well, we both know sadly some people do that's

355
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:59,790
some people do and that's wrong it's

356
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:08,510
Ideally you understand or have a way to understand what the biggest problems are your customers or potential customers are facing

357
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:16,060
Yeah, or like you said you just you just fully own the fact that you are the second coming of Steve Jobs

358
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,180
And then you do whatever the hell you feel like did I tell you about the time at Microsoft when one of?

359
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:27,660
Someone who is no longer there was a partner test manager who is known as a buffoon

360
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,960
He reminds me of Mike Pence actually, but he compared himself to Steve Jobs and meeting I was in

361
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,860
Like literally said well, I Steve Jobs has ideas and I have ideas are the same

362
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:44,940
So what so in reality? I like to start with what's the customer problem?

363
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,980
We're trying to solve and hopefully it's a big one or one of the biggest ones

364
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,220
I like to start with the problem versus the feature idea and then I refer to

365
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:59,140
Weinberg which is until you can think of at least three different solutions to your problem. You don't understand your problem well enough yet

366
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,440
that I agree with the

367
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,110
And

368
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:11,390
In even further I'll tell you the three I'll tell you what the three different solutions should be

369
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,180
the one that is

370
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,420
the low cost

371
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,370
high risk

372
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:22,370
the one that should be low risk high cost and

373
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:27,170
The one that is right in between I get that I get that

374
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,730
Do you actually I mean you're laughing but do you get the?

375
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:36,330
The wisdom behind no I do it's it's it's a flavor of the

376
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,770
Quadrant used often effort versus impact

377
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah, I use that frequently, okay

378
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:51,080
But it but they may not all be that way they all they all may have different trade-offs that may not be that may be

379
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,320
More subtle than the impact versus effort

380
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,060
But the important thing is is you don't as you know, just don't fall in love with your first solution

381
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:07,760
So who's involved in figuring that stuff out who's involved in effort and impact and problem solving in the generic sensor in a

382
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:14,920
Modern in a modern sense in a modern sense in a world where we live. So it's it's I

383
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,250
was gonna say the whole team, but that's that doesn't even cover it because

384
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:26,210
The the problem statement could come from user research as part of UX. It could come from marketing

385
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,330
It could be product management

386
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:37,220
Could come directly from customers through a series of forum posts or scathing articles. There are lots of ways for you to

387
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,260
understand that problem, but you you won't understand the

388
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,440
effort impact

389
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:53,400
Quadrant until you get your development team involved understand because a lot of times you really can't understand

390
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:02,080
Which solution is most feasible and viable until you can get people brainstorming about the different solutions

391
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,830
Well, yeah, but I think you're you're not at

392
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:11,550
That phase yet. It's right. The very first thing is is how do you know?

393
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,310
when

394
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:16,830
To even bring it that idea to that forum. I

395
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,510
Guess I'll be the first to bring up the the Eric Ries story, right? It's essentially

396
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:28,230
In lean startup. One of the things that he talks about is how they very deeply

397
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,950
Began to invest in

398
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:39,990
What Eric Ries now will proclaim it was a just a fundamentally stupid idea

399
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,620
right, um

400
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:50,240
But it's very easy to get spun up and believing that you have found a an important gap and

401
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,240
Work through that right if we do if we use your

402
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,920
system the widget ordering like

403
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:06,840
Wondering is hey, where is their great potential? So they got to that phase they basically said hey

404
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,600
We think it's gonna be absolutely

405
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,400
Fantastic to do blah blah blah blah blah blah and there's a lot of people who are doing that and and you know

406
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:23,280
you just have to watch, you know three episodes of shark tank to get a good sense of the diversity of

407
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
of

408
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:32,510
How people will come up with with new potential

409
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:35,590
and and even

410
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,230
Stand behind it

411
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:44,910
now the question is in my mind in in them and that's always happened in in throughout history like you and I have talked through

412
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,070
Like how many times in the old-school Microsoft did we go and see a requirements document?

413
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,950
that

414
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,950
You know was was either

415
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:57,550
unfounded by any sort of customer statement

416
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,150
Or or very loosely founded. Oh

417
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:08,430
Darn often. Oh my god. It just drove me crazy. Even when I didn't know what was better. I knew it was wrong

418
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,260
right

419
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,060
Right. Yeah, and back then one of the challenges were

420
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,420
Was we really didn't have the ability to

421
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,460
To do anything differently

422
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:26,180
right, so this this this person did two-hour call with a customer and

423
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,340
That entire deck came from that call right from one

424
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:39,860
Customer right, but we didn't have the ability to scale customer feedback back in those days, right? Right. Okay, because we didn't ship anything

425
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,860
told

426
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,140
True again, so okay, so we're vetting

427
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,860
We're figuring we're doing a bunch of work up front to make sure we're building the right thing

428
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,980
Let me fast forward a little bit and say we feel like we have what's called product market fit

429
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,620
Okay, what happens next and who's involved?

430
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:10,180
So are we to the are we now to the let's figure out exactly what we're gonna build to solve this problem?

431
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:16,530
So if we found product market fit is it let's say we've selected the best what we think is the best solution

432
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,110
Actually, we see we see even experiment solutions

433
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:28,570
Yeah, have we already discerned solutions because I think the first thing like wonder is the exploration of opportunity

434
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,770
That's how I view it. Yeah. Yeah, so you're right. We need to discern the solutions

435
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,930
It can't like I said, it's more it's usually more subtle than just effort and impact if there's like a

436
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:44,090
There's a low effort high impact. It's just we could probably just go forward and try it, but it doesn't always work that way

437
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:49,210
I just realized my dog is laying on my foot didn't know she was there great back on back. Look a squirrel

438
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:55,850
Okay, so I like the idea of discerning solutions again

439
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:59,090
A lot of companies fall in love with their first solution a lot of feature teams

440
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,770
We're as discerners especially and as disciples of the lean startup we say BS to that

441
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:09,170
So we want to discern the solution. Let's talk about how that happens. Who's involved in that?

442
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,590
Discern we got we skipped over invention. I think invention. I mean

443
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,670
No, no, so the very first thing so wonder so this is actually really cool

444
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:25,070
I did not play I knew there was a segue

445
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:31,270
But you are actually tying this phase of working genius directly in here, which I kind of love some let you keep going

446
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,590
And I'll remind you

447
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:40,610
My working genius is invention and discernment. Okay, so I in some regards. Yeah

448
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:47,310
Because I don't really care about about about that first part I want to get to discernment and galvanize

449
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:52,390
But anyway, go on so wonder I go back wonder is is around

450
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,040
The the gift of seeing an opportunity and a need

451
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,920
And it's a gift. I I wish I could load an example

452
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:12,280
But have you ever sat down and briefly thought hey, you know this particular something or other

453
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,180
Sucks, how come they don't make it this way?

454
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:25,740
In I wish I could come up with a really good example here. It's something actually my wife does quite often

455
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,420
She she will go why why doesn't yeah, anyway

456
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:37,460
I can't even let any of her examples at the moment the closest example I can think of is back in the day

457
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:44,140
Do you remember magic cards with did you ever get sucked into magic cards like magic the gathering? Yeah. No, I never played. Oh

458
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,220
so

459
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:53,860
Literally 90% of my spare income in college went to magic cards. Okay, and

460
00:35:54,450 --> 00:36:00,490
What I would do is I turned it into business. I actually created this whole

461
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:06,090
Offline auction system where people would send in bids and I did it on

462
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:12,710
Got news groups like this was before the internet and I had generalized it

463
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:17,700
But you know what? I I was thinking of I

464
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,810
had a need

465
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:26,060
Okay, I had a need I had a full end-to-end bidding system and in different types of bids

466
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,580
But I don't have that gift of wonder so it never it never

467
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,660
immediately

468
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,740
inherently

469
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:41,180
Registered that hey if I generalize like the the money I'm selling off of these magic cards is

470
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,460
Less valuable than if I found a way to generalize this whole auction site

471
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,500
Yep, right and that was the thing that

472
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:57,890
Amongst other things the the other thing is it's not on here. I have the vice of being completely lazy

473
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:07,650
But that was one key thing which is why you're not currently talking to the CEO of eBay because I

474
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,320
Didn't think broader around that potential

475
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,200
Okay, so it never occurred to me that there was a global need on that one

476
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:23,000
Once you I've identified a potential need then then how do you generate ideas?

477
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,920
How do you generate solutions to that question is you bring in domain experts and you have a

478
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,840
Brainstorming session you do not and ideally the customer is part of your domain experts yet that yes

479
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,830
right now

480
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:47,470
In in in in some models they call this feasibility analysis opportunity analysis

481
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,710
That's where you going through and you say, okay

482
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:56,930
How do you take this thing and understand the pros and cons?

483
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,450
What would be the constraints out of the solution?

484
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,610
There's many a times where I'll come to you Alan on certain things

485
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,370
You can you go I don't know the solution and then with a few precision questions

486
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:12,750
I can really understand that well at least you know the constraints on on that solution

487
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,970
So if there is a solution, it's now not this big grab bag of thing

488
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,410
It's got to be in a much much smaller space

489
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,890
Right. For example, you may say hey, I need a solution for something

490
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:31,530
But I need it in the next two weeks. So anything that's gonna take longer than that is not going to be a solution

491
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,950
Now now with that constraint you can bring in people and say okay, what can we do?

492
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,470
within this time period on discernment

493
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,270
intuitively and instinctively

494
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:48,110
Evaluating ideas and situations that is one of mine

495
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:54,780
And I don't know that if I say so there certainly I don't I do it intuitively. I'm gonna in

496
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,800
I'm I'm an end

497
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,560
But instinctive I don't so this one

498
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:02,190
I

499
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:06,270
I'll say for me. I am very able to sort of very quickly

500
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:09,670
I think of it in terms of the strength finder. I'm an ideater

501
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:12,830
Okay, I see how I see all the dots and I see how they're all connected

502
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:17,430
Let's tie all this to how a team does their stuff

503
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:23,400
So you need to you need to vet the ideas discern the ideas and figure out

504
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,960
I'm gonna fast forward a little bit because we do need to take time to figure out which is the best solution I can

505
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,280
Bend on time it can depend on customers and market and other pressures

506
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
Lots of things can influence

507
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Which decision you choose?

508
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
in in terms of

509
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,520
Modern testing and in tying it to that the process of discernment I'll be super tactical on this

510
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,160
You get the right group of people together you identify what are the three MVP things?

511
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:58,600
You then prune those down because no one really fully understands what an MVP is

512
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,520
They always turn it into a friggin beta. Yeah, absolutely. That's true and they go

513
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,880
Well, all we want to do is what is the cheapest thing that we can do to sort of test these things out?

514
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,480
Yes, and that's that's a 100%

515
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,000
Yes

516
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,460
That's what you have to vet it down to is what is the least amount of effort we can do in order to get

517
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,680
Feedback that will tell us whether or not we're going in the right direction

518
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,900
Right and yeah, I totally echo your people

519
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:33,860
Bastardized the MVP term into something much much bigger and it drives me freaking nuts

520
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:40,980
They just don't get it and makes me angry when it really shouldn't so no it's because they overload

521
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:45,270
What the point is?

522
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,950
Right it it's not an MVP's goal is not

523
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,580
To generate customer happiness

524
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:55,300
No, no, it's it's getting to generate

525
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,260
Learning right generate learning. So now

526
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,220
We figure those things out

527
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,820
Let me know if I fast forward too much

528
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:10,980
But yes, absolutely part of discernment should be breaking it down and then part of that if we go through the working genius stuff is

529
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,980
Getting the team aligned and I'm gonna repeat something

530
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:22,300
I've unfortunately had to say in several different conversations this week is that alignment is not consensus and

531
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,670
Get the team aligned on

532
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:30,090
What what they're doing what they're trying to learn they get it

533
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:37,430
Intel you this goes with the rallying cry and tell the team under team 100% asked to fully understand the problem of solving and

534
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,760
Be aligned on the solutions are putting in place and what the plan is in order to do that. So that is

535
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:50,840
Everyone on the team if you have a dedicated tester testers are generally people with that testing background

536
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,840
I'm not gonna say mindset, but that testing background are very good at discernment generally

537
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,520
They're good at asking those questions and figuring things out. Maybe not as good as getting everyone aligned, which is galvanizing

538
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,400
Probably why maybe it's cuz I'm a galvanizer that I work on alignment so much now. I have to go ponder that later

539
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,520
Okay, so anything else to talk about there before we get into

540
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:20,520
Really the nitty-gritty in the last 10 minutes here, which is all of the implementation of this stuff and who's involved

541
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,720
How do handoffs work those sorts of things?

542
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,940
Well, so I kind of go old-school

543
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Agile on this is that you

544
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,840
You sort of create an assembly line of the work and

545
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,520
Part of part of that work advancing forward or are essentially spot quality checks

546
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,880
If you think about acceptance reviews

547
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,000
Generally in scrum you have an acceptance criteria

548
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,720
either generated or

549
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,320
negotiated with the product owner

550
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:04,000
When the scenario is complete there should be some form of an acceptance review, which is

551
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:11,320
Essentially, okay. I now have implemented what I thought we had agreed to let me validate that

552
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:16,400
It was what we agreed to yeah, I would go back one step. I think yes, you do those things

553
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,400
But it's important also

554
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,320
This is where if you have a dedicated tester they'll help but if not it has to happen

555
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,080
Anyway, is you need to think about all of that validation and testing as part of planning

556
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:33,050
We make our teams think about a test plan and you can make them think about testing

557
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:37,570
How are you gonna know this is gonna work in production up front? This actually goes going back to Reese. It's

558
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:43,210
What asking that question? How will we know this is successful in production?

559
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,200
Right, it's essentially it's essentially asking

560
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,080
Before we begin

561
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:57,590
How do we know if it's if it's working or failing? Yeah, and what and ties into I mean, there's this really old-school thing

562
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:59,510
failure modes

563
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:06,430
FMEA but the idea was to think about all the ways your application could fail before you shipped that that FMEA is

564
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,670
Super old-school and super heavyweight, but there's a flavor of that you need to do in addition to

565
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:18,410
Success metrics is how are we gonna know like just thinking about say I'm shipping a new

566
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,410
Website that's a good generic thing before I go live

567
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:27,690
I want to get an idea of how I'm gonna scale for load just in case people actually go there

568
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:32,010
Things like that just being able to think about those things upfront as part of planning

569
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:35,050
That's a new thing for a lot of developers who haven't

570
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:39,130
Been in a team where they didn't have dedicated testers before

571
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:45,920
So that's where if you have one you can help out but over time and I've seen this in many many many teams

572
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,380
It's not too hard to get a development team to think about those things, but you can't forget about it either

573
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:58,170
Yeah, the other thing with handoffs like in terms of handoffs that the I mean it's essentially

574
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,860
It kind of goes back to the sort of the stakeholder thing. Are you handing off because?

575
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:11,500
Hey in terms of what needs the additional polish that needs to be added is best suited by a

576
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,540
different set of experts or

577
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:21,520
Is it is the handoff really lightweight and it's more of an inform or an improve much like the story?

578
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:28,020
mentioned around product owners the I'm thinking through I'm reading through Sean's question again and

579
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:33,820
We've kind of touched on answering so sorry Sean, but you know, this is what we do here

580
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:42,140
Well, we got five minutes left. So I'm wondering maybe we can go succinctly through like the thing that I this all makes me curious

581
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,310
How you might see a feature from beginning to end who might work on it

582
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:52,650
Maybe handoffs or however it may describe from story writing to design to engineering to release some monitoring

583
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:58,090
Okay, we've talked we've talked maybe a little about some of this but not maybe not the best

584
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:00,450
Yeah, we kind of did a piecemeal

585
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:06,410
We did we covered some good stuff the a B testing podcast

586
00:46:06,850 --> 00:46:10,650
Come to us for a tangential talk. We got that one nailed

587
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,450
from story writing right in

588
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:18,850
Initially that once that to me is it's very customer-focused. It's

589
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:25,310
And this is one of my challenges that I constantly see is it's no it's not about the work

590
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,050
The story needs to be about the outcome

591
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:36,150
How do we know we got there and who cares what's the context so completely agree with story writing then from the story

592
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:42,090
It says as Alan and I just just sort of I'll say detailed with double quotes

593
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:48,110
Okay. How do we decompose that? How do we generate? What are the alternatives? What and

594
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:50,910
with a heavy focus on on

595
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,170
lightweight in my humble opinion because the one thing that's

596
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:57,330
The one thing that's missing from Sean's

597
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:03,990
Discussion because he talks about story writing to design to engineering to release some monitoring in my humble opinion

598
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:09,050
There is a bunch of sort of the the loops through the system. I

599
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:14,250
Mission accelerate the achievement of shipable quality

600
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:22,610
Shipable quality may not be achieved in the first time the code goes to prod right? It could just be a a

601
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:27,550
an MVP that's missing a lot of things a lot of

602
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:34,810
Solidification because you're really just trying to determine is this idea something anyone freaking cares about?

603
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:42,350
But then you'll you'll go back to the drawing board add add additional hardening or or pivot entirely

604
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,280
to sort of

605
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,800
Submit the direction that the the idea came from

606
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,710
Obviously monitoring needs to be in place

607
00:47:53,230 --> 00:48:00,870
That I think is another tool for answering the questions that that we just talked about is this is this anything cares about?

608
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,310
Hey, we we operate under certain assumptions that

609
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:12,400
So, for example, maybe we didn't test if it can scale beyond a thousand concurrent callers and

610
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,400
We're suddenly way more popular than we expected

611
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,200
Right. Obviously, I would want monitoring in place and I would have a discussion around

612
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:28,930
Hey, if for some as an example if for some reason

613
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:32,430
This exceeds what we tested for

614
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:39,730
I want to monitor in the system that comes and tells me that I need to be observing this near real time because we

615
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,930
May have made a decision to ship it too soon

616
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:48,360
Right if if we tested it for for a thousand and it's a million callers

617
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,670
Right. We may want to roll back

618
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,530
True true

619
00:48:54,610 --> 00:49:01,230
One last thing to touch on I think and maybe we have to take some questions on this and answer more detailed questions

620
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:07,490
These open-ended questions aren't are not good for a be testing, but we do get some we do generate more questions from those which is good

621
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:12,890
I've been thinking like ever since I first brought up I but I questioned handoffs

622
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:18,570
I think it's worth just doing a quick recap on those because we do believe in teams of

623
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,450
specializing generalists or generalizing specialists and

624
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:29,890
Often whether it's a testing special or some testing background or performance or database or any other specialty

625
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,890
Which may live in just a few people on the team

626
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:39,890
Avoid the throw of the wall handoff. I think what we try and do on our team. We do a lot of pairing

627
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,550
when we have expertise

628
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:50,390
Because we want a collaborative handoff and I don't even think of it as a handoff when we need a bunch of

629
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,400
We need to make sure that networking is set up correctly for a new GCP cluster

630
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,770
Jesus Christ

631
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,530
Welcome to crazy world

632
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:10,430
Collaborating with a network engineer on the team who has some expertise there

633
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:16,770
It's a quick and easy way to do that versus and generate some learning on both sides versus just

634
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:20,340
Giving it to a network engineer and saying hey

635
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:25,860
I need this do this for me because I don't like handoffs like that they when I think a handoff should be a

636
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,180
collaboration between the hander and the handy

637
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:34,660
There may be places so there was guidance that I learned and I'm trying to figure out

638
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,740
I'm looking at my bookshelf. I don't see anything there. But one of them

639
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:45,190
One of the places that I learned around there is a role for specialists, right?

640
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,270
as the name might

641
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:49,570
State it needs to be something special

642
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:52,590
like security

643
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,110
Deep security is a specialization and if you're in a business where you need that

644
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:02,710
Right, but the one thing to be cautious about is by its nature

645
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,950
Handoff to a specialist is a bottleneck, right?

646
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:13,750
That's that was my the moment of my cringe earlier fully agree. We're on the same page, which is weird

647
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:20,390
But you know sometimes unavoidable, but it might be necessary and the way you account for that is

648
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:23,350
Is essentially you look at?

649
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,020
You you then have to figure out how to optimize

650
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,050
that particular bottleneck

651
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:40,510
And in terms of your end-to-end plan, you're gonna have to think through okay. How quickly is that bottleneck?

652
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,450
Getting through it sort of independent queue

653
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:48,570
All right. What does that mean for our timing? How do we how do we change our scope?

654
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:53,850
How do we go with a different solution in order for me to make sure that the end-to-end thing?

655
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:58,450
Reaches market while there's still a viable window off of opportunity

656
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:06,030
Anyway, yep, so anyway lean startup regurgitated. We'll call it that fan test ago

657
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:11,790
With some nuance in there. All right, we should we should call it a day it is or call it a Friday

658
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:18,140
Or wait call it another lonely day. You can go your own way, Brett

659
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,270
All right fantastic

660
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:24,630
Again showing my age

661
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:28,070
Yeah, all right. Well, I'm Alan's beard and

662
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,340
I am Alan's

663
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,660
beard's

664
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,820
predecessor

665
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:37,960
The wit on you is amazing. All right. We'll see you next time

666
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Bye
