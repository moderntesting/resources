1
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,130
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:11,950
Hi.

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,790
I'm Alan.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,610
I'm Brent.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,530
And we're back for episode 43 of AED testing.

6
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,530
We are back after a break.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:23,130
I apologize again for the audio yuckiness

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,850
in the last episode.

9
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,230
Hopefully it is better this time.

10
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,210
I have upgraded some equipment to try

11
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,730
and make it Brent proof.

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,770
That implies that the audio yuckiness was due to me.

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,610
Well, some of it was.

14
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,050
And I believe it was your channel that went offline.

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,250
We had multiple issues, multiple issues.

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,290
When you try and take my little weak signal and amplify it,

17
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,130
I end up amplifying some of Brent's microphone stand

18
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:52,210
fondling.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,850
I have fondle proof at the microphones.

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,690
And the Darth Vaderism, that's what bothered me the most.

21
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,620
I'm like, wow, I really should go check out my breathing.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,010
Yeah, hopefully this one is better.

23
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,270
So what's new with you, Brent?

24
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,850
I have just come back from Kauai.

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,730
Nice.

26
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,090
It was.

27
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,130
Have you been?

28
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,410
I've been to Maui.

29
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:17,910
OK.

30
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,680
I've been to Kauai.

31
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,360
Unless you're an outdoorsy guy, there's

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,160
not much to do in Kauai.

33
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,040
Sounds fun to me.

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,600
We're not outdoorsy people.

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,080
Oh.

36
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,600
But there are beaches in Kauai.

37
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,440
And we are definitely beach people.

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,360
I spent at least 50% of my time in the ocean.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,160
My favorite story was I was out.

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,240
You're as pale as ever.

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,800
So you must have had some good sunscreen.

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
I am not as pale as ever.

43
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,200
Slightly less pale.

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,040
I am golden brown and delicious.

45
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,150
My best story is I was out snorkeling with my younger son.

46
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,150
14.

47
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,530
This is only his second time ever he's been snorkeling.

48
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,890
And the first time, he was like eight.

49
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,710
And the waves were pushing him around.

50
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,710
This time, I was following him.

51
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,830
I was a good father paying attention of his son.

52
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,670
And suddenly, he just starts freaking out.

53
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,990
So father syndrome kicks in going, ah, crap.

54
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,990
I'm going to have to punch a shark in the nose

55
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,630
or some bullshit.

56
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,440
And he was actually freaking.

57
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,680
He starts pointing.

58
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,880
And he was swimming right next to a giant sea turtle.

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Oh, that's cool.

60
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,780
That's way cooler than punching a shark in the nose.

61
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,140
It would.

62
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,420
Surviving punching a shark in the nose

63
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,100
would probably be a much better story in a UB podcast.

64
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,140
But as we kept on swimming, we discovered

65
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,100
we were actually stuck in, I don't know what you call

66
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,340
a group of them, but a swarm of sea turtles.

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,940
There was like 10 of them.

68
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,420
And that rocks.

69
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,300
It did rock.

70
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,860
Just to amp up the drama just a little bit.

71
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,120
You're not allowed to touch the turtles.

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,680
They're an endangered species and touching them equals bad.

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,560
But so it was a real challenge when you're stuck

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
in a swarm of these things, battling the waves

75
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,720
and making sure, because the waves kept on pushing me

76
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,200
towards the sea turtles.

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,640
Anyway, there you go.

78
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,400
Very cool.

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,900
It was fun.

80
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,820
Nothing new with me, but there's something new with A.B.

81
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,500
testing for episode 43, something brand new.

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,900
So we have a sponsor for episode number 43.

83
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,460
My good friends at Star West asked if I'd give a plug

84
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,900
for their upcoming conference, and I'm going to do it.

85
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,860
Because if you look at all the conference talks

86
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,220
I've done over the years, one conference I've done

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,540
way more than any are the Star Conferences.

88
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,340
And in fact, I've probably been to more Star West

89
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,780
conferences than any others.

90
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,220
Huge fan of Lee Copeland helped put together that conference.

91
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,060
I just enjoy the crap out of it.

92
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,620
And I make, I'm not, obviously not doing this Star West,

93
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,500
but I'm trying to get back down there again.

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,060
I kind of like going to the conference near Disneyland.

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,260
It's kind of a lot of fun.

96
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,460
Is it in LA?

97
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,380
It's in Anaheim.

98
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,340
It's in the, it's, actually I didn't look up the hotel.

99
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,460
Usually every time I've gone it's been

100
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,340
in the Disneyland Hotel.

101
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,540
This is, as far as speaking goes, I've enjoyed it

102
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,860
and I encourage A.B. testing people to go.

103
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,980
If you're looking for a conference to go to,

104
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,380
looking for a way to connect with testers.

105
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,300
The talks, there's a couple of great keynotes.

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,420
Jason Arbin from Applause.

107
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,260
Do you ever meet Jason?

108
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,100
No.

109
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,660
Jason helped James Whitaker write the book

110
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,420
that was ripped off of my book,

111
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,260
the How Google Test Software book.

112
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,540
Oh.

113
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,860
So he's at Applause, but he is a really smart guy.

114
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,700
Does a great job.

115
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,870
Jeff Morgan, also awesome.

116
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,270
Tons of track speakers.

117
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:54,070
And what I encourage people that go to these conferences

118
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,070
to do is, is you get some value and learning and ideas

119
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,950
from the speakers.

120
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,790
It's not like you're gonna get every single word said

121
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,950
or things you're gonna take home and apply directly,

122
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,110
but you're gonna find nuggets, dozens if not

123
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,310
hundreds of nuggets, but some of the best learning happens

124
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,230
at these conferences.

125
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,030
For me, and for pretty much everyone I've talked to

126
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,470
is in just talking with other people at the conference

127
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,910
and getting a chance to talk to some of the speakers

128
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,750
one on one after their talk in the hallway at lunch,

129
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,630
at the pub, whatever.

130
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,070
It's a great way to learn.

131
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,390
So that's where I get the value out of conferences

132
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,270
is from just talking to people

133
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,360
and learning from each other.

134
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,660
So I have not ever been to any of the stars.

135
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,660
Back when Whitaker was a prominent keynote speaker,

136
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,640
he's invited me a couple of times to Star East,

137
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,560
but it never was convenient for me

138
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,740
to go all the way to Florida.

139
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,480
Getting knowledge around current techniques,

140
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,500
I have seen particularly Lee is,

141
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,660
of the leaders of these conferences

142
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,140
that I have visibility to,

143
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Lee is paying attention to the data movement,

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,820
the agile movement, and he's not fighting against it.

145
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,780
Absolutely not.

146
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,070
And there are, again, you need to take everything

147
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,310
with a critical eye.

148
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,870
Everything you learn whether it's from a conference,

149
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,910
from a book, from an article, from a blog, from Twitter,

150
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,070
you need to apply critical thinking

151
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,910
is how you decide what's worth learning

152
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,790
versus what's not learning.

153
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,710
So you need to apply that always.

154
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:40,470
Blind faith or blind, like, oh, what you said must be true,

155
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,270
is a recipe for disaster.

156
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,890
So that's with that caveat in mind.

157
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,710
So Star West is, I'll give a little plug now,

158
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,730
now that Brent is totally taking us off the rails,

159
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,950
but Star West is, I think,

160
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,770
one of the longest running test conferences out there.

161
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,450
And this year it's in October, October 2nd through 7th.

162
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,010
It's in Anaheim.

163
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,830
I'm going to assume Disneyland Hotel,

164
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,560
although I did not look that up.

165
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,560
There are over a hundred sessions.

166
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,320
One thing about Star is they run massive concurrent tracks.

167
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,840
So you can always find something.

168
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,040
And one thing I encourage,

169
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,240
and Lee will encourage you to do as well,

170
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,440
is if you go to a talk and it ends up

171
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,680
not being what you want, it's okay to leave.

172
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't throw up your arms, go, ugh, and leave,

173
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,560
but it's okay to go check one out.

174
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,100
And sometimes if there are one or two or three talks

175
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,160
I want to see all at the same time,

176
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,560
I will plan to rotate through them,

177
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,240
try and get the best knowledge I can.

178
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,680
So there is great information

179
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,440
and everything from test automation.

180
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,140
There's a bunch of stuff on agile testing,

181
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:48,360
perf testing, leadership, et cetera, tons of junk.

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,640
And then I mentioned networking as the way to learn.

183
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,960
And they have, in their expo,

184
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,560
they have a bunch of exhibitors, I think like 50.

185
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,200
You can speak one-on-one with the speakers,

186
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,960
get some free consulting.

187
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,400
Even more, there's a full day session on,

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,520
a bonus session, Women Who Test,

189
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,560
which I think is really cool.

190
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
And a great way to,

191
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,970
another great networking opportunity for women who test.

192
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,010
Hey, Brandt.

193
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,170
It gets even better.

194
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,930
So AB testers, if you want to go to the conference,

195
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,570
do you like to save money?

196
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,650
Who doesn't like to save money?

197
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,130
I love saving money.

198
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,530
So if you, you can, believe it or not,

199
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:30,130
and not maybe applicable,

200
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,130
but if you go to the Star West site

201
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,250
and you sign up for the conference

202
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,850
and you want $200 off,

203
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,770
just enter the promo code AB testing.

204
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,690
I've never had my,

205
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,330
I don't think I've ever had my own promo code before.

206
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,170
Me, but either.

207
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,210
It fills me with glee.

208
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,210
It really does.

209
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,670
So I'll post a link.

210
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:55,990
It's well.tcwaxstarwestab.

211
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,990
I'll post a link to that.

212
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,550
And I encourage AB testers who,

213
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,950
looking for a conference to go to, to attend.

214
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,270
And I have confirmed that it is at the Disneyland Hotel.

215
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,830
Yeah, I didn't want to make an assumption,

216
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,030
but thank you for confirming that.

217
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,950
It is at Disneyland Hotel.

218
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,750
I'm really not going to try and edit that in.

219
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,790
Great conference.

220
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,390
The AB testers can find some value there

221
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,110
and use that discount code to save you

222
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:22,950
or your employer a few bucks.

223
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,630
What's the discount code again?

224
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,150
AB testing.

225
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,590
All one word.

226
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,510
You know what that's worth?

227
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:31,830
$200, $200 off.

228
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,670
Sweet.

229
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:33,710
Thank you Star West.

230
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,550
All right, man.

231
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,950
Thank you for our first

232
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,270
and potentially our last ever sponsor.

233
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,990
Okay, moving on.

234
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,190
So our good friend,

235
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,650
I wouldn't call him a good friend

236
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,110
because I don't know if we have any good friends,

237
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,230
but our one of the three, Danny Thott.

238
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,510
Software Alchemist posted just this morning last night.

239
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,990
I just saw the post today.

240
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,190
So did I.

241
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,170
And I wanted to talk about a few things in the post

242
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,430
because he gave us a shout out.

243
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:06,830
And the post is about the demise, the fadingness.

244
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,670
What does he call it?

245
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,250
A black box testing.

246
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,490
Brent's learning how to operate

247
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:16,190
his mechanical electronic device here.

248
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,190
The name of the post,

249
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:23,020
the black box tester role may be fading away.

250
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,100
And we could have a long discussion

251
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,700
about the truth and non-truth of that.

252
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:32,810
I think it's definitely true in some ways and not in others.

253
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,110
For example, on, you know, I am not a black box tester.

254
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,550
I do a bunch of different things,

255
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,690
but I employ black box testers.

256
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,090
I was trying to think through the last time

257
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,550
I had a black box tester as an employee.

258
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,370
Yeah, and these are vendor positions.

259
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,210
And it might be measured in decades.

260
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:00,830
I don't know that all teams would need a black box tester.

261
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:05,280
I think, I think it'd be, again, a long discussion.

262
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Happy to have it.

263
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,560
Maybe not today.

264
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,970
Cause what we really want to get to is

265
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:14,210
Danny gives us a little bit of a shout out.

266
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,050
Yes.

267
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,610
So can you read what Danny says?

268
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,130
Yes, and thanks Danny for the shout out.

269
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,970
Of course.

270
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,410
What Danny says is I have been following

271
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,450
Microsoft employees, Alan Page and Brent Jensen

272
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,330
on their AB podcast.

273
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,170
That's us.

274
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,070
The AB testing podcast.

275
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,590
They have had fairly traditional testing roles

276
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,990
and are now in roles that seem much more future proof.

277
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,750
Brent is now a data scientist,

278
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,950
specifically principal data scientist manager.

279
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,270
Alan, principal software engineer

280
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,710
describes himself as a helper,

281
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,710
doing odd but challenging tasks

282
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:55,140
that don't easily fit the developer roles on his team,

283
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,120
which is something that appeals to me, Danny.

284
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,280
Both are still involved in the testing process.

285
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,160
The project structures they describe

286
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,300
seem to be on the leading edge of the future

287
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,400
of the software testing role.

288
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,920
In my limited view of the software industry,

289
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,260
I don't see many companies that are anywhere near

290
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,560
Microsoft in their evolution.

291
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,520
If the traditional black box tester role is fading,

292
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,160
I think it's going to happen very slowly.

293
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,260
I think it will require a very broad view of the industry

294
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,460
to track a slow evolution like this.

295
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,740
And I'm curious if you've heard from anyone

296
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,880
who is in a good position to see it.

297
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,240
Danny does have a caveat there.

298
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,280
He says in his limited view of the industry.

299
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:41,340
I think Danny actually has a fairly non-limited view

300
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:46,630
of the industry, yet I'm going to say it right here.

301
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,850
I'm glad you think that Brent and I

302
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,450
are on the leading edge of the future.

303
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,570
I'm going to get the words wrong here,

304
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:57,570
but I don't think Microsoft is anywhere near the forefront

305
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,610
on how unified engineering or how to function

306
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,340
in an org without black box testers.

307
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,180
No, I-

308
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,240
My org is because I'm awesome, but Microsoft as a whole.

309
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,900
No, even I have a ways to go, I think.

310
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,240
I would say like us being on the,

311
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,680
Microsoft being on the leading edge here.

312
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,230
When I read that in this post,

313
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,250
it kind of took me aback a bit.

314
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,930
Alan and I have been talking on this topic

315
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,290
in various different communities

316
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,130
for it seems like five years now.

317
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,770
Okay, for the record, I don't think you have to drink

318
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,550
for that one, that was well put.

319
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,390
Thank you.

320
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,420
All right, go on.

321
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,520
And when we first started talking about this,

322
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,570
we, much like I think Danny is doing referencing us,

323
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:49,630
we were talking about other companies

324
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,630
that we were aware of that were pushing

325
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:58,230
the boundaries and leading this edge.

326
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,070
Like when, like we've talked about,

327
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,950
I'll go ahead and drink.

328
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,070
He's drinking coffee for the record.

329
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,690
Yeah, make believe Irish.

330
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,550
We've talked about it on the podcast

331
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,630
that not all of Microsoft has really moved

332
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,490
towards this transition.

333
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:22,680
Although I, except for vendors,

334
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,170
like I can't think of a single team

335
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,850
that employs a full-time black box test area at Microsoft.

336
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,690
Oh no, absolutely.

337
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,690
I'm 99.99% positive that they don't exist at Microsoft.

338
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,730
I would tend to agree.

339
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,730
And if they do, it's an extremely rare context sensitive

340
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,310
situation.

341
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,380
So when Microsoft gets accused of the leading edge,

342
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,220
what happens to me is I go, but we're so far behind.

343
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,220
Yeah, that's the way I feel too.

344
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,030
I see a lot of companies really better at this,

345
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,830
better at doing, like I'm trying to work my team,

346
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,910
for example, towards continuous deployment.

347
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,750
Yep.

348
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,630
Which requires such a high level of daily quality

349
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,990
that we, and I know plenty of other companies do this,

350
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,710
plenty of other companies bigger than

351
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,790
and with more baggage in some cases

352
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,790
than what my team has, but they're able to pull that off.

353
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,910
They've made it farther.

354
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,270
I still feel like I'm chasing where I think we need to be

355
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,070
to be a good 21st century software engineering team.

356
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,190
I do, I spent some time thinking about

357
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,610
why do I feel this way?

358
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,270
And we've heard from other of the three

359
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:52,200
around things like, oh, we are isolated,

360
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,920
Microsoft environment isn't like everybody else, right?

361
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,760
And that may in fact be true.

362
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,370
The thing that as I was thinking through

363
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,330
about what could be the difference between my perception

364
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,800
and say Danny's or other listeners perception.

365
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,400
And one of them I thought about is all the companies

366
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,640
that I know of that don't employ testers,

367
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,340
the vast majority of them never had testers to begin with.

368
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,500
Absolutely true.

369
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,700
So it's very possible we're leading

370
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,400
on the executing this transition.

371
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,780
Yes, and that's actually a good way to put that.

372
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:44,480
Nice insight there, Brent, because I think that

373
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
the transition is something that we've struggled with

374
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,260
and sometimes done well, sometimes done poorly,

375
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,440
but it's that transition that's really hard.

376
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,600
And to be clear for any first time listeners

377
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,360
who haven't heard this before, nothing to drink.

378
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,240
These companies that don't have testers or teams

379
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,520
that don't have testers, they still guaranteed,

380
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,980
still have people focusing on quality

381
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,680
or focusing on testing activities.

382
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,300
Those things still happen.

383
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,800
So I don't want anyone, every time we say no testers,

384
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,120
I feel like I have to remind people that means

385
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,640
it doesn't mean no testing.

386
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,440
That is correct.

387
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,510
Like, and we're proponents of it on the podcast.

388
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,210
There is a new balance that you need to strike

389
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:43,420
in terms of preventative care of your software.

390
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,700
And in my humble opinion, it's just simply

391
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,940
more productive and more efficient

392
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,970
to have the testing tasks accomplished

393
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,130
by a specializing generalist versus a single individual

394
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,450
whose sole duty is to be paid to do that testing.

395
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,290
Yeah, I agree.

396
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,890
I think, and Danny talks in that article about,

397
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,930
and even he references Kim Caner's article

398
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,090
talking about the need to pick up some programming skills

399
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,990
or some, doesn't be programming,

400
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,310
could be technical skills.

401
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,270
I'm looking for someone from my team,

402
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,210
not necessarily to do programming,

403
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,750
but someone who is a wizard with configuring websites

404
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,210
and deployments and Azure site management,

405
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,470
et cetera, et cetera.

406
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,510
And it's technical, it's not coding necessarily,

407
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:42,130
but it's critical to have.

408
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,890
And those people that can do that

409
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,270
and keep an eye on quality,

410
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,910
I think they're as good as gold.

411
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,110
You can stay employed if you have a breadth of skills.

412
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:56,770
The one thing that Danny has talked about

413
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,700
that I do think is,

414
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,420
so I got a LinkedIn message

415
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,260
from one of our listeners in India.

416
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,640
You wanna take a stab at the name?

417
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,840
Looks like a Polish name.

418
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,280
Ewa, it could be Eva with a W, Barzakoska.

419
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,560
We'll go with that.

420
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,600
Working in India.

421
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,640
Yep.

422
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,240
Barzakoska. Barzakoska.

423
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
Barzakoska. Barzakoska.

424
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,240
And she sent me a LinkedIn connection invite thingy.

425
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,930
Okay.

426
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,770
A linker?

427
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,390
Yep.

428
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,830
And wanted to be able to ask questions,

429
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:49,080
but in her last message sent the following.

430
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,240
Hey, Brent, you know, one thing I really liked

431
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,640
that I had not had enough characters in the invite

432
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,440
to express is that you guys are still learning.

433
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,120
One of you mentioned taking a MOOC in analytics.

434
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
Do you know what that is?

435
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,390
No, master of occupational crime.

436
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,550
Yep.

437
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,390
And I'm learning to code right now

438
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,350
and from time to time,

439
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:18,350
I also take MOOCs and find it really encouraging

440
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,090
to hear that people who are already established

441
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,990
in their industry spend their free time

442
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,950
learning new things to stay relevant.

443
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:28,380
I wonder if OC is online course.

444
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,220
It might be.

445
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,900
Something cause I do, I'm not always doing one,

446
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,460
but I frequently do online courses

447
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,540
in things I just need to know more about to feel relevant.

448
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,100
But to hijack the thread here.

449
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,420
Well, so I got to the,

450
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:50,300
then she goes on to discuss how awesome the podcast is.

451
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,620
I'm blushing.

452
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,810
So thank you for the feedback.

453
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,570
But the point that Danny and Eva, Eva,

454
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,240
sorry about is.

455
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,160
Who by the way, no longer likes the podcast,

456
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,760
given our butchering of the name.

457
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,200
Yeah, I hugely apologize for that.

458
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,860
Is it's really important to have a sense

459
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,060
of what you need to grow into?

460
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,290
Yeah, and so first off, the easy part is

461
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,810
if you're in your job and you think,

462
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,270
I'm pretty good at this, I'll just keep doing this,

463
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,850
no need to learn anything else,

464
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,570
either at best career stagnation,

465
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,970
but at worst career limiting or more likely career limiting.

466
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,730
But there's that challenge of what should I learn

467
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,650
and how much of it should I learn?

468
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,320
And that's a contextual and an experienced thing.

469
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,000
I read this book maybe as long as 20 years ago.

470
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,960
I think it was on management or leadership.

471
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
And one of the things that suggested

472
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,720
is that you should always look for ways to learn.

473
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,800
Like read, give examples of magazines.

474
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,280
And don't worry if they're not in your field

475
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,720
because you'll pull ideas from them.

476
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,840
That breadth will allow you to connect things

477
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
in the way that Steven Johnson,

478
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,120
in where good ideas come from

479
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,160
talks about that network effect.

480
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,280
And so for about five years,

481
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,800
I subscribed to this little 12 page magazine

482
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,560
called Science News, which came every week

483
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,400
or every two weeks.

484
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,220
It was the most fascinating thing in the world.

485
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,620
Nothing to do with testing,

486
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,520
nothing to do with software engineering.

487
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:42,370
Occasionally about technology,

488
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:47,690
but it was, imagine like scientists doing active research

489
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,550
could publish not in the boring academic way,

490
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,910
meant for people like me to read,

491
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,830
articles on their research every couple weeks.

492
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:00,270
It was a great outlet for them, I imagine.

493
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,090
But just, it was some of the best advice

494
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,710
I'd ever been given through a book in my life.

495
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,690
But I learned just enough.

496
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:12,850
It tickled my brain enough to make me want,

497
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,690
to give me some expansion.

498
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,970
But as far as learning, look for online courses,

499
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,450
look for things you think you need to know more about.

500
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,370
Sometimes, I can't remember why, I remember why.

501
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,370
When Microsoft was making this move towards data science

502
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,810
and data analysis and business intelligence,

503
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,170
I wanted to be ahead of the curve.

504
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:39,650
So the reason I'm able to fire off,

505
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,510
Brent always freaks out,

506
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,090
Brent is a real data scientist,

507
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:45,110
freaks out when I fire off mathematical terms

508
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:47,930
or data science terms in the right context

509
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,450
and make them make sense.

510
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,410
I've gotten used to it, but I would say-

511
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:55,290
It does freak him out, and it's because-

512
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:57,770
When he tells me he's gonna go present

513
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,890
how to do A-B testing to a workshop of hundreds of people,

514
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:02,730
that freaks me out.

515
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,130
And then I tell him what I'm doing,

516
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,990
and he goes, oh, okay.

517
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,850
Because I took the time to go through courses

518
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,250
and reading and videos to learn how this stuff works.

519
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:18,170
And then if you wanna make sure you know something,

520
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,750
the best way to make sure you know it is try and teach it.

521
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,640
So if I can, it's one thing just to repeat things I've read,

522
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,000
but that works great as long as there are never any questions

523
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,880
and as long as I can explain it perfectly.

524
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,860
But you have to teach something,

525
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,880
you have to know it well enough

526
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,080
to understand the nuance and how to-

527
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,480
And the other thing I would add-

528
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,320
Yeah.

529
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,160
You should target teaching it,

530
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,400
and you should target applying it.

531
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,280
Yes, that's absolutely true.

532
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,480
But the reason, and I'll finish up here,

533
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,800
but the reason I learned those things,

534
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,440
I wanted to know them and I wanted to know them well enough

535
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,160
to be able to teach them to other people.

536
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,560
I think there's some valuable things in there.

537
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,320
So that's how I figured out how much I had to learn of it.

538
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,600
So I could teach it to other people.

539
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,160
There's an old phrase,

540
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,160
and that is the only constant in life is change.

541
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:16,160
And back in the day when I had my first management job

542
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,880
here at Microsoft,

543
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,680
it occurred to me pretty quickly

544
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,280
that in the software industry,

545
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,820
we change much more frequently

546
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,440
than most industries I'm aware of.

547
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,580
And I discovered very quickly

548
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,460
that the people who did best

549
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,870
were not those who learned to survive change,

550
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,180
but thrived on it.

551
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,340
And learning new things,

552
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,770
getting ideas from other industries.

553
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,610
I'll give you a recent example

554
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,200
of something that I'm working on.

555
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,390
I run a service organization,

556
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,390
and I'm busily spending a lot of time reading white papers

557
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:10,060
on healthcare.

558
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:14,000
And the primary reason why is most services

559
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,960
have some form or another of signals,

560
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,800
often referred to as pings or heartbeats

561
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,170
around how well the service is operating.

562
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,110
Well, the healthcare industry

563
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,750
also spends a lot of time worried about

564
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,550
how well heartbeats are operating.

565
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,390
And they've done a lot of advances

566
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,570
around near real-time analytics.

567
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,530
So I'm reading a lot of these white papers

568
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:46,890
and mapping several of their efficiency concepts

569
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,130
into something that's service-based.

570
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,250
It reminds me, one of my bachelor's degree was in math.

571
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,930
And one of the few things

572
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,450
that have stuck with my math degree

573
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,410
was this concept of a mapping function,

574
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:07,010
where if you knew how to prove something

575
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,090
in one environment,

576
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,120
but you're in a different environment,

577
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,840
you could map from environment B

578
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,200
to environment A, do that work, then map it back.

579
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,000
It's kind of the same thing with these concepts.

580
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,400
Healthcare, yeah, they're worried about real heartbeats,

581
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,850
but you can map it to a more technical concept,

582
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,060
use the same solution.

583
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,300
In terms of learning, I would recommend people to

584
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,540
not only look for online courses,

585
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,500
I would spend 30% of your time

586
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,730
just looking for things that are,

587
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,610
you have no idea if it's going to apply,

588
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,170
and then spend a good portion of those things

589
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,760
that are something you've never done,

590
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,020
but you have a 50% confidence you can actually use it.

591
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,060
One of the things I got from,

592
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,180
I mentioned the science news story earlier,

593
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,940
the little thin magazine,

594
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,260
one of the things I got from that

595
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,700
was exactly what you're talking about.

596
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,520
It's nothing to do with software,

597
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,280
but every once in a while,

598
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,880
I would find something I could map.

599
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,000
I wasn't looking for it,

600
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,940
I just read it because it was interesting as hell,

601
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,080
but I was able to find,

602
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,040
it tickled some ideas and it may not even be direct.

603
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,880
It may not be like,

604
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,920
oh, I can use this plant genome mapping

605
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,200
to figure out software, no,

606
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,520
but the ideas would tickle something.

607
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,000
And I think if you want to stay on the edge

608
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,200
and you want to really advance your career,

609
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,940
and for me, if I'm not learning,

610
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,700
I am just bored as hell.

611
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,820
I have to be learning,

612
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,780
I have to be learning something new.

613
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,900
So I think that's why I'm still employed,

614
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,130
even though my degrees are in music, perhaps.

615
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,010
I know it's why I am.

616
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,910
The last thing I'll say on this topic is,

617
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,430
I know what really spawned this for me.

618
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:09,890
You mentioned your, what was it, science news.

619
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:15,270
For me, what inspired this was really reading two books.

620
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,650
Number one,

621
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,490
Green Eggs and Ham.

622
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:25,330
Nope.

623
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:28,330
Christopher Alexander's book,

624
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,990
The Timeless Way of Building,

625
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,990
as well as, you know the head first series of books?

626
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,870
The head first design patterns book.

627
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,430
That's a very good,

628
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:44,070
that became my favorite book on design patterns.

629
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:47,470
Even if you don't know coding very well,

630
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:50,190
I would recommend the design patterns book

631
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,590
because what we're talking about,

632
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,430
like in my healthcare example,

633
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,570
and the example you just gave,

634
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,670
what we're really talking about

635
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:02,770
is universal process design patterns

636
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,130
that apply in a context free fashion.

637
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,090
You know, that's a really good example

638
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,050
or recommendation for,

639
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,650
you know, testers talking about being technical.

640
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,690
I better learn to program.

641
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:17,850
I better take a course in whatever.

642
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,420
But as far as breadth goes,

643
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,340
and specializing in generalists,

644
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,820
that head first design patterns book

645
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,820
is maybe a great recommendation

646
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,500
as one of the first few books you learn

647
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,420
is you wanna just start broadening.

648
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,260
Yeah.

649
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,080
It's really good.

650
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,580
I've read the Alexander book as well

651
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,900
and I've even read,

652
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,260
have you read the Gang of Four patterns book?

653
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,520
I have the Gang of Four.

654
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,400
I do not recommend reading it.

655
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,760
No, I do.

656
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,200
Like what if you can't sleep at night

657
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,520
and you wanna.

658
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,360
It works for that.

659
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,180
Yeah, it does.

660
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,020
Exactly.

661
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,600
It's great for insomnia.

662
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
For design patterns,

663
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,920
like the way I've,

664
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,120
Al Shalloway and the,

665
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,630
okay, he's a buddy of mine.

666
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,350
And yeah, he and I go to lunch quite often.

667
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,710
How come you never invite me to lunch with Al?

668
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,710
I'll do it next time.

669
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,550
You better.

670
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,240
The way I tell.

671
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,760
Purely so I can name drop Al Shalloway too.

672
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
The way I tell people

673
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,440
if they wanna dive deep into design patterns

674
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,520
and you don't need to,

675
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,760
if you're one of the three

676
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,880
and you spend most of your time as a black box tester,

677
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,760
just read the head first one.

678
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,480
But if you wanna go deeper,

679
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:34,730
then pick up Al Shalloway's book,

680
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,680
Explaining Design Patterns.

681
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,000
Head first design patterns

682
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:43,350
will teach you why design patterns are freaking cool.

683
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,190
Okay, and.

684
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,010
In great ways.

685
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:45,850
In great ways.

686
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,870
With examples using pizza and other things.

687
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,070
Yeah, and what was it?

688
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,190
Star buzz.

689
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,510
And the duck thing.

690
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:55,550
Yeah, it is just.

691
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,550
It's a great.

692
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,750
It's really well done.

693
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,150
It's really, it really is.

694
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,750
And just to interrupt there,

695
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,910
I've read,

696
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,270
that was the first head first book I read

697
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,630
and I've read a few others.

698
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,510
They're good, but not as good as the design patterns one.

699
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,110
It is the best head first book.

700
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:11,570
But the head first,

701
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,670
the head first style,

702
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,710
if you have a choice between getting a

703
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,270
blah, blah, blah for dummies

704
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,150
or the head first blah, blah, blah.

705
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,270
Or even the textbook.

706
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,630
Get the head first blah, blah, blah.

707
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,070
Yeah.

708
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,310
Then go look at

709
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,030
the explaining design patterns.

710
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,670
Because what Al does really well in that book,

711
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,430
is it shows you how to design with design patterns.

712
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,990
How there's this fantastic process called CVA,

713
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,990
which I'm no longer remembering

714
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,990
what the acronym stands for.

715
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,510
Where it allows you to pick and choose.

716
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,150
So let's say you got to connect two components.

717
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,470
Do I choose the adapter pattern?

718
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,630
Do I choose the bridge pattern?

719
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:56,510
There is a,

720
00:32:56,550 --> 00:33:01,550
there is a great process that he goes through and describes

721
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,910
around how to pick which design patterns to use.

722
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,630
And then the head or the gang of four book,

723
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,630
Dear God, never start with that book.

724
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,870
That book is a reference.

725
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,310
This book is,

726
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:21,310
it's like going to the index card section of a library.

727
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,470
It tells you what other things exist.

728
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,670
So if you going through and you're designing,

729
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,150
you're going, you know,

730
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,670
I don't think this pattern fits.

731
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:32,630
That's a good book to use as a reference.

732
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,990
And I have,

733
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,190
I probably have 10 different books on design patterns

734
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,030
in my library in my office.

735
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,080
Those three are the ones I use the most often.

736
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:44,920
Very cool.

737
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,720
Hey, we have just a few minutes left,

738
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,750
but I want to make sure that we get to the

739
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,590
mailbag.

740
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,410
I love mailbag.

741
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,050
Who doesn't love mailbag?

742
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,130
And we've done this before with other people

743
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,690
where we've highlighted one person

744
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:03,770
for pretty much the whole show.

745
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,100
And today is apparently Danny Fot day.

746
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,580
Because Danny Fot had a question.

747
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,580
He asked in our one of the three.slack.com channel team.

748
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,560
He asked,

749
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,160
what do you think of property based testing tools?

750
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,640
And there's an example,

751
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,000
I haven't tried one in anger,

752
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,920
but from what I've read,

753
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,520
these appear to be useful tools for exploratory testing,

754
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,440
but are not a substitute for unit tests

755
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,880
given their non determinism, et cetera, et cetera.

756
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,200
What do you think of these?

757
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,160
So the question is really,

758
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:42,510
there's some discussion afterwards in the slack messages,

759
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,070
but really it's,

760
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,510
Brent's looking at me very confused.

761
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,110
So go back to that lesson,

762
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,670
they're not suitable for unit tests

763
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:53,250
because of their non determinism.

764
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,330
Why are they non deterministic?

765
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,530
Not the point.

766
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:01,130
There's a link in which Dave Thomas

767
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,490
makes somewhat trolly assertion

768
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,970
that unit tests are a waste of time.

769
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,690
Everyone should be using quick check.

770
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,890
I said trolly because other comments make it clear

771
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:11,170
he's actually railing against bad unit testing.

772
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:13,450
So his position is probably a bit more nuanced

773
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,490
in the statement implies,

774
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,050
which is absolutely true.

775
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,000
I also am against bad unit testing.

776
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,840
I'm also-

777
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,200
I will take a strong stance.

778
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,270
So-

779
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,670
Wait, I'm gonna lay down some controversy.

780
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,800
I am 100% against bad testing in all forms.

781
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,320
For once I'm going to agree with you, Brent.

782
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,520
So since the dawn of time

783
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,960
or the dawn of software engineering,

784
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,420
there have been companies who strive to

785
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,380
not only make our lives easier,

786
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,980
but to advertise the crap

787
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,140
out of how much easier they've made our lives.

788
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:56,100
Whether it's in most testers have seen

789
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,020
the dozens, if not hundreds of tools

790
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,260
that will allow you to automate all your testing

791
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,150
without writing any code.

792
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,430
Here we have an example, not quite as bad as that.

793
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,110
We have an example of tools

794
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,110
and Microsoft has had some similar tools.

795
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,510
They're part of Visual Studio now,

796
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,070
which do some automatic unit testing

797
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:17,190
by looking at the parameters and the contracts

798
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,910
and generating a whole bunch of unit tests,

799
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,390
different parameters and finding the bugs for you.

800
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:22,510
Great tools.

801
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,510
Great tools.

802
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,470
They help you find some bugs.

803
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,230
Some of which may be very obscure

804
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,910
and wouldn't be hit, we'll call them edge cases.

805
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:31,630
But as testers, we know the value

806
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,830
in fixing the edge cases

807
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:34,910
because when you have a million users,

808
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,790
you have a significant portion hitting those edge cases.

809
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,190
So all good.

810
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,830
But are they a substitute for unit testing?

811
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,350
And my answer is absolutely no.

812
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,510
They are a supplement for unit testing

813
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,230
because the value in unit testing,

814
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,830
even if you're not doing test driven development,

815
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,570
is it makes you write better, cleaner code

816
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,450
in the first place

817
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:57,890
because you have to write code that is testable.

818
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:58,890
I have trained.

819
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,930
You said even if you're not doing TDD

820
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,730
and that's not true,

821
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,090
if you're not doing TDD,

822
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,530
then you're writing your code

823
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:08,610
and then using the stupid tool to generate stupid tests.

824
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,930
So, no backup.

825
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,010
So now I wanna say,

826
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,450
if you're writing unit tests without doing TDD,

827
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,970
I have trained dozens, hundreds of developers

828
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,570
in both writing tests with using TDD

829
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:24,050
and writing unit tests without using TDD.

830
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:27,050
Now TDD, we can talk about it.

831
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,930
Okay, I will talk about it.

832
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,010
Because you have to write your tests first,

833
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,170
you consciously think about how that code has to function.

834
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,250
Using TDD makes you write

835
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,490
more testable, better designed code.

836
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,190
But what I found in experience,

837
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,670
even if people don't jump onto TDD

838
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,610
and write the unit tests afterwards,

839
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,210
once they, in my experience,

840
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:51,110
not everyone, but the majority for sure,

841
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,810
even if they know they're going to be writing unit tests,

842
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,530
just the fact that they know

843
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:57,090
they're going to be writing unit tests,

844
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:59,770
they write clearer, more concise code

845
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,930
than they would have if they knew

846
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:02,250
they weren't going to test it.

847
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,130
Or when they go to write that unit test,

848
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,250
the first thing they do is go,

849
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,530
oh crap, I can't test this.

850
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,830
Let me refactor my code and make it more testable.

851
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,370
Those things do happen.

852
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,730
TDD, in my experience,

853
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,930
is the most efficient and best way

854
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,610
to get that code that way in the first place.

855
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,330
Yep, but for those that won't jump in,

856
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,350
I do think that just writing the unit tests

857
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,450
and having some discipline around that

858
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,230
has not equal, but in some cases, similar benefit.

859
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,590
One of the questions,

860
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,530
I don't know if he had it in this particular response,

861
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,550
but one of the questions that popped out,

862
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,660
Alan alluded to it, or Luke, Alan eluded to it.

863
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,860
Hey, is unit, is, I'll call it PBT,

864
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:49,200
a replacement for unit testing.

865
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,420
And I'm going to say, absolutely not.

866
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,380
Well duh.

867
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,020
And the biggest reason, because,

868
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,680
so I love tools.

869
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,380
Tools simplify our lives, they make everything better.

870
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,660
But there's one thing that they do that's really bad.

871
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:12,420
And that is they encourage intellectual laziness.

872
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,340
So any developer who picks up these tools that go,

873
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:18,020
hey look, I just generated 3,000 test cases,

874
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,330
my unit test suite is done.

875
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:26,130
Get none of the design benefits

876
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,690
that you just referred to.

877
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,330
Yeah, I think for a lot of things in testing,

878
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:34,480
if there's some sort of dichotomy, it's probably wrong.

879
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,080
So does automation replace testers?

880
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,200
No, does it enhance them?

881
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,040
Yes.

882
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,740
Replace testers?

883
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,840
Testers or testing?

884
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,680
Testing.

885
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,520
Testers, yeah.

886
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,560
If you have a bunch of automation.

887
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,800
It's not the point you're making.

888
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,440
So the point is, we look for things,

889
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,880
and we don't look, we're told that a tool

890
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,520
or something will replace something else.

891
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,900
But in most cases in testing or software engineering,

892
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,080
the tool merely enhances or supplements.

893
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,320
In fact, not merely, that's the main benefit.

894
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,960
And I think if I could jump into marketing

895
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,880
of testing tools for a while,

896
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,920
I wanna talk about how they supplement, not replace.

897
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,000
These tools we're talking about

898
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,280
as far as test generation based on inputs,

899
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,480
totally supplements unit tests.

900
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,560
If you wanna run those, I think it's great.

901
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
I think you'll find a lot more bugs.

902
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,400
You still have to write good unit tests.

903
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,120
If someone pick random Juju Fruit,

904
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
it's probably too close to something,

905
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,200
there's so many names of automation tools,

906
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,600
but Juju Fruit automation framework.

907
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,720
Great test automation, don't have to write any code.

908
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,000
Is that gonna replace my unit test?

909
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
No, my integration test?

910
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,620
No.

911
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,320
Is there no use for it all at all?

912
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,240
No, because I may decide like,

913
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,200
oh yeah, this is automation tool,

914
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,820
works at a very high level.

915
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,320
May have some false positives.

916
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,440
May have some flakiness, cause you're automation,

917
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,710
but there may be some,

918
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,550
I would guarantee there's some places I could find

919
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,140
to use that, that would give me some coverage

920
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,140
I couldn't do by myself.

921
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,260
But it doesn't replace anything I do.

922
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,840
But the point is I can use any of these tools

923
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:12,500
to enhance what I'm doing.

924
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,300
Not to replace things I'm doing.

925
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,100
You can, the thing I still wanna sort of rail against

926
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:24,400
is it is not, none of these tools.

927
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,680
So let's talk about it a different way.

928
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,440
The benefits of these tools.

929
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,840
Okay, so if the goal that you're trying to achieve

930
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:35,980
is a checkbox claiming I have a unit test suite.

931
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,820
You know what?

932
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,500
Test generation tools kick ass at that.

933
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,260
If that's the goal you're trying to do,

934
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,740
knock yourself out, you're going to have

935
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,820
a bunch of tests really rapidly.

936
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,900
That's worth a tangent because, very quick,

937
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,660
I'll just make a point that,

938
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,180
I love that you bring up the checkbox,

939
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,540
cause so much of what I hear and experience

940
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,460
in engineering is about,

941
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,140
there's a lot of checkbox engineering.

942
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,260
We don't need to get the benefit of this,

943
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,500
we just need to say we've done it.

944
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,420
Right.

945
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,260
Go on.

946
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,460
And I do know, particularly in the last five years,

947
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,760
as Microsoft has gone through this transition,

948
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,600
sort of a bookend of the podcast today,

949
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,180
there are several devs that just like,

950
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,880
God damn it, I don't wanna think about testing.

951
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,840
I just want a tool that just gives me that checkbox.

952
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,880
Right.

953
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,440
Now, if you wanna move up the stack

954
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,590
and have your code be better maintenance,

955
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:38,110
easier to maintain,

956
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:43,110
then, even then, these test generation tools will help you

957
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:46,390
and you'll still have to provide

958
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,320
a modest amount of thoughtfulness

959
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,520
in order to maximize that benefit

960
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,080
around the maintenance cost.

961
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:59,880
If you just go, I'm gonna generate a bunch of test cases,

962
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,160
yay, checkbox, well, when that test suite runs,

963
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,000
you're going to be stuck into a bunch of maintenance,

964
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,600
understanding why this test case is suddenly failing,

965
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,320
blah, blah, blah.

966
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,240
So even then, so winding up,

967
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,340
this can help reduce test maintenance.

968
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,380
Now, if you wanna go even further and say,

969
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,700
hey, I want the code I write, have the maximum ROI,

970
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,900
which means reusability,

971
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,080
the ability to integrate new features on demand,

972
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,660
reacting to the marketplace,

973
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:40,600
then you're going to need 70% thoughtfulness

974
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,630
and 30% this type of tooling.

975
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,810
This is where, again, where TDD comes into play.

976
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,810
TDD forces you into that thoughtful design process

977
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,100
so that you can construct your code in a way that yields

978
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,700
that top tier of benefits that I just mentioned.

979
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,740
Yeah, I think there's a whole podcast on sort of,

980
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,340
I've been thinking about it while you're talking,

981
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:09,370
checkbox engineering versus craftsmanship.

982
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:10,530
I love these tools.

983
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:14,170
The biggest problem, there's a new catchphrase.

984
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,490
Automation is great.

985
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:20,210
Automation allows you to take a lot of these painful things

986
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,210
and do them really easy.

987
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:25,530
But the problem with automation is it also allows you

988
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,690
to really reduce the friction on delivering

989
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,690
on really crappy outcomes.

990
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:37,690
Like, now I have a test suite of a million test cases

991
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,610
all auto-generated where on any given day,

992
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,310
25% are failing.

993
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:44,870
Oh God.

994
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,230
Yeah. Do the math, that's awful.

995
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:47,680
Yep.

996
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,540
All right, we are done,

997
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,380
and it looks like my microphone's still recording,

998
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,400
so I'm pretty happy.

999
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,160
I'll get this edited and out to the people soon.

1000
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,000
Thanks everybody.

1001
00:44:59,000 --> 00:44:59,840
I'm Alan.

1002
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,660
I'm Brent.

1003
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,500
We'll see you next time.

1004
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,340
Yep.
