00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:08,630
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:14,950
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,430
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,940
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,260
I have pressed record.

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,360
I have pressed the intro.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,300
I have not yet pressed Brent.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,650
Brent, how are you doing today?

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,810
I'm doing super.

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:38,020
Super like super man, super dog.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,460
I am emotionally positive.

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,900
I am physically drained, as you know.

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,930
So we got delayed a week for the podcast.

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,930
So I know what is it?

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,690
Jason gets ticked off when we're late.

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,840
Well, you get what you pay for, right?

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,080
Although even if he had paid for it, we would have still been late.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:16,760
I was last week suffering through my second bout of the COVID.

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,160
I officially was negative yesterday.

20
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,800
So a little longer than 10 days.

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,800
How was it this time?

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,480
I know- Oh, this one sucked.

23
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,120
Oh, really?

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,360
Because I know somebody who just got it for the first time.

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,560
And it was kind of mellow for them.

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I hate them.

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,120
But I'm still one and done.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,840
It's inevitable.

29
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,920
It's inevitable that I'll get it sometime and I don't walk to you.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
But the darn thing's never going away.

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,840
And it's just going to become the new 10 day flu.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,000
It's horrible.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,620
For me, no.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,100
So both times, it was the first day that sucked.

35
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:13,300
But last time, I just felt tired and miserable.

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,860
This time, like, no, nausea, full on fever, pain out

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,420
of every nerve in my body, it sucked.

38
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,410
But it only sucked for about 36 hours.

39
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,730
Not bad.

40
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,490
So the rest of it was, I mean, I just worked from home.

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,570
The first day, I'm like, yeah, I'm not working.

42
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,450
But after that, worked from home.

43
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:48,010
My daughter also got COVID.

44
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,370
I'm pretty certain that's who I got it from.

45
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,690
She was showing- Did you kick her out of the house?

46
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,410
No.

47
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,410
No.

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,890
But we both sort of hung out in our own room.

49
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,890
We had just flown back from Florida.

50
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,520
I just came back from a- That's where you got it.

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,680
Pretty certain, actually.

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,200
Yeah.

53
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,890
And my son sat in between us on the whole plane trip.

54
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,330
And he managed to not get it at all.

55
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,370
So what's up with that?

56
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:24,170
I don't know.

57
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,050
I don't know.

58
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,730
It's a weird thing.

59
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,930
Maybe your son's a robot.

60
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,690
Who knows?

61
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,370
Who knows?

62
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,170
He might be.

63
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:29,650
All right.

64
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,370
I don't know if I- I just got back from LA.

65
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,970
Went down there for a couple of days, hung out with the team.

66
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,250
It's weird to have a meeting in a meeting room.

67
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,410
One, it's massively productive.

68
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:45,090
But two, I couldn't figure out how to make the-

69
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,650
I mean, eventually, I did figure it out.

70
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,690
But I was intimidated by the room control

71
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,610
to plug in my laptop or we all joined the meeting together.

72
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,330
That's something I haven't dealt with in many years.

73
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,860
That was a little while ago.

74
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,900
I don't know if I did that.

75
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,700
Anyway, fun stuff.

76
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,740
It's weird.

77
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,260
Good times.

78
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,620
It's weird.

79
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:14,150
There is one in-person meeting that I have on my calendar.

80
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,390
And I regularly attend it.

81
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,150
It's weird pre-COVID versus post-COVID.

82
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,030
It's sort of a status-recording meeting.

83
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,670
The things before COVID, I would avoid the plague.

84
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,910
I regularly attend this one, and I look forward to it

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,080
because it's like novel to do an in-person meeting, even now,

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,960
today.

87
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,640
Yeah.

88
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Yeah.

89
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,400
It's weird.

90
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,360
It's weird.

91
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:44,880
I don't know.

92
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,240
But it was- it's great.

93
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,440
It's such an accelerant to get folks together.

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,120
It was beneficial in so many hundreds of ways.

95
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,280
But it's different and weird.

96
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,160
Long days, too.

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,400
I ended up meeting with the team all day and then dinner at night

98
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,280
with a lot of 14-hour days of sort of on, which is for us INTPs

99
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,580
or us eyes, especially, it's pretty exhausting.

100
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:18,920
I think we've begun to forget the degree to which

101
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,940
in-person collaboration is an accelerant.

102
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,210
Absolutely.

103
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,550
We talk about Async all the time.

104
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:37,330
But I'll tell you, number one, in comparison to you,

105
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,530
particularly the way you told the story at Unity,

106
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,640
my team has not figured out Async even remotely close

107
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,160
to how you described it at UN.

108
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
We were pretty good there.

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
And we were before.

110
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,560
The difference is if you're in 10 time zones,

111
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,640
literally, I mean more actually, but 10

112
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,080
that I'm working with very closely,

113
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,840
you have to figure it out.

114
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,080
And the thing I've been thinking a lot more

115
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,000
about this remote work, and it's not all Async.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,280
You have to figure how to work both synchronously

117
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,000
and asynchronously.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,960
And it's hard with you and I because we're

119
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,520
working remote at a company that isn't fully remote.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,640
Like fully remote companies have because they're not

121
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,760
paying any rent, have all kinds of budget for travel

122
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,440
and getting these teams together.

123
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,280
And of course, Microsoft, everybody

124
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,480
gets a million dollars for travel for their budget.

125
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
So it's a little different.

126
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,600
No.

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
Not the last several years, no.

128
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,480
Yeah, but I'm being facetious.

129
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Even at Microsoft, it's hard to mean for,

130
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,080
I get where Satya's coming from.

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,040
I'm already paying for how many buildings on campus

132
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,880
that are 25% full.

133
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,600
I can't up the travel budget just because people who are remote

134
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
aren't getting together.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,680
And I know a lot of folks at Microsoft are in the area,

136
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
but I know they don't go to the office, they could.

137
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,560
But you've been hiring more remotely as well

138
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,920
because it's a better way to hire good people.

139
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,280
So it's weird and it's good to get people together.

140
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
And I think it's necessary.

141
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
And I think we're still, I mean,

142
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,960
work changed in the last couple of years.

143
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,560
And we haven't quite adapted to the involvement yet.

144
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,060
And we're gonna have to figure that shit out.

145
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,420
I completely agree.

146
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,540
All right.

147
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,620
Okay, let's get into,

148
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,620
dun dun dun, little transition thing past the,

149
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,960
is there are people, do you hear that?

150
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,800
No.

151
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,880
Good, I'm gonna turn off that app.

152
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,820
I have an app, it's giving me some notifications.

153
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,900
If that was in the thing, I'd be all kinds of,

154
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,420
ah, stop it.

155
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,260
Okay, we got a couple ideas for a topic.

156
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,340
Do you wanna start with number one or number two?

157
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:48,970
Uh, there is a third that I just saw.

158
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,530
A what?

159
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,730
Yeah.

160
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,370
Like is like breaking news somewhere?

161
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,180
Oh my God, is it crouch track again?

162
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,940
No, here, I will.

163
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,330
Breaking news on the A.B. testing podcast.

164
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,370
Do I have a breaking news sound effect?

165
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,490
I need more sound effects in my thing.

166
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,620
How many, have you populated them off?

167
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,620
No, I can upload as many as I want.

168
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,140
I just haven't bothered because I didn't know

169
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,070
we're gonna have like things, you have to warn me.

170
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,030
You have to warn me, Brent.

171
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,050
I don't.

172
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,070
Okay, Brent has shared with me.

173
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,910
Oh.

174
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,830
You know what, I forgot about this one.

175
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,430
Do you wanna talk about that one?

176
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,990
We can talk about that one.

177
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,110
This is live, live here on the A.B. testing podcast.

178
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,750
So does that count as a mailbag?

179
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,500
Or is it just a question?

180
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,340
It feels like a mailbag.

181
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,880
I don't know if I need to press the button or not, Brent.

182
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,720
Yeah, go ahead.

183
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
I mean, it's in general, but go ahead.

184
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,680
Let's call the mailbag.

185
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,800
All right, we have a mailbag.

186
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,400
I think just because the amount of joy

187
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
you push in that button brings me,

188
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,160
I think if it's ambiguous, it's a mailbag.

189
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,000
I want to press more buttons.

190
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,160
And it's my fault for not having more.

191
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,400
I should be adding all kinds of quirky little sound effects

192
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,440
because that's what's gonna get us

193
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,840
downloads and clicks.

194
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,760
That's how we get from three to four listeners, right?

195
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,260
So I did read this article a few days ago

196
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,100
and the article someone sent to us

197
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,660
and who sent it to us?

198
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,060
It was not Brent.

199
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,380
Brent, that's not you.

200
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,420
It was sent by, sorry, someone on our,

201
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,740
oh, from our, what do you call it?

202
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,940
Our Slacker group, one of the three.slack.com.

203
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,280
Walmart, is that the full name we have here?

204
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,560
Walmart, that's the name we know now.

205
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,280
Nice looking guy.

206
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Sent us a blog post from Stack Overflow

207
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,280
and would love to hear our opinion.

208
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,320
And the title is called,

209
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,080
Generative AI is Not Going to Build

210
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,880
Your Engineering Team for You.

211
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,000
Subtitle, it's easy to generate code,

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,320
but not so easy to generate good code.

213
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,000
Do we just say correct and move on

214
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,010
or do you want to talk about more?

215
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,410
Yeah, it's interesting.

216
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,610
I want to talk about more.

217
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,540
All right, then we'll continue.

218
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,610
Yeah, there is, like I do hear rumblings.

219
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,490
Like it's interesting.

220
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,130
Like number one, I'm gonna share my intern

221
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,730
that I had this last summer, okay?

222
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,990
He, it was not a CS degree.

223
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,390
He, we hired him, he was a cybersecurity.

224
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,060
He was going for a cybersecurity doctorate.

225
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:55,260
And one day I asked him to,

226
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,540
hey, I need you to do this and do this

227
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,380
and do this analysis, okay?

228
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,800
He did all of that the next day.

229
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,850
But then showed me a working,

230
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,450
highly interactive website

231
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,530
that he had just put together

232
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,530
that also allowed you to drill into the analysis.

233
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,890
And I will tell you, no one on my,

234
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,730
like I run a data science team

235
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,770
that has a lot of development talent,

236
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,490
but no one on my team is skilled at UI.

237
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,690
And he showed me something that was like,

238
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,340
holy crap, I'm like, how did you do that?

239
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,900
And he's like, oh, yeah, I don't know how to build UI either.

240
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,460
I just had chat GPT write it for me.

241
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,500
And I'm like, oh, whoa.

242
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,360
So I had, he's unfortunately gone.

243
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,000
I wanted him to sit down and show me.

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,320
And did his code break the day after he left?

245
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,260
No, no, that thing's still running.

246
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,350
And I'm like, okay.

247
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,710
I'm like, all right,

248
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,390
this thing is capable of doing things

249
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,320
that even I hadn't dreamed up yet.

250
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,800
And I still kind of want it.

251
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,640
I may call him just to check in and see how he's doing.

252
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,000
Like he was a fantastic intern.

253
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,760
All right, so what's interesting for me in this article,

254
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,080
and it brings us back on topic here.

255
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,440
I think you're a little bit on topic,

256
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,200
but I'll put a link to it in the show notes

257
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,840
that if you read those,

258
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,360
did I mention go to the one of the three.slack.com

259
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,800
or to go to moderntest.org to get a link there,

260
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,960
you can sign up.

261
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,840
So the subtitle to me is odd,

262
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,600
it's not the key point of the article.

263
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
They do discuss it.

264
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
And we all know this, anybody who's dealt with co-pilot

265
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,360
or asking chat GPT to code,

266
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,120
yeah, it can do code that solves problems.

267
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,400
It can even fix the errors that it creates

268
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,360
and eventually you can come up with something that works.

269
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,400
Is it good code?

270
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,360
No, you need to look at it

271
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,120
and you need to be able to read code.

272
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,880
Again, going to back to my prediction

273
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,400
from eight months ago in the beginning of the year,

274
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,840
being a good code reader and reviewer

275
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,280
is going to grow as a valuable skill more than writing it

276
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,280
because chat GPT or I'll say Gen AI can get you started.

277
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,560
So there's some talking on that,

278
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,820
but I wanna, I don't know if you read the whole article,

279
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,940
but that is a good point.

280
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,860
And I think it's been discussed quite a bit,

281
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,700
but also the article ends up being a lot about

282
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,820
advocating for hiring junior engineers.

283
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,240
Right.

284
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,560
And like head nod, like whiplash head nod from me.

285
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,440
And I think it's interesting to tie that

286
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,000
into the overall story, but to me that was,

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,080
I'm curious in your takeaway,

288
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,280
so I wanna dive into that, but first,

289
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,680
did you see that too with the,

290
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,760
for you was the article more about writing good code

291
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,280
or more about why hiring junior engineers

292
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,760
is helpful in growing them to some engineers, et cetera.

293
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,200
I think the article was written

294
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,850
to try to put a statement around there

295
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:33,770
that does appear to be something companies are doing.

296
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,100
The, like, okay.

297
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,740
And that is cutting back on their payroll,

298
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,500
not lowering the rate at which we hire

299
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,230
junior engineers because the quote unquote,

300
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,150
Gen AI can automate their jobs.

301
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,990
Right.

302
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,610
And I think they're basically saying no.

303
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,130
And that kind of, so in some regards, like what,

304
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,440
to me, it is, no, we should not stop hiring

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,120
junior engineers.

306
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,800
Well, I mean, nobody advocated for that.

307
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,800
I will tell you a lot of the people making decisions

308
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,270
to cut back on their payroll

309
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:33,430
because of the existence of Gen AI.

310
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:36,150
I think you're taking a massive risk

311
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,990
because they're kind of putting their finger in the air

312
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,390
and going, oh, this is where we're going.

313
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,740
So let's just go there now.

314
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,380
Right. Yeah. Absolutely stupid.

315
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,980
This is equivalent to teams that said,

316
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,380
like when we talk about in modern testing,

317
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,540
like the tourniquet and Band-Aid story,

318
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,140
but the companies that fired all their testers

319
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,380
because they saw some other company didn't have testers.

320
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
They thought that would improve their quality

321
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,340
when there's a few missing pieces in there.

322
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,020
Now, maybe it's similar.

323
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,790
So what, I'm gonna draw a couple lines here together.

324
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,480
Where do you get good senior engineers?

325
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,030
Joel Spolsky wrote an article about this 20 years ago.

326
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,580
Can't you just now order them from amazon.com?

327
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,420
I think.

328
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,100
Because I think actually Amazon is one of the companies

329
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,500
that is cutting back on payroll.

330
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,820
You have to go to the dark web for those,

331
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,100
but Spolsky wrote an article

332
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,900
about where all the good senior engineers,

333
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,820
something like this.

334
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,820
And the point was that if you're a good senior staff engineer,

335
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,340
you have a job that you like and you're well compensated.

336
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,500
And if you decide you want to change jobs,

337
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,900
usually it's because you've been poached

338
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,300
and you have an offer and you're never on the market,

339
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,820
or you're on the market for about a second.

340
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,300
Like even in this economy,

341
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,020
the good engineers, there's gonna be some exceptions,

342
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,930
but generally they're not on the market for a long.

343
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,450
We've been a little lucky, not lucky, unlucky,

344
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,290
depending on your point of view.

345
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,530
There's been a few good months, Rob.

346
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:16,450
But generally, they stay employed and gainfully employed.

347
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,250
The best way to get senior engineers for me

348
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,970
is to hire the junior engineers when they're hungry

349
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,650
and get them to grow.

350
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,210
But more importantly, more importantly,

351
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,770
when I look at diversity,

352
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,010
and not just diversity in race or sex,

353
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,970
but diversity in ideas,

354
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,730
diversity in different ways to solve a problem,

355
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,850
diversity in curiosity about how problems can be solved,

356
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,370
diversity in people thinking about what's possible

357
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,930
given their unique background,

358
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,690
that comes from my junior engineers.

359
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,890
A lot of the senior folks,

360
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,730
they get used to solving problems a certain way

361
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,970
because they've been very good at it,

362
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:01,290
but they end up using their same toolbox a lot.

363
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,410
They're very good at that toolbox.

364
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,010
They deserve to be senior.

365
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,730
But the reason I like to hire a lot of junior folks

366
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,650
is they bring new ideas and new ways of thinking.

367
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,970
And if you replace them all with Gen AI,

368
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,530
how many different ways does Gen AI have

369
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,690
to think about solving problems?

370
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,500
Exactly zero.

371
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,060
Well, it has the LLM that was based on one idea.

372
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,660
I'll give it one.

373
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,060
Right, well, and it's because you said the word think.

374
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,340
Oh, okay, you're correct.

375
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,260
So I think you lose a lot of that.

376
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,300
You lose the creativity in problem solving.

377
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,820
Article also points out that writing code is the easy part.

378
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,220
In software development it is.

379
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,660
The people is really hard.

380
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,300
Also, in thinking how the system works together really hard,

381
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,620
there's all kinds of things that are super difficult

382
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,590
that aren't part of just spitting out

383
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,430
the method or the function.

384
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,310
And that's the most here.

385
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,380
Yeah, I...

386
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,500
I think writing code is easy.

387
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,220
Writing code is easy.

388
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,500
The thing...

389
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,400
The art that's dying if it's not already dead

390
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,560
that I still actively use,

391
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,240
and because I actively use it,

392
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,920
I basically out produce any of my staff.

393
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,360
And now that said, most of my staff,

394
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,080
only a couple of them have ever been in development.

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,310
But that's design patterns.

396
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:42,570
And, you know, the art of refactoring your code

397
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,240
such that there is just one line of code

398
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,440
that does the thing you need it to do

399
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,340
versus sort of copy paste, right?

400
00:19:55,630 --> 00:20:01,490
I don't know that co-pilot can really do the design side of it.

401
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,390
I'm looking at research right now.

402
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,230
I was...

403
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:12,630
I just quickly looked because I...

404
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,150
There's a lot of things out there like researchers saying

405
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,550
and forecasters saying,

406
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,430
oh yeah, it has the potential to reduce,

407
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,990
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

408
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,870
I'm like, great, I don't care about your opinion.

409
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,310
Has anyone done a study?

410
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,430
Like has anyone attempted to quantify it?

411
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,480
And I do find one, which I'm like, hmm.

412
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
So I'll just read this.

413
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,160
A field experiment involved would be nearly 2,000

414
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,500
developers at Microsoft and Accenture.

415
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,320
For those who don't know,

416
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,550
Accenture is one of the largest companies

417
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,390
that will do coding for hire.

418
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,830
Coding mercenaries.

419
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,670
Yeah, sure.

420
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:59,470
Show the developers using co-pilot

421
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:04,470
completed 13 to 22% more poll requests per week

422
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:12,360
at Microsoft and seven and a half to eight

423
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,080
and a half percent at Accenture.

424
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,480
Now, how do we feel about that frigging vanity metric?

425
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,520
I don't think it tells us anything by itself.

426
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,710
No, more doesn't mean better, right?

427
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,720
But it's really hard to measure.

428
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,000
Well, productivity is essentially the rate at which

429
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,960
you get more widgets out the door.

430
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,160
So in some regards, okay, maybe poll requests

431
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,000
is the closest thing to productivity.

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,060
I know for me, in some regards, it has sped me up.

433
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,760
But in other regards, it has encouraged intellectual laziness.

434
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,060
I have used that term extensively this week.

435
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,840
So that's odd that you bring it up.

436
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,980
Yeah, intellectual laziness, big bang for me.

437
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,060
Oh, it absolutely is for me as well,

438
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,500
there's like simple things like I'm in Python

439
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,340
all of the time.

440
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,260
I use the pandas data frame all of the time.

441
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,100
And now I have noticed just this week

442
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:33,240
because I come back from vacation on coding again.

443
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,600
And I'm like, oh, I got to convert this data frame

444
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,800
to a dictionary.

445
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:42,400
By now I should have this memorized, but I don't.

446
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,880
So I went to get a pilot and wrote a comment,

447
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,390
convert this to a dictionary.

448
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,450
And I realized, oh, I am never going to memorize it again

449
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,290
because it gets that one right.

450
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,450
And I have memorized that I don't have to memorize this.

451
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,930
You know, how do I feel about this?

452
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,330
A story I've told for, actually I think it's good

453
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,450
and I'm a parallel hero story I've told

454
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,390
for over 20 years now.

455
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,610
As I began to like people ask me like,

456
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,650
Alan, you're a composer, I just learned to write code.

457
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:15,970
And I said, writing code's fricking easy.

458
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,690
But there's a lot of parallels.

459
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,450
There's some creativity.

460
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,930
Creativity is the design pattern.

461
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,890
It's how am I going to solve this problem?

462
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,690
Because that's what chat GPT can't figure out.

463
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,570
There's something here or co-pilot, JED AI.

464
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,050
They're all interchangeably sometimes.

465
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,370
Okay, so there's some creativity involved.

466
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,410
How do I got to figure it?

467
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,410
Same with melody, what voice I want,

468
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,610
what dynamics are on what's this kind of the story

469
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,450
I want to tell.

470
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,650
There's a creativity part.

471
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,570
There's an infinite number of ways to do that.

472
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,530
And then once you get that figured out,

473
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:50,290
there's a whole bunch of rote work.

474
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,650
There's voicings and chords and progressions

475
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,490
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

476
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:59,490
It's really rote work based on math and formulas.

477
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:01,650
Sounds a lot like programming.

478
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,970
So as a composer, why, I mean,

479
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,240
I'm sure these things already exist

480
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,160
and in the composition tools, as they say,

481
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,960
if I figure out like the base I want to do,

482
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,520
I sketch in some chords,

483
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,520
I give it a few instructions on voicings and depth

484
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,160
and timbres I want and kabing, all my rote work is done.

485
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,600
It's the same as having you add that to addiction,

486
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,600
convert that to a dictionary.

487
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,720
It's the same damn thing.

488
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,960
And I think it's okay.

489
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,960
And actually I'm looking at another study right now,

490
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,400
which is right along with what you're saying.

491
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,920
Quote, so this is another one of the things

492
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,790
so this is another study done by McKenzie

493
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,870
and it seems much better.

494
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,750
Good, finish it up.

495
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,230
Cause I'm kind of getting excited about something.

496
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,070
So take it there.

497
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,230
Quote, developers using generative AI best tools

498
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,990
were more than twice as likely to report

499
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,830
overall happiness fulfillment in a state of flow.

500
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,670
Yes.

501
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,910
They attributed this to the tools ability

502
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,150
to automate grunt work that kept them

503
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:12,310
from more satisfying tasks.

504
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,270
And it puts information at their fingertips

505
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,710
faster than a search for a solution across online platforms.

506
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,550
Right.

507
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,820
And that for me in those two sentences, that's 100% true.

508
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,660
Yeah.

509
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:26,500
So let me tie this back.

510
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,340
So before Dan Pink wrote drive,

511
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,060
he wrote this book called a whole new mind,

512
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,540
which is how right brainers, creative people,

513
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,540
we're gonna take over knowledge work.

514
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,780
And yeah, creative work is so much more,

515
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,300
for me at least, a right brainer,

516
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,020
it's so much more enjoyable for me.

517
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,860
It gives me energy when I can create things.

518
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,700
And then I'm distracted when I have to do it.

519
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,340
Like I almost go to a different part of my brain

520
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,020
and shift when I go to do the rote work.

521
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,260
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

522
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,220
And if I can basically automate the part

523
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,900
I subconsciously don't wanna do

524
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,660
and spend more time doing the fun part

525
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,980
that's a little harder, that stretches my brain

526
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,460
and makes me kind of think.

527
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,140
God, I'm fricking happy.

528
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,380
And you know, if I'm happy doing my job,

529
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,780
if I love my job, do I create great work

530
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,740
or do I create shitty work?

531
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,700
I create great work.

532
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,540
Yeah.

533
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,380
It's proven.

534
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,860
There's studies on this.

535
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,140
If I'm happy and engaged in my job, I do great work.

536
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,220
Happy people are productive people.

537
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,060
Right.

538
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,660
And I remember years ago,

539
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,780
I had a had an argument with my executive

540
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,660
because he had it backwards.

541
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,540
Why does so many dumb people get to be executive?

542
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,820
Because they get shit done.

543
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,660
I mean, he was like-

544
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,860
It should be how you get it done.

545
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,300
It should be how you get it done.

546
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,140
I agree.

547
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,700
It should be what kind of person you are.

548
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,060
And I go back to Maxwell's levels of leadership.

549
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,130
You are a leader because people want to follow you.

550
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,090
Yeah, et cetera.

551
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,850
I'm just kind of mad.

552
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:04,690
I'm gonna rewind.

553
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,530
Go ahead and talk.

554
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,410
He is, let's see, is he still there?

555
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,450
He's still at Microsoft.

556
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,890
When are you gonna, like,

557
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,410
things are changing there.

558
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,050
Things are getting better.

559
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,010
Can you get rid of the cruft?

560
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:19,610
He's no longer an executive.

561
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,980
He's only a partner.

562
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,240
Well, keep on-

563
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,680
I mean, that's still-

564
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,350
Still arresting, investing.

565
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,150
They didn't take his stock away.

566
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,650
Still there.

567
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,920
Yeah, but he's not making executive money.

568
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,560
So this is actually really interesting.

569
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,720
Now, based on what I just said though,

570
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,120
and I would do this as a composer also,

571
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm gonna imagine I have co-pilot for composing.

572
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,760
And this thing may exist.

573
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,920
I haven't played with these tools in a long time.

574
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,800
But I've written my melody kind of thing,

575
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,280
and I've used the AI, the Gen AI

576
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
to help me do some of the rote work.

577
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,800
I still need to review it.

578
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,960
I still, like, I can't just go,

579
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,880
oh, I'm gonna bring this down to the studio

580
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,400
and have the orchestra play it.

581
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,640
No, I'll get, there's, I gotta listen to it

582
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,080
and tweak it and do some hand massaging

583
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,120
to make sure it's what I want,

584
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,040
that it fulfills my creative intent.

585
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,420
And you have to do the same thing with code.

586
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,260
Yes.

587
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:26,420
So, it's, yeah, that, again, yes,

588
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,980
because I'm getting back to the article here

589
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,660
that says that it generates code but not good code.

590
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,380
And what I'm saying is we do the creative part,

591
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,140
it does the hard part, then we have to go,

592
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,600
again, I think that's creative

593
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,580
to take what's been generated for us

594
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,940
and to turn it into something we like.

595
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,820
Now, and here's the thing,

596
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,620
like when it's circled back to the idea of,

597
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,180
we still need junior developers, right?

598
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,840
Even with the stats, like,

599
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,360
if we take the stats that I see, all right,

600
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,680
and from the two studies, I'll say,

601
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,340
okay, it does seem to be a, let's say,

602
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,300
a minimum of a 10% productivity boost.

603
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:15,340
Okay, well, I know for a fact that students

604
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,480
at many colleges right now

605
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,260
are learning coding alongside chat CPT.

606
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,540
The coding programs are including-

607
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,940
And that's wonderful, I think they should.

608
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,060
Yeah, they absolutely should.

609
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,340
Like the next set of junior people,

610
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,180
now, hopefully, they don't just learn how to gen AI code,

611
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,790
they are learning, again, human and machine

612
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,030
working together towards a common goal

613
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,710
and not encouraging intellectual laziness

614
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,630
in the way that we both would disapprove of.

615
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:51,990
But, go ahead, Fish.

616
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,590
But, so if that 10% is real, right?

617
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,590
Yeah, maybe you don't need the 10 heads

618
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,550
you wanted to hire, you only need nine.

619
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,760
But you still need that nine

620
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,320
and this is under the assumption

621
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,160
that these guys are skilled at using this

622
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,680
as a tool to get their stuff done.

623
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,840
And this is what I think we can teach.

624
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,160
And going back to, I love universities have this,

625
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,440
I wanna steal their curriculum

626
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,420
and give it to the engineers we have today.

627
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,120
Because what's missing today

628
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,600
in how people are using CoPilot

629
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,840
and we give people CoPilot to use

630
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,520
is they, we need like an exercise,

631
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,840
like a couple exercises,

632
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,400
a set of exercises they go through

633
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,620
where they have to find practice,

634
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,460
finding the shortcomings of what it delivers

635
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,740
and how to iterate on that

636
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,060
and turn it into something that's efficient and effective.

637
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,180
I think, like I have,

638
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,700
well, the stats are published overall,

639
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,420
they're similar to what I've looked at at our company.

640
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,780
There's a percentage of,

641
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,300
of suggestions that are accepted

642
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,940
that's pretty consistent industry-wide.

643
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,720
But there's a lot to learn there.

644
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,440
But I just,

645
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,540
I think even the engineers employed today

646
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,420
need to do that.

647
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,060
I do love that college students are using,

648
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,860
there are like professors are acknowledging,

649
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,500
and I hope they're doing this in other courses as well,

650
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:22,060
is using Gen AI as a tool.

651
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,540
It's not a cheating tool.

652
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:27,660
It should be an accelerant for work, for creative work.

653
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,580
So I don't know, I'm kind of excited.

654
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
I'm curious to see what it does

655
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,860
to the industry down the road,

656
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,860
but all these stupid stories about people thinking Gen AI

657
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,700
is going to flat out replace a bunch of engineers is dumb.

658
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,340
It's gonna make some engineers more effective

659
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,900
so you need a few fewer.

660
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,740
And as we've said before, for over a year now,

661
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,340
Gen AI is not going to take away jobs.

662
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,120
No, Gen AI won't.

663
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,440
It's people who don't,

664
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,430
well, people who understand how to leverage Gen AI may.

665
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:03,390
Because yeah, a team of nine people

666
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,270
that know how to use Gen AI effectively

667
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,750
could probably effectively do the work

668
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:09,640
that 10 people could do two years ago.

669
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,120
Or today.

670
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,960
Sure.

671
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,240
I was going back before chat GPT came out,

672
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,080
but yeah, whatever.

673
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,920
Oh, fair.

674
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,780
Yeah, and it's interesting,

675
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,280
like I had a conversation on this exact scenario

676
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,040
just today with a brand new mentee.

677
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,330
And it was interesting,

678
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:36,330
his approach to using Azure Co-Pilot was different than mine.

679
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,090
And I'm like, oh, that's fascinating.

680
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,210
Tell me more about it.

681
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:48,460
He, like for me, I will do the whole comment thing.

682
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,180
I assume you know what I'm talking about,

683
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,540
where you type in a comment and then it writes out the code.

684
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,860
He likes using the side panel

685
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,500
and he'll instead ask it questions.

686
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,340
Okay, good.

687
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,300
One of the things that is one of my new favorite things

688
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:13,420
with Co-Pilot is if I had the exception in my code, right?

689
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,580
I can just say, oh,

690
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,540
depending on what I want it to do, right?

691
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,660
I'm a big believer and you don't use exceptions

692
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,740
for flow control.

693
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,740
So I go, oh yeah, that's missing an assert.

694
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,300
You know, please add that assert

695
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,940
and throw if that's missing.

696
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,900
Or if it is an exception,

697
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,940
like some of the calls will time out and I'm like, okay,

698
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,460
yeah, there's no way I can proactively guess

699
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,540
how long it's gonna take.

700
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,500
So let me put exception handling around that.

701
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,740
I hate writing exception handling code.

702
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,580
I hate it.

703
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,860
It's boring AF.

704
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,500
And the fact that this thing can do it

705
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,940
is fantastic.

706
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Now, it never, when I do exception handling,

707
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,580
I like to use the concrete class

708
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,940
and I have not gotten the GitHub pilot, Co-Pilot

709
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:21,480
to put in the correct concrete class yet.

710
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,480
But you know what?

711
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,880
It taps things out.

712
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,160
It gets the exception structure right.

713
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,000
And sure, I spend three more seconds

714
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,940
to get the right class under.

715
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,880
So yeah, I do like that aspect of it.

716
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Just like that last article I mentioned,

717
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,880
is it gonna take it away not anytime soon?

718
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,320
Gen AI won't do that.

719
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,240
When or if the AGI comes into play,

720
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,440
and I don't know if we've talking about this.

721
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,120
Open AI is on record thinking that an AGI

722
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,680
will exist within 10 years.

723
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,760
Yeah, we did talk about this briefly.

724
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,700
It's, yeah, this I think is probably the lead in

725
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:15,660
maybe to the, we're all gonna die episode of A-B testing.

726
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,780
We're talking about AI.

727
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,500
Can't remember, but we did mention this.

728
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:24,840
Yeah, the, so winding back to...

729
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,640
Yeah, I mean, I think we,

730
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,200
anything else in the article you wanna hit like any,

731
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,440
he asked for any comments and there they are.

732
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,780
It's the article has a lot of good points.

733
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,260
It's a head-naught or hire junior engineers,

734
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,020
grow them into senior engineers,

735
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:43,540
create a good, like here's the deal.

736
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,460
I guess the thing is, it's easy.

737
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,340
Like, I guess my comment around,

738
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,780
it's easy to generate code,

739
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,180
but not so easy to generate good code.

740
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,820
I kind of think that that's kind of a bullshit subtext.

741
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,660
I, yeah.

742
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,660
Right, it's no.

743
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,140
That's hard without Gen AI.

744
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,640
And that statement is true without Gen AI.

745
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,480
Right.

746
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,880
And it also operates under the assumption

747
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,580
that that's really what you're trying to do.

748
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,260
Now, the pointy-haired managers at certain companies,

749
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,820
you know what, they might be, right?

750
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,140
Again, I have seen, I've seen evidence of companies

751
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,460
even at Amazon.

752
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,100
I try to remember where I saw this.

753
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,100
It was a news report where, oh no,

754
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,100
the CEO came out basically at some thing saying,

755
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,940
hey, the Gen AI is coming to take your jobs away.

756
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:44,500
And oddly, he meant it as sort of an inspirational message.

757
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,340
Oh, Lord.

758
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,700
Or he obviously didn't frame it right,

759
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,020
so he freaked out his entire dev staff.

760
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,410
But it does make the stupid stuff go away.

761
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,730
Whether or not, maybe that could be a fun exercise

762
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:02,570
to do one day.

763
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,760
Maybe you and I, we could do a series of and go,

764
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,310
all right, I've seen Planet Money do a series

765
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,870
of using Gen AI to create a whole episode.

766
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,970
Maybe it'll be interesting.

767
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,790
You and I.

768
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,270
We could have it, I mean, I could have it

769
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,510
create a script for us that we just read.

770
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:31,950
No, well, and with their voice stuff, we could go beyond that.

771
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:35,350
No, no, I was saying it might be a fun experiment

772
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:40,760
to say, all right, let's dream up a service

773
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,280
and let's see how far we can get Gen AI to design it.

774
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:51,630
No, it might be good for, like if we're gonna,

775
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,270
we need to do that one as a cast

776
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,750
and put it on YouTube or something,

777
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,690
because people need to see some screens along with that.

778
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,170
I'm wondering how long is it until one of us

779
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,130
can do the podcast without the other one?

780
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,420
Oh, I think.

781
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,260
Like, cause it's there.

782
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,100
So you kind of tried to do that and you're like,

783
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,300
oh no, without Brent, they call bullshit on me.

784
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,420
This is boring.

785
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,060
Well, again, but if I, look, if I need someone

786
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:23,700
to be confidently incorrect, I can use you or chat GPT.

787
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,550
Sure, sure.

788
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,590
I mean, I guess you just, you spend another couple hours

789
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,710
this weekend and come up with the right prompts.

790
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,430
No, I'm not gonna do that.

791
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,750
Okay, point is, read the article.

792
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,030
There are our thoughts.

793
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:44,470
We think that Gen AI isn't taking away jobs.

794
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,010
You should hire junior engineers.

795
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,550
You should have a diverse culture that you should,

796
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,510
like focus on, I was gonna say earlier

797
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:54,430
before you interrupted, like you gotta build good teams

798
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,990
and good teams will make good software

799
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,030
and they'll make it efficiently.

800
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,790
You don't have enough people on the team

801
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,510
to get done what you need to get done

802
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,170
and they're gonna figure out,

803
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,990
like I'm full of tautologies here,

804
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,590
but if you build a good team and you focus

805
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:10,640
on their engagement and joy of their job,

806
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,000
they're going to produce great software quickly

807
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,280
and yet everybody wins.

808
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,920
Woo hoo.

809
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,480
There is one last thing I'll say on this.

810
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,320
Okay, fine.

811
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,160
One last thing.

812
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,480
And we'll see.

813
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,330
Does it have to do with unicorns?

814
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:26,130
No, cannibals.

815
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:26,890
No, cannibals?

816
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,810
Cannibals.

817
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:28,930
Cannibals, gross.

818
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,870
The section header is we need to stop cannibalizing

819
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:34,290
our own future.

820
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,210
Ooh, that sounds harsh.

821
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,050
And the very last paragraph.

822
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,970
All of this speaks a deep misunderstanding

823
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,410
about what engineers actually do.

824
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,550
By not hiring and training up junior engineers,

825
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,250
we are cannibalizing our own future.

826
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:51,250
We need to stop doing that.

827
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,750
Now, before you comment,

828
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:59,510
I will tell you this reeks of several of the messages

829
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:04,570
I heard when test was imploding.

830
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,670
People proactively holding on to the old world

831
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,590
with white knuckles.

832
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,830
I don't know if that's their intent.

833
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,810
I'm going to choose to sort of be balanced,

834
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:18,110
but I think this whole article,

835
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:21,390
at least in terms of my own view of thinking

836
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:25,190
about the future and balancing human with the machine,

837
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,770
this article would have been much better

838
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:29,140
without this whole section.

839
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:33,620
Because I'm just like, oh, it reeks of that protectionist.

840
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,300
The way we've always done it,

841
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,350
it's the way we should do it that I don't like.

842
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:42,870
Yeah, I get it.

843
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:43,710
I get it.

844
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:45,910
To me, I take it a little bit differently.

845
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,670
I want to get into a couple of code of things here

846
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,190
before we end it for the day.

847
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,270
But really, it's reading my LinkedIn DMs.

848
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,270
I thought would be a fun segment

849
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,610
that I forgot I wanted to do.

850
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,430
But I think what he's saying is

851
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:59,830
if we only focus on hiring seniors,

852
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,390
eventually we aren't going to have anybody

853
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,710
to grow into senior positions.

854
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,270
And that's how we cannibalize ourselves.

855
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,300
We have to hire the people that grow into those positions.

856
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,060
So I don't have a sound effect for this,

857
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:16,780
but I don't know what your LinkedIn DMs are.

858
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,780
I reply to if I know you, I reply.

859
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,260
So I don't want people who know me,

860
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,420
who send me DMs to feel like they can't send me DMs.

861
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,380
Of course I'll reply to them.

862
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,420
But I get DMs all over the place

863
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,220
from people who have glanced,

864
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,020
well, they haven't even looked at my profile.

865
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,900
What they've done is had an algorithm,

866
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:40,120
I don't call it AI,

867
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,180
something has scoured my profile

868
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,280
and found deep in the dark roots of my past,

869
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,890
the word test or the word estet.

870
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,770
And then I get messages like this.

871
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:55,150
And tell me what your answer would be.

872
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,230
I'm not going to reply.

873
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,490
Alan, I'm building a...

874
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:02,370
Fuck no, I'm thinking what my answer is.

875
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,770
Let me finish.

876
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:06,050
Alan, I want to give you $10 million.

877
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,230
No, I didn't say that.

878
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,250
Alan, I'm building a company

879
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:11,970
to help my customers achieve test automation

880
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,210
using their manual testers six times faster than Estet.

881
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,280
I'm seeking blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

882
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,920
Is he coming to you for venture capital?

883
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,560
No, he wants insights,

884
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,520
but I don't want to talk about testing.

885
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,680
At least he's not trying to sell it to me.

886
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,920
But I don't want to talk about,

887
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:36,350
like I'm tired of it because nobody gets it.

888
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,550
I don't want to teach my manual testers to write code,

889
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,950
to write code, test code.

890
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,030
I want my developers to write test code.

891
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,470
Yes, that's exactly where I was going.

892
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,550
I refuse to be part of that system.

893
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,830
I'm like, it's not the answer.

894
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,670
A bunch of testers writing Selenium all day

895
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,710
is not the answer.

896
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,390
Teaching my manual testers air quote to write automation.

897
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,150
I don't care how many, look,

898
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,670
I'm sure your company is great.

899
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,550
And I'm sure you have a market for people you can use,

900
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,750
but it's not for me.

901
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,590
It's not for me.

902
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:10,590
Teach your manual testers to write test automation

903
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:15,910
and dev code better than your Estets.

904
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,750
And all right, I'm in.

905
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,710
Let's talk about that.

906
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:22,270
And again, you get the mountain I'm on.

907
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,790
We have studies showing,

908
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,670
studies not just my anecdotes, which are absolutely valid.

909
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:31,310
We have studies showing that tests owned by developers

910
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:35,670
have a higher correlation with quality than other tests.

911
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,830
Yet we pay these test teams to write automation,

912
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:44,570
like an unhealthy amount of UI automation

913
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:45,770
for the development team.

914
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,330
And I just,

915
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,000
the inability of people to learn and adapt to,

916
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,270
and grow, like, I don't know, like Dan Pink was right.

917
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:06,660
The future is right brain, creative people.

918
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,660
If you are a fixed mindset and you don't want to learn,

919
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,980
and you don't want to do new things,

920
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,270
and you don't want to be creative in your job,

921
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,550
you're useless.

922
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,280
In software, in software,

923
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,120
you are, you have plenty of other jobs you could do.

924
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,040
Go work in a button factory.

925
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:37,990
Uh, go work at anything that's assembly line work.

926
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,910
Yeah.

927
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,750
Right?

928
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,270
Button factory, door knob factory.

929
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,320
Yeah, I don't.

930
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,840
I just, I'm blown away.

931
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:51,720
I was talking to, I was talking to a former employee of mine

932
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,440
who I moved to enroll in another team.

933
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,280
And well, it didn't go well.

934
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,200
Today was their last day.

935
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:05,200
And I was talking to them and they said,

936
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,000
they're just blown away the fact that

937
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,140
there are people in the software industry who like,

938
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:16,420
like there is so many new things to learn.

939
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,660
Like, Brent, you and I have been in this,

940
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:22,100
like, like a combined 150 years.

941
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,820
And every day, every week we find new things to learn,

942
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,460
and we're excited about those things.

943
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,340
And it's that learning and new things that keep us motivated.

944
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,700
And there are people that I just,

945
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,800
I just don't get why there are people who don't want to learn.

946
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,040
So anyway, backing up to this thing.

947
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,160
Uh, I know, I, sure.

948
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,000
I believe in you.

949
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,440
I just want to be no part of having testers learn,

950
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,660
like having manual, like I,

951
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:52,420
tell me how you're going to help developers

952
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,540
write better tests.

953
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,340
Tell me how you're going to accelerate software development.

954
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,660
Tell me how you are going to speed up the feedback loop.

955
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:03,080
And I will talk to you any day of the week, any time.

956
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,920
Right. And, and to me, okay.

957
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,840
So you can make manual testers faster than Estes, right?

958
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,280
For me, it's okay.

959
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,680
How can you use that same tech to turn the Estes

960
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,280
into better developers?

961
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,410
Like, um, it is still something that I have,

962
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,870
I've mentioned on the podcast a billion times.

963
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,550
When you take someone who's in suit,

964
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,550
who is competent at testing and move them into a dev role,

965
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,130
they become the developer.

966
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,340
They're the modern developer.

967
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,180
Yeah.

968
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:47,820
It's, um, they are just simply, uh,

969
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:52,000
better in all ways that I can think of measuring.

970
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,020
Uh, and if there's a strategy along those lines,

971
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,940
great, I'm a board, right?

972
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:03,100
In terms of like the one line pitch that you just talked

973
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,540
about, yeah, it's fine.

974
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:09,060
They, they meant, they meant well, but their demographics

975
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,980
is just screwed up.

976
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:12,340
They absolutely targeted the wrong person.

977
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,060
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

978
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:18,300
All right. Well, that is AB testing for today.

979
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,180
I remain right. Blaine Allen.

980
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,620
And I'm.
