1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
That doesn't translate into quality software, which is what I care about far more.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,440
Who cares if a crummy product that nobody uses is well tested.

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,300
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:22,980
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,260
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,780
Now on with the show.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,970
Welcome, everybody.

8
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,010
This is Alan.

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,530
And once again, I am pissed off at Zencaster.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:43,090
But Zencaster Alan is the easiest way to record your VoIP podcast interviews in studio quality.

11
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,130
I got to tell you when it works, it is awesome.

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,210
And honestly, I would pay money for it if you guaranteed me it would work.

13
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:55,090
But I have none such confidence.

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:56,940
Here's what happened.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,220
Let me recap y'all.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,620
And then the Zencaster algorithm is going to sneak in,

17
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,020
hear my voice and blow the whole thing up.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,140
But Brent was late.

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,420
What's new?

20
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,170
And then I started I just as I was starting to record without him and it was good.

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,250
I had a speech going and it was awesome.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,930
Brent showed up and then Brent was coming out the wrong speaker because

23
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,690
Zencaster can't read it settings from a hole in the wall.

24
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,730
That's a horrible metaphor.

25
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,850
But you know what I mean?

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:29,970
What I have to do is I have to change the speaker from the one that's correct to something else,

27
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,210
then back to the one that's correct, and then it works fine.

28
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,810
And then I pressed record and then Zencaster restarted for both of us.

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,850
And it went back to the broken way, had to do it again.

30
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,050
Now here we are.

31
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,170
Welcome to the ZenB Caster or something.

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,690
Anyway, when it's good, it's great.

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,730
So when it's annoying, it's really, really annoying.

34
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,410
And I'm happy to have someone from Zencaster on the podcast to talk us through it.

35
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,410
And honestly, we're getting value from it.

36
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,490
So maybe it's all right.

37
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,210
How you doing, Brent?

38
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm doing all right.

39
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,810
I'm currently looking up to see how we can get someone on the podcast.

40
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:19,250
Oh, how Berlin like they publish their looks like they publish their Twitter handles for.

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:19,490
Good.

42
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,050
We'll ask them.

43
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,690
We'll ask them to come on and they can just come because, you know, we have had to be clear.

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,490
Zencaster has worked perfectly for us a few times.

45
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,090
And meanwhile, over in the left pane, I see one recording of 31 seconds and one recording of

46
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,370
zero, zero seconds.

47
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,730
Neither of the ones which will be published, but we appear to be recording now.

48
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,530
So, okay, enough with Zencaster.

49
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,090
We just talked last week and we talked a lot about AI.

50
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,450
I talked about a lot of the reasons why I left my old job.

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,210
And maybe this time we'll get to talking about what's next.

52
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,770
But first, can we talk about how freaking stupid I am?

53
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
Like we've beaten that horse to death.

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,520
No, we talk about how stupid you are, Brent.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,600
Oh, oh, I misinterpreted.

56
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,000
So every year, every year, you don't know what this is and stop typing while I'm talking.

57
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,620
Like, actually, it's better for you to type when I'm talking than when you're talking.

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,260
Because if you're I want, I can edit one.

59
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,220
I just poke myself in the eyes around every year.

60
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,020
Every year, I have a reminder on my calendar in March to sign up for the lottery.

61
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,820
Brent is banging on a fucking can on his side.

62
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,950
Let me finish that thought before people think I'm all about buying lottery tickets.

63
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:41,070
Every year, I sign up for the lottery to get early access to the Wonderland Trail.

64
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,150
Ninety nine point nine percent of our three listeners, including Brent,

65
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,910
do not know what the Wonderland Trail is.

66
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:50,990
The Wonderland Trail is this trail that goes all the way around Mount Rainier.

67
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:55,250
It is freaking amazing and beautiful and awesome.

68
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,250
And every year I want to go do it.

69
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,050
And every year I do not get selected for the lottery.

70
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,930
And if you don't get the lottery, you can try and figure out campsites,

71
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,330
but it's painful and just it's it's really difficult to make work.

72
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,290
So this year, for the first time ever, I got accepted into the Wonderland lottery.

73
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,460
And Brent's applauding.

74
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,340
And Tuesday morning was the day that I could begin to go get reservations

75
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,180
because we open up for just a lottery winners.

76
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,300
And I completely forgot.

77
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,580
So I remember today as I was one of the things I did on Fridays is clean out my email.

78
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,300
I was going through and I saw that and my stomach dropped to the ground.

79
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,780
And I just I went ahead and went in the.

80
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,620
Was it Tuesday and Tuesday only or are you competing?

81
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,900
Up Tuesday.

82
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,460
So what happened is everybody else had lottery access,

83
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,260
which is not a small number and there's a limited number of campsites.

84
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,820
There are specific places you can camp on the Wonderland Trail because of the bear issues.

85
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,500
And they have bear precautions for food at those camps

86
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,700
and also just trying to limit the people so it stays awesome and beautiful.

87
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,140
And so open Tuesday.

88
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,700
So Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, most of the day Friday here,

89
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,460
people have been filling out their itineraries.

90
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,780
And I go and of course, the days I wanted to go, there's no campsites available.

91
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,260
And luckily I was able to do some.

92
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,380
And here's the deal you're trying to it's 95 miles.

93
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,140
So you're trying to figure out and lots of ups and downs trying to figure out a

94
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,660
sustainable pace to get around this thing.

95
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,900
And I had an itinerary all worked out.

96
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,900
It was so it was nice.

97
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,780
It was like nine to 12 miles a day, which is a lot when you're going up and down steeply.

98
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,780
Anyway, it was it was perfect.

99
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,500
It was perfect.

100
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,060
It was perfect.

101
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,820
None of those campsites are available.

102
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,700
So I am doing some weird like 16 mile days and a week later that I wanted to go.

103
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,660
But it should be all right.

104
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,140
And I'm a little bummed about it.

105
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,660
Just happened like a half hour ago.

106
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,780
It's like, oh, no.

107
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,260
So that was that's me being stupid.

108
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,860
But then I was smart today, too.

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,020
But we can talk about that in a minute.

110
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,700
Any comments you want to go on the one I only booked one seat.

111
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,940
So you have you have.

112
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,900
Oh, so you're just going to go off by yourself?

113
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,060
Yeah.

114
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,500
Okay.

115
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,780
So this one, is this the big like bucket list trip you've been talking about?

116
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,900
No, no, the bucket.

117
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,660
The bucket some day is the Pacific Crest Trail.

118
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,700
That'll take about four months.

119
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,750
Ah, okay.

120
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,150
Okay.

121
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,790
This is 93 miles 16.

122
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,510
So what is that?

123
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,990
Two weeks?

124
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,190
Nine days.

125
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,500
PCT is interesting.

126
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,060
And I've always wanted to do it.

127
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,540
But ever since that dumb movie came out about it around eight years ago,

128
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,980
it's gotten super popular.

129
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,410
And as you know, and as our listeners know, all three of you, I do not like people.

130
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,660
Thus why he's going camping for nine days by himself.

131
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,700
Yeah, that's okay.

132
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,460
That one's pretty limited.

133
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,420
Most of the campsites only hold like five to 10 people.

134
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,260
So it stays once you spread out.

135
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,700
It's pretty you don't see people much on the Wonderland is what I'm led to believe.

136
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,390
PCT is also a permit system.

137
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,700
Pacific Crest Trail, but there's so many people on it.

138
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,580
And what happens there is a whole bunch of people get excited.

139
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,540
They watch the movie.

140
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,700
They think, Oh, I'm going to go do this thing.

141
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,500
And they somehow managed to get one of there's 50 spots a day going from Mexico.

142
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,150
And I would guess half of them don't make it the first 300 miles.

143
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,600
But for those first 300 miles, there's a shit ton of people around.

144
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,990
So one thing.

145
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,790
If you can make it to 300, you're good.

146
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:42,830
Then it spreads out.

147
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,230
Yeah.

148
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:49,260
And unfortunately, because I move kind of fast, I would, if I did it from Mexico,

149
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:49,900
I would shoot.

150
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,860
We're way off in the weeds here, but I'm happy to share this one.

151
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,700
I got to find the time and I can get four months off.

152
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,580
That's a whole other story.

153
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:02,240
But if I would start late and be passing people, so I'd see more people until,

154
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,920
you know, Northern California or so, and they're all eventually gone.

155
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,280
I've been thinking really hard.

156
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,660
You know, the vast majority of people do it from Mexico to Canada.

157
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,370
I've been thinking about going the other way just to avoid seeing starting at Canada and

158
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,010
going to Mexico just to avoid seeing as many people.

159
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,050
There's advantages and disadvantages.

160
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,890
The disadvantage is you're starting off with some huge up and downs in Washington going South.

161
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,300
Right.

162
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,820
But once you get over that, it's all downhill from here.

163
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,140
Yes.

164
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,380
Yeah.

165
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,540
Yeah.

166
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,180
Yeah.

167
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:46,270
But the thing is, though, then you end your hike dealing with the zombie horde.

168
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,780
No, because you're starting much later.

169
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:56,060
So if you start from the you're trying to dodge the PCT these days between getting the snow,

170
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,150
the hell out of your way before the the forest fires come.

171
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,690
So if you're starting from the South and you usually start like an April.

172
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,410
Some may some March, but April ish.

173
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,060
But if you're starting if you're starting from Washington, get away from the snow to melt.

174
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,060
You don't even leave till July, mid July.

175
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,720
So if you go south and you're going from July to November and you're ending up in the desert

176
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,720
in November, which is cold at night, but doable.

177
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,460
And if you're starting south, then you start in April and end up in August.

178
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,530
Anyway, something for me to figure out.

179
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,170
I don't know.

180
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,970
This is just something to get away from people and get some exercise.

181
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:39,250
Take some good pictures.

182
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,690
Try not to eat and buy a bear.

183
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,490
It's fun for me.

184
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,330
So, yeah, but I totally blew the reservation system.

185
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,620
I feel really dumb, but I did something else today that was something I don't normally do,

186
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,060
but it's actually maybe even a topic for the podcast.

187
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,740
So let's pause on that.

188
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,580
Anything you want to touch on from your life, from your your dreams and fantasies,

189
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,940
your no, but never mind.

190
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,500
No, I had a I had a weird dream last night.

191
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:17,630
I fell asleep watching watching Tournament of Champions, which is a it's a upleveled

192
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,350
chef competition show.

193
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,990
Love chef competition shows.

194
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,510
Yeah, it's basically they have like the winners of Iron Chef competing against the winners of

195
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,590
Top Chef.

196
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:30,830
Right.

197
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,310
Like it's super high bar.

198
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,910
And I fell asleep watching it and I had this weird dream where suddenly Guy Fieri

199
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,270
was cheering me on and I was one of the chefs.

200
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,790
And it's rare for me to remember my dreams lately.

201
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:52,050
But this one, I'm like, you know, it reminded me, I used to always say that

202
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,420
whenever I retired from Microsoft, I would go to culinary school.

203
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,500
You know, I always thought about being a smelly or a chef as well.

204
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,420
I can see you being a sommelier.

205
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:15,980
My son, like just to give you a sense, my son, my interest and desire to around around cooking

206
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,540
is so strong.

207
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,500
He was seriously considering going into that as a career because his his bar was essentially,

208
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,460
let me just do the things that dad seems to be interested in.

209
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,020
Quite honestly, he hadn't come up with his own goal himself.

210
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:42,640
He's now almost graduated and I was positive to say he's he's realized he and I had a conversation

211
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,160
about a month ago and he's like, dad, I can't stand coding.

212
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,760
I cannot stand it.

213
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,150
Hatred.

214
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,230
But I want the CS and I want and I said, well, talk to me about the things

215
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,150
that you kind of want to do.

216
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:04,530
He's like, without boring our audience, long story short, he wants to be a PM.

217
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:12,430
And I'm like, OK, well, let me introduce you to a few folks and then start directing it.

218
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,950
And the other thing he's very fascinated about is cybersecurity.

219
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,300
And I'm like, oh, yeah, that one will be good for you.

220
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,020
He's right now at Walt Disney World.

221
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,380
Did I tell you this?

222
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:26,540
No.

223
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:34,350
He and his fiance are part of the Walt Disney World College Program.

224
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:37,950
So like you've been to Walt Disney World, I presume.

225
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,070
I have not.

226
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,950
You have not.

227
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,150
I don't go to Florida.

228
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,400
OK.

229
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:50,000
Walt Disney World, a large portion of their staff are essentially college level people

230
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,640
from all around the world, and they accepted both of them.

231
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,360
So they're they're working Walt Disney World for the next six months.

232
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:03,420
Like he was working one of the glow carts.

233
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,180
I don't know if you've seen this, but most of these amusement parks,

234
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,620
like they have these carts with shiny, spinny things, particularly when it's parade time.

235
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,140
And he he talked me this today and he's like, oh, yeah, me and my partner.

236
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,980
We sold a bunch of these things.

237
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,060
And but anyway, he got an opportunity.

238
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:28,300
Their IT department connected him or connected with him just out of the blue.

239
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,660
They're like, hey, we see that you have a C.S. degree or you're working on it.

240
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,860
We have this opportunity.

241
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,660
Do you want it?

242
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,130
He's like, yeah, I don't fully understand the opportunity,

243
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,450
but apparently it's combined C.S. data engineering, data science and customer connection.

244
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,210
And he's just he's super pumped about it.

245
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,490
He wants to be a generalist.

246
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,990
That and I'm supportive of me too.

247
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,310
Me too.

248
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,630
Next week, spring break.

249
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,310
So you asked my news.

250
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,430
My daughter is doing a class trip.

251
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,630
Both I and my wife.

252
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:05,790
You're going to Philadelphia in Washington, D.C.

253
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:06,830
Yeah.

254
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,910
So we talked about this before drink.

255
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,670
That happens starting Monday.

256
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,850
Nice. Nice.

257
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,650
Not been to that part of the world.

258
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,730
I'll say right now.

259
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,570
I don't know what I'll be most excited about retroactively.

260
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:29,810
I'm sure this is one of the things that I have picked up from Fallout, right?

261
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:37,900
Because Fallout does such a great job sort of modeling what the area of the world would look

262
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,660
like in an apocalypse.

263
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,060
You then go and look, you then go to the real place and you go like,

264
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,340
damn, those Fallout guys, they did a really exceptional job.

265
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,980
And with Fallout 4 being all about the Boston area, I'm like, you know, I would love to go to

266
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,940
Boston even more now just because of the real historical context.

267
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,020
So I've done the opposite.

268
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:08,340
I've done extensive walking, self-guided walking tours of Boston before playing Fallout 4.

269
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,300
Okay.

270
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:10,740
And when you play.

271
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,260
It would be fun to go back.

272
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:19,220
I have definitely walked more of Boston in Fallout 4 than I did over days and days of it in person.

273
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,220
So the question though, though, though, when you played Fallout 4, right?

274
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,300
Did you go like, I have totally been there.

275
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,390
Like, did you?

276
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:27,790
Yes.

277
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,510
In a couple of places.

278
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,070
Yes.

279
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,550
Yeah.

280
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,030
So for Vegas, that's what happened with me.

281
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:42,060
Anyway, so part of my bucket list is certainly to do historical visit, historical sites.

282
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,660
Excited about going to D.C.

283
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,220
I don't know that we're going to see the White House, but we're definitely going to see

284
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,980
the Lincoln Memorial.

285
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,420
So that should be cool.

286
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,340
I will actually have a Philly cheesesteak from Philly.

287
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,630
Right.

288
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,190
I did that.

289
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:58,430
Yeah.

290
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,470
Yeah.

291
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,510
But I was going to say.

292
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,470
You are far more traveled than I am.

293
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,310
I still have not been to Europe.

294
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:06,350
All right.

295
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:11,790
I'm going to push off the, we have to have an AI discussion chat, GPT discussion.

296
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,070
We do.

297
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,510
I thought we're going to avoid it this time.

298
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,910
Can we ever really?

299
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,100
Oh, right.

300
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,260
Can we?

301
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,060
So it was interesting.

302
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:28,560
There was, I don't normally respond to random posts on LinkedIn.

303
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,680
I shouldn't even say random.

304
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,720
I don't normally respond to posts on LinkedIn.

305
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:37,300
Often it is not worth the effort.

306
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,210
Okay.

307
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,930
So do you find, as an aside, do you find

308
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:51,010
responding to posts on LinkedIn has less ROI in general than on Twitter?

309
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,210
Oh, that's a good question.

310
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,610
People want longer answers, so it's different.

311
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,810
There's a lot more posturing on LinkedIn these days.

312
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,130
And Twitter is kind of turning into a ghost town.

313
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:01,650
Yeah.

314
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,730
So, but there was one struck something with me and it was from, and you've, you've,

315
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,730
you've still, he still works at Microsoft.

316
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,970
You've crossed paths with Wayne Roseberry before.

317
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:16,130
And he has a lot of good insightful posts and he's someone who's still doing,

318
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,010
at Microsoft, still doing mostly testing as his job.

319
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,290
So I'm, I know there's very little of those rules like that.

320
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,730
So it's interesting, but good for him.

321
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:26,610
And he's still still doing that?

322
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:26,850
Yeah.

323
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:27,010
Yeah.

324
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,250
Yeah.

325
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,370
And he's telling a story about where he wrote some automation to open and

326
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:34,530
close word a bunch of times and found a memory leak.

327
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,970
And it reminded me of a story I told in, uh, how we test software at Microsoft.

328
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,810
And I promised someone a while back, I can't remember who, that I would write the

329
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,050
15 years later reader's guide to that book.

330
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,050
And I'll do that this year sometime, but it reminded me, there's a story I wrote on

331
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:50,850
windows CE.

332
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,170
If you remember the Mira client, which was a stupid thing, there was this idea.

333
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:01,010
Remember this is 19, uh, might've been 2000, 2001, but the idea was the idea

334
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:05,840
for a device was when we sold a couple of these, it's like a computer monitor,

335
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,080
like sitting on your desk, like, like you'd have a pad,

336
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,950
like managing using an iPad as your, as your monitor.

337
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,550
Anyway, the idea was when you undocked it, you could walk away with it and it would

338
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,230
immediately become a terminal server client logging into your machine.

339
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,190
So basically you're taking your computer with you on a monitor.

340
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,430
This was before we had the idea of what a tablet was and it worked, but it was dumb.

341
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:28,990
It was heavy.

342
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,710
It was expensive.

343
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,190
It was too hard to use on the toilet.

344
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,630
I think was the, um, the final review that said it wasn't going to happen.

345
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,590
Is that what killed it?

346
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,650
Maybe, maybe.

347
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:49,680
Um, so I added a story, the paraphrased short version of what I put in the book

348
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:55,520
saying that brute force automation sometimes is interesting because I, I did the same

349
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:55,840
thing there.

350
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:02,560
I wrote a little script, not in selenium, not in Appium, not in any of that crap.

351
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,880
I just wrote a little wind 32 app that found the control, clicked on it.

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,320
And then, uh, found the control in the frame for the terminal server and click

353
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,840
disconnect and just looped.

354
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,860
I don't know why it felt fun to do, but after about 20 minutes, my test crashed.

355
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:24,270
And I thought immediately the thing you think, wow, I must've wrote some

356
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,630
crummy wind 32 code.

357
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,510
So I looked at it.

358
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,790
It looked fine.

359
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,360
I cleaned it up a little bit, added some logging, ran it again.

360
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,920
And in 20 minutes, it crashed again.

361
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,120
That's okay.

362
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,160
This time I'll look at it in the debugger and sure enough, leaking GDI objects and

363
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,560
it crashed because windows see you didn't have that much memory.

364
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
That's all just the same story told a different way from a Wayne tool.

365
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,040
But then I said the thing I always say, which is I'm gonna say it again.

366
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:56,320
I wish more testers and developers used automation as a discovery mechanism rather

367
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,620
than stupidly trying to automate a bunch of user workflows, which I have

368
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,620
been saying for at least a decade.

369
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,140
Stop it.

370
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,620
In fact, it was like over 10 years ago, I gave my talk on stop writing automation,

371
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,540
but nobody listens to me, Brent.

372
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,060
Nobody listens.

373
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:19,020
There are hundreds of thousands of people out there writing user workflow

374
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,860
automation and Selenium, Appium, test cafe, uh, Cyprus, this and that,

375
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,580
spending all their time writing user workflow automation.

376
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,540
Why, Brent?

377
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,140
Why, why, why, why, why, why?

378
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,370
Yeah, it's, it's, uh,

379
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,050
big test auto.

380
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,710
Okay.

381
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:37,950
Yeah.

382
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:44,910
You just one small voice and you know, the big test automation, uh, you know,

383
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,030
and their lobbyists, they're out to get you just a snowball and they're in their heat wave.

384
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,510
Sorry.

385
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,510
I write that and I go to the gym.

386
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:59,600
So I had some time this morning and I'm at the gym and I get a little notification

387
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,270
that says Michael Bolton has replied to your comment.

388
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,710
Yeah, I'm staring at it.

389
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,430
Your, your BFF was just like, yeah.

390
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,750
And wait, wait to, um, wait a the story.

391
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,510
Wait up.

392
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,140
Nice.

393
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:21,820
I, oh my God, this is why I don't reply on LinkedIn, but I checked and he says here,

394
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,980
here and, and gave a like to my post.

395
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,260
Cause the idea is, is that one thing Michael Bolton and I can agree on is that writing

396
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:37,340
a bunch of user workflow UI automation is not that helpful.

397
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,940
No, it's awful.

398
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,380
It's, it's just terrible.

399
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:51,020
As I mentioned before, James and Michael and I have this unwritten truce where we don't really,

400
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,580
we just kind of stay in our own lanes.

401
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,820
Even when I wrote that post, remember the one where I said, I'm not all teams need

402
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,580
dedicated testers, which seems so brain dead, simple to me.

403
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,900
Like, yeah, of course not all teams dedicated testers yet a whole bunch of testers got really

404
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,740
mad and said, I didn't know anything about testing and blah, blah, blah.

405
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,900
And then tagged in Michael and James.

406
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,460
That's what they do.

407
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,940
They bring in the, bring in the grownups to come yell at me.

408
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,340
They didn't yell at me as fast as they got was Bolton.

409
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,620
So something about, well, this author doesn't do blah, blah, blah, which was wrong, but

410
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,060
I didn't take it like, yeah.

411
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,780
Yeah.

412
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,060
And I don't know if you saw it in that same post just before it.

413
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:38,720
The issue is you validated, you accidentally went down the path of validating the whole

414
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,800
checking versus testing thing.

415
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,400
That's the only reason why Michael here, here you did.

416
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,330
I, I didn't, you didn't post.

417
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,770
I didn't, I didn't validate any checking versus testing.

418
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:54,930
No, but just before I, just before you posted,

419
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:02,930
Bolton replied to Wayne's thing and said, that was not an automated test.

420
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:05,250
That was a test, right?

421
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,490
I didn't read anybody else's stuff.

422
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,130
Whatever.

423
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,690
Okay.

424
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:15,730
No, but you were, that was you using your intellect, your skills, and a bit of code

425
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,370
to say it was an automated test is, is like saying that a hammer built the house.

426
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:21,570
Right.

427
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,770
Then he goes off into his weird checking versus testing metaphor.

428
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,570
It was a test completely agree.

429
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,250
And it was automated.

430
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,850
I do not understand why it's not that simple.

431
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:41,650
And then you said, so the way I think Bolton is translating it, the term automation is now a tool.

432
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:49,730
I wish, wish more developers and testers used tools as a discovery mechanism

433
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,330
rather than trying to do a bunch of work.

434
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,050
I do.

435
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:54,450
I do.

436
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:59,330
And if you think about, and this is a big, big point of mine, I've never understood

437
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:06,610
the interest other than a cool little demo to watch of trying to automate a user workflow.

438
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,570
You use, you want to use, I'll call it test automation, test tools, whatever the hell ever.

439
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:18,050
You want to use the power of programming to do the testing that is too difficult to do by hand.

440
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,290
But if I want to create a thousand entries in an address book,

441
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,610
I'm not going to go create them one by one.

442
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,050
I'm going to write a fricking loop.

443
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:32,620
If I need to create any sort, I want, I can only use automation to do test data.

444
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:37,740
If I want to understand, well, what happens if I do this action a million times,

445
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,860
I'm going to write myself a little program to do that and understand that I am not going to write

446
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,700
automation to put an item in the cart, open the cart, click on payment, enter a fake credit

447
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,540
card and make sure I get the sale done.

448
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,180
I don't know how far too ridiculous you want to go with this conversation, but

449
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:01,100
another blatant example is, okay, can my website handle a thousand simultaneous users?

450
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,460
Sure.

451
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,740
Right. Do that as a manual test case.

452
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,580
You call all your friends and you have them log into your stupid website.

453
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,340
Even there, you can do some cool stuff using Postman.

454
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,420
If it's out of your website, but it's an API and you want to simulate some requests,

455
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,380
you can do it there or-

456
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:23,980
No, my point is doing it in the manual way is dumb AF is all I'm saying.

457
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,100
Yes. Yes.

458
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,420
Right.

459
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,820
But that curiosity, here's what's wrong and here's where maybe we agree, but I don't want to go in,

460
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:37,500
I mean, with Michael Bolton is I want to use automation to let me be curious about what

461
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,900
happens, not to satisfy some requirements. I know there's somebody, I can't remember their name,

462
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,460
but they're in my feed and I haven't removed them yet, but they just post these esoteric

463
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,180
comments about testing that mean nothing.

464
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,860
And I look at that, they always at the top of my feed because they post so often.

465
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,660
I looked at one the other day and it was something around, oh God,

466
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,380
now I just, it left my head because it was so stupid.

467
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:06,140
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

468
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,020
It was, it'll come back to me later and I'll blurt it out.

469
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:17,840
But I just, just want testers and that are testing people who do testing.

470
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,480
And once again, research has shown that automated tests owned by the dev team have a high correlation

471
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,160
with quality and those written by the QA team do not have that correlation.

472
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,440
So just want to throw that out there for those of you that have forgotten every time I bring it up,

473
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,640
I used to have the page memorized.

474
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,600
Yeah. So here's, here is, I don't know how you...

475
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,320
Hey look, it's AB Tester talking about testing. Welcome to the podcast.

476
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm not certain how you managed to successfully trigger me, but you have.

477
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,920
It's my job.

478
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:50,960
Testing.

479
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,400
I'm good at my job.

480
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:58,560
Testing this, at a high level, this is the thing that bothers me.

481
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,720
Okay. And I think it's in alignment.

482
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,560
There are a lot of people that we have spoken to in the present as well as in the past that

483
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,800
view testing as the goal.

484
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,080
Yes.

485
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,080
It's effing not. Testing is a means, not an end.

486
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,840
Okay. Number one.

487
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:28,110
Number two, when you are going through and it's understanding what the hell you're trying

488
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,110
to achieve, that's, I guess that's my other problem is that there's so many people who

489
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,510
don't even realize it's a means on an end.

490
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:41,790
So they don't even have a sense of what's the end, the goal you're trying to achieve.

491
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:47,710
Right. This is why principle number one is principle number one for MTP.

492
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:56,700
Okay. Now, to generalize what you were saying just a second ago is, okay, if testing is a means

493
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:04,800
and not an ends, once I understand the ends, then I should be looking for the high ROI

494
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,240
ways to achieve those ends.

495
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:18,580
To me, it's like, you know, we want to take a trip to Hawaii and, you know, we can start hiking down

496
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,820
the PCT. See what I did there?

497
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,900
Nice, nice, nice.

498
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,140
Yeah.

499
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:23,620
Yeah.

500
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,060
You're not going to get there.

501
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:31,660
You're not going to get there anytime soon, and you're going to have a big bottleneck at

502
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,700
some point in time.

503
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,460
And let me just loop this into something you and I have both said before.

504
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,500
Because this is exactly the difference.

505
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,340
And I was trying to find the article real quick that where James wrote this, but I'm 99%

506
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,980
positive I read this and didn't dream it because why would I dream about James Block?

507
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,860
That would be weird.

508
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,860
And again, I will not say anything here.

509
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,100
If he wants to listen to the podcast, he won't, but nothing I wouldn't say to his face is you

510
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,860
and I have said, Brent, you and I have said many times we care about quality far, far more

511
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,380
than we care about testing.

512
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,700
Yes.

513
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,580
James has come out and said the opposite.

514
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,980
It wasn't like the premise or the thesis of his, but he cares a lot about testing.

515
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,540
That's fine.

516
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,420
That's fine.

517
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,540
I disagree with that as the thing to care about.

518
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,060
But when I look at these folks who are doing what I'll call-

519
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,020
Well, if he's expressing his passion.

520
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,340
His passion is testing, yes.

521
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,540
And a lot of people like this, a school of we care about testing.

522
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,820
Testing is super important.

523
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:38,860
It's important that we have skilled people doing great testing.

524
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:46,780
And while I can't disagree with the passion, to me, that doesn't translate into quality

525
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,660
software, which is what I care about far more.

526
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,580
Who cares if a crummy product that nobody uses is well tested.

527
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,500
The testers, maybe.

528
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,820
Great, great.

529
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,220
Yeah.

530
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,180
That's fantastic.

531
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,900
You're 100% right.

532
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,260
That's the best kind of right.

533
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:10,880
To me, he's basically saying, and good for him, right?

534
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,320
His talents, his going deep, that has helped society.

535
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,200
Yeah, no.

536
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,240
But his-

537
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,360
Did I just say, yeah, no.

538
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,400
I'll explain that later.

539
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:22,640
Go on.

540
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:22,800
Yeah.

541
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,560
But the acolytes that follow him, and here I specifically use the term acolytes,

542
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,440
right?

543
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,640
It's the blind faith that then take his statements and misunderstanding, in my humble

544
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,520
opinion, I don't know if it's that actual misunderstanding, but misunderstanding that

545
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,960
he is stating this is what everyone should do.

546
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,990
And it's not.

547
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,030
He's saying he's going deep on this specific means.

548
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:55,870
That's where his passion is.

549
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,950
And great, great.

550
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:58,990
Go for it.

551
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:04,510
But from a business context, I'm going to stand by the side of it's a means, not an

552
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,390
ends.

553
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,310
And I want to understand the ROI of alternatives.

554
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:16,860
If there are multiple ways for me to achieve the ends, why would I do the one

555
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,460
why would I do this one versus the alternatives?

556
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:20,700
Yeah.

557
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,140
And I'll be very, very clear here, because this is, I don't want to say just

558
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,700
preference.

559
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,580
I'm not saying what James is doing is badmating.

560
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,500
Because I think it's not.

561
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,260
He's very good at what he does.

562
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,860
Sometimes he's a jerk to people.

563
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
And I don't want to go into that right now.

564
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:44,300
But what we really are arguing about is, you know, given the preference of,

565
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:49,020
could we have could we make a product that is our customers view as a quality

566
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,020
product, or could we make a product that we feel is well tested?

567
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,260
There's one that you and I would choose 10 times out of 10.

568
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,820
And another one that people like James would choose 10 out of 10.

569
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:08,700
The philosophical principle difference is that I believe that the customer

570
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,140
determines quality.

571
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,500
So if they like it, it doesn't matter what kind of testing we did.

572
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,300
Yeah.

573
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,600
Yeah.

574
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,880
And if I do, if I have the best testers in the world applying great testing to something

575
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:30,480
and doing things in a very thoughtical and using all the things from RST and customers

576
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,920
think the software is a piece of shit, I'm not proud of that work.

577
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,200
No, I was just thinking because we just had this example of where we did a bunch of testing.

578
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
And to be clear, there's an overlap.

579
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,880
There's a Venn overlap here.

580
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,400
I'm just saying if I can choose one, I choose quality.

581
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,030
No, no.

582
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:50,990
I mean, you, of course can choose one.

583
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,870
Damn it, Paige, maybe lose my train of thought.

584
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,110
That's what I do, man.

585
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,990
That's my job.

586
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,830
That's my job.

587
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,070
Your job is to get me, what we learned is you have two jobs.

588
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:03,390
Yeah.

589
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:03,950
Wrap it up.

590
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,150
We got to end early today.

591
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,870
We started late.

592
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,710
It's going to be a short podcast, which is much easier to listen to on your commute

593
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,190
because you can have a shorter commute and you're welcome.

594
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:12,990
What were you going to say, man?

595
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:19,870
Oh, so you said if the customers love the product, I think you paraphrasing

596
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:26,370
customers, the product, then you said something like how does the testing matter?

597
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:26,930
I don't care.

598
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,050
Yeah, I don't care how it was.

599
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:28,450
Okay.

600
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,850
If customers love the product, I don't care how it was tested.

601
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,130
Let me ask you this.

602
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,890
If customers don't love the product.

603
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,740
Oh, customers don't love the product.

604
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,620
It's a testing problem.

605
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:37,860
I'm not.

606
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,260
I'm lying.

607
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,660
It's not because all you know what?

608
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,900
Because that happens from often from the same crowd.

609
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,780
Customers don't like it.

610
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,740
It must be a testing issue.

611
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,740
It's like choose one side or the other.

612
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,260
No, it means we built the wrong product.

613
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,100
To me, it's quality.

614
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:57,620
And I wrote a very abstract and painful to read blog posts on this topic,

615
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,900
so I'm not going to recommend it.

616
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:08,740
Quality is first and foremost, how well has this thing solved my problem?

617
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,300
Okay.

618
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,820
Then it's okay.

619
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:16,140
Now what additional pain in the ass things does it bring to it?

620
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:21,820
Like it reminds me of systems theory where one of the particularly

621
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,420
systematics, there is a law in systematics which says the number of problems in the

622
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,860
universe is constant.

623
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,020
So oh yeah, we talked about this like two times ago.

624
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,740
I'll pound my.

625
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,660
Yeah, it's essentially okay.

626
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:34,980
Great.

627
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,780
If it's solving my problem and if it's creating bigger problems for me,

628
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:47,300
then then then my original problem, right without overusing the word problem,

629
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,140
that then becomes the problem.

630
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:49,380
Yes.

631
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,980
And that's where bugs and such could come into play.

632
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,780
But if if the initial hypothesis for the purpose of the thing is wrong,

633
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,580
it doesn't matter if you tested it well or didn't test it at all.

634
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:03,460
Right, right.

635
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,060
I love the part where I tell you to wrap it up and you go into some big long thing.

636
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,820
Well, that's your job.

637
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,540
That's awesome.

638
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,140
Okay, well, we're going to call it good here.

639
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,660
I got a little something to play here.

640
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,460
See what works here.

641
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,080
All right.

642
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,920
And we're going to leave you with that.

643
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm Alan.

644
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,760
I'm Brent.

645
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,960
Talk to you soon.

646
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,480
Bye.
