1
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:19,840
test the modern testing podcast join your hosts Alan and Brent I am mindless

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,140
agile robot I must iterate as we talk about software engineering software

3
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,620
quality leadership and whatever else comes to mind now on with the show hey

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:38,760
Brent hey Alan how is it going super happy holidays to the three we are for

5
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,040
the first time ever recording a podcast at Unity's office in Bellevue Washington

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:49,380
if we sound like we're in a different place that's why and Brent is gonna take

7
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:57,570
a commemorative photo of this event and now it is done and now that part is

8
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,930
probably my fault you can fix that while I talk this is episode number 95 I guess

9
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,930
we should catch up a little bit kind of keep the the pattern to a minimum if we

10
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,760
can although we are incapable of that and then see if we can get into it sound

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,360
good Brent it does anything new and exciting I should know about I do

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,200
neither new nor exciting okay then yeah so let's get going so let's start with

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,230
some reflections on 2018 do you have any of those Brent Brent is frantically

14
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:41,590
staring at his phone I'm not sure if he is downloading inappropriate material or

15
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:45,510
if he is just look actually looking for something to do is that your best two

16
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:54,180
guesses yeah right trap and fire oh yeah favorite book you read in 2018 tensor

17
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:03,670
flow using Python excellent excellent choice Wow favorite movie the one I

18
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,670
watched the most often I would go with favorite and that would have to be

19
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:13,430
Guardians of the Galaxy volume two a good choice a good choice which I think

20
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:20,500
I actually liked better than Avengers infinity war I also loved I also loved

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,620
I went and I saw the new spider-man movie this weekend very good my son and

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:37,080
I are my middle son has been on me he is expecting to see that dad very soon is

23
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,800
it's worth it excellent favorite a B testing podcast episodes of 2018 I have two

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,880
on that one 77 what do we do in 77 we actually wrote down the principles oh is

25
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,040
that that we've we've vetted though so 20 in reflection 2018 was the year of

26
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,140
the modern testing principles because we came from sort of a outline of like how

27
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,060
about these dude they're not quite right to vetting and editing and also standing

28
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,300
our ground in a few places with the three until we came up with what we

29
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,500
thought would continue to evolve but they've been locked solid for almost a

30
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:24,230
year now yeah March there is a strong chance I was a strong chance that

31
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:35,240
episode 100 might be the anniversary of the development of maybe I thought I showed

32
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,640
the modern testing principles briefly at test bash in 2018 which is one of my

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,600
highlights of 2018 which was February March and the end of February beginning

34
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,440
in March they might have been done a little earlier than that we might have

35
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,960
the pod I don't know what we'll figure it out we're not too good on 77

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,080
remembering things yep my other favorite episode is 86 and that's the one where

37
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:08,480
we do the drill down and on the customer principle oh yeah which was when

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,160
we came up with these I was surprised that that one ended up being

39
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,600
controversial and we've talked about the controversy around that before drink

40
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,820
so yeah that was a good drill down and people that don't get it should listen

41
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,200
that listen to that episode and join the slack channel because the conversation

42
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,560
still continues one of the three dot slack comm you can go to modern testing

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,520
org and find a link there to sign yourself up

44
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,520
auto magically I can't think of a good podcast a good favorite podcast of mine

45
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,440
for the last year to answer my own question I already answered the movie

46
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:56,400
question favorite book I read not as cool as TensorFlow with Python but I read

47
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:05,860
what was the name of the book about the startup run by the really bad CEO in

48
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,380
Silicon Valley they're they're a blood testing company they're trying to make

49
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,180
hardware to test blood and they were cutting all kinds of corners doing all

50
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,100
kinds of cheating reminded me of when I used to work at midi soft back in the

51
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,260
early 90s bad blood it's called bad blood I thought it was pretty cool I felt

52
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,930
like hey as bad as I thought it was when my CFO told me to start changing time on

53
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,850
our network service so we get a few more sales into each quarter that was

54
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,050
nothing that was like eating cotton candy compared to the stuff going on at

55
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,970
the company whose name I can't remember who actually did go out of business

56
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:45,250
finally just this year CEO was fired years back but there is a movie being

57
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,820
made it was a great year for Marvel movies also a sad year in losing Stan Lee

58
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:57,140
I grew up with Marvel Comics so I I see I love that the Marvel Universe is

59
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:03,750
getting so much love in the cinema did you know there's a my kids are excited

60
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,190
my daughter especially who just turned 13 is excited to go see Deadpool Deadpool 2

61
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,980
because there's a PG version coming out I'm kind of interested to seeing how

62
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,300
much gets edited and what the heck happens why would you know it'd be that's

63
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:25,930
funny because I could see Deadpool and I could see Reynolds coming out as

64
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:32,370
Deadpool and then making some snarky jokes about bleeding the teenagers dry

65
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,360
first off we didn't actually talk about Deadpool I have to say that I was

66
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:46,200
disappointed with Deadpool really yeah I found it nowhere near as as funny although

67
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,680
Deadpool forming up X Factor and then slowly but surely slaughtering them off

68
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,730
accidentally that was amusing that was totally amazing and the invisible guy

69
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:01,250
did you the invisible guy that you never do was really there until he died did

70
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,250
you see who it was when he gets electrocuted you briefly see his face

71
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:15,000
no it's Brad Pitt oh anyway one thing as I mentioned we do predictions every year so

72
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,400
we should take some time and talk about our predictions from last year no one of

73
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,720
the things we had a long conversation last year around which episode number this

74
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:36,520
would be and it's funny because I in the conversation I was all about I think

75
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,680
it's gonna be I did some math I think we'll do it be productive do this many

76
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,480
last year probably around 95 and then so I said that in the conversation I

77
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,800
relistened to the podcast one of the few times I've listened to a podcast

78
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,010
other than editing and then in the then Brett says I think it'll be episode

79
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,970
90 and I said 92 so I'm closer but without going over I'm closer without

80
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,850
going over but we had a fairly productive year we did how many episodes

81
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:09,570
is that 23 23 episodes pretty good yeah that's almost ones are one every two

82
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:16,710
weeks almost yeah we we we did between between travel and life we did pretty

83
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,750
well all right well we'll get back to maybe a prediction around that later in

84
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,910
the episode I also threw out a prediction which is which is contrary to

85
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:33,360
you are wait so far Alan won Brent zero excellent excellent I'm gonna hit a home

86
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,000
run here in a minute you threw out a prediction that maybe episode 100 would

87
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,560
be on the anniversary of our modern testing principal principal reveal or

88
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,160
according to your notes here it said Alan not me predicted that a hundred

89
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,480
would be near the five-year anniversary yeah and we're on track for the brand but

90
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,760
let me finish cuz these are two different things I was getting there you

91
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,720
made a prediction a minute ago five minutes ago an hour a lifetime ago saying

92
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,120
that the episode 100 would possibly be on the anniversary of modern testing

93
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,000
principles and then I was gonna segue that in brilliantly until you screwed it

94
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,120
up to say last year I predicted that episode 100 would be on our five year

95
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,370
anniversary which is just after that in April I can make that both of those

96
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,730
predictions come true I'm still taking applications for people with the first

97
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,730
letter B in their name but another thing we said I think I said it we kind

98
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:41,490
of agreed on it that that in 2018 by the way Breckner Bach there's plenty of

99
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:50,010
people Oh God and and now you can figure out which one goes with which all

100
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,460
right predicted that empty modern testing would become a thing and damn it

101
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,080
if it didn't sort of no it's a thing still totally blown away that ministry

102
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,120
of test and actually the reason I know that the principles were at test bash

103
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,920
is shortly after they made that poster of the modern testing principles yeah

104
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,310
which is kind of cool and there were actually it's way way more than kind of

105
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,510
cool it's super cool there was lots of discussion around it we have seen meetups

106
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:25,510
people have made it central to yeah it's it became a thing I don't know how

107
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:34,170
because we it wasn't the first external talk I ever gave about modern testing was

108
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:41,050
in late Feb at test bash Brighton Joe has has made it a key part of his

109
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:47,130
lightning talks to OTCs in a row so cool thank you everyone out there who has

110
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:53,030
reviewed and given us feedback on modern testing so hopefully it continues to be a

111
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:58,590
thing until it doesn't need to be a thing anymore yeah I'm not certain when

112
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:03,480
that's gonna be yeah predicting things is hard especially about the future I

113
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,680
had a sub prediction with that which actually did not work out where I

114
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,440
predicted that modern testing org would turn into something and it remains to be

115
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:20,940
purely a redirect into the modern testing principles at some point we could

116
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,620
make a website around that with some more information and we could host the

117
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,620
podcast there versus being in a a sub domain of anger weasel calm which I did

118
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,180
change hosts on anger weasel calm this year and reset everyone's RSS feed as a

119
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,340
side effect of that I would probably would probably have it would have to

120
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,220
happen again if we change web hosting which is one of the big reasons I

121
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,140
haven't thought about that but I don't know if I will continue that prediction

122
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:53,020
I think I can just keep doing what it's doing I've realized more and more that

123
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:58,820
domain names don't matter because of search yeah that's true the thing is

124
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,320
even I mean back then when we did this prediction that we saw a lot of momentum

125
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:11,580
moving towards it in modern testing org being sort of a central place for people

126
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,390
to get information base has as we've gone through this last year I'm not

127
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:23,040
certain that that's really all that important right the Ministry of Testing

128
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:32,440
has has con people don't seem to have an inability to to find it right right

129
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,400
right and that's to me that's what's important yeah I like having the domain

130
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,240
and the redirect because a lot easier than telling people to go to angry with

131
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,480
the calm slash a be testing oh for sure in modern testing org and that gets you

132
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,640
everything you need to know podcasts are on that page you are good to go

133
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,050
Brent I want you to talk a little bit more about this prediction because I

134
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,960
will dive in here a little bit you had a little diatribe small soapbox around

135
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,970
how there would be a tipping point in the way test job titles are used do you

136
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:16,050
remember this yeah I vaguely remember it I don't remember so what I've seen is

137
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:22,410
it's a tough prediction to make because test job titles for testers are stupid

138
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:29,830
silly they're all over the map they don't titles are still stupid one year later

139
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:41,650
yeah this I'm gonna go ahead and and see in terms of your predictions like the

140
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:49,540
scoreboard I think is Brent zero Allen two will go and with this one I think

141
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:57,520
it's still Brent zero and but and by the way just jumping to the end it's

142
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:06,020
Brent zero this is something that I think still is is very important but I

143
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:12,700
no longer really have a sense that the momentum is in this direction right the

144
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:19,820
I'm seeing a lot of in in what I'm visible to in the in the test community

145
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:28,830
I'm seeing a lot of almost for lack of a better word a reinvigoration of

146
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:37,490
traditional stuff right and I'm thinking thinking through like a recent tweet

147
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,810
storm where yeah we were asked to sort of incorporate the defense of a test

148
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:50,210
specialist into the modern testing principles yeah and let me let me just

149
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:54,330
read that so it people who don't follow Twitter can have context someone found

150
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:58,450
the Ministry of Test list of the modern testing principles and they sent a tweet

151
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:03,870
to me saying can I suggest number eight we should articulate the value of having

152
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,230
dedicated testing experts whose role is focused on critical thinking achieved by

153
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:18,450
maintaining critical distance from the product yes that was that event occurred

154
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:32,280
and that's and that proposal was rejected yeah by both of us in Allen in in the

155
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,440
thread for those who don't want to read the thread Alan essentially said yeah we

156
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,640
think this is covered sufficiently and then I piggybacked off of that and said

157
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:54,160
you know what MT does not explicitly say one way or the other if a business

158
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:04,120
decides that they need this great if the business doesn't decide also great

159
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:14,540
right now that's empty my personal opinion which which may not necessarily

160
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:21,060
align with with well it aligns with what I just said about MT but I will go back

161
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:28,250
my rule of thumb is the term specialist is a bottleneck so yes I am

162
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,850
unlikely to ever proactively in a written form defend the role of a

163
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:42,640
specialist short-term sure I would defend it but it has to be it would be in

164
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,480
my mind all right if I'm helping to make this decision my job is that going to be

165
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:57,920
to alright I have a bigger problem to solve right now but I'm going to be

166
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,520
creating a new problem by incorporating a specialist into the system and so it's

167
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,960
going to be a cost-benefit analysis in my view I get it yeah more importantly is

168
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:15,790
I don't know if we maybe it wasn't it wasn't conscious from my part but we've

169
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:19,030
been talking about modern testing as the antidote or I've added that word is the

170
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:26,150
antidote to traditional test last bottleneck testing and the principles as

171
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:30,750
you know if you've if you've read them don't talk about testing they're about

172
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:37,060
how to make quality software yeah so having one specifically about testing

173
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,100
was weird but there always be people who want to and they see this a lot there is

174
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:48,840
a faction and rightfully so of testers worried about job preservation and by

175
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,360
pressing this idea that your special snowflake like I'm the only one that can

176
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,720
apply critical thinking and critical distance to the product that it helps

177
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,850
preserve that that role that specialization for a job I am about

178
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:05,050
getting rid of bottlenecks and we'll actually talk more about that a little

179
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:10,090
bit I'm about yeah getting rid of bottlenecks is certainly part of it the

180
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:17,800
the thing I would really like to see and it's really hard to defend against

181
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:24,860
but the the old story of the Emperor's new clothes right I think the test

182
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,700
discipline has wrapped themselves up in the the Emperor's clothes and for a long

183
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:38,830
time and I'm nodding my head trying to shine the light on this and in the way I

184
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:46,230
internalize it is is getting some of these folks to open their eyes and

185
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,710
re-look at the world they're in particularly the leaders like the the

186
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:58,820
leaders in the test community who are open-minded and have a defense against

187
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:05,460
the following phrase I have been in the industry for 20,000 years and I know

188
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:12,380
everything and I'm exaggerating of course no you're not there's not too many

189
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:19,020
people been here for 20,000 years but you get the point right that experience is

190
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,970
valuable particularly with those leaders and what I would love to see a

191
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:32,120
lot more of is those folks saying recognizing that what got us here may not

192
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:38,140
necessarily get us where we need to go for sure right all right back to the

193
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:43,980
list so on the tipping point the way test hot job titles are used I'm gonna

194
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,400
take that back and matter of fact it's Brent zero Brent zero and I don't see I

195
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,790
do think that the way this happens is we get enough in the leadership on this

196
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:02,560
front but I'm definitely wrong on this one and and I actually don't see it's

197
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,640
coming close it may not be a change is needed yeah what about the next one I

198
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,240
have some thoughts on this but I'm gonna let you answer it you said that

199
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,240
AI would become democratized that is still on track yeah it's happening at the

200
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,400
house we might come it's happening it's not there it's not there yet but it is it

201
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:29,640
is so that prediction I think is still very valid I'm just off by the timeline

202
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:39,500
yeah that's cool I'm even now telling people and I mentioned this on the slack

203
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:52,460
channel people going into college today I currently don't think data science is the

204
00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:00,530
way to go if you want to go into software industry I do think targeting a t-shaped

205
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:07,810
role focused on CS but adding data science is the way to go I think the

206
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,210
devs of the future need to have this in their back in their back pocket yes I

207
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:20,270
agree so I had a prediction that and someone can I didn't go look at the

208
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,270
websites to see if these things happen that I didn't know about them maybe they

209
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,190
were going on and I was subconsciously do about them but we had a discussion a

210
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,470
year ago I said that machine learning would creep its way into automation and

211
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:40,510
that they'd apply ml to test automation to help solve some of the problems and

212
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:48,750
where's my bell sound ding with the rise of things like Mabel and test him and a

213
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:53,830
few others using ml to take care of the flaky test problem with web automation

214
00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:02,120
that happened that's out there that's done I don't know if I in hindsight

215
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,480
these companies have had to have been around for more than a year so maybe I

216
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,720
just didn't know about them I heard about them I was influenced but if I

217
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:15,520
didn't I'm a genius yeah or very very lucky I'm realizing how how you nailed

218
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,490
your prediction here because I think two things that you really say that really

219
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:28,310
nailed this number one ml will creep its way right you know any sort of

220
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,760
movement into automation with the word creep makes that a winner oh don't

221
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,240
make fun of my weasel words the other one is tool vendors will apply ml

222
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:49,280
oh my god right all that really means is will tool vendors to pass this flag

223
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,600
tool vendors all they have to do is realize make fun all you want I'm not

224
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:02,680
making fun of you actually I'm making fun of tool vendors say hi I'm a tool

225
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:09,720
vendor for automation we have all the ml's and all the AI's yep yep okay ding

226
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,200
point for me yep for sure and did you finally graduate no that was your

227
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,650
prediction yeah Brent did you said you're gonna reboot blogging did you do

228
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:25,960
that no and Brent last but not least for sure wrong

229
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,480
Kylo Ren will be revealed as Darth Reven yeah matter of fact we didn't even

230
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,000
talk about that Star Wars movie Last Jedi with a name like that you expect

231
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,460
cool man we didn't talk about it but man was I disappointed about that whole

232
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:51,280
thing like I don't get where where they're going with this franchise like

233
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,960
the next Star Wars movie hopefully they'll be the last one because I will

234
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,690
probably be thankful it one last thing on the reflections I wanted to mention

235
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:09,530
before we go into prediction mode is I discovered many new blogs this year but

236
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,610
I discovered my favorite blog that was new to me at least in the last year and

237
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,570
I've tweeted a lot about it I don't know if we've ever talked about it on the air

238
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:26,970
Jeff Niman you know do Jeff is no stories from a software tester very good

239
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:34,410
writer much better than me he writes about a lot of topics that are I don't

240
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:39,990
even know if he knows much about modern testing if that's on his radar but I think

241
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:46,110
I do yeah it's a tester stories comm stories from a software tester he had a

242
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,120
post about should be higher specialist testers of course he takes six pages to

243
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,000
write about it well he probably needs to explain why yeah but he has he's he

244
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,960
makes some good cases he writes well so that's my I wanted to give him a shout

245
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,480
out just because that's it's one of the blogs of course I have a RSS feed of a

246
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,360
gazillion blogs I look at most I don't read through his posts are ones that I

247
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,480
stop and read so that's my new discovery any new discoveries on the web

248
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:24,750
for you this year blogs websites no actually this year so the stories of the

249
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:32,850
tester like the the thing that was interesting to me most of the the blog

250
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:43,030
stuff that's relevant to our audience was a random listing of people and how

251
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:49,000
they're using modern testing modern testing is is in a lot more discussions

252
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,150
and they're just popping up everywhere so that's where I've either that or

253
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,030
investigations into data science is where I've been spending my time okay I

254
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:07,080
have not other than our own this last year I don't think I've actually

255
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:12,600
listened to a single podcast oh I've been getting really into trivia

256
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,320
podcasts oh you've always been into it I didn't know I added a few more to my my

257
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,400
rep my list trivial warfare probably one of my favorites now gets a little

258
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,560
obnoxious sometimes but it's fun I like trivia I like watching jeopardy I played

259
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:37,840
jeopardy on my Amazon echo all the time I do pretty well I have to say yeah

260
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:44,880
all right let's look forward to 2019 but before you and I look forward to 2019

261
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,820
let's we had a few members of the three look forward 2019 want to share what

262
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:59,060
they had so we had one of our listeners Ryan Kuelhorst send in his thoughts about

263
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,280
2019 in an audio clip here it is hi Alan and Brent and the other two

264
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,100
listeners of the A B testing podcast my name is Ryan and here are my predictions

265
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,900
for 2019 I think first off teams will start to utilize JavaScript and node JS

266
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:18,340
more in their test automation strategy I've been diving into node JS and the

267
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,860
last year and I found a lot of really helpful libraries some of them include like

268
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,020
Cypress IO and test cafe for UI testing really nice HTTP client I use axios JS

269
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:33,940
and for machine learning I've been kind of diving into TensorFlow JS so I think

270
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,380
there's really powerful to use JavaScript as a language for your

271
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:42,660
automation strategy so I kind of see teams moving in that direction another

272
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,260
thing I see DevOps DevOps DevOps like everyone is talking about DevOps and I

273
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,940
know there I know you might be like come on Ryan DevOps that was like five

274
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,420
years ago it wasn't the Phoenix project released five years ago big

275
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,860
organizations are just now getting into looking into DevOps as kind of a way to

276
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,460
run their organization so one of the like big tip offs was for me for this was

277
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:14,020
a local QA conference conference just released their speaker talks and half of

278
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,100
them were focused around DevOps so I think DevOps is definitely starting to

279
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,940
build momentum and you'll just see like you'll just get hammered with DevOps

280
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,460
DevOps DevOps in the last in the next year the last thing is there's a new

281
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:34,100
Avengers movie Avengers Endgame the last movie Infinity Wars edit on such a

282
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,900
hopeless note and it's really it kind of akin back to the Empire Strikes Back

283
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:45,620
but I just hope Endgame doesn't have the same kind of lackluster conclusion

284
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,020
as Return of the Jedi like make it better make Thanos I don't know better

285
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,980
than than what like Vader turned into so kind of on that note I wish Alan and

286
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,510
Brent and the other two listeners a happy 2019 cheers so thoughts on that I

287
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:08,730
have my own but I'll let you start this time Wow no I'm actually thinking it's

288
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:16,370
too bad Ryan's name doesn't start with a B Brian yeah maybe maybe he's

289
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:23,720
comfortable changing it to Brian so I'm I'm gonna jump in because I use a lot of

290
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,800
Node.js I'm doing Advent of Code this year although I get kind of stuck a couple

291
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:34,620
days ago so I'm stopped because it's hard but I've done everything in

292
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:40,800
JavaScript using node and we have a lot of node apps here and I play with a lot

293
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,440
and he's right there is we're starting to see almost a tipping point of testing

294
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:53,320
and analysis and quality tools built on top of JavaScript built with JavaScript

295
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:00,080
built on top of the node package manager library you know NPM install all the

296
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,720
good stuff and I see more and more test type tools showing up there so that's

297
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,000
a good observation about yeah I think he could be right that we are ready for

298
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,260
that to become even more of a thing I think it's gonna continue right and

299
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,380
Brent got all squealy when he mentioned TensorFlow yeah that was that was

300
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:29,450
fantastic good good job Ryan the first so the one thing that was interesting to

301
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:36,050
me is that the his first prediction he might as well have been speaking Greek

302
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:42,770
right these are I'm like what what are these things right it's like I listen to a

303
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,090
foreign language you hear like one word you know it's like what what a lot

304
00:30:46,090 --> 00:31:01,900
TensorFlow yeah yeah no it's it's I've realized that I personally my investments

305
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:13,380
in in sort of the the test space in a deep dive rather small a lot of these

306
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:19,520
things I don't understand what they are anymore right I would I would not be able

307
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:25,760
to go back to test if I wanted well think it from this perspective when you move

308
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,040
to modern testing if you if say you get to principle number seven and you get to

309
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,960
the point where you no longer need actually have to go that far as far as

310
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,480
not needing a dedicated testing specialist one way to get developers to do better

311
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,520
testing and write better quality code is make it easy for them to insert quality

312
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,620
and testing tools into the workflows they already know node does that yeah and

313
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:59,260
there's there is here's one one thing that I have observed and and I don't

314
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:05,420
know about the specifics of Ryan's first prediction but one thing I observe is

315
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,380
technical communities so here I'm talking about people's code getting

316
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:20,900
together and sharing knowledge not necessarily people those are thriving the

317
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:33,960
matter of fact actually just this last weekend I've been doing a lot of ML I'm

318
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:40,720
on my holiday vacation starting last Friday I do a lot of one of the things

319
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:48,490
that's generally been true first thing I do when I go on vacation is I work on the

320
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:59,310
the AI stuff that I haven't been able to do at work because I'm a manager and

321
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,380
people like are you my wife's like are you doing work I'm like well literally

322
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:15,090
yes but no but for example your Taylor Swift ML thing that you sent out a while

323
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:21,530
ago I read that and the approach that they do is very similar to a problem that

324
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:28,250
I have so I've been working on sort of re-implementing that approach against my

325
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:35,330
data set and it's it's that sort of humidity around code around even

326
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:43,100
solutions and then blogs and stuff that's thriving DevOps DevOps DevOps oh

327
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:54,410
yeah that so that was one of my predictions so Ryan's predictions right

328
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:59,570
so I think as we get through playing through the three I'll have nothing so

329
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:07,450
that way oh okay yeah so the DevOps thing I definitely think that that's I

330
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,610
obviously I completely agree with with with Ryan on I think and we've talked

331
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:17,930
about the three ways of DevOps all line a lot with modern testing principles so I

332
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:24,250
think if our if as much as modern testing is becoming a thing DevOps people

333
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,310
actually getting what it is not using it as a buzzword which thankfully they

334
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:33,510
haven't done with modern testing yet is something yes I agree yeah I have a I have

335
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:39,990
a relevant segue to that it's the last thing on our segue flash tangent yeah I

336
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:47,420
don't want to take it yet but but I do think DevOps is DevOps is going to be a

337
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:57,180
thriving thing and I also think it is part positive and part negative I think

338
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:04,960
one of the big one of the major reasons for this is that it is to business

339
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,880
leaders who do not understand the test role it is an obvious thing to take these

340
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,890
trained experienced people and move them into yeah I'm kind of glad we

341
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,930
didn't have a lot of these or more than one of these audio submissions because

342
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:25,610
you're kind of turning them into full-on mailbag answers but they're

343
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:32,930
just prediction fan so Avengers Endgame my notes here say there should be no

344
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:41,740
ewoks in Avengers Endgame yeah we'll see I'm really looking forward to that

345
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,700
movie I like a dark movie once in a while I liked Infinity War thought it

346
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:53,910
was very well done yeah they've done a good job hyping up Chris Evans hopefully

347
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,070
whatever the hell happens to Captain America meets up to the hype but of

348
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,630
course it won't we will get there a couple other notes from the three to

349
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:09,450
show you on Avengers one of the things so you've seen the trailer yes okay one

350
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:17,120
of the things that I am extremely curious to find out is how the hell at

351
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:22,890
man got out of the quantum room because the end of the the ended number two and

352
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:29,780
he's stuck there and then suddenly he shows up and the remaining Avengers

353
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:36,140
don't know how he did it so all right well we'll get there sure a few other

354
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:42,020
notes from the three Patrick Peryll test Pappy has no predictions but does

355
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,140
want to say thanks for the awesome episodes 2018 and looking forward to more

356
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:54,340
interesting discussions in 2019 thank you Patrick we will try and do that

357
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:00,780
Percy is jet-legged but he says his prediction is a growth on practical

358
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,570
illustrative examples on how to employ MT well sure I hope that happens too and

359
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:14,410
it is and and an increase in attacks against MT which I think I think that's a

360
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:18,690
valid and probably going to come true prediction as well I think I'm okay

361
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:26,940
with that I think both of those will come true I mean the first one's easy

362
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:36,670
we just had to have one and then it you know we have an increase growth so are

363
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:44,420
you ready for our own predictions that you haven't already shared you ready

364
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:50,580
yeah you have any so what do you think what what's gonna be new in 2019 one or

365
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,460
two things it has to be a lot of things but fire something out that as we know

366
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:03,370
from last year it's probably not gonna happen so one thing I will say is that

367
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:09,010
I will finally decide this year whether or not I will actually graduate matter

368
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:16,230
of fact I got to do that within days all right yeah that one's still a

369
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:23,660
tortured decision for me I kind of wish my personality type was a little bit if

370
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,140
I were closer to Alan's personality type I'm pretty sure this would be easy

371
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:41,840
what what personality type is that fabulous in this particular case it's an I

372
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:47,980
think actually you if you were in my shoes right you have one class left to

373
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,210
take on the degree I think that would be all you would need for a decision

374
00:38:52,210 --> 00:39:05,530
yeah yeah I'm a I'm a I'm a deep analyzer and so yes it's still a struggle

375
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:10,210
so well I'll discover what what I'll decide I don't know if I mentioned this

376
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,570
on the air but there's two things I want to mention on the air before we go on

377
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:19,550
one is one more reflection my favorite author Steven Johnson came out with a

378
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:24,530
new book this year it's called Far Sight it's about how to make how people

379
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,250
make decisions and not in the blink or the decisive blink with Malcolm Webwell

380
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,930
decisive the Heath brothers he looking at decisions to take a bunch of factors

381
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,490
that have that have outcomes that last years or decades or more so more of the

382
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:43,690
big decision-making kind of things very fat as usual fascinating read but your

383
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:49,170
thing on decisions reminded me of that the other thing I want to mention is we

384
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:53,130
haven't done a sponsor in a long time and we don't have this isn't a sponsor

385
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:59,080
but I do want to give a big shout out to the folks at hey taco we use this this

386
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:05,580
bot called hey taco in our in our slack group to it's a free currency to give

387
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:09,880
other people when they do things you like they pass out a taco you can give

388
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,720
away five tacos a day I love gamification of of promoting like

389
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:21,580
helping each other and sharing I think it's a great idea their cost after the

390
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:25,540
free trial was a little more than we could afford on our non our what's what's

391
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,380
not only nonprofit but operate at a loss podcast effort so they gave us a sweet

392
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,300
deal on continuing to use hey taco and so huge thanks to them it's really cool

393
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:41,500
if you got if you use slack in a professional setting that makes money you

394
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:47,660
I can't recommend it enough it's very cool stuff okay all that all that said I

395
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,380
wanted to give him a shout out I should have done earlier but I'll

396
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,320
probably mention them a lot throughout the year because they're awesome and

397
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,320
just really great experience talking to them and and using the product so very

398
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:07,290
excited I was quite saddened when I read your statement around hey they want

399
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:14,240
us to want us to pay for it because uh yeah once you once you get the taco

400
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,680
yeah tacos are great so tacos are around for a long time that's good okay

401
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,360
so and I even spent some amount of time looking through right how we could set

402
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:33,760
up the rewards on the tacos all right we'll get back to the world then what

403
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,440
are your predictions is we'll figure out something interesting to do with tacos

404
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:49,490
in 2019 sure that is marked all right what other predictions do you have as it

405
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:57,260
stands right now for me on the on the test front you know it's really hard for

406
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:04,420
for me to make a prediction on that one what I'm seeing in terms of momentum is

407
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:15,180
is sort of a polarization happening which I guess is standard I'll call it

408
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:22,620
the well we already have it the traditionalist and the modern testing is

409
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:34,390
right um will that conclude next year probably not but yeah so in terms of

410
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:39,310
Percy's prediction on more attacks yeah I agree on that one okay do you have any

411
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:48,840
predictions of your own yeah okay those would be good to get to so well I guess

412
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,040
there are more predictions I want to read but I'm afraid you'll comment at

413
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:58,860
length about them no let me just say in terms of in terms of data science stuff I

414
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:10,720
do think the democratization will absolutely continue and I do think we're

415
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:20,220
gonna see in the next year I think we're gonna see comments from the three around

416
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:30,760
actually using it to achieve test goals here what we see a listener basis you I

417
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:37,960
see a lot of people commenting on it and a lot of it's very theoretical I'll see I

418
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:47,200
think we'll see them actively using it and actively being successful okay anything

419
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,840
else no all right I want to throw out two quick predictions from Patrick Prel

420
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:57,120
that just came in moments ago and then I'll go on with mine the first one is

421
00:43:57,120 --> 00:44:01,400
probably they're both very unlikely number one Trump will not do something

422
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,840
extraneous extraordinarily stupid for two days in a row I can't see that happening

423
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,240
but you know you never know and number two is you'll love this one

424
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,720
ISTQB will come up with a certificate for the modern testing practitioner

425
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:23,200
imprints making a face so don't comment I don't I think probably that one is more

426
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,760
likely to happen than the first one can they do that with our license we don't

427
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,740
have yeah I guess I really know it's license we the principles are creative

428
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:37,650
common pay it forward that you have to attribute but yeah they could if they

429
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:46,740
want to they won't I think principle number seven is in would they'd have a

430
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,860
hard time with that one because they're a for-profit business on creating testing

431
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:57,970
specialists so yeah yeah be interesting if they did it

432
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,690
okay so my predictions I know I would work hard to make sure that doesn't

433
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:12,980
happen so I got got got I have talked a lot about moving my org towards modern

434
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:17,380
testing and how I am slowly but surely working myself out of a role but

435
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:24,100
hopefully not a job I think I'm on track in 2019 to actually work myself out of a

436
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:33,950
role so I will have a new role same job new role I don't know what that is yet

437
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:39,410
DevOps DevOps DevOps DevOps one thing to mention about DevOps is one of my

438
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:45,130
former test leads is now a DevOps lead and there are it was a no-brainer

439
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:52,710
striking similarities it is in this DevOps is of course a culture not a role

440
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,430
but you may be in a DevOps role to help move the team towards a DevOps culture

441
00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:01,430
which is what he's doing and I think we've said a very very very similar

442
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:08,970
thing about QA or test roles yeah unless you finish your predictions but

443
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,810
there's a lot of similarity there yeah so that will happen the other one was

444
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:22,300
test pappies number one prediction is not coming true that won't happen I vowed

445
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:31,370
took a I made a statement that I would not speak at conferences in 2019 and I

446
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:40,040
will say that will not be true but will be true is I will not speak at any

447
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:47,770
testing conferences in 2019 any even OTC test bash I'm not gonna speak at test

448
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:52,860
conferences in 2019 that's my prediction we'll see how what will

449
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:58,610
we'll come back and watch me do like 10 I'm kind of burned out on test

450
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,370
conferences I love test bash I'm burned out on many of the other ones and some

451
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:07,050
I will just there's some I just will not go back to it's too much of a

452
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:13,350
world I don't want to live in I am I could see you not going but especially

453
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,870
when we do test bash Seattle I'll have to go to that but that probably won't be

454
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:25,780
in 2019 I may given the right opportunity speak at a non testing conference but

455
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:29,660
we'll see I may it may just be there I speak at no conferences but if I do

456
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,700
speak at a conference it will not be a testing conference I guess is the actual

457
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:37,990
prediction yeah it's interesting that Lisa Crisp and I don't know if you've

458
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:46,940
been following this she's trying to speak at DevOps conferences no oh good

459
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,020
she's wondering how to how to break in because it's it's uh she's been rejected

460
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:58,940
apparently interesting but right I I do think that's gonna be a big mover I

461
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,390
think it's actually rather brilliant of Lisa to realize that that's where she

462
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:08,330
needs to go yeah for sure I don't know I haven't heard any statement around her

463
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:15,960
saying she's gonna stop doing test conferences but it does seem like it's a

464
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:24,580
thought process it's in her mind cool I also predict that Avengers Endgame will

465
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:30,690
be my favorite movie of 2019 I predict that the Seattle Sounders not Royal

466
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:34,630
Salt Lake salty gunner is a real Salt Lake fan

467
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:41,530
Seattle Saddles will return to the MLS Cup and win it in 20 between 19 yep and

468
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:45,430
what else what are the random predictions can I give to kind of screw

469
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:53,150
things up I'll do one last one last prediction for bread we will create a

470
00:48:53,150 --> 00:49:04,780
principle number eight holy crap okay I may reject one out of spite okay that's

471
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:11,850
it that's a bold prediction because I could see I will be as much as I like you

472
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:16,310
to get zero points in your predictions if there's a valid number eight of course

473
00:49:16,310 --> 00:49:24,700
no I I'm interesting I will not bring it up I'll leave it as a cliffhanger yes

474
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:36,380
but I believe I have found a key flaw that I think MT needs to address that

475
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,400
is cool all right I'm not even gonna ask you what that is on the air to find that

476
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,920
out you're going to have to listen to episode number 96 which will come out

477
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:55,290
sometime in January of 2019 all right I am Alan and he is Brent I took it from

478
00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:00,290
