00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,580
Hello again, howdy, hey, I'm Alan I'm brit and we're back with another episode of a B testing

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,670
Does it have a number are we up to?

3
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,830
87 we are

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:27,490
87 welcome to the 87th episode of a B testing if this is your first time listening to a B testing

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,650
Welcome, please go back to episode 80. You may want to back up

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:39,390
We've been diving into the modern testing principles on you can read those on modern testing org

7
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,550
We've been spending this is our sixth episode going through the seven principles will hit the

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,270
the last one in two weeks, but this podcast in general is your

9
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:58,010
guide your gateway your information Center for a lot of things about software testing a lot of software engineering

10
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,870
Quality and of course the aforementioned modern testing. Yes

11
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:11,950
It's all that so that's the plan for today if you'll hit the fast-forward button now you can avoid our chit chat or

12
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,390
Since we don't work together anymore. This is our chance to catch up, too

13
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,270
So what's new with you? Mr. Jensen? Oh

14
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,830
The biggest thing that's new is

15
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,510
Baseball seasons over

16
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,900
Not for the professionals for your children. I assume yeah from my son although that reminds me

17
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,070
I need to sign them up for a fall ball. I keep forgetting that you want to stop and write yourself a note. Yeah, he actually

18
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,230
Totally going to do that

19
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,290
Like yeah, cuz if I miss the date

20
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,100
let's see

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,280
Okay, then yeah, talk some amongst yourselves the Bellevue which is also called the Seattle

22
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,220
Unity office because outside of the Seattle area. No one knows where Bellevue is. We are

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,080
moving offices we are vastly outgrown both the

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,480
Physical space and power and AC limits of our current space so

25
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:19,040
Another month or two and we'll finally be in our new spot pretty excited about that. It'll be pretty and nice. Where you going?

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:27,440
Six blocks away. We're going to Lincoln Square South. Oh, okay again for the locals everybody else like shut up and talk about modern testing

27
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,660
Lincoln's is that the same building you used to be? No, no South it's

28
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,060
Three blocks south on the it's the newer one that went up on the corner of fourth and Bellevue way again more local trivia

29
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,820
Okay, we'll move on here has a lot of restaurants

30
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:48,460
Had they put anything into that Toys R Us yet? No the toys our s space is still available

31
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:55,300
Okay, so anyway, so anyway, I thought I'd just cuz I was thinking about it on the way to work

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,620
I have a bit of a

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,620
Where is the weasel update? Oh?

34
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm I mean I'm at the I was I was waiting for the song but oh we'll come back to that

35
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,860
We'll go back to that, but you weren't done. I forgot that you just took a pause to

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Write notes on your phone so that I can read that we now return to a quick update from

37
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,340
Brent Jensen yes, so the the next biggest thing that's happening is

38
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,180
So my oldest has been home for the summer

39
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:35,300
He's got an apartment where he's he's gonna move into his apartment on Saturday in Pullman in Pullman

40
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,210
He's already pre-warned

41
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:45,170
Things like he may not be home next summer. He may not come home for Thanksgiving

42
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,730
So I actually think even though he's not willing to say this and he may not know but just because you know

43
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,250
I've gone through the college experience. I actually think this is

44
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,530
It I think this is him actually moving out

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,200
That's congratulations on a successful early launch

46
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Yeah

47
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,160
It I I hope I hope I and all of our listeners with children have the same experience with all of our kids

48
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
Yeah, no, I don't think I'm gonna have this same. No I can't wait. I can't wait to get rid of them

49
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,920
Move out they're obviously not avid listeners to the podcast

50
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,000
No, but they have heard me tell them that as soon as as soon as the younger one goes to college that

51
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,680
The house is being sold immediately and we're not leaving a forwarding address just a PO box

52
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,100
That's you know that's not a bad strategy

53
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,350
But you can mitigate it. Just you know if you if you'd like where you live you know just change the locks

54
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,590
Thought about that thought about that, but I think it's better just to actually I don't like

55
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,990
The house is fun. I like the house. It's a nice house is beautiful

56
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,270
I am I have not adapted well to suburbia

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:10,000
We became suburban to get the kids in better schools and all that but I I would like

58
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
Living this cookie-cutter house. It's nice

59
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,360
And it's big in the three-car garage and lots of room and have a huge home office

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,720
And it's awesome a great place for a dog and everything that's cool, but I

61
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
I

62
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,320
Suburbia takes attacks on me

63
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,040
I need I need a neighborhood or a building with character that sometimes only a more urban

64
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Environment can provide yeah

65
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,630
You and I are so far apart there. I can't even see you from where I'm saying

66
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,390
I want a house with so many acres. I don't even don't even know which direction my neighbors are

67
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,870
Yeah, that actually would be pretty sweet

68
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,670
Yeah

69
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,170
Yeah, not cool for me not cool for me

70
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,330
I want to go outside and run naked in my prairie. Oh god you that God confidence

71
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,750
Could you move to Russia and do that?

72
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,640
No, okay. I don't want that happening within a thousand miles of me

73
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,500
Too late

74
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:21,460
All right, so yeah, so that's that's a that's a big deal and then the next thing that I'm

75
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,460
So school should start back up for me on August 20 you get a finally finish

76
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,050
You didn't go for it get the home stretch done

77
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,320
You know

78
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,970
I'll just I'll just submit to everyone on there. I just don't

79
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
Want to do it?

80
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,820
I want to be done with this thing and I don't want to do one final burst of pain

81
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,400
but yeah, so I'm kind of

82
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,660
Constantly flipping that coin in the air and picking it up and re-flipping and picking it up and re-flipping

83
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,940
Yeah, it's it is the last time but the idea of

84
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,470
Going through another four months of all of my nights and weekends

85
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,660
gone

86
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:24,740
No pain no gain. Yeah, but I am thinking first you've already got most of the game. I am yeah, I've gotten all of the game

87
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,100
That's the other thing too is I'm so wired for for return on investment

88
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,580
right yeah, I am too old I am too old and

89
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:45,330
Not from the the weariness part, but I'm at a stage in my career no one will actually care

90
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,500
About this degree the only reason to do it is to be done

91
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,620
It's not gonna get me a job in the future

92
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:02,110
Right. Gotcha. It's not it's it's I've gotten what I wanted out of it. Yeah

93
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,670
Anyway, there you go. So

94
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,830
School may start for me in August. It may also start for me in January

95
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,460
All right. We'll see how I will finish

96
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,080
I have six years from the start to finish

97
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,000
And I still think I have five or six semester starts left

98
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:33,450
Alright, excellent. That's now I'm done. Okay a quick update of my fall travel schedule because it just got a little ridiculous

99
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,050
In fact, I just in fact, I haven't sent the mail. I just made the choice last night

100
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:44,450
To turn down I almost went to a conference in November because in Korea and I really wanted to go there

101
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,790
But there's too much else going on. I'm heading off to Iceland next week

102
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:57,350
Shouldn't that next week? No, not the week after and then in October. I thought I was going someplace in September end of September

103
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,290
Very beginning of October over that weekend heading down to Anaheim to give a workshop at Star West

104
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,850
popping back up north be home for about four days heading down to Portland for a couple days to

105
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,290
Give a talk on modern testing and also a workshop at

106
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,850
PNS QC which is one of my favorite conferences

107
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,170
I think the size and caliber of presentations is usually pretty good. So I'm excited about that in

108
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,030
Later in October. No. Yeah later in October. I'm home for like two weeks and then I'm going to

109
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,770
Copenhagen and Helsinki on a work trip

110
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:38,700
Home for about three more weeks and heading to Sweden for a week for a work trip and that should close out the weasel

111
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,860
2018 travel schedule I would have had to shove that two more weeks later hit that Korea trip

112
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,700
But I was like that's I think it's enough. So doing that

113
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:56,300
So shall we you have a sub in Korea or is that a no? No, the Korea trip was a conference

114
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,620
request speaking speaking request

115
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,550
And I thought about doing it because I actually I am trying to

116
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,840
not

117
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,360
speak at any test conferences in

118
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,080
2019 I may speak at

119
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,080
Given the right opportunity. I'm trying to get out of

120
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,130
If I've talked to you about this before I want to get out of the test. I

121
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:29,050
Want to get out of the test conference speaking except for rare occasions. I will always speak at ministry test because it's like

122
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:36,210
The test batches because they're really good and the audience actually gets it. It's it's a proper audience. But I

123
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,410
I think I want to

124
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,450
If I do more speaking I will do it more at

125
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,160
Development center conferences. I think that's where my mind and content is is what improving

126
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,480
software quality through better engineering and development practices

127
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,520
so I think I may start focusing more there when I speak and just speaking a lot less in general because

128
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:04,560
It's fun and it's great and people clap at you and they ask you questions. You feel all validated and stuff, but

129
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,750
I think I want to focus my efforts elsewhere. I think I think that makes sense

130
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,990
based on my

131
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,970
My knowledge of you and your passions. I think you're done

132
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,520
Sort of teaching testers how to test

133
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,860
Yeah, right exactly. It's kind of not where we're going with modern testing

134
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,640
I think it makes sense to start you going through and say okay

135
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
No, we need to start teaching devs how to test

136
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,720
Although I don't I think that may be premature quite honestly like I would suggest to you

137
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,190
that

138
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:49,590
No, there's still value in you going to the test conferences and teaching testers how to lead

139
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:56,270
I think yes, but I'm gonna do that selectively test leadership conference in the one I did in New York

140
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,630
That has some validity to it test bash as I mentioned before

141
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,990
like an agile testing conference I could do but

142
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,470
Again, I'm gonna be much more selective. I'm I'm

143
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
I am done talking to

144
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,120
Junior testers about how to get started in testing and test careers and all that stuff

145
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,480
I want to help I and I think a

146
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,640
Lot of what we need to do with testing is about

147
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,640
Being a modern tester and someone just asked me on Twitter Jim Holmes. Hey Jim about

148
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
Give a description of what it's like to be a modern tester. I like given the tautology answer of

149
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,120
Well, actually it says no such thing as a modern tester

150
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,560
But we do recognize I spoke for you. So we do recognize that

151
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:46,870
Someone who leads the team towards following modern testing principles. I'm okay with calling them a modern tester

152
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,800
Yeah, it's a leadership position and it's a position that I am happily grooming

153
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,640
Most are all people in my team towards I mean they're they are

154
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:03,000
Whether they know about modern testing principles or not. They're all kind of in a modern testing role right now

155
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:11,480
In terms of like the the tipping point I I I don't think we're done here on this topic

156
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,070
until

157
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,640
We get a sufficient amount of the test community

158
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,930
to understand that

159
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:28,480
The content after the semi-colon in principle 7 is not only a good thing

160
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,100
But something they should be working towards. Yeah, I want to walk

161
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:36,580
Yeah, there is a lot of fear and people see it as it's like the controversial part and we'll talk will

162
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,300
We're all the good time talking about that in our next recording. Yep

163
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:50,380
But yeah, yeah, I think so. All right, so we do this week. Yes, we shall we shall and let me start let me start by

164
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,540
Saying that I slapped I don't know if I CC'd you on this or not

165
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,860
Maybe I mentioned it in slack

166
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,060
But I did slap a creative commons attribution share like license on the modern testing principles

167
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,900
To encourage people like it's totally yeah do whatever you want with them. It's so people have asked like can we copy these?

168
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,060
Can we translate these? Yes attribute the source and do whatever you want change them for your team

169
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,180
If you want attribute the source, it's totally fun

170
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:17,880
Took out the middle man. No longer need to ask just the licenses there follow along

171
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:25,540
I would be careful about changing for the team though, right? Some people could change it and turn it into something and that supports

172
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,140
Traditional then it will yeah, it wouldn't really be modern testing anymore

173
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,860
It says that would attribute the original they would go. Oh, okay, you've you've changed this

174
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,620
There's a license give us the right to tell somebody to take it down if we discovered

175
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:46,860
No, I don't want that. I want people if somebody wants to bastardize. I don't think they're going to I am a truster

176
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,900
All right. I'm a truster and an enabler

177
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,540
Maybe that last doesn't sound right. Okay, let me read to you modern testing principle number six. Oh my god

178
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,020
It's been so long since the podcast started. It's about freaking time. Okay

179
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:09,450
Number six we use data. Um, he thought I was gonna start didn't you you can read these at modern testing org

180
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:17,130
number six we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and then close the gaps between

181
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,590
product hypothesis and business

182
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,450
What does that mean? Well, we'll dive into a deeper

183
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,370
Give it to me

184
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,370
How would you

185
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,410
Paraphrase that back to me. What does that mean? We do or and we meaning teams following modern testing principles or teams

186
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,250
delivering software in this way

187
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,970
Why is

188
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,670
Actually, let's talk about why why is this important?

189
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,700
Before I go on to that, that's a great question and we will get to it

190
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,950
I want to read you a tweet

191
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,630
that that I

192
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,140
Don't know how I got it

193
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,470
Follower of a follower of something and I'm gonna tell you

194
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,440
This is relevant. Okay. Okay. I am listening to your tweet reading

195
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:18,240
exploratory testing is

196
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
the key to high quality software

197
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,300
semicolon a highly intellectual and

198
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,060
time-consuming activity

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,170
Often pushed off to end users. How do you feel about this tweet it?

200
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:44,190
And again, it's relevant. It is relevant and I had a similar tweet

201
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:52,200
Exchange that just to continue on this morning about the same topic it reeks of ignorance

202
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:59,370
To me. I am NOT first. I am NOT against exploratory testing total value in that

203
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:05,250
Using data to understand customer usage and to close the gaps and monitoring etc

204
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,770
Has nothing to do with shoving buggy software on to customers because you don't give a shit about them

205
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:16,960
And there is a and I'm gonna get on my soap boxes. I'm pissed off about this because there are people in the industry

206
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Some with loud voices who tweet about the new tweet saying that or speak saying that

207
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,800
Having customers, you know letting customers find bugs even if they're not actually finding them directly

208
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,480
It's monitoring that's revealing these things is a horrible thing and it's lazy

209
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,320
I had I saw one author. I can't call him an author one article writer

210
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Because in the internet, I guess everyone's an author

211
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,080
I had an article where they mentioned testing and production as a last quote

212
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:54,520
Maybe I'm quote me. I'm not quoting but as a last gasp resort to find bugs using the customers as testers

213
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,310
so so anyway, that's why you triggered me because I see a

214
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:09,030
very big lack of understanding on how to use monitoring how to use data and how freaking valuable it is done, right and

215
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:15,370
They think it's just this lazy thing teams do because they don't want to do testing where that's not the case at all

216
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,190
Was that the answer you wanted or did I kind of go?

217
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,070
close

218
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,070
You know if if

219
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,430
If this

220
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,930
Tweeter

221
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:38,900
Had not used the words pushed off to end users. I would have had no problem. I

222
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,120
Actually, I totally agree with the first half of that. I mean again to be cool. Yeah, anyway

223
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,730
I'm gonna I'm gonna you talk I'm gonna breathe. Okay, it is not pushed off the end users

224
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,540
So the the principal talks about validating the hypothesis

225
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,410
Actually the way we word it is better than the way I'm remembering how we worded

226
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,340
We close the gaps between the product hypothesis and the business impact. What does that mean?

227
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
means when we wrote code

228
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,240
We had a theory around what is valuable to be clear

229
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,480
We had a hypothesis

230
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,850
Right. Yeah, right. Well, I'll just say yes, right?

231
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,530
Well, no, I'm a data scientist in my world

232
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,330
Hypothesis is overloaded but I'll just say yes because it's not worth going into but

233
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,000
There are for the record I win. Yes

234
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,770
We have talked about this before in that is

235
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:44,660
the problem with ET

236
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:48,370
Now is it the key to high quality software?

237
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,140
Probably now, but they're saying exploratory testing

238
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,860
Okay, if this is something that's pushed off to an end user

239
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,820
Then I'm gonna say it's not exploratory testing anymore. It's actually this clever thing that we call

240
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,300
using the product

241
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,290
Now when a customer is using the product, is it highly intellectual? Maybe

242
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,680
Now I will say most products if it require highly intellectual

243
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:28,130
You probably have a usability problem like customers don't want to have to think too hard to get their solution solved

244
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,360
the time-consuming activity I also have a problem with a

245
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,460
traditionalist point of view is we try to

246
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:46,220
We try to prevent harm to the customer and we see it as as us

247
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,860
Again, it kind of is like the the champions the champions of quality slide that I keep referring to that Alan has produced

248
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,300
Right. We're a superhero team. Why are we letting that poor pregnant pregnant mom?

249
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:09,500
Take the bullet instead of us. We should be doing it. That's not actually the reality

250
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,960
today, I will let me share a

251
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:20,800
Story and then I'm gonna go into a lot more on the the what why and how after you do you share your story?

252
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
We'll comment actually have another tweet thread

253
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:30,770
Highly related. I want to read to you. Okay, so we should do a whole episode of Alan and Brent read tweets

254
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,490
No, actually would be fun

255
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,570
I'm already vetoing the idea. Anyway, go on story time. All right

256
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,400
it was my last week and bing and

257
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:50,510
I'm sorry. I need to interrupt just for the the new listeners Bing is like Google. All right, go on

258
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,360
All right, but Bing Bing Google's things really well, it's fine. It works

259
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,200
moving on

260
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,720
It was my last my last week in Bing

261
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,840
my

262
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,560
Executive had set up in all hands on the Wednesday and we had

263
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,840
We had an individual from a partner team come in

264
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:26,480
And they did a presentation because we had worked we had done a co-development project with that team and it and

265
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,620
Finally shipped it well

266
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,100
It was best essentially shipping a Bing app in in the Windows Store

267
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,700
at the same time

268
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,080
Google

269
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,480
Was shipping an app into the Windows Store?

270
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,090
in and this person told a story about

271
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,970
about how

272
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,810
We finally got this thing across the wire

273
00:22:53,170 --> 00:23:00,930
and one of the things that they owned producing was a sort of a documentation on how to streamline and get things into

274
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:03,800
the ecosystem and

275
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,960
They decided to produce us a slide deck around what not to do now

276
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,620
they decided to use the Google app as an example because

277
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:25,420
a month prior when they were first onboarding the Google app, they went through and they just found bugs everywhere and

278
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,160
Much like I think this individual

279
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,250
Would have done is just mocked how crappy the software was

280
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,140
There were just bugs and bugs and bugs

281
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,440
everywhere in the Google app, okay, so

282
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,840
I

283
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Again fast forward a month later

284
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,320
She's she's producing the streamline thing and she wants to get screenshots of what not to do

285
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,420
so she's like aha, I will load the Google app and

286
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:05,600
She loaded it. It of course had updated by that time and she failed to find

287
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,740
any of the bugs

288
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,510
that she had found earlier and

289
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,060
She she actually commented on

290
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,820
Yeah, it was amazing how how quick

291
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:29,070
they were I do not understand how they did that and I pulled her aside and I said

292
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,800
That is why Windows is having a problem

293
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,160
The traditional point of view when you're in a world where you have a lot of software in

294
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,940
your reaction time

295
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,830
Like when you and I grew up in this company in this company

296
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:52,000
Windows shipped every three years

297
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,040
Everything shipped every three years, right? You did not you had to get it right the first time

298
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,580
Did we ever?

299
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:07,890
No, do we have any idea of how much we got it right the first time that didn't matter

300
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,770
We have some like a

301
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:18,210
Episode or two ago. I talked about kin right that was last time. Yeah, that was a traditionalist

302
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,230
That started off in a traditionalist model

303
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,130
Right and it was an unsuccessful product

304
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,990
right

305
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,270
Would the company like to have had?

306
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,910
That time and that development money back you bet

307
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:46,050
We talked multiple occasions about lean startup and the metric that matters and the decision to pivot and persevere

308
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:54,270
This is what data brings to the party data

309
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,250
allows you to

310
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:04,810
Understand what parts of your product is being used

311
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,930
What parts of the product isn't being used?

312
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:16,090
And it allows you to scale the team by focusing your limited resources on

313
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:19,930
The parts of the product that matter. Yes

314
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,160
Yes. Yes

315
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
there is a

316
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,520
12 minute answer to your question. Why?

317
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:33,490
Data is critical to scale now

318
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:38,730
If you combine these with the other principles, right?

319
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:45,330
So this the the individual I was talking about before was amazed that she couldn't find any of the bugs in Google

320
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,370
Right. I'm not

321
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,410
Because I know Google instruments the crap out of everything

322
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,070
They worked through

323
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:02,370
When they saw errors coming in I know because I interviewed with Google years ago

324
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Right. They have a two-week release cycle. They go to or at least back then. I don't know what they do today

325
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,740
Yeah, and again not Google in general says Google apps

326
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,900
Mobile apps in this case. No, but this was this was this was the Google philosophy all up

327
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
I don't know if it is still today

328
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,630
but back then

329
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,490
What they did is after the initial release they had

330
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:30,590
They would have an individual or team of individuals after the release

331
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,150
They didn't start working on the next features

332
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:40,430
They the after their release the deep dove into the telemetry and go what is the problem that we have now?

333
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:43,520
they're even smarter right because they

334
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,410
they follow the practice of

335
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:57,030
Continuous integration which means the number of bugs so you you you do end up shipping bugs

336
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,940
But when you do continuous integration you have as long as you have the right monitoring in place

337
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,500
As long as you have the right telemetry you end up turning around and fixing that bug the next day

338
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,500
I think that's the piece that's missing from the mindset of people who see it as pushing things off

339
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Quick story on data then I want to read a tweet stream to you is

340
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:25,080
When I worked on the project that I refer to as a stupid science project to make Android app. Yeah, my windows phone

341
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,780
We had an offshore team of five maybe testers who?

342
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,940
We just gave them who would test apps just

343
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:39,220
Various Android apps they'd load on they'd side load onto windows phone

344
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,980
They'd run them reporting about they found so we could figure out what was up with our system

345
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:49,410
It got to a point to very very quickly where we said actually just stop entering bugs

346
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,580
Run the scripts overnight because we knew from the data every morning when we come into work exactly what bugs they hit

347
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,700
We knew where every single incompatibility was yep

348
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:04,380
It was faster for us to look at the data and figure out what the problem was and dive in and and fix the bug if we could

349
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:12,540
Then it was for them to enter the bug report. Oh, this is I know we have talked about this on multiple times on

350
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,000
Before we actually even started talking about modern testing, right?

351
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,040
It is absolutely my belief that the best way for testers right now to write automation is

352
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:32,240
Write the automation as low generators. Yes, and you their validation from the product telemetry

353
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,520
Let the telemetry be the Oracle

354
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,200
Yes

355
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,960
And I've always said in fact this may even be in how it does offer at Microsoft the Oracle is the hardest part to write

356
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,620
The part that figures out whether the test pastor failed let the telemetry figure out what's going on

357
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:52,260
Yeah, it's much easier because what I often ended up doing was but I remember having a whiteboard conversation in

358
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,860
1997 to discuss whether I could use get pixel to test set pixel and

359
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,100
I thought and what I ended up

360
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,620
You know taught at least whiteboarding would never doing was we whiteboard it out basically an implement a new

361
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:10,780
implementation of get pixel to test set pixel and and luckily even in my

362
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,300
Niamhiti was smart enough to think that was stupid

363
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,730
And you know why?

364
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,770
Because it was stupid. Yes, because it

365
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:23,850
Exactly, let me read you this is actually it's interesting you brought up that tweet because

366
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:27,730
To read to me because I don't know if you saw this tweet for me last week

367
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,920
Or I said I did see something relevant

368
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,480
Just because a team relies on customer data to understand or evaluate customer value or quality

369
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,960
It doesn't mean that the team is relying on that customer to test the product

370
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,470
To the people who keep saying the quota part of that sentence, which is the last part stop saying that then someone said

371
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:52,750
Analytics are great, but they don't reduce the need to verify correct system under test behavior before shipping

372
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:56,910
Unless your software doesn't matter much to people like a free game on your phone

373
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,660
And I said actually in a lot of cases example web services

374
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:08,140
It's much more efficient if my monitors detect changes and reject new code appropriately than if I took the time to verify correct

375
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,540
Behavior before shipping. Yeah, and

376
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:15,140
The reply I got back was how is it more efficient to break customers?

377
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:20,780
All the information is available to you before shipping. You just have to look and be smart about looking

378
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,220
what services do you ship broken and

379
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,530
All kinds of the point I want to focus on there is no you

380
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:34,590
Have all the information available to you you you don't know how the customer is gonna use your product

381
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,870
You could never know that and to quote Eric Reese

382
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,430
Show me a product that ships zero bugs and I'll show you a product that shipped far too late

383
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:50,200
Brent we will not be able to show Eric Reese a product that shipped with zero bugs

384
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
number one period

385
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,800
right

386
00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:03,720
I'm sorry even even you know the simplest stupid tic-tac-toe app. I can guarantee you it shipped with bugs

387
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:08,380
right the and the reason why and

388
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,080
I'm bet you the developer knew it

389
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,340
The reason why is because they made a decision these bugs don't matter oh

390
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,890
Oh my god, really shipping a bug

391
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:26,950
So the Google thing so here's the secret here's the secret

392
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:35,400
customers want their problems solved and they want the least amount of time spent on

393
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,670
friction due to bugs

394
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,630
Okay, so code paths that customers don't use

395
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,270
Guess what they don't care. It's not shipping a bug

396
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:59,670
It does not mean the customer is broken. I know I know I know this reminds me actually I gave them presentation on metrics

397
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:05,710
Well at least ten years ago if not longer and one of the joke slides. I made was a

398
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:11,350
This is back when product is I can tell how old it was because remember had a mock-up of a product box

399
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,910
when used to buy software in boxes yep, and

400
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:21,150
For the bullet points in like bullet points of features like you know twice as fast as our competition

401
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:27,650
Whatever I wrote like a bunch of stuff customers don't care about like over 20,000 test cases run

402
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,640
76% code coverage

403
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:37,960
No customers don't give a crap about that stop thinking that customers give a shit about your testing effort

404
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,200
They don't they don't care about your testing effort. They want their problem solved

405
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:47,680
Yes, God and just get out of the mindset. I don't know why people think that

406
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:52,030
Again, this was ten years ago back then when tests last

407
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,390
Software and functional test teams were much more common still they didn't customers

408
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:01,430
Don't care what the testing effort was as long as the software

409
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:06,350
Allows them to solve their problems without making them want to throw their computer against the wall

410
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,710
Yeah

411
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:14,750
Right the reason why in the old days we would do all of this testing upfront is

412
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:22,020
Because we didn't have the ability to react right today. We do right we had we would wait

413
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,320
I mean the ability to react was wait for the bug reports to come in from the enterprise customers

414
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
And then eventually build a service pack

415
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,290
Right or a hot fix. Oh, yeah, if important a hot fix

416
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,910
me um

417
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,830
and

418
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:41,310
Here what I'm essentially saying is

419
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:45,180
Treat every release as a hot fix

420
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,400
Yeah

421
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,840
the

422
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:55,440
Ship frequently ship small look at the data to to describe to you where to go next

423
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,720
Let's get back on track here. I see you referring to your notes. So we're of one mind

424
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:07,430
So the angry part is over for now. So the key it start no, no, no the key why is

425
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,840
The data tells you where to focus. Yes

426
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,220
Yeah, and as we've talked about many times before

427
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:25,360
Speed is what's important in today's world. Mm-hmm. If you want to compete you need speed now

428
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,720
caveat just like everything else

429
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,020
We're saying this is the general rule

430
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,100
There are exceptions

431
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,770
Right even even in your current product, whatever it may be

432
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:42,850
There's going to be a set of

433
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,930
Hey

434
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,930
even in a small

435
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:54,930
Flight environment like with continuous integration you're shipping the prod constantly. I still recommend flight rings

436
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:02,230
Where you're looking at monitors and then you you you then slowly widen the number of customers that can get it

437
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,390
Let's move on and talk about a little about a little looking at the clock

438
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,430
What is how does the modern tester lead a team to do this? Like like, how do you?

439
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,270
How do you make your team use data in a way that that?

440
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:24,180
Closes gaps. So we we did episode 82. Yes, and that was actually a good prequel

441
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,220
So at this point you could pause go from the 82 and go. Oh, that's a good idea

442
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,060
Huh, so the how is actually covered really well in 82 you're right. It is in terms of

443
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,740
evaluating

444
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,320
Your your your product hypotheses and the in

445
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,320
That's what's important like we would rather

446
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,320
Test focus on how to improve the business

447
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,160
How to improve let's say the value or the revenue of the business

448
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:58,460
Rather than what they're accustomed to which is how to reduce the cost. Okay, but that said

449
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,560
You know

450
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,060
I don't know that any test team would ever do this. I think it would be really freakin smart for test teams to do this

451
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,020
But then so once their product ships, so let's say they want to go through and do the prescriptive and preventative testing model

452
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,230
once

453
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,430
Now go back and look at the data and

454
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:29,760
Try to evaluate how much of your time was wasted. How much of your time? Did you spend testing enough?

455
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,750
Testing a feature that got three users

456
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:42,670
still, you know go look at the place that got a thousand users and see what problems they're having because

457
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:49,870
That's probably what's more important. But if you go back and you go what miss if you take the product telemetry and say hey

458
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,230
Where did the

459
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,510
So but let's pretend well, you actually you're a test director. Okay, so

460
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,180
Our quality director

461
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,780
So yeah, cuz I don't care about testing. I care about quality. Yes

462
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,500
so but you still and I don't know if it's changed but as of

463
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,040
What was it a year ago when I came and presented to your team?

464
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:19,900
Right you had testers sure. Okay from a management point of view

465
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,610
You're accountable

466
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:27,890
For where your team invests its time. Yes

467
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,420
I

468
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:37,120
Your philosophy is to sort of delegate those decisions, but ultimately you hold the accountability

469
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:42,320
Like because you made a decision to delegate those decisions. Sure. I'll not disagree

470
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:48,900
It'd be worthwhile to go. Okay, where did your investments pay off?

471
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,280
Right. It's a few had a month-long test pass that was scheduled

472
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,380
I

473
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,380
Just I just threw up all over the conference room

474
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,940
It's hyphen never never again in my life. Would I do something like that? How dare you even mention that? Yeah, you may continue

475
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,340
All right. It's worthwhile looking at the data and then

476
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:19,220
Okay, so maybe maybe you're gonna go done down this this this path, right? Maybe we've opened your eyes a little bit to

477
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,940
Hey, there is a better smarter way

478
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,400
Maybe you're in a position where you're like, hey, how do I convince my executives?

479
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,540
Right the data helps you make this transition as well

480
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:37,220
You go look, you know what? I don't think this is the right way. I don't think this is the efficient way

481
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:43,820
For us to deliver quality software. I think we need to get continuous integration going

482
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,780
I think we need to get I did the data

483
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,430
right

484
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,910
This month-long test pass cost our business

485
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,990
Depending on the size of business like it wouldn't be uncommon and

486
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:03,470
For a month-long test pass that costs well over a million dollars just in payroll let alone the hardware costs

487
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,900
right and

488
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,880
Look, we got three customer clicks on this feature

489
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:15,210
Right. I don't think we're using our resources efficiently

490
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,920
The other thing is

491
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,980
Customer it is

492
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,000
not

493
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,020
true that

494
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:32,500
Shipping bucks of customers is breaking the customer

495
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:38,740
It is also not true that it's a violation of some unwritten test law

496
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:46,140
Also true in in the modern testing thing we want devs to be held accountable for code correctness

497
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,100
We want QA to be held accountable for the quality culture

498
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,900
and the delivery of quality and

499
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:03,420
It is definitely not the case that if is I could see someone responding to this effect is like

500
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,420
Hey, if just one customer hits the bug

501
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:11,200
Then it's a big, you know catastrophic problem

502
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:21,330
Catastrophic problems are things like customer does something and it deletes their data store. Mm-hmm, right or it corrupts their OS or

503
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,210
It publishes their credit card

504
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,400
Numbers to the dark web. These are

505
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,040
catastrophes and you

506
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:37,120
It is absolutely true that you should still continue to prevent though that type of code from going up into the wild

507
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,840
But a lot of the times the the product hypothesis is wrong. We've we have talked on multiple occasions

508
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,440
that

509
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:55,590
Who values your product often isn't even like in a v1 situation. This is very often the case who values your product is

510
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,790
Often not the customer you're targeting

511
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:05,740
Yeah, and again for the third time probably on this podcast will refer you the chapter 8 of the lean startup

512
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:12,420
With the pivot or persevere chapter with all the different kinds of pivots you may make based on what you learn from your customer

513
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,420
About how they use the product you learn from the data

514
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:26,100
Who your customers really are and what's important to them? Sure completely agree now going into

515
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,620
Into data I'll add

516
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,460
You know one one caveat

517
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:40,420
Right once you go into the data, there's a whole rich rural infrastructure on on this right privacy

518
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:47,160
You can go too far. I think once you start getting into the data world. I think we need to start talking about ethics

519
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
Yeah, right

520
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,830
We want from a quality world we want to

521
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,420
benefit the business by making our customers happier

522
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,100
doing things with the data that they generate that

523
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:14,140
If they knew about it wouldn't make them happier is a likely ethical problem

524
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,020
Yeah

525
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,780
But there are other requirements and then we know you know we

526
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,300
GDPR

527
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,500
Government requirements. So going into the data space does come with its own

528
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,020
bureaucracy

529
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:38,300
But it is vastly better particularly when you combine it with the other principles we talked about the theory of constraints

530
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:45,100
continuous integration it ends up being a less risky in a much better way of

531
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,320
of

532
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,600
building product quality. Mm-hmm. Let me our

533
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,680
Conversation so far reflects a lot on web services

534
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,240
Now we can ship multiple times a day and get this data very quickly and hypothesis driven

535
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,720
I want to talk a little bit about how these things apply to

536
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
slower

537
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,920
Shipped products. I don't think there's much of anything that ships every three years anymore

538
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,440
No, but if you're a product that ships I mean there is

539
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Download fatigue from customers even with apps that they're seeing

540
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:24,040
updates every day for your app, although it can happen in an area in if you're having some bad bugs coming in but

541
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,200
There's a level of fatigue or ship

542
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:37,650
There's a level of download fatigue users can go through. So aside from that let's say you're gonna ship your product every two months

543
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,180
Two weeks. It's okay every two weeks. Thank you

544
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,130
You may

545
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:50,850
Have a brand new feature you want to get out because customers really need this and it's really easy for people to

546
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:58,540
Sort of hand wave around solving a customer problem by just saying a customer asked for this. They gotta have it

547
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:02,060
I gotta get into I'm gonna ship it and I say great ship it to them

548
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:06,780
Do you have how do you know if they're going to like it? We're gonna call them and ask them

549
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:13,430
Yeah, I would say if you're shipping every two weeks or especially if you're shipping everything

550
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:14,390
three months

551
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:20,170
But if you're going to ship something new because you think it solves a customer problem

552
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:24,530
You better damn well have the data to help you figure that out

553
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:31,950
I think what you may not be able to so on the data front, right? Sure call the customer. That's the data point

554
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:38,870
Another common thing is is either a proactive or a reactive survey

555
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:45,550
Sure, just understand that both of these things are considered to be very low quality data

556
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,750
Yes, and the point I'm getting to is

557
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:56,110
Sure, all this stuff works in a lot of the examples you see from talks on the internet and articles are around shipping web services

558
00:45:56,110 --> 00:46:00,790
Or websites things that can ship and update where you can react very very quickly

559
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:06,790
But the point I want to make is even if you have something that can't react very very quickly

560
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:14,150
You still need to use your better serve to rely on that data to help you understand

561
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,790
much much more about

562
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:19,370
customer usage customer quality customer experience

563
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,990
Right and the other thing is I find

564
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,450
we started the podcast off with this sort of concept and I find that people take a

565
00:46:29,550 --> 00:46:34,430
Take a strong stand on on a principle basis. So for example

566
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:39,900
You know shipping bugs to customers is you know, apparently

567
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,380
Just natively evil, right?

568
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:53,700
But even if you're in the situation where you where you only ship once every three months

569
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,040
That doesn't mean you have to accept

570
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:06,190
That that's the way it should be the next time we ship right? There are always ways to improve this

571
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,870
so for example, I I my phone is

572
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,100
an Android and

573
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,180
I've noticed that there are two different sort of update models. There is the

574
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:27,220
There there appears to be a model where an app will indicate it needs to be updated and

575
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:32,140
Android will will just silently handle that update for me

576
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:38,900
But there also appears to be a model where the app itself you launch the app and it says

577
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:47,280
Hey, I need to be updated and it didn't signal to the Google app management system

578
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
To do the update for me

579
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:52,530
right am

580
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,990
that in place app that in app update

581
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:03,230
That irritates me it should right the one where the app or the

582
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:09,470
Update happens, maybe you tell me after the update that hey I updated right

583
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:14,640
I got that one of these this morning said 14 apps were updated. So you're all cool. Yeah, then my

584
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,580
But then for me it seems like four out of five of the times I have to do the in app update

585
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:28,020
It's then a Wi-Fi required. Oh, I haven't and actually I've never seen that one. So

586
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,860
I would imagine it happens when the app needs an update, but the Google Store hasn't

587
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,100
propagated the update yet

588
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:43,990
Yeah, so in that particular case if I were an app developer and let's say it was Google's problem if it wasn't Google's problem

589
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,030
Then I would I would be looking at our code and going okay

590
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:55,470
How do we make it Google's problem because it is a better user experience in my humble opinion to just let Google manage the updates

591
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:03,010
but if it if it is already Google problem and so maybe

592
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:09,270
Maybe Google only does the update, you know once a day or does that check?

593
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:13,730
Once a day and and the app just updated three seconds ago

594
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:18,030
Right. The app is telling me hey, I need to be updated

595
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:26,430
That situation what I would do is is is talk to Google and say hey, how do we make this experience more seamless?

596
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,960
right the

597
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You're right

598
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
customers have update

599
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,360
fatigue

600
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:42,330
But what I'm saying is that doesn't mean you stand on the principle and say we don't do updates

601
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:46,450
No, we figure out how to do the updates and we remove the fatigue

602
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:54,500
Absolutely, and you see all kinds of apps do that. It's pretty common now for apps to have an update or

603
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:01,920
To just download silently or and install patch style updates in the background. I think it's totally expected

604
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:09,760
It's okay, let's hear on Windows and every damn single one of them requires a reboot and that's annoying, too

605
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,320
Yeah, okay. Get my windows jab in. Okay

606
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,460
Let me summarize

607
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,940
Data is important. It it means you actually care more about the customer not less about them

608
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,540
It's actually a more efficient way to evaluate

609
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,620
the customers perception of value or customers

610
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:33,970
Yeah value of the product

611
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:35,970
one thing to bring up here is

612
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:41,290
People ask me what's different about modern testing versus agile testing and this it's a lot the same

613
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:46,010
It's a lot about whole team delivery. One of the things we really call out that's

614
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:53,850
not called out explicitly or at least not that much in the agile testing books is this use of data and how important it is because

615
00:50:54,210 --> 00:51:00,730
You and I and people who believe modern testing principles and a lot a lot a lot of engineering teams around the world

616
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:04,490
realize that data is critical to

617
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,530
Understanding and using data is critical to understanding

618
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,290
customer quality and production

619
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:14,130
Using data, so you just made a point using data

620
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:20,970
It I forget how you say it but some of the lines of it is not actually harming the customer

621
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:25,010
It is actually better for the customer. Right, right? Am

622
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,890
And still and just because it allows you to

623
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,740
Scale up your let's say it's a pure traditional testing

624
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:46,310
Facility it allows you to scale up your testing resources on the things that actually matter to the customer. Yes

625
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:50,270
Right, you can help you target your testing. Yes

626
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:54,370
absolutely

627
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,150
Yeah, and what might maybe let me add this metaphor

628
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:04,190
Well, if you have time is in the old days way back in the 20th century

629
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:10,560
We may look at code coverage and we'd figure out where we had missing tests

630
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:14,800
And we still do this today in our unit test and go make sure we have tests for the areas that don't have coverage

631
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:21,020
We can use data in a similar way to understand if you look at customer

632
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:27,140
Usage patterns as a method of coverage. You can look and see where they're using the product and make sure

633
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:33,180
We have and actually that may help you target. Okay customers are really using this 30% of the product

634
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:39,600
Let's go invest some of that time-intensive intellectual exploratory testing there. How about this?

635
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,810
How about it? You set up an experiment that

636
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:53,850
Routes 10% of the traffic to a co coverage instrumented build. Yes. I've done that before

637
00:52:54,690 --> 00:53:02,310
Right, and then you compare the co coverage of your test suite to the co coverage coming from your usage suite

638
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,250
Yep, fantastic

639
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:12,270
Now that means now you have a decision, right? Okay. Should you solidify where there's existing co coverage or

640
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:16,230
Do you fill the holes?

641
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:19,300
right, so if you see that that oh

642
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:24,520
This one one class is just used like freakin crazy

643
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:32,470
But there's a couple of lines of code that don't have testing right you maybe you you bolster up that unit test before you

644
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:40,070
You cover the test suite that that usage doesn't even hit right?

645
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:46,600
Matter of fact, I would I'll tell you what I would do in that particular case. I'd like hey

646
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,480
Do we have this feature turned on?

647
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,760
Right. There's this whole library that's not even touched

648
00:53:54,690 --> 00:54:00,330
First off is it is it actually instrumented? Do we screw up when we deploy this thing? But assuming it is

649
00:54:00,850 --> 00:54:04,630
Right. What is this code doing? Is it turned on?

650
00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:07,600
if so

651
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,270
Okay

652
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:13,470
There's something wrong with it because customers can't find it customers aren't using it

653
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:20,590
Let's figure out if actually this is something we should continue. Yeah, that's an example of we're gonna look at the data and and

654
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:25,310
Prove or disprove our hypotheses on how we think the product works and it's being used

655
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:27,430
Yeah, the

656
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,610
You know another way of making

657
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,710
higher

658
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,990
Quality code here and talking about code correctness another way of making high quality code

659
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:42,390
one of my employees says and I like this the difference between a a

660
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:45,160
four star and a five star developer

661
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,420
five star developer

662
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:53,770
Doesn't add code. They remove it. That would be one attribute. Yeah. All right

663
00:54:54,130 --> 00:55:00,930
Okay, I hope we have beat our opinions and thoughts on data and it's important into your heads and next time

664
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,650
We'll cover the to some not all slightly controversial

665
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:12,080
Principle number seven. Okay, I am still Alan and I'm Brent and we'll see you next time
