1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
What I want to do, let me just talk through how I turned the corner on this.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,040
Which was 100 and 100 million billion

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,280
kazillion percent in agreement.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,520
And this is a man who knows his numbers.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,640
Welcome to A.B.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,720
Testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,560
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,680
on testing, leadership, agile and anything else that comes to mind.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Now on with the show.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,720
Hey, everybody. Howdy.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,790
Alan, you're lovely.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,390
I'm love.

13
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,790
I'm lovely. Yeah. Who are you?

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,590
I'm Brent.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,590
Brent, you're a lovely host.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,360
Yeah, I'm uncomfortable with the term lovely.

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,360
I like this.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,840
You know what? You're going to have to go with it.

19
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,880
You know what we're going to do today?

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,960
No, make a podcast that's better than the one we made last time.

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,360
Continuous improvement.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,320
Yeah, that's that's that should be an easy to achieve.

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,240
Yeah. Retros are important. We retro.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,640
We say, you know what? Let's do better.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,400
So we're going to do that. We're going to do better.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,640
So how you been? What's new? What's exciting?

27
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,600
It's just coming up.

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,400
Not a thing for me, but whatever.

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,350
Chocolate Bunny Day.

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,310
Is that what it is?

31
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,110
Yeah, I think it's chocolate Bunny Day.

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,750
Well, if you if you play Animal Crossing, then it literally is.

33
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,990
Bunny Day coming up.

34
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,670
I don't play Animal Crossing.

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,750
Oh, all right.

36
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,550
Do you Animal Cross?

37
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,590
I did. I'm not currently.

38
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,350
We got a whole community at Unity.

39
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,670
It's like they have a shared spreadsheet of what they make and everything.

40
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,830
And it's they're into it.

41
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,350
Yeah, we've talked about this before.

42
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,310
Anyway, go on.

43
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,990
Do you even have a switch?

44
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,870
No, there's there switches in the house.

45
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,150
I don't have one that I claim as my own.

46
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,830
Like Nintendo switch.

47
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,910
I know what you're talking about.

48
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,270
Yes, a Nintendo switch.

49
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,750
No. So so there's like a bunch of I'm not as dumb as I look, Brent.

50
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,950
What data do you have to back that up?

51
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,530
All right. Well, we'll just go for it.

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,690
All right.

53
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,490
So that'll be a continuously disproved or not yet proven.

54
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,130
All right.

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,450
People are doubting our opening statement of doing a better podcast already.

56
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,730
No, but it's going to be higher energy, therefore, just by definition better.

57
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,330
How can two old farts like us have high energy?

58
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,410
Coffee. Oh, yes, I did.

59
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,250
Yeah, yeah. So were you I have stuff to say, but I can't remember

60
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,130
if you were saying anything or not.

61
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,730
No. So, and I'm a long story short, I played a lot of Animal Crossing.

62
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,610
There's really I've now played it enough that there's really no more sort of goals

63
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,730
to achieve, like there's not any sort of like achievement points.

64
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,770
Like there is an Xbox.

65
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,930
There are all these other little sort of achievements you can do.

66
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,850
And I've kind of done them.

67
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:58,210
So my my my game of today on the switch is one known as Hades.

68
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,410
Oh, yes. This is a hard game.

69
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,490
I've played this. You've played Hades.

70
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,160
Yeah. On Xbox. Yeah.

71
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,200
Yeah. So like right now I'm on my 150th run.

72
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:16,200
I have yet to beat Hades himself.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,840
I have I was bummed by the last time because I almost got him down to the

74
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,120
to the second one and I'm like, oh, I'm going to do it.

75
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,800
Oh, I'm dead. Yeah.

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,040
So for those who are not as nerdy as us,

77
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,800
Hades is a game where you start off your character.

78
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,840
You're you are the son of Hades, who ancient Greek God

79
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,960
who controls essentially the Greek version of hell.

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,440
And you are tired of living in hell

81
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,520
and you are trying to get out.

82
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,720
And Hades has insisted that no one gets out.

83
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,440
I am playing a game where I'm continuously trying to just prove this

84
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,240
and continuously fail anyway.

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,640
One bit of news for me is kind of hilarious.

86
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,520
I think I mentioned last time I was traveling to Montreal for a team offsite.

87
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Yes. Yeah, that's not happening.

88
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,620
Montreal got nixed for some reason.

89
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,100
I can't remember.

90
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,780
I was out so I can't remember what I went on a bike ride last week.

91
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,220
We're right about 200 miles.

92
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,740
Anyway, Montreal was canceled.

93
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,020
I came back. It was going to be Miami.

94
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,020
And then we found out the Miami Grand Prix is the weekend.

95
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:31,300
The week were there. So I talked.

96
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,380
I think I think I think I think I think I've talked my manager

97
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,580
into doing it in Los Angeles, a much closer plane ride for me.

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,180
And I don't care about anybody else.

99
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,740
So I go somewhere, you know, travel somewhere, go and travel on a plane.

100
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,260
So that's kind of it for me.

101
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,900
Work, work, work, bike, ride, bike, ride, bike, ride.

102
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,900
Yeah, that's it.

103
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,780
I have a question about work.

104
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,180
If you want to get into the podcast proper in record time.

105
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,180
Just sure.

106
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,100
But I'll just do one last thing.

107
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,940
I just looked it up and apparently Fallout 5

108
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,100
won't be out until at least 2025.

109
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,180
Oh, yeah. Anyway. All right. Let's go.

110
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,340
Should I? Should I preorder it now?

111
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,340
Um, I don't know. I don't think so.

112
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,260
If it's anything like Fallout 76, the answer would be no.

113
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,220
I played 15 minutes of Fallout 76.

114
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:31,180
And when like not when it came out, like maybe it was over winter break.

115
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,770
Oh, just like three months ago or whatever it was.

116
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,770
Oh, so the news I haven't tried, but the news is saying

117
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,560
that it sucks way less.

118
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,800
Yeah, it wasn't too bad. I just I just lost interest.

119
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,360
So I have a question.

120
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,750
It's actually hearkens back to a few of our earlier podcasts.

121
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,350
For those of you that may remember, at one point I worked at Microsoft,

122
00:05:56,950 --> 00:06:00,030
small little software company in Redman where Brent remains employed,

123
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,630
as far as we know, and probably while we were there together,

124
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,950
Microsoft went through at least three, if not 12,

125
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,790
different iterations of employee performance programs.

126
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,090
And they still use the Connect.

127
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,290
Is that today's thing still?

128
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:23,050
That's a record for how long they've used that.

129
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,530
Because I've been around for about three or four years when I left.

130
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,770
And I don't recall anything being used that long.

131
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,170
But yeah, they they haven't changed Connect in a long time.

132
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,370
This year and literally in the last month, it is the first time

133
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,650
they released. I don't even know the name of it.

134
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,930
It's employee. I think it's employee signals is what it's called.

135
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,050
It's the dramatic replacement to MS Polls.

136
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,450
Oh, we use a third party culture thing called Culture app.

137
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,210
We just finished up our poll today.

138
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,890
In fact, I will let you know confidential unity information.

139
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,050
I'm going to get busted by comms for this.

140
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,930
My team had 94 percent participation.

141
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,330
Wow. Looks like that's as far as reading it.

142
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,730
So not bad, huh? Not bad.

143
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,450
That so I did not.

144
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,370
All right. So anyway, the Connect is the the employee review thing, et cetera, et cetera.

145
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,450
We talked about the toxicity that can generate when people are more concerned

146
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,330
about getting their own goals done.

147
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,170
We used to joke at Microsoft around peak in May because that connect you do

148
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,170
because all the pay stuff is done in June.

149
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,130
And and then the straw, one of the straws that broke the camel's back with me

150
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,130
was my manager making up stuff in my connect that never happened or he never told me.

151
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:42,570
I said, OK, I'm done. But so all that happens.

152
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,250
It's very awkward and weird about I can't remember how long ago.

153
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,130
Maybe I won't get there yet.

154
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,610
I've talked before about Unity's three Q system of feedback.

155
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,570
So three questions, three times a year.

156
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,810
What is your mission or why is your mission important?

157
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,570
What are you doing to achieve your mission?

158
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,470
And how's it going?

159
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,950
Just sort of the framing for a reflective one on one,

160
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,270
looking at the work and opportunity for feedback.

161
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,590
As we grow, we're seeing the need for more opportunities for feedback.

162
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:13,910
And so we're building in we're building a goal setting system

163
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,590
and which set off my Spidey sense and red flags at first.

164
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,950
I was furious.

165
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,270
I can share that.

166
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,670
I do not want a performance management system.

167
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,990
My organization gives feedback just fine.

168
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,300
As I've lived with it, we haven't visited a soft launch.

169
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,940
I'm an official thing to like forever from now.

170
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:41,500
But as I've sat with it and thought about it and talked about it,

171
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,300
I'm feeling a lot better about it.

172
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:52,920
And I think it's possible to have a healthy culture and organization

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,120
and still have these goals you can work on.

174
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,520
In fact, you can even do better if you do goals in the right way.

175
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,680
But the reason I want to I'll talk a little about my ideas,

176
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,360
but we want to bring it up to you because in our conversations

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
in the past, you have said that Microsoft is getting better

178
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,880
in some of the toxicity that I experienced when I was there.

179
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
And of course, there's pockets.

180
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,140
It's a huge freaking company.

181
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,260
Can you talk a little bit from what you can?

182
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,780
And we'll both have to be a little bit nonspecific in some areas, I'm sure.

183
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,660
But I think I think we can be fairly transparent on

184
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,100
how do you approach that goal setting with your employees?

185
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,620
And I mean, how do you come up with good goals?

186
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,940
What makes up a good goal?

187
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,500
And I'll jump in and add some flavor as we go through.

188
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
But let me let me kick off with that question.

189
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,780
Oh, what was your first one?

190
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,860
So you said what makes a good goal?

191
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,220
Well, there's a good goal.

192
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,540
And really, how do you approach setting goals with your employees?

193
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:53,020
Oh, what I will do is I'll share with you.

194
00:09:54,210 --> 00:10:01,450
So there's a bar that I have set very high for the principal band.

195
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,770
So at Microsoft, we have multiple bands, but the most popular,

196
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,890
most populated bands are in order, just simply a one.

197
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,930
So you could be a PM one or a software engineer one or a data science one.

198
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,250
Or you could be a two.

199
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,010
Or you could be the natural that is a senior.

200
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,930
And then after that is a is a principal.

201
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,610
And then lastly, after that is a partner.

202
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,290
You weren't a partner when you left, right?

203
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,610
You were still principal.

204
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,610
Yeah, I was 67 in Microsoft terms.

205
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,770
I was a principal.

206
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,810
Yep, I am.

207
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,450
I am a principal myself now.

208
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,810
And so when I have conversations with and I'm not entirely meandering,

209
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:52,850
but when I have conversations with my seniors

210
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,730
who are who their next promotion would move them into the principal band,

211
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:06,330
I start off with a setting expectations on the principal band as follows.

212
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,620
OK, so you want to go to principal.

213
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,250
What I want you to do is think about what KPI

214
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,220
that the business cares about that you want to own.

215
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,280
And then they look at me befuddled.

216
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:26,860
What do you mean?

217
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,820
Own like I'm already I'm already driving a bunch of KPIs.

218
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,100
I'm like, no, no, no, no.

219
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,620
Here's what own means.

220
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:37,860
You're going to you're going to say, Brit, I want the food KPI.

221
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,020
And then I say, OK, great.

222
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,000
Start working through.

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,760
I want to I want you to start working through your strategy

224
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,840
around how you're going to move it.

225
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,880
And then I'm going to be basically hands off.

226
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,440
That's what own means.

227
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,800
I want you to practice moving needles.

228
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,280
Yeah, that's I'm going to jump in because that's a it's not

229
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,230
I don't know if we've got into the setting goals part directly.

230
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:07,030
Maybe we're getting there, but yeah, that's I've had a very similar conversation.

231
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:14,590
So the levels that every company has a very similar growth of or leveling system.

232
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,910
They're not all identical.

233
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,590
For example, if I look at levels, not FYI, I see that it's about makes sense.

234
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,630
What we call principal or director

235
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,350
is the top end of sixty six, sixty seven and all of sixty seven at Microsoft.

236
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,890
And when I'm talking to those folks, a little little higher up.

237
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:41,080
But I tell them at at that level, you have to run your business.

238
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,360
Yes, that your business could be small. Right.

239
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,120
But that's and that's what I'm kind of trying to drive them to

240
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,000
is basically understand, no, when you're the owner, you are

241
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,520
essentially part of the business team

242
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,440
and you are going to specifically drive improvements in this thing.

243
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:12,250
They're like, well, but wait a minute, that KPI multiple teams are like, no, no.

244
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,570
Scope it down and and to something that is drivable.

245
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,170
But getting to goal setting.

246
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:25,170
So the at the very top level, the reason why I told the story is at the very top level,

247
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,570
I'm very explicit. What's the KPI? You're going to move.

248
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,210
You're a senior now.

249
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,970
You should have everything you need underneath your belt.

250
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:35,810
Like one of my expectations around the senior band

251
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,010
is that they have learned to master leadership.

252
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,390
Right. And leadership is the ability to get people to follow you,

253
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,830
not do what you say.

254
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,950
Follow you. Very distinct difference.

255
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,270
You should also at that, depending on your role, you should also have at that point in time

256
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,750
has sufficient skill set in whatever band you are.

257
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,790
If you're a developer, like you probably know all the coding

258
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,140
you need to know at at 64.

259
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,740
Sure, there might be other things that are that would be fun to learn.

260
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,540
Always learning support.

261
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,580
But it's enough to give the team trust in your ability to lead them.

262
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,020
And I keep on thinking when you say followers, I keep on thinking of the Maxwell

263
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,780
levels of leadership and there's you're put in a position of leadership

264
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,340
and then people give you permission to lead them.

265
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,340
And I really like that. It's like, yeah, you can I trust you.

266
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,420
I trust you to help me figure out the path.

267
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,540
We just had a reorg and and I picked up a couple of people

268
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,540
and part of my first speech because you shrunk it last time we talked to you

269
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:49,570
and shrunk. Yeah. And it's it's back up and circle of life still growing.

270
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,290
Yeah, it's it's a headache because

271
00:14:53,730 --> 00:15:00,210
right for me, Brent needs the right balance of talky and dewy.

272
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,050
And right now I am over pivoting on talk.

273
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,730
I'm too much talky right now.

274
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,890
And it's it's I'm working on it.

275
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,810
So I want to jump in and I like where you're going.

276
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,250
But I'm going to I realize I can be more specific here and help out here.

277
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,810
So by talking about you want to talk about commitments?

278
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,090
No, I mean, you commitments goals.

279
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,290
So here is the deal.

280
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,090
And I can compare Microsoft and kind of where some of my my rage flare up came in.

281
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,890
Like, oh, we're going to have goals.

282
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,770
And I'm not saying goals are bad.

283
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,970
Goals are good. But things change so quickly.

284
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,010
At Microsoft, the commitments were they yearly, twice yearly.

285
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,490
It's really hard because stuff changes super fast these days.

286
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:50,330
So what would happen is people would either set very vague goals,

287
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,380
which you could morph into success no matter what.

288
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,020
And it's hard to tell if you're hard to coach on those or very specific goals

289
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:05,060
or or more, I think very even more specific goals that may become irrelevant

290
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,660
a few months down the road.

291
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,620
So how do you go about setting goals or commitments?

292
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,100
With your team to to avoid falling into either of those two traps

293
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,340
or those traps, OK?

294
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,140
Enumerate again, the two traps.

295
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:21,140
So vague that you can't tell if you've made progress or not.

296
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,380
So you can make shit up the the what I thought was the canonical Microsoft model

297
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,100
or an amount of specificity that if anything changes,

298
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,500
that goal is irrelevant, just just becomes an A or not done.

299
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,070
So nowadays with goals,

300
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,940
here is what I here is a major difference,

301
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,900
I would say, about the current Microsoft thing.

302
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,660
OK, Microsoft doesn't care about goals.

303
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,420
We have these things called commitments, but we don't care about goals.

304
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,100
You get reviewed on impact.

305
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,740
And I think that's the key. Go on.

306
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,020
I like that better.

307
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,940
The problem is, as it stands right now, the term impact

308
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,460
is kind of because there's still too many, you know, old timers here.

309
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,380
The term impact is just becoming a synonym for for goal

310
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,220
in in in the old world that existed when you were still here.

311
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:31,490
OK, the like this idea of of of committing

312
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:38,220
to something, to committing to something that you've written in your connect.

313
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,700
That is something that has died down.

314
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,100
And for me, it makes more sense.

315
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,540
But this idea of committing to

316
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,260
shipping this feature by this date, right, you go and look up smart goals

317
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,460
and they'll tell you, oh, yeah, that's a fantastic goal.

318
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,940
But committing to it, and at least in my world,

319
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,100
is just absolutely nonsensical.

320
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,940
I heard a great quote about smart goals on a podcast today.

321
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,780
The quote was everybody knows about smart goals, but nobody's excited about them.

322
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah, because smart, the smart goals and I

323
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:24,580
actually you've been long ago, a manager of mine, Damien.

324
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,540
Ah, Damien Lindauer.

325
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,740
Where can I sit on LinkedIn?

326
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,340
I just doxed Damien. Sorry, man.

327
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,220
No, do you remember there was a there was one time I called you in

328
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,780
to do a presentation at a at a Damien team meeting?

329
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,820
And then I at that same meeting, I presented around

330
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,060
smarter goals like I've done.

331
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,340
So I created my own acronym Smarter Goals.

332
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,820
So anyone can go up and look up smart on the Internet.

333
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,460
I had a measurable, actionable result oriented and time bound, something like that.

334
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,940
Relevant and time bound.

335
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,140
Yeah. And then I added an E.

336
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,400
So everyone know a

337
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:18,660
the A stands for actionable in some places or attainable in other places.

338
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,260
Or astonishing. The E.

339
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,460
Or sometimes Alan.

340
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,020
So the E I added was exceedable.

341
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,660
Though can you get past it?

342
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,500
Can you can you overachieve?

343
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,420
Right. Right.

344
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,540
If if if you are because one of the big problems at Microsoft at that point in time,

345
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,070
if you had the goal that wasn't exceedable, then right.

346
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,350
Your goals are setting you up for a three.

347
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,030
OK, tell me the R that I want to react.

348
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,000
Reasonable set.

349
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,080
OK, so you smart has you go through these goals.

350
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,240
Right. But if and you could create an individual

351
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,160
goal, but if you have too many of these goals,

352
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,520
then you're diluting your effort.

353
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,720
Yeah, absolutely.

354
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,880
You can't have multiple.

355
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,920
But let me give you some reaction because my the part that doesn't sit well

356
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,920
with being the part I will ignore and fight and do my own way

357
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,440
is tying those goals to pay.

358
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,940
We can tie the impact to pay.

359
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,700
So what I want to do, so let me let me just talk through my

360
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,580
how I turn the corner on this, which 100 and 100 million billion,

361
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,820
gazillion percent in agreement.

362
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,460
And this is a man who knows his numbers.

363
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,140
So what I want to use the goals for, and this is where

364
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,100
the Connect stuff comes up three times a year, sometimes two.

365
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,140
Is that right?

366
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,220
It doesn't matter.

367
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,500
What I've decided is I will get goals from my whole org,

368
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,340
starting with my direct reports, and we will check in on the

369
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,500
and we're going to get some wrong.

370
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,780
We're going to practice doing it because it takes some practice

371
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,020
to get it right, as you know.

372
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,740
And we're going to check in on them regularly.

373
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,500
Maybe not every one on one, but at least once a month

374
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,620
because they provide a ton of coachable moments and times

375
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,540
where you can give specific feedback.

376
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,900
Here's a challenge with feedback.

377
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,300
If I go to my manager, actually, my manager doesn't know how

378
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,500
to get feedback, bad example.

379
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,940
But if I were to go to my manager hypothetically and say,

380
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,340
do you have any feedback for me?

381
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,620
He'd be like, uh, yeah, when you ask for feedback,

382
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,820
it should be around specific things.

383
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,340
Do you have any feedback on the delivery of component A to team X?

384
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,500
And then hopefully we can get that.

385
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,300
Then what this does is having goals that we work through

386
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,220
can give us some opportunities for feedback.

387
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,250
And then my model here is I'm not really into smart.

388
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,090
I am time bound, not worried about smarter,

389
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,090
but remember the unity three questions.

390
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,570
Why is your mission important is the first one.

391
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,090
And I find I'm a disciple of Dan pink as much as I am

392
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,330
of Eric Reese.

393
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,810
And if people have autonomy, mastery, and purpose,

394
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,650
and I give people autonomy and I balance that

395
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,290
with accountability and transparency,

396
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:01,480
but I give them freedom to run their own business.

397
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,400
I make sure they have the skills to do

398
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,360
what they need to do, mastery.

399
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,800
And purpose is so important.

400
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,800
I want everyone to feel like their role and their job

401
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,360
and what they do is important.

402
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,840
So we start with that question.

403
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,320
And then from there, move into what are some things

404
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,100
that you want to accomplish to help achieve this mission?

405
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,860
And we come up with two or three goals sometimes

406
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,100
and it kind of depends on level and experience.

407
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,420
Someone more junior, they may be shorter term,

408
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,580
one month goals.

409
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,700
Someone more seniors like by the end of Q2 or Q3

410
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,460
or by the end of 22, they need to accomplish this.

411
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,220
And then they'll go through and break it down.

412
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,300
Like what are the milestones?

413
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,780
It's almost like objective and key results for the goal.

414
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,060
We'll have a goal, like what are the things

415
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,100
I need to accomplish to make sure I'm working toward this?

416
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,660
And those are the things we can check in on.

417
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,740
And then finally, after we kind of get through

418
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,340
that little exercise, it doesn't take long.

419
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,620
I make sure that those goals represent both

420
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,740
what they want to do for the business

421
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,140
as well as their personal growth

422
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,180
and or growth in that, whatever they want to do.

423
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,340
Does this feel like it moves you forward?

424
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,300
Remember the old ACB model.

425
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
A certain amount of your work is above you

426
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,460
and stretches you.

427
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,060
Some is just stuff you're good at that you do.

428
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,780
And then there's a little bit of grunt work.

429
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,220
We want the below work.

430
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:21,300
We want to minimize that and find the right balance

431
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,980
between stuff that stretches you

432
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,380
and stuff you're just good at.

433
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,740
What happens if you don't have any stuff

434
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,970
that stretches you, Brent?

435
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,730
You burn out and die.

436
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,740
You're bored as fuck.

437
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,580
Yeah.

438
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,140
So remember Microsoft used to accuse me

439
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,060
of changing jobs every 18 months,

440
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:43,140
which I deny, but it turned out being kind of true.

441
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,780
I didn't accuse you.

442
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,220
I was just putting out the facts.

443
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,700
Damn data people.

444
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,060
But what happened was in every single one of those cases,

445
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,780
except for the last one, which is special,

446
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,220
I was bored.

447
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,500
There wasn't really anything challenging left for me

448
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,580
to do in that role.

449
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,060
So I wanted to do something else.

450
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,060
I, in hindsight, I have found

451
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,960
that there were two primary reasons for me leaving.

452
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,840
One of them is, yeah, bored as hell.

453
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,200
Bored, bored, boredy, boredy, bored, bored, bored.

454
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,200
The other one is not bored, love what I'm doing,

455
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,790
but there is a critical problem within the organization

456
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,590
that I have attempted to do my part to fix.

457
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:41,510
And just not only is it done on track to get fixed,

458
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,230
it's not going to be fixed.

459
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:49,230
And I have a big problem staying in broken orcs.

460
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,870
I'm like, oh my God, it's gonna drive me

461
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,270
incredibly insane on a daily basis.

462
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,750
It depends how broken and how much ability you have

463
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,790
to fix what's broken.

464
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,910
If it's a hopeless cause, yeah, I would get out.

465
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,870
I mean, we are so fricking lucky to be able to work

466
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,710
in an industry where we can have jobs

467
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,430
that are fun and challenging.

468
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,150
I am sharing on my screen right now.

469
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:18,130
For those of you not watching the closed captioning version

470
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:23,130
of this podcast, Brent has a screen full of Venn diagrams

471
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,630
and other charty looking things.

472
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,470
I'm going to explain it to you,

473
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:31,190
my beloved listener in a second.

474
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,450
And Alan, I'm gonna focus his attention on this.

475
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:40,450
This is a diagram that controls 90% of the time

476
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,090
of my one-on-ones with my staff.

477
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:48,890
So can I attempt to describe this for our listeners?

478
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,890
Cause I think you are on the money.

479
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,970
You have found, you have the diagram close at hand,

480
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,730
which represents what I just mentioned.

481
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,730
So this is a three circle Venn diagram of what we do well,

482
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,220
what we want to do and what we can be paid to do.

483
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,700
And smack dab in the middle of the intersection

484
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,790
of those three circles is hooray.

485
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,630
Right.

486
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,030
And we should all, I mean, knowledge workers rejoice.

487
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,550
Knowledge workers have the ability to seek out

488
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,970
and find that role.

489
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:23,950
It's not always easy.

490
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,270
And sometimes it's a little bit in the outskirts,

491
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:28,230
but we're lucky.

492
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,670
And so I will talk to them and I will go through

493
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:35,150
and say, okay, we can talk to them.

494
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,110
Or like I just picked up a couple of employees.

495
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,870
I know I've erased it now.

496
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,950
Otherwise I'd prove to you that right over there

497
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,430
on that whiteboard where it says,

498
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,510
predict risks and mitigate, I had drawn the circle.

499
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,810
I've been using this thing for years

500
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,800
in terms of my one-on-ones and say, okay,

501
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,580
so where are we?

502
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,920
Where are you with this particular task?

503
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,400
Where are you on the task of growing your career

504
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,180
in this diagram?

505
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Now, circling it back to the goals, right?

506
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:13,380
The reason why I brought up that top level KPI

507
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,720
is that's what I do when people are going in

508
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,340
or are part of the principal band.

509
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,660
And then you would imagine that at the lower bands,

510
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:25,580
I'm basically training them up to get to the point

511
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,180
where I can have that conversation

512
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,760
when they're principal band.

513
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,260
Like at the level two, their job,

514
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,260
in my view, their job is execution excellence.

515
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,220
You have to get shit done.

516
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,340
At senior band, your job is to figure out how to lead.

517
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,380
And in this case, I don't even care how you're leading.

518
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,740
It could be a technical leader, it could be a people leader,

519
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,700
you could be a strategic leader.

520
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,100
I don't care.

521
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,980
My only bar is that you have evidence

522
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,320
that there are people following you.

523
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,380
And as you correctly called out,

524
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:03,550
a follower is someone that's making a choice.

525
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,590
Like they don't have to choose to walk your path.

526
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,590
Now, on goals, I particularly,

527
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:17,830
now I am lucky to be in a space where I can do a lot,

528
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,980
I can go a lot of different directions, right?

529
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:26,060
My space is customer analytics.

530
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,580
Like we've talked about that before

531
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,700
and I can go deep on a lot of places

532
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,660
because it turns out in the software industry,

533
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,220
it turns out a lot of things are about the customer

534
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,770
if you look at it right.

535
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,930
Right, Am.

536
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,050
I'm sorry, a podcast, did you hear my eyes roll on that one?

537
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,370
Did that come across on the microphone?

538
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,810
Anyway, go on, sorry.

539
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,650
What I try to do with this diagram is to go,

540
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,770
okay, let's talk about intrinsic motivators.

541
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:58,340
What is it that you want to do?

542
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,800
Whether it be work related or not work related,

543
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,000
what is your passion?

544
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,790
What is driving you?

545
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,290
And what subset of those things

546
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:15,290
can I help you get paid to do?

547
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:20,290
You said you very clearly enjoyed riding your bike.

548
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:24,570
Like I remember stories from your college days

549
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,330
where you were a pizza delivery

550
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,650
and I think you said that you did it through bike riding.

551
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,250
No, I was a, I delivered pizza by car

552
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,370
but I was a bicycle messenger.

553
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,250
Oh, bicycle messenger, that's right.

554
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,810
I delivered anything from mail to blood.

555
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,450
Yeah, I mixed up.

556
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,890
I just combined your before Microsoft job history, I think.

557
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,050
So you have an interest in riding bikes.

558
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,290
Well, unfortunately, like if you were to be

559
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,750
a future employee on my team,

560
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:59,390
I can't yet figure out how your passion there

561
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,890
might be something that I could combine

562
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,570
with a lot of the work that we're doing.

563
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,450
But if I can, I'm gonna tap into it

564
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:12,450
because I have learned happy people are productive people.

565
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,050
Yes, yes.

566
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,690
And in fact, you and I have arrived

567
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,490
at the exact same destination via different routes.

568
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,850
We were talking about our engagement survey earlier

569
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:25,210
or as used to be MS Pulse has a new name for you,

570
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:26,730
MS Insights.

571
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,730
These are measurements of employee engagement.

572
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,090
And I don't care what the survey says,

573
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,330
I want to make sure people are happy about their work.

574
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,570
And then of course, the study from Pat Lanchoni

575
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:42,530
in The Advantage, finding massive correlation

576
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:44,890
between a healthy organization

577
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,050
and the quality of the products they deliver,

578
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,930
regardless of the industry, it all ties together.

579
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:54,850
Our part of our job as managers is to not just get people

580
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:59,250
to get their work done, it's connect them with their work,

581
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,850
make it important for them

582
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,930
or find the work that's important for them.

583
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,210
And then the good things in the delivery

584
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,610
and the velocity and all the things we want will happen.

585
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:14,450
My job as a manager is to get to the point

586
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:18,910
where I do not have to manage, right?

587
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,390
It's essentially, how do I light a fire?

588
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:26,230
How do I show them that they can achieve

589
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,470
a business impactful goal at the same time

590
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,910
as develop things that they want to do?

591
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,670
Yeah, so this is where, again, I've turned the corner

592
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,630
from us not having a specific goal setting process

593
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,870
before at Unity to where I'm at now thinking,

594
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,190
first thinking it was horrible and now thinking,

595
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,430
you know what, if we use this right,

596
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,430
I can actually do the things I've been trying to do

597
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,910
much more effectively.

598
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,870
It just took me a while to get there

599
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:57,630
because I had been tainted by some poor goal setting

600
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:00,270
processes that I've been part of in the past.

601
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:05,790
I'm not clear on what you're classifying as goals, right?

602
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,510
Because you already have language,

603
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,550
like in your questions,

604
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,790
you already have language around mission.

605
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,950
It's reflection.

606
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,950
The previous questions are more reflecting back.

607
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,910
What is my mission?

608
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:18,070
What have I done to achieve my mission?

609
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:20,790
How have I done in achieving my mission?

610
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,830
All I'm doing now is twisting that a little bit forward.

611
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:27,230
What else, what are the next things I want to accomplish

612
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:29,550
in order to achieve this mission?

613
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,670
So in goals and in your context,

614
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,550
are they more rallying cries?

615
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,270
Are they more North stars?

616
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,630
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

617
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,310
concrete goals.

618
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,710
Let me make up one that's probably,

619
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,270
I could probably just let me get away with it.

620
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:47,940
I will kick Alan in the shins by end of year.

621
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,780
Here's one.

622
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,540
Here's one for my one I play, I should be safe.

623
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,420
We'll have a pipeline for pseudo localization available

624
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,340
in all of our build pipelines by the end of Q3.

625
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,500
Okay.

626
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,060
That's probably too much jargon.

627
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,060
My team will reduce test time by 25% by the end of Q2.

628
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
Okay.

629
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,180
So pretty concrete stuff, not North star.

630
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,300
And I'll, but those goals all require a multitude of things

631
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,390
be done to complete them.

632
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,430
Okay.

633
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,190
Now, is that goal a commitment?

634
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,700
No, it's a goal.

635
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,540
Okay.

636
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,250
So what happens if you don't achieve the goal?

637
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,490
It depends.

638
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,330
Yeah.

639
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,090
See, I think you see where that comes from.

640
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,650
What we can do is we're not,

641
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:32,650
I'm not going to wait till the end of Q2 to go,

642
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,490
did you hit it?

643
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,310
Did you not hit it?

644
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,150
Okay.

645
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,990
Here's your grade.

646
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,650
We'll have a discussion regularly and maybe it's Q3.

647
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,010
I'm making up stuff here,

648
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,330
but we're going to have a regular check-in.

649
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,410
How's this going?

650
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:45,130
What are the next things you need to accomplish?

651
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,970
I have traditionally done OKRs with my team

652
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,090
without telling them they're doing OKRs

653
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,450
because once they know they're doing OKRs,

654
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,570
it gets all messed up and I have experience of this.

655
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,250
So I'll approach it very similarly.

656
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,610
Although these aren't OKRs to that.

657
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,210
I will ask, we'll check in on it.

658
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,410
What are the top priorities for this goal for next week?

659
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,890
What's coming up over the next month or so?

660
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,210
That's the check-in on it.

661
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:13,710
And if you're not achieving it

662
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,110
because you're getting distracted

663
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,090
or just leave the OKRs out,

664
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:19,050
if you're not achieving it because you're distracted

665
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:21,170
or you didn't feel like doing it

666
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,850
or you've become disengaged on it

667
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,290
or you made a big mistake in the wrong direction

668
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,760
and that was preventable

669
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,800
or maybe you went and did something I asked you not to do.

670
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,840
For whatever reason,

671
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,760
those things are a different sort of feedback than

672
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,080
we did all the right things.

673
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,080
It ended up being, that last 5%

674
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,200
ended up being much harder than we thought.

675
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,880
That's what I mean by it depends.

676
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,080
So we're going to talk about,

677
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,480
the difference is we're not going to wait

678
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,040
till the end of the time bound to bring it up.

679
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,240
OK, here's your deadline for this goal.

680
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,440
How did it go?

681
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,040
It gives us a framing for ongoing conversations

682
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,560
which are going to provide opportunities

683
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,470
for feedback and coaching.

684
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,430
Yeah, so my...

685
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,030
So I kind of don't care if you hit the goal or not.

686
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,630
What I care is we can have meaningful conversations

687
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,630
about doing the work you've committed,

688
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:13,470
use your word, you've committed or set out to do.

689
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,950
Yeah, sorry, you were going to say something.

690
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,790
I got to say it.

691
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:19,070
Yeah, so I understand

692
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,110
what you described at the beginning of the conversation

693
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,110
as, I'll just reframe as anxiety

694
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:32,190
or frustrated or upset in some regards.

695
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,670
Because I'm just like,

696
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,430
oh my God, that is a slippery slope

697
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,550
to just death spiral doom.

698
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,390
And I must do everything to avoid it.

699
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:45,270
Like I'm vicariously living that emotion through...

700
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,110
And that's what happened at Microsoft.

701
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,590
It got, it would get to be a month before goal time.

702
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,990
And you would screw your teammates in the back

703
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,710
with an iron spike just to make sure

704
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,710
you got your stuff done you committed to.

705
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,430
I care a lot less if you've reached your goal or not.

706
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,750
Because what I also want,

707
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,030
what I want to reward you on is not just impact,

708
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,510
but what I'm going to pay attention to

709
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,110
and we're going to get feedback throughout this thing

710
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:09,270
is the way in which you accomplish those goals.

711
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,710
If you are doing it in a way

712
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,630
that's leaving bodies in the wake,

713
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,390
that's going to have an effect

714
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,070
on how I'm going to evaluate you.

715
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,150
If you're doing it in a way that's inclusive

716
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,230
and involving other people and showing respect

717
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:23,110
and listening to everyone's ideas

718
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,510
and you're rocking out of the park,

719
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,830
I am going to rock you out of the park with a pay raise.

720
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,460
Yeah, I don't like,

721
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,500
I don't like directly connecting those goals.

722
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,460
Not connecting the goals,

723
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,980
I'm connecting the outcomes

724
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,540
and the way in which you achieve the outcomes.

725
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,260
Yeah, so let me, oh, so many things.

726
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,580
So we do have OQRs here at Microsoft,

727
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,620
but OQRs are never,

728
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,540
at least they haven't been in my team

729
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,820
or in my manager's team.

730
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,820
They're not specifically in anybody's commitments.

731
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,220
No, no, no, no, and I am against,

732
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,220
I mentioned the model, it's kind of like that,

733
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:09,180
but I would never use an OQR for personal goals.

734
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:13,020
No, an OQR serves a valuable purpose,

735
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,060
but it serves the purpose around a rallying cry

736
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,260
for a virtual team.

737
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,820
And here's where people get stuck and screwed up

738
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,860
on OQRs for quick tangent.

739
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,740
OQR is done right, as you mentioned, rallying cry.

740
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,660
They are a massively valuable tool for alignment.

741
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:29,500
Yes.

742
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,940
People try and use them like scorecards

743
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,700
and they're just,

744
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,980
Yes, also yes.

745
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,980
Although you just,

746
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:39,500
I'm thinking 99% of all the sentences

747
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,660
that you could ever say,

748
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,620
they can include the word scorecard,

749
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,860
I'm going to be against.

750
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,060
As an aside, there's one of my meetings

751
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,780
where I've instituted a drinking game,

752
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,460
which is tough because it's an 8am meeting,

753
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,020
but every time someone says,

754
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,060
we should build a dashboard for that,

755
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,220
I faux slam a shot.

756
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:01,230
Ha ha ha ha ha.

757
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,550
Yeah, you know, it's been a while since we've,

758
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,710
we had our own version of that on the podcast.

759
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,670
Like we've said this before.

760
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,510
Yeah.

761
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,190
All right, now,

762
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,230
so I'm energized by this conversation

763
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,230
because I'm just like, oh my God,

764
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:19,990
no, yes, no, yes, no, no.

765
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,510
Like for me,

766
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,110
I was also thinking through one of the reasons why,

767
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,990
so it's, for me,

768
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,630
goals of that nature,

769
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,370
like Q2, right?

770
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:35,770
I don't even communicate them as goals.

771
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,330
I want to make sure people are understand, no.

772
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,290
As it stands right now,

773
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:44,160
it is, that is my plan, okay?

774
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,240
But it's not a goal,

775
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,960
it's my plan.

776
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,560
I'm okay with that.

777
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,800
And I softened that communication

778
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,280
because of my, because again,

779
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,720
the business that I'm in,

780
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,800
and I can explain why that's important.

781
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,930
Number one,

782
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,930
number two is my training on Kanban.

783
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,330
Kanban has really said,

784
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:15,560
look, no, what I rather do

785
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,240
is start funding

786
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,460
the highest ROI thing

787
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,060
when I have idle people on my team.

788
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,660
Like whatever is not yet started,

789
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,140
I want to start those things that have the highest ROI

790
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,980
and it may not be this pipeline

791
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,100
that handles all localized languages, right?

792
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:46,180
It may, and it may never be that.

793
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,300
Right, that's a good goal.

794
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,500
This goes back to the first thing I said was it's hard.

795
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,340
If you get too specific and things change,

796
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,860
or priorities change,

797
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,700
then that goal is like,

798
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,300
oh, I didn't do this goal, what happened?

799
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,820
So I like the idea of thinking of them as plans

800
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,780
and not goals.

801
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,300
So that's a nugget I like,

802
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:05,690
because it takes care of that trap.

803
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,650
Now it allows you to be specific to a point.

804
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,770
If you know it's a plan

805
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:12,290
and you know that plans can change.

806
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:16,940
And if the plan has to be committed,

807
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,700
then I have an even bigger problem

808
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,420
because like as most of our listeners know,

809
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,900
I am an Azure, Azure is a service.

810
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,720
And a lot of big design upfront

811
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,520
just does not make sense in this space.

812
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,720
It just does not.

813
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:41,840
We have to be adaptable and failing to be adaptable.

814
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,960
We end up being interrupt driven then

815
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
because there are higher priority things,

816
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,480
higher urgency things that are constantly coming in.

817
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,520
Well, again, again, going back to why I wanna check in

818
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,720
on these frequently, super frequently

819
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,080
is so that we can deliver frequently, super frequently.

820
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,200
I don't want someone to say,

821
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,040
here's my goal for the end of QTQ3.

822
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,960
And mine are made up of it

823
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,680
and my people are listening slightly.

824
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,200
But I don't want you to just deliver the whole thing

825
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,550
at once and say, okay, done.

826
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,870
What we're gonna talk about

827
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,110
as we look at these, like,

828
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,710
what's the minimum first step?

829
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,950
What's our MVP?

830
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:21,070
What do we need to do?

831
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,630
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

832
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,750
So absolutely using that.

833
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:25,030
And I'm stealing stuff from your combine.

834
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,270
We get to a stage where like your combine question is,

835
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,190
I think, tell me if I'm wrong,

836
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:33,070
what work is remaining to complete this task?

837
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,150
I can use a variation of that

838
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,150
to check as a method of checking in on these plans.

839
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,670
Oh, you're talking about, yeah.

840
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,070
What work is remaining to move this ticket,

841
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,910
one column to the right?

842
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,110
Oh, right, right.

843
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:49,910
What needs to be done, right?

844
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:50,750
That's exactly right.

845
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,750
But that framing could work for these plans as well.

846
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,910
Right, but the other thing too,

847
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:02,670
the problem is, so that question works very well

848
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:06,030
for sort of tactical work, right?

849
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:10,150
When you talk about sort of goals or strategies, okay,

850
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,830
I actually changed the question.

851
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,910
I basically say, I am now at a point,

852
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:19,950
so do you remember the pivot or persevere conversation?

853
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,110
Oh, yeah, yeah.

854
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,950
It from-

855
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,150
Yeah, I agree, Chapter 8.

856
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,870
So now in a strategic sense,

857
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:30,510
I say what work remains

858
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:34,830
so that we can have a pivot or persevere discussion.

859
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:37,910
And that pivot or persevere discussion

860
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:40,550
is part of that plan.

861
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,300
And it may change the goal.

862
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,220
That's fair, that's fair.

863
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,700
And another thing I've been very clear about

864
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:48,860
is these things not being written in stone.

865
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,820
I want to encourage my team to discard

866
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:55,980
or change these goals as needed as we get more context.

867
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,820
Absolutely.

868
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,500
I like adding pivot or persevere to that discussion as well.

869
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,180
Up to and including abandon the goal.

870
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,540
Yeah, absolutely.

871
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:07,100
I tell my team, look,

872
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,220
when you write this goal, like number one,

873
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,660
if anyone on my team said something like what you did,

874
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,230
like your pipeline by the end of Q3,

875
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,590
I would have just, I'm like, no, okay.

876
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:23,190
Don't put the Q3 part, right?

877
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,230
I get what you're trying to say, okay?

878
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:29,510
But you're locking yourself into something

879
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,090
that may be abandoned, right?

880
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,170
Just saying remove,

881
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,610
I don't mind having the time bound bit on there,

882
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:37,330
but you're saying remove that.

883
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,370
I just don't think it's realistic.

884
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:40,450
That's fair.

885
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,770
But that's in my business, right?

886
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:47,890
In what my team operates on on a day-to-day basis,

887
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,450
because I'm just like, oh.

888
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:51,570
On the other hand,

889
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,370
it comes with psychological safety as well

890
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:58,850
because they may say this thing for Q2 or Q3 or Q4.

891
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,490
And if they miss that date,

892
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,850
again, it's the impact outcome,

893
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,330
the way in which they accomplish that.

894
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,370
They still need to,

895
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:10,330
they're stakeholders that may need these things

896
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,370
and practicing commitment

897
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,890
and doing so in a safe manner.

898
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,810
If they miss a date, I'm not gonna get mad.

899
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:21,570
I'm not gonna change their pay for missing in most cases.

900
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,290
Depends on their effort and how they got there.

901
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,730
But I wanna give them,

902
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:30,130
there's a short story, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

903
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,850
I want it to be safe for them

904
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,780
to fail in achieving their plans.

905
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,340
So it's okay if they have a date

906
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,500
because it's a plan.

907
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,060
It's a guess.

908
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,740
And you know, we do P50.

909
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,580
In fact, we do P50 estimates on our work items.

910
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,260
I would say we have P50 estimates

911
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,020
on our goals slash plans as well.

912
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:55,160
I will say I not only want them to feel safe.

913
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,560
I'm, so my statement,

914
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,280
I'm trying to do it a clear fashion,

915
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,520
but my statement is a little bit more aggressive than yours.

916
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:09,510
So I do want them to feel safe to fail.

917
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:14,020
I want them to feel morally obligated,

918
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:16,380
business obligated, investor,

919
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,780
like something along those lines.

920
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,980
I want them to feel obligated

921
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,580
that if this goal is to fail,

922
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,060
to fail it as fast as f'ing possible, right?

923
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,060
It's, I don't want you onion peeling for six months

924
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,300
and then then going, oh, well, my time's up.

925
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,460
I failed.

926
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,460
But again, again, I'm not gonna, it's, I think,

927
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,270
I think we're far more likely to be in agreement here.

928
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,110
We are.

929
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:53,470
This goes back to the point I made about checking in on like,

930
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,350
what's the logical next step?

931
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:57,710
If there are no, if they're going for a big bang delivery

932
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:01,400
at the end, that's gonna get some feedback right away.

933
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,600
Right.

934
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,880
I guess as long as we're making progress,

935
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,440
like what's the next step?

936
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,360
What's the, yeah, what's the next step?

937
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,800
What's the next bit of value we add?

938
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,440
I guess we can have that conversation.

939
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,520
It might take some practice.

940
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,360
I think, I think I'm okay with the dates,

941
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,960
but I can now see why you wouldn't have that.

942
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:22,360
Again, it's gonna take some coaching to get there

943
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,720
to make sure because.

944
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,840
I actually think you could take this and combine it.

945
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,280
Okay. With what?

946
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,040
With our two philosophical ideologies.

947
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,800
Come take what we talked about in terms of the goals

948
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,600
and then combine it with the three questions.

949
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,480
So let's imagine one of your reports had this goal

950
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:48,730
and it's two weeks into something that's six months out.

951
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:49,570
Right.

952
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,330
I think it's important that you continuously check in

953
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:56,780
on those goals and say, all right,

954
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,860
what evidence do you have that your mission,

955
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,140
that this goal is still important?

956
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,740
Like I'll say from my point of view,

957
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,580
one of the biggest things that,

958
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,820
one of the biggest speeches,

959
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:12,820
I am delivering to leaders throughout the company

960
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,860
because I'm getting called in to sort of collaborate

961
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,420
as well as advise on multiple different projects now.

962
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:27,300
And this one team came to me

963
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,700
and then I talked to their leader yesterday,

964
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,900
or at night, talked to them last week

965
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,860
and talked to the leader above the set of group.

966
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,100
And I said, you have a real big problem.

967
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,870
And I said, your team is not,

968
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,470
they're busily going and doing something equivalent.

969
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:50,510
Like I will build this pipeline for localization

970
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:54,000
or I forget what you said, but it's a great example.

971
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,600
And I said, your team is not addressing

972
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,800
the very first and basic question.

973
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,380
Why does the business care?

974
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,930
Why do we care?

975
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,050
So what?

976
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,890
You did this.

977
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,730
How would this have been-

978
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,370
We have that as part of the goal setting

979
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,650
or plan setting session,

980
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,450
but I think what we can do as we go forward

981
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,530
is ask questions like,

982
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,820
is this still the highest priority for your team?

983
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,180
Well, you don't wanna start and then stop, right?

984
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,090
But it's, do we still,

985
00:48:26,090 --> 00:48:28,690
with the best available information,

986
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:33,090
do we still expect to get the return

987
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:34,410
from this investment?

988
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,450
It's gonna be contextual on all these,

989
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,170
but I think there are,

990
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:40,490
I guess the short story is,

991
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:43,370
as long as we talk about these things regularly,

992
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,850
and I remember at Microsoft,

993
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:47,330
we would not look at these often

994
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:49,890
until the week before our connect,

995
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,290
we go, oh, shit, I said I'd do that.

996
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:53,770
Huh, wonder what I did there.

997
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,170
And so I like the idea of getting some plan,

998
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,130
get people used to setting some plans or goals,

999
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:03,170
reviewing them often,

1000
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:05,650
figuring out what works and doesn't work,

1001
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,170
both as far as goal setting and feedback

1002
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:13,650
and trying all these things is all really powerful.

1003
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:16,810
And I guess the revelation I'm trying to share here

1004
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:18,850
is I went from, oh God,

1005
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,730
not a performance management system,

1006
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,130
to, oh my God,

1007
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:24,330
why didn't we have a performance management system?

1008
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,330
It took me several months to get there

1009
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,410
and a lot of reflection and a lot of thinking

1010
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,250
and a lot of just kinda typing away,

1011
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,290
trying to come up with a model that works.

1012
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:36,290
And it sounds like from bouncing it off of you,

1013
00:49:36,290 --> 00:49:40,210
that we're aligned and it sounds like you've made it work,

1014
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:42,650
so I'm feeling more like in a different model

1015
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:44,290
that this should work,

1016
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:46,370
but it's not gonna be easy,

1017
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:47,850
it's gonna take effort.

1018
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:50,610
The issue is, what are you managing

1019
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,050
with the performance management system?

1020
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,050
And-

1021
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,330
See, that's the part I don't like thinking of it,

1022
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,890
like a performance management system,

1023
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:59,930
because it is, to me,

1024
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,370
it's a guideline,

1025
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:07,370
it's a method to achieve business impactful outcomes,

1026
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:11,290
which I want to reward on,

1027
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:16,000
I don't want to reward on the stuff we put into the tool.

1028
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,840
If it can be framed as an employee growth-

1029
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,800
Yeah, that's how I'm framing it for my work.

1030
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,640
I don't even like the word management.

1031
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,040
No, I don't use that either.

1032
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,840
What did you call-

1033
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,800
I like how I refer to it as,

1034
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,320
we're gonna use it as a growth framework.

1035
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,960
Right, if it's a growth framework, I'm all aboard.

1036
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,680
To me, the second you add in the word management-

1037
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,720
Nope, not adding that word.

1038
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,560
Right, it's command-

1039
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:47,880
It was unveiled as a performance management system,

1040
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,760
which hit my, I triggered, made my blood boil,

1041
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,000
but now that I've embraced it

1042
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,520
and looked inside the guts of it

1043
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,040
and kind of made it what I think it can be,

1044
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,240
it's a growth framework and that's how I'm gonna use it

1045
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,440
and it's gonna be effective.

1046
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,280
So for me, summarizing, I think goals are great as long

1047
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,240
because I think it's important for an individual

1048
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,000
have a sense of where they wanna go.

1049
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,200
I do think that it's also important

1050
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,880
to sort of train into that individual

1051
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,520
and evaluation of what's gonna be the investment costs

1052
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,520
and what is gonna be the expected return

1053
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,040
and have an idea around the return.

1054
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,640
Failing to do the return stuff, by the way,

1055
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,120
is how you get all of these, build it

1056
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,240
and they will come, science fair problems.

1057
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:37,560
Feel the dreams, bull crap, yeah.

1058
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,000
Right, and well, so hey, I spent six months doing this,

1059
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,400
now I'm gonna spend the next six months

1060
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,440
setting up roadshow meetings

1061
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,720
and see if I can get anyone to care.

1062
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,640
Nah, no, no, no, that's, again,

1063
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,000
what I like about this is more chance

1064
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,480
to check in frequently on how those things are going

1065
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,640
to make sure none of those traps are falling into.

1066
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,000
And then again, my directs won't do that,

1067
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,520
but I don't think, but in modeling that,

1068
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:07,840
as this cascades down, they can catch those things as well.

1069
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,040
I think we can actually get,

1070
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,480
I think good things are gonna happen,

1071
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,320
but you know, I'll keep you all posted.

1072
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,960
Sweet. Sweet, man.

1073
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,240
All right, well, that other topic,

1074
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,960
we're gonna do that next time.

1075
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,800
Good.

1076
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:20,960
Because we, this was fun,

1077
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,400
thank you for this conversation.

1078
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,360
I didn't know if you'd be as interested in it as I was,

1079
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,360
but you were, and I appreciate that.

1080
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,120
I am all about this stuff, right?

1081
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,240
So we've talked about it on the,

1082
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:38,640
like the Kanban method that I've kind of modified, right?

1083
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,120
It's all about teamwork,

1084
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,830
and teamwork takes people,

1085
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:46,390
and you need those people to be engaged.

1086
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:48,270
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1087
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,390
And this is, that is what I want to do.

1088
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:53,390
I want people, and this is getting harder

1089
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:56,230
two years into this pandemic thing, but yeah, all on board.

1090
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:57,830
All right, man, I gotta run, I gotta go,

1091
00:52:57,830 --> 00:53:00,550
but this has been a fun Friday.

1092
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,190
Thanks for being part of episode,

1093
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,830
let me look at my recorder here.

1094
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:05,670
158.

1095
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:08,350
158 of the A.B. testing podcast,

1096
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:10,470
which was way better than 157.

1097
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,990
And then if you wanna go back, listen to 57,

1098
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,030
you're welcome to, but don't.

1099
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,590
Anyway, I am Alan.

1100
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:18,430
I'm Brent.

1101
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,550
We'll see you next time.

1102
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:20,390
Bye.

1103
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:21,940
Wack-a-no-n-
