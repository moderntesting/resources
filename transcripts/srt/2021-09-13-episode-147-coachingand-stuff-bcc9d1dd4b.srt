00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,260
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,360
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show it's day 1000 of the

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,500
pandemic and I'm Alan and I'm Brent maybe it's not day one thousand what it

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,180
is is episode 147 of the AB testing podcast right Brent right if you divide

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,860
it by pie and round up and then square it I'm sure that's close to a number and

7
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,460
then if you speak that number and then play it backward it will be a secret

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,660
message from Brent and I to you all three of our listeners right yeah I'm

9
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:54,340
staring at a Dave Grohl quote are you a fan of the Foo Fighters I'm a fan of Dave

10
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,660
Grohl I like a lot of Foo Fighters songs I think Dave Grohl is really really

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:05,220
cool at it he is really cool like I'm a big fan on YouTube just as a very quick

12
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:13,860
tangent no we don't do tangents on this podcast come on he he he has this thing

13
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,460
where he goes and does gigs and then pulls random people yeah yeah I've seen

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,260
those YouTube videos that's why I'm a Dave Grohl fan he's a cool guy he is

15
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,340
and I'm addicted to those videos the ones where he pulls random people yeah

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,900
yeah these kids that come up and shred and makes him think of firing his band

17
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:37,740
members anyway I'm staring at a David Grohl quote right now that's relevant to

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,180
your last comment right if you if you play a Nickelback song backwards you'll

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,020
hear messages from the devil but even worse if you play it forward you'll hear

20
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:56,460
Nickelback you know man Nickelback are just the band everyone loves to hate

21
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:06,680
and really for good reason yeah we should do a podcast of music reviews we

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:15,060
should review music sure I'm I'm I'm I'm down for that let me see what's good what

23
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,990
have I listened to recently I know I have some deep tangents we could get into but

24
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:30,380
we won't I don't think no let's do a podcast what is I gotta think there is

25
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:38,340
well let me stop it not from our list able to lead with is it is this this

26
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:48,420
thing that we're dealing with ongoing pandemic and the ongoing work from home

27
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:54,110
madness it's not madness I don't mind I don't mind it it's actually good for me

28
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:59,080
but it's getting what I've been thinking about is there's it's been a lot more

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,580
monotonous than the first 25 years of my career there's nothing to break it up

30
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,300
I come to my desk I do a bunch of meetings all day do a little bit of

31
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,700
work and typing and then I do the same thing the next day which is different

32
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,640
then maybe the way most of my career is gone there's things to break it up

33
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,360
there's whether it's travel or an event at work or some social stuff there aren't

34
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,070
enough things in between it's just the same thing every day so I'm doing fine

35
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,750
but I worry on the impact of that on in fact I worry about the impact of that

36
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:43,340
far more than like I just just before we were on here I was watching yet

37
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,630
another anti-mask protest just it's not harming children they're back in school

38
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,350
if they were still being remote there is some harm in that in the long term I'm

39
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm seeing it with my workers I'm seeing it with me we have a big rat hole I'm

40
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,360
gonna go down that I don't want to get to but how are you and your team feeling

41
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,280
like are you feeling burnt out feeling good and energized how's it going I'd

42
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:17,320
say there's a diversity right I am coming into work there's no one here but

43
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:24,400
then I am on constantly on slotted with new and interesting things I guess one

44
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:34,700
one difference between us is so early on when you and I first met you were sort

45
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,820
of anti-manager I will never be a manager something yeah I'm paraphrasing

46
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,580
well and I'll remind listeners why in a moment but I'll let you finish yeah and

47
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,380
so now not only are you a manager right you're you're you're one of those you're

48
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:56,420
the man right you're one of those hippos that suppress the rest of us you're way

49
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:04,740
up there and one thing I guess I have learned that you either haven't learned

50
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:13,220
or have definitely avoided needing to learn it right I have learned that I will

51
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:21,940
never again in my career man I say this with with a knock on wood be a middle

52
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,660
manager because that I am just not wired for that job front the frontline

53
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,180
management is where it's at for me it's the right balance between keeping my hands

54
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:41,780
dirty and and providing strong leadership and I'm able to do that at a high-scope

55
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:48,940
because of the type of job I do like I'm going to senior executives and and

56
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,820
having cogent conversations around strategies to me it's sort of an ideal

57
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:01,910
thing whereas a middle manager job and I wouldn't like are you you're do you

58
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,060
have managers of managers of managers underneath you know that's a lot of

59
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:13,790
managers to count I have some of my direct reports have leads okay one of

60
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,990
their leads has a lead himself so that's as deep as it goes but we're not very

61
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:27,120
deep either my skip level is our CEO right right yeah so I'm trying to decide

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,960
if you're if you're upper management or middle management I don't know but the

63
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,760
there may be a tag on my underwear that tells me let me check in a second yeah

64
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,470
we're pausing anything no my pants are off but so far I'm not sure what I am

65
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:50,940
okay yeah there's a quote out of context could be really bad yeah sure so while

66
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,260
you're thinking I'll go ahead and address the the pin from a moment ago

67
00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:02,290
and you're right I did not want to be a manager at micro at the time I

68
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,570
realized took another realize out Microsoft what we had managers do at

69
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:14,550
Microsoft was it wasn't fun managers would pride themselves on being in

70
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,870
meetings all the time thought it made them feel important and then you got to

71
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,790
be forced to stack rank your team twice a year once a year whatever it was and

72
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,750
that just didn't seem very fun to me I wanted to be able to get stuff done and

73
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,470
the managers that were around me didn't actually get anything done

74
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,310
eventually I learned how to find a role where I could be a manager who could get

75
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,930
stuff done and that worked out much better for me so I like being a manager

76
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,390
now it's working out very well especially in my older age but I get

77
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,950
stuff done and my team gets a whole bunch of stuff done so it's different

78
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,350
than the managers I was exposed to at the time when I was telling you that

79
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,780
because I did truly mean it at the time and there are plenty of reasons to not

80
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,620
want to be a manager at Microsoft in those times yeah in in that case it

81
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,790
wasn't it wasn't so much then that you didn't want to be a manager I didn't want

82
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:18,880
I didn't want to have a job where I was supposed to be a dick all day yeah no

83
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,570
and that's one thing that's one thing that's nice with the the Satya error

84
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:32,930
error it's not how he rolls right it so he he's he's basically starting the train

85
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:39,360
where if you're a dick you're gone good good I think that would be good to see

86
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,040
I think I knew a lot of folks we talked about this for who could be dicks and

87
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:49,020
be aggressive or harassing and it would take Microsoft years to get rid of them

88
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,820
so I love the idea if you're a dick you're gone one thing I really loved

89
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,980
you know as part of the train that's just under Satya as well it used to be

90
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:04,660
Microsoft you poaching was illegal frowned upon you could not go to another

91
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,500
team and try and recruit someone eventually someone on HR got smart and

92
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,770
said you know what if they want to do that that's fine and I remember HR I

93
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:20,240
don't praise HR a lot that Microsoft but they had the sassiest little comment

94
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,490
on their fact and basically said something like hey if poaching is allowed

95
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,290
what happens if my whole team goes to work for other managers and the answer

96
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:36,370
was well that I guess you're not a manager anymore it allows a team to vote

97
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:43,060
with their feet yeah no I mean I haven't seen that comment but the one

98
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:49,100
where HR came out with the guidance of proactively saying there is now no

99
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,060
longer an anti-pooching rule yeah that was right that was a bit of a turning

100
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,380
point to that made stuff a lot easier and one of the comments that they had in

101
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,740
that is we want to make it clear the only way to ensure your employees stay

102
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,870
with you is to make a better environment where they are at than alternatives

103
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:21,680
yeah and I'm like that is fantastic fantastic it sort of sets the stage now

104
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:30,340
that doesn't that doesn't prevent people using fear-based tactics or I didn't

105
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,860
prevent it but the the DNI initiatives have then prevented that tactic so a

106
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,020
fear-based tactic was the case where like let's say you reported to me Alan

107
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,660
and I was a complete dick and and I get the hint that you're leaving and I just

108
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:52,100
point out blank and say hey Alan I'm just gonna be super clear you leave before

109
00:10:52,100 --> 00:11:00,620
this date I am going to completely screw you in your in your connect and make

110
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,660
sure HR is involved and probably get you fired you know whatever that was

111
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:12,150
that was unfortunately common it was a less uncommon at least it's far less

112
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:19,510
common like now it's the the needle has kind of swung the other way it's it's

113
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:26,630
kind of really hard to fire somebody now the latest one I have heard of just

114
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:33,110
just completed last week and it was two years in the process yeah yeah I don't

115
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:37,630
like that at all one thing to bring up along that is you know one of the the

116
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:44,350
straws that broke that mixed metaphor there leading to me leaving Microsoft I

117
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,540
I was in a job I liked the culture wasn't great there was a lot of sucking up my

118
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,060
manager was a complete jerk and Brent mentioned connect earlier that's

119
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,440
Microsoft's version of a perf check-in over review yeah yeah yeah and is the

120
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,240
first time I managed to make it through and I got lucky I made it through 22

121
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,500
years at Microsoft before I had a manager literally make stuff up in my

122
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,080
connect that I didn't do stuff I had never heard of because we didn't even

123
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,880
deliver on this and just nice little WTF and also huh wonder what else is out

124
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:26,160
there moment and he has he has since lit left the company so I can't exactly

125
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
you know check in and see what's happening with that level of dignity

126
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:37,280
because he left on his own accord he got a VP job at some financial place yeah

127
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:43,080
I'm those type of people good riddance no kidding no kidding hey I want to use

128
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,600
this topic to segue and we can always bounce around because we do we had a

129
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,560
question to talk a little bit more about being quality coach and maybe a

130
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,320
day in the life of a quality coach and what it's like and I want to talk about

131
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,040
it a little bit also have a proposition I'll make to you here but it's a segue

132
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,120
because you mentioned to me an episode or two ago when I gave the book called

133
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,320
the coaching habit a big plug yeah that it is there's like a course or required

134
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,520
reading or something around that can you maybe talk a little bit about that

135
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:20,880
in a moment because I think what that book teaches you is that coaching is

136
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,720
different than consulting and often as a quality coach end up doing both you

137
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,160
end up both giving advice and and helping me a bootstrapping some work

138
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,520
getting people on the right board just telling them what to do I would see that

139
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,160
as the consulting hat but the coaching hat is where the long-term stickiness

140
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,280
comes from yes getting people to reflect on what it is they're doing and and why

141
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,130
it's important and why quality is important for customers etc so I want to

142
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,610
hear the story about what how how that's going at Microsoft coaching habit

143
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,850
and tie that in we'll talk a little bit about maybe what I've done in my roles

144
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,610
as a quality coach but what I want to propose to you is you know I haven't done

145
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:08,130
an AB T AB T 343 in a while I will take volunteers if you want to be just you

146
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,920
and me doing a little interview for 20 25 minutes let me know we'll get you

147
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,080
set up and Melissa Eden who's on my team very everyone knows Melissa was on an

148
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,400
AB T 343 but her whole role I mean it's expanding well beyond quality coach now

149
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,560
but it may be good to have her on to talk about her experience doing that

150
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,160
sometime in the near future as well doing quality coach yeah yeah okay cool so

151
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,680
yeah no no I definitely think our audience would love to hear from someone

152
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,680
on the the ground floor of quality coaching right in ideally would be

153
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,320
someone outside of your org right yeah it'd be great so for somebody else doing

154
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,240
it don't contact me too I just right yeah you get a little bit of the unity bubble

155
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,200
when I bring Melissa in well yeah and just to be clear the questions that I

156
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,080
want her to be comfortable answering is like okay what are the difficulties that

157
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:18,040
she didn't she didn't inform you of for you know whatever reason I don't think

158
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,720
anything like that will come up when you go back to maybe our previous

159
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,880
conversation in whatever label you decide to call me one thing I've trained

160
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:35,040
my team very well on is to know that I I have ideas all the time very very few

161
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,320
to none of them are good ideas and they're not afraid to call me out on it

162
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,110
we have a pretty high level of transparency so I don't think there's

163
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:49,120
gonna be any secret sir that would come out I have a similar philosophy with my

164
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:56,040
team I'm like look my a big portion of my job is to make decisions a big

165
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,600
portion of your job is to make sure I'm making good ones yeah what you're gonna

166
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,170
find I'll guess a little bit what she'll talk about and what will we can I do

167
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,130
want to hear the whole coaching a Microsoft story but what I think we'll

168
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:18,990
find is that the difficulty is getting people to care what you have to say you

169
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,510
can't just I can go point at my dog back here and say hey your quality coach now

170
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,160
but the challenge is to build that credibility you know Maxwell talks about

171
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,960
these five levels of leadership first you're put in a position of

172
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,670
leadership been appointed quality coach but second people have to give you

173
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:39,310
permission to lead them so you have to there's work to build that credibility

174
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,530
and and show results and all the things to do that that have to happen before

175
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,050
you can really be successful in that role it's not something you just take a

176
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:54,490
you're not gonna hire a college grad like the old look at the old Microsoft

177
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:00,440
s-debt we get some college folks who are programmers and had a good mindset

178
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,720
for or skills for debugging or analysis and we make them testers you're not

179
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,280
gonna be able to hire someone out of college to be a quality coach you need

180
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,720
experience on the front lines either in probably in testing at this stage but

181
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,210
maybe in agile coaching or working with another quality coach for years it's

182
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:25,670
not a job for a junior or even slightly less than junior employee no no and the

183
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:31,620
thing is like you even you even talked about it right the I would say the

184
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:44,320
single most important job of any coach period is it's this will be generic

185
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:51,650
statement but it's to make it stick for a for whatever is the important it in

186
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:59,920
that context is make it stick and so I don't see I don't see how you make it

187
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:11,230
stick in a world where where you don't have the experience around around either

188
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:17,910
the topic or interacting with with with other knowledgeable people on the topic

189
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:24,680
yeah I could even to build on your make it stick it's to sustainably improve

190
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:30,290
performance does that work for the yes coach as well as the quality coach yes

191
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:37,890
actually that that I like and if you if you underline the term sustainably then

192
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,410
then I'm I'm a hundred percent of board yeah I like that definition yeah you

193
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,200
got to teach people to fish yeah tell me I want to hear the story but keep I

194
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,400
keep on sidetracking you but tell me the story about what's happening with the

195
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,810
coaching habit and coaching at Microsoft um well I would say right now the story

196
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:10,090
is is is nascent we'll see so so Microsoft has in this this started up

197
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:19,580
officially last year they did a study that that essentially showed that there's

198
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:28,180
a lot of crappy managers and yeah and the the the problem is is that there's a

199
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:36,340
diversity around the definition of what is a good or a crappy manager so the one

200
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,540
thing that Microsoft is doing is they're they're aligning with essentially the

201
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:51,980
the statement that that you just said right my job as a manager right back in

202
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,580
back in the day we would have conversations around what's the job of a

203
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,940
manager right and some people would go oh it's purely people group some people

204
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,300
like well it's no no no they need to manage the project and then of course

205
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,580
just some place in between and as an aside for leads in my org it's they know

206
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,540
they are responsible for three things people project and tech they have to

207
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,700
manage the people they have to do the project management estimation delivery

208
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,020
for their team and they have to be the technical leader for their team of course

209
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,180
they can if as the team grows they can delegate a little bit of that they can

210
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,100
have if they have a senior IC on their team to do some mentoring and coaching

211
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,780
or just technical leadership that's fine too but they're ultimately

212
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:42,050
responsible for people product and tech people project and tech right so so so

213
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:48,650
project and tech would fall into the would be two subcategories of the the

214
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:53,410
prior category I mentioned the people project in tech I'm in alignment with that

215
00:20:53,410 --> 00:21:02,250
so what Microsoft is doing is you could essentially say is no actually we need

216
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:08,970
all three very similar to what you're saying although on the project side or

217
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:18,640
there's multiple different ways to to skin that cat so they are putting in what

218
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,720
they've identified is of course the greatest weakness is around the people

219
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:36,390
side because a lot most managers that Microsoft in my view were were promoted

220
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:45,710
were the best I see at whatever the task at hand is and so there's a struggle

221
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:54,740
often whenever I get a new mentee that just got promoted to a lead job right one

222
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,100
of the first and most valuable lessons I teach them is what got you here ain't

223
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:06,900
gonna get you there right that the now that you've accepted this this lead job

224
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:13,820
be aware that even though you are probably still the best IC on your team

225
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,610
you need to view that skill set is completely useless otherwise you're gonna

226
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:29,450
burn out just completely fast but you can't be a lead and the number one IC on

227
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:34,200
the project that you just don't have that ability you have to now learn how to

228
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,580
scale it so one thing we do in my org just to and that anti-pattern of taking

229
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,740
the IC oh you're the best IC you're gonna be the manager we say we saw that

230
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,330
a lot and there are some definite traps there some of those people grew

231
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,890
into good managers so that's okay and I mentioned so unfortunately we've gone

232
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:02,710
the other direction in my org where I I need more leads and I have a bunch of

233
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,610
people who go no I want to be an IC they don't want to be a lead and it's

234
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:11,520
good and then when we do have someone who wants to be a lead we put them in a

235
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,800
provisional lead rule so we don't move the headcount change we have them begin

236
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,980
to we usually take three to sometimes six months of having them we add them

237
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,580
to my leadership meetings they they manage the folks they do everything

238
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:31,140
except for the the basic accounting you have to do in in workday or your or or

239
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,290
head tracks at Microsoft and they get a chance to try it like it's a try before

240
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:40,170
you buy on both sides they get an opportunity to see if it's what they

241
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,950
want to do if they like it and if they're good at it and I get an

242
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:48,630
opportunity to see how well they do that so that helps out a lot we never

243
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,750
just put someone into a lead position and say okay you're a lead now good luck

244
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:58,470
it's they they get a chance to test it out which has been very successful so

245
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:04,040
far okay so they get a chance remembering that we're talking about

246
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:11,020
coaching now but anyway right there a be testing in their tangents yeah no no

247
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:20,470
the the issue I see I guess my question is what's the common reason why they

248
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:27,340
don't want to be a lead they want to focus on keeping their hands dirty as

249
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:34,740
mint in the product as many hours a day as they can also because of the I tell

250
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,230
people this too because we rely on the leads you're responsible for delivery

251
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:45,790
project people management and tech leadership it's being that first-level

252
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:50,250
lead in my org is probably the hardest job we have in my org you have to want

253
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:56,290
to do it it's a challenge and I think it's so much of a challenge I think it

254
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:01,690
it's a lot of it's daunting for a lot of folks to go that's I know that's a lot of

255
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,410
change I don't want to do all that I know I don't want to try to fix it now

256
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,930
but that to me if I were in your role that would be something I would want to

257
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:21,040
look into is is do we have the right amount of friction in place for those on

258
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:28,130
our on our bench to to to little friction and too much friction both are

259
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,080
bad yeah it's not we don't have to be clear it's not like we're trying to hire

260
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,000
for a lead and have open heads we have a couple of teams are a little flatter

261
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,600
than we'd like in the long run but also what we have at the same time is a set

262
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,080
of leads and managers across the org who are all really really good at being a

263
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:53,450
leader a manager well that's that's a good problem yeah so it's not horrible I

264
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,890
think long-term they're looking at when I'm looking at two to three to five year

265
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,730
growth and what's happening assuming I live that long which is you know fairly

266
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,290
likely I do need to look at capacity and growth and where we'll need to add

267
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:13,410
people so it's just something I think about I don't have I have a pretty good

268
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:19,810
I'm getting to a bench for me but that long-term bench there's some holes it

269
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,410
just a problem for me to address I don't think it's a given what we have I'm not

270
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,410
going to change the principles of what that baseline for what leads to do

271
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:34,770
because that's working in the long run I can hire strategically to take care of

272
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,470
that I'm not I'm not worried about it but it's something I want I'll need to

273
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,710
take care of at some point all right so going back to the coaching story oh yeah

274
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:49,630
yeah yeah all right going back to the coaching story right so there's a bunch of

275
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:57,590
required training that's that's being pushed pushed down and so they created a

276
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:06,070
synchronous gamified training around the coaching habit I think this is the this

277
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:12,550
is one of the things that the author of the coaching habit has done although so

278
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,830
he produced a lot of videos and in those videos he mentions Microsoft quite a bit

279
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,910
so I think I've never I've read the book I've never watched the videos so I'll

280
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:30,410
trust you well so no so I think I think the content he built was for Microsoft

281
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:37,930
but he's definitely put together like I wouldn't be surprised if he's if he's

282
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:43,770
turning what he's done into more of a self-serve business because by doing the

283
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:49,360
right set of videos and then they added gamification in automatic requirements

284
00:27:49,360 --> 00:28:01,000
like the training is very self-serve and you're kind of forced to to learn as

285
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,600
you go through it if you can't you can't proceed until you have enough

286
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,720
points and you can't get points unless you you know answer the questions and

287
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:18,720
things like that it was six weeks long I would say one of the problems is that

288
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:26,360
they they set it up with pairs so I was in a cohort that had four four members

289
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:33,010
and in week one I was to pair with one person and week two a different person

290
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:41,820
etc in my particular cohort I was only able to have one of those meetings because

291
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:53,750
one of the one of the problems with with how how it was set up is it was very easy

292
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:00,550
for it there's a new culture shift on managers and a lot of the managers were

293
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:07,360
like oh crap this is started and there's not really a sense of the time

294
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,160
commitment they say oh it's gonna cost you like an hour a week no no no no it

295
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:19,650
does not cost you an hour it costs you significantly more than and the meeting

296
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:24,370
starts showing up and it's it was on it was unusual because it was self-serve

297
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,210
whereas a lot of these training meetings like you have to go to the tenant

298
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:32,090
conference and there's a moderator or a conference call and there's a moderator

299
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,240
this was different I've gone through the training I have right here like lots

300
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,890
of my notes you can't see it because I have a background and and also the

301
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:51,130
people in our podcast can't see it either that's oh yeah there's that but I

302
00:29:51,130 --> 00:30:00,290
actually have the one page bookmarked because I have found that that going

303
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:09,400
through the enumeration of questions is so friggin useful so he talks about the

304
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:17,520
seven powerful questions and I find that doing that and find the structure is

305
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:25,240
absolutely useful it allows you to very readily avoid what he calls the advice

306
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:33,000
monster right that's remember I think consultants give advice and coaches ask

307
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,160
questions so I'm gonna interrupt I'll let you go on in a second but I want to

308
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,800
tie this a little bit into quality coaching because these questions are

309
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,360
they lead off with something like the old how's it going what's on your mind yep

310
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,400
I forget I get the kickstart question yep it's like just get it started kind of

311
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,920
kind of see what's going on there and he goes a big escalation on why it works

312
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:58,560
and why it's important and then there's the the the and what else so this is

313
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,240
great for one-on-ones too but for coaching I may come to go to Brent and

314
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,800
say hey Brent what's on your mind I'm trying to get this release I'm

315
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,220
just listing this point where I'm not giving advice and what else oh and that

316
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:22,270
it makes you stop they pull what else is on my mind oh crap we have I yeah I have

317
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:27,350
a team X is asking me for something and trying to figure out how I can do that

318
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:34,420
so now you've gotten a little bit into what's going on and then the one I

319
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,420
use them one-on-ones a lot I use it today and it almost every time I ask it

320
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:44,110
even though my directs have heard this question a lot of times for me doesn't

321
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:48,030
matter if they've heard it from me once twice ten times before when I pull this

322
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,980
one out which isn't every week I spread it up but they all go that's a great

323
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,600
question and I ask what's the real challenge for you here they go oh good

324
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,320
question well and that's why I start again I'm just gathering information but

325
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,960
it's getting them to think about it well the real challenge is probably

326
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,840
dealing with team X who wants that thing for me it wasn't the first thing on

327
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,720
their mind but because you asked and what else you got them thinking about what's

328
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,960
going on and then when you asked what's the real challenge this thing's actually

329
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,590
taking a lot of my time getting this thing to happen so then the foundation

330
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:32,610
question you ask well well what do you want I want team X to be satisfied so

331
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,130
they could leave me like a focus on this delivery I'm confident we can get

332
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,530
the delivery and the quality built in place but my team and I are distracted

333
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:45,410
though a lot all kinds of notes go with that and then the lazy question how can I

334
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:51,120
help and there might be even a flippant answer like well you can go tell team X

335
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,480
to f off but maybe an answer of maybe nothing I don't know of anything okay and

336
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,120
you don't have to try again don't be tempted to give that advice you're

337
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,760
trying to get them to figure it out themselves coaching is you get them to

338
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:08,510
figure it out themselves but there may be something they think you can do well

339
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,230
actually do you know this lead of team X maybe maybe that connection will help

340
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:18,540
those things happen all the time and then the strategic question is is like

341
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:22,520
this is digging a little bit deeper it's almost advice I think but you're

342
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,080
asking questions like do you have anybody in your team already working on

343
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,880
this who else have you talked to about this that may be able to help

344
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,640
things like that you're trying to get them to are there things you could

345
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,600
things that I can take off your plate that would give you time to do this and

346
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:41,840
then the learning question at the end is again imagine I've coached you I'm trying

347
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,600
to help you get your delivery done which as far as I'm concerned as part of

348
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,560
quality at least it is for this example we finished that conversation I haven't

349
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,520
given you advice I've asked you questions to make you think about how to solve it

350
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,720
and at the end and I'll do this someone-on-one sometimes as well I

351
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,280
don't do them every week because I don't like to be predictable but I'll

352
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,980
ask what was most useful for you what comes out of that is some feedback to

353
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:15,260
you as a coach on well I found that just actually until I talked to you I didn't

354
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,500
realize that the thing on team X was such a big deal for so thank you for

355
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,260
that it reinforces it helps so that's that's it that's the seven the flavors

356
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:30,660
of the seven questions but they work in a freaking multitude infinite not

357
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:35,260
infinite but yeah infinite numbers of scenarios and they're fantastic and

358
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,620
remember remembering to do that and not as I forget the office name Ryan somebody

359
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:46,180
not falling into the the clutches of the advice monster is huge huge and getting

360
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:52,980
people to get stuff done okay back to you Brett so it's interesting because

361
00:34:53,340 --> 00:35:02,390
you literally in order read off everything I had listed here except you skipped

362
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:10,540
over what I had as question number five and you you you skipped over my question

363
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:16,730
number five you did how can I help this questions five then you added a new

364
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:22,290
question six so I'm wondering if he's changed his content because I'm pretty

365
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:28,290
sure you got that from the book but what I have is question number five so this

366
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:35,290
piggybacks after you ask what do you want then then the follow-up question to

367
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:43,200
that is what are you going to say yes to and if you do what then will you have

368
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:51,230
to say no to oh that's a that's a good coaching question by itself right it's

369
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:56,150
sort of a it's sort of for this forces them to understand okay what are the

370
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:02,070
trade-offs yeah so I actually love questions like that when people come to

371
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:11,300
me and say I am so busy I have too much to do yeah and then we have that that

372
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:19,360
question followed by some advice or consulting on prioritization everybody

373
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:26,200
gets the same number of hours in a day right how you choose to prioritize that

374
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:32,980
time the selects what you can say yes to and what you can say no to and no this

375
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,340
is not I'm not knocking anybody all the time I can't I have never in my history

376
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:43,620
of not just managing but mentoring I have never in never gone very long

377
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,660
without encountering people who did not know how to say no to things and not

378
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,540
because they wanted to be nice they just like well that's cool I'll do that

379
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,340
that's cool too I'll do that well I want to do that too and all of a sudden they're

380
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,740
going I can't get all my work done because I'm deadlocked oh so I I'm

381
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:09,620
afflicted by that same problem but for me it's I evaluate I go oh that sounds

382
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:16,960
really freaking cool and and I think I could get that done in like two hours

383
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:27,560
yeah right so but then it isn't until I'm working on my fourth straight day on the

384
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:39,080
same thing that I am reminded of how bad I am at estimation yeah the bulk of my and

385
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,520
related the bulk of my growth as a manager and leader has been learning how

386
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:50,260
to be a ruthless delegator and I have now empowered like I had a situation today

387
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,260
where there was a thing that I was going to do that one of my employees took off

388
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,060
my plate they delegated it to themselves and in my head for a second I

389
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,460
thought but but I want to do it I thought oh my god they are a genius yeah

390
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:10,540
yeah actually so I have a couple of people that will will do that and they

391
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:21,340
come to me and they they they come to me and they they're so polite and they're so

392
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:29,510
diplomatic and as they as they're like kind of they they all have the same

393
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:36,840
story they first walked through the why hey I was doing this and then this and

394
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,240
then this and the strong-out story because they want they want me to have

395
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,550
all their facts but the end story is Brent I'm taking this from you you're too

396
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:53,270
busy you you're you know whatever they're variant of you suck which almost

397
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:58,110
ninety ninety five percent of the time whatever it is that they're explaining

398
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:04,530
that they don't want to say around Brent sucks I I mean I will be the first to

399
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:08,720
agree so that was a worthwhile tangent but I want you to go back and repeat

400
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,720
that question and then back into the other differences between the questions

401
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,440
from the ones oh I'm sorry no sorry this is fun well so the close-out what

402
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,800
I roll man close out what I was saying is that when they finally got to to

403
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:31,600
their ass and I'm like oh my god what a rollercoaster yeah George like they

404
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:42,250
they they do not understand how hungry I am for them to step up and take things

405
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:53,320
from me absolutely being the answer is yes every single time today I handed off of

406
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:00,440
one small project that I was owning to one of my ICs it was like I gave him

407
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:10,800
candy it so it was a net win and for me I have learned that one-offs I can do I

408
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,400
can be on but but things that are gonna last longer than a month in terms of

409
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,920
being useful the business I have no business being on it then I need I need

410
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,020
to have a need to plan for that to be delegated if not up front very quickly

411
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:36,140
after there's a lot of things around my job that honestly I am the the the best of

412
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:44,600
my team so I do a lot of bootstrapping stuff but that so anyway back to the

413
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:52,960
question there we go yeah what are you going to say yes to and if you do what

414
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,120
are you going to say no to I like that question all right and then what else

415
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:07,190
was different so you had some question in between how can I help and what was most

416
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:14,700
useful here that I don't have so does he talk about the strategic question what

417
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,120
did you call this strategic question actually this strategic question is the

418
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,590
yes no one the flavor I use there is I guess there's a version that there's a

419
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:28,870
question there that in his strategic questions the version it's a little

420
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:34,270
where I said who else have you talked to about this what what have you tried or

421
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:38,910
what do you what can we take off your plate to make this work your question I

422
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:43,310
think is better there but that's the strategic question from his number when

423
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,590
you gave me is actually number that's if it's strategic which is how you

424
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:50,950
described it it fits in that bucket but that's the original question number

425
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:56,670
six is I have it as as question five and then how can I help his number is

426
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:01,350
question six okay maybe he flipped those around because I had how can I help

427
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,630
as the one before it those two are just flipped in our in our in our renditions

428
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:13,100
so yeah just do your little goog everyone do a little Google searchy

429
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,660
searchy thing check out the coaching habit you know there's a chance not a

430
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:23,060
good chance there's a chance there'll be a link in the show notes but people

431
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,340
don't look at those anyway it's way faster just to bring up a search engine

432
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,220
like Google or Duck Duck Go what's the one does Microsoft make still make a

433
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:38,910
search engine yeah you can use bong go to ball is it something like that and you

434
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:42,950
can type in the coaching habit and you'll find this website and the book

435
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:50,070
and it's really good so Brent screen-sharing actually and I like so

436
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:55,710
it's interesting your your search so maybe it's updated from the book because

437
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,030
you're or maybe I just wrote it down wrong I'm wondering that right but I also

438
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,110
like this question even better if you're saying yes to this what are you saying

439
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:11,150
no to I think that's more succinct yeah and by this it's the Brent in oh it's

440
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:14,950
cool he used Google he typed co he searched for coaching habit seven

441
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,950
questions and the very top list is very similar to the questions he and I

442
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:24,310
just talked through so you can use those to help with it's really a day in the

443
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:29,110
life let me we got like nine minutes left here eight might be five minutes left here

444
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,230
oh next episode no I think we'll do the other topic so next time I'll go ahead

445
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:39,110
and tease for it next time Brent's gonna tell me why safe isn't as bad as I

446
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:46,800
think it is and also why it may not be needed anymore something like that do

447
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,360
you want me to clarify the cliffhanger no what I want it's it's something like

448
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,880
that just listen to 148 and you'll find out if we remember to talk about it you

449
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,120
never know so let me talk a little bit about what when I've been in a quality

450
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:08,130
coaching role or part-time role what that's like so some of it is because

451
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:13,670
you usually it's it's kind of like if you look at the embedded tester on an

452
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:20,250
agile team that is kind of a coach but now imagine you are the embedded tester

453
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:25,770
for 10 teams or 20 teams you are probably not going to go in there and do

454
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:30,330
their testing when you're like how agile testing is described everyone on the

455
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:35,450
team does testing everyone has a priority around quality that embedded tester

456
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:41,600
who's typically part of an agile team in the worst case they're doing all the

457
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:45,360
testing for the team they're not coaching but in a case we're actually

458
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,240
following agile principles and doing what the teams who are good at this do the

459
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:56,960
person in that role is helping that team understand what are the quality

460
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,000
challenges what testing do we need to do and eventually those folks are getting

461
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,520
better at that now as you expand that and you say okay now I'm the the

462
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:11,840
embedded tester or the quality coach for 10 teams the time you spend with those

463
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:18,720
teams is less do you spend exactly one tenth of your time with each team no you

464
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,270
spend time I may spend all of my time with one team because they have

465
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:30,510
particular challenges you use context to figure out where you should spend your

466
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,950
time to use things like the quality culture transition guide to help teams

467
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:38,430
figure out where they are what improvements you may want to want to

468
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,670
make and help them figure out how to do them you're doing coaching asking

469
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,910
questions to get them realize what they need to do get them focused on solving

470
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:52,560
customer problems if they're not all kinds of stuff like that there was

471
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,640
something else really important oh one super cool thing it's great to have a

472
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,720
quality coach or have that quality coaching hat on and sit in on the team

473
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,820
retros because it's a great place to offer advice I and other quality coaches

474
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,660
have pulled out that quality culture transition guide during a retro and say

475
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:15,820
well here this may help here or talk about how you can this problem could

476
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,060
have been solved if we would have built quality in a little bit better in this

477
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:24,660
particular way you know should we add a linter here or how can we why don't we

478
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,300
add memory monitoring to this this cluster so we can keep an eye on that in

479
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,860
the future how do we prevent these things whatever the typical stuff that

480
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,740
comes up that brainstorming that comes up in a retro helping teams think about

481
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:40,540
things from a quality perspective when they may want to do it from a perspective

482
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:43,140
of someone who doesn't have the experience and breadth and testing you do

483
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:48,620
so those sorts of things there's my little bit of a nutshell of it's not a

484
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:52,980
whole day and we'll get a quality coach or two on here in the coming weeks and

485
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,120
months to help us walk through it and give some more ideas I think it is

486
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,080
worth it especially it starts to give a picture of what principle seven is like

487
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,960
when you don't have a debt you don't have dedicated quality specialist you may

488
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,240
have a quality coach that quality coach could be the agile coach could be a hat

489
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,200
someone wears it's worth talking about I think that captures it at a high level

490
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,800
yes Brent no I completely agree

491
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,860
all right so that's a start we definitely get back into that we'll

492
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:32,740
talk about safe that ended up being a much cooler conversation than I thought I

493
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:39,490
can't congratulations to Microsoft do you see on doing coaching do you see these

494
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:45,410
coaching habits actually a bit of this way books called the coaching habit do you

495
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:52,870
see these questions becoming a habit among leaders and managers at Microsoft

496
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:58,390
you see them doing more coaching yet as a result of this training or is it yet

497
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:07,190
no so the answer to your first question is is no I don't see it but the second

498
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:14,380
question I guess the first question is as well why and I think a big part of it

499
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:21,020
is goes back to your initial of the podcast right everyone's kind of working

500
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:31,180
from home teams are kind of isolated right it's I don't know that Microsoft has

501
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:38,460
really sort of I don't know that too many teams have really come up with a good way

502
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:44,780
to figure out sort of the random coaching opportunities that would be

503
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:55,440
publicly visible right the the so when in person thing like somebody comes to my

504
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,440
office randomly I can use that as a coaching moment is something that they

505
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,800
they talk about like coaching should take 10 minutes or less so says the

506
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:13,790
author so in order to really see that you really need to have like I would

507
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:17,830
need to be in like public meetings where coaching events could occur with other

508
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:26,510
management peers now I will say I do see it it's just not brought yeah so that's

509
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:32,070
something to work on one thing one maybe last thing is we have grassroots

510
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:38,600
kicked off some coaching clubs kind of like your your group so I have a group

511
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:43,160
and they listen to the podcast so hey everyone a group of folks I've been

512
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,320
meeting with regularly for a while now and we just it grew out of some my old

513
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,560
team but we've been giving each other coaching practicing giving and receiving

514
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,040
coaching in a group of four or five people I would have done it long enough

515
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,840
that we wanted to split it up so we've now broken into three groups and added

516
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:03,600
more people to see if we can organically spin up these coaching clubs

517
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,990
across more and more people at the company so phase two multiple coaching

518
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:14,190
clubs just starting but that'll help I think getting the chance to practice

519
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:21,720
giving and receiving feedback is time well invested all right yeah yeah okay man

520
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,400
I got a run but this was fun time flew by I know we started a little late

521
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,480
because I had some technical difficulties here on the A's side of the EB testing

522
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,120
podcast if you read my five for Friday I got a new desk and because I have a

523
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:39,360
new desk I had to move where my microphone was it's a long story and I

524
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,640
didn't quite get it done as fast as I wanted to and then Brant made me change

525
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,840
levels and blah blah blah and yeah and we're done so thank you for listening to

526
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:52,360
episode 147 of the AB testing podcast where we don't talk about AB and we

527
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,720
sometimes talk about testing but we always talk about things that we think

528
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,440
may be relevant may be interesting if you have other ideas please let us know
