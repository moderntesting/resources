00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,460
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,980
Now, on with the show.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,940
Hey, hey, Brent.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,980
Hey, Alan.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,100
It's time for another episode of A.B. Testing.

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,140
Do you know what number we are?

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:28,140
I do.

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,140
I looked it up this time.

11
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,260
Are we 130?

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,420
We are.

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,300
I mean, I have only one real job on the podcast.

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,140
And last time you just went forward without me.

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,620
I know.

16
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,780
And I think I got it wrong.

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,980
Was that last time or the time before I got it wrong?

18
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,380
It was last time.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,460
What did I call it last time?

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,820
128?

21
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:46,580
Yeah, you were.

22
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,140
And it was 129?

23
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,940
Or are we just permanently off by one now?

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,900
No, no.

25
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,500
We're good?

26
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:51,820
We're good?

27
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,900
You correctly corrected it in editing.

28
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,500
Wow.

29
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:57,980
Nice.

30
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,380
Yeah.

31
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,780
So on my little recording device, it's just called 130.

32
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,700
So I guessed well.

33
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,620
That was my guess.

34
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,580
I was going to double check with you.

35
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,980
So here we are recording on Friday.

36
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,460
This will come out on Monday, November 2,

37
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,650
which is one day before the US election.

38
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,490
And I have never in my life been so nervous over an election.

39
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,490
Over an election that 538 says currently Joe Biden,

40
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,210
well, anyone who's not Trump, has a 90% chance

41
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,650
of winning the election.

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,940
But I am still nervous because it comes down

43
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:45,020
to what three or four or five states decide to do,

44
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,380
which seems really fair.

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,700
That's what people wanted when they made up

46
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,980
electoral college for sure.

47
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,820
There's crap going on to stop people from voting.

48
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,300
There's crap going on to try and throw candidates under the bus

49
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,620
four years ago.

50
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,420
I wasn't the biggest Hillary fan either,

51
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,380
but I think Trump's a piece of crap.

52
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,380
But I was confident that he was going to go away and do

53
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,060
his talk show.

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,420
And then crap happened.

55
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,140
And I have not been happy.

56
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,180
And not because I don't like him.

57
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,680
It's not because I don't like him.

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,180
It's because of the things he's done that make me not like him.

59
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,020
Short story is, welcome to the AB testing political podcast.

60
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,420
I'm Alan and do my NPR voice.

61
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,140
And now over to Brian.

62
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:39,140
So you were mentioning, you were hinting

63
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,940
as we were talking, you have a prediction.

64
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,200
And you being the data scientist,

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,560
I hope it's not based on data.

66
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,880
And I hope it doesn't just, I have a knot in my chest

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,080
talking about this.

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,720
But what do you, what are you nervous about?

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,440
What are you thinking about?

70
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:04,520
So I will, I will share with you what my thought process is.

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,560
And then I will assure the three.

72
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,800
This is entirely based on non data sources.

73
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,160
It's, it's, it's more based on you remember back in the day,

74
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,520
when you and I were laughed at repeatedly because we saw

75
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,440
that within the next three years,

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,560
the whole of Microsoft was going to get rid of tests.

77
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,000
I do recall this.

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,960
Yes.

79
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,560
Well, I wasn't the data scientist then,

80
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,200
but, but my prediction kind of comes from that same space.

81
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,400
So you and I tend to pay attention to what's going on

82
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,880
in the world around us and not in an echo chamber

83
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,320
or even the bubble we live in.

84
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,280
So yeah.

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,840
First off, I'm pretty sure I've mentioned that on the,

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,480
the podcast, right?

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,390
I don't think Alan's ever mentioned it,

88
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,590
but he's, he, what party he's affiliated with,

89
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,190
but he definitely has Democrat leanies.

90
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,670
Well, I had never thought about it much

91
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,150
until the last four years.

92
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,470
My viewpoint is I think people should be allowed

93
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,230
to do what they want as long as it doesn't hurt other people.

94
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,830
And I think people should be treated fairly.

95
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,230
If that affiliates me with a party, then it go ahead.

96
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,670
I believe in the golden rule.

97
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,550
One party is closer to that, at least than the other.

98
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,390
It's interesting.

99
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,270
You say it that way.

100
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,830
Cause your first statement, I completely agree.

101
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,270
I haven't thought about your second statement enough

102
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,150
to decide how I feel.

103
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,310
The problem with deciding that whether or not people

104
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,790
are treated fair is fair as a subjective term,

105
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,790
but I do believe that people should be allowed

106
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,190
to live their lives as they see fit.

107
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,470
I'll just say I am a libertarian,

108
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,710
which means no matter who I talk to,

109
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,070
no matter who I talk to,

110
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,130
I can agree with them that the other guy is an idiot.

111
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,870
And in this case, like we keep hearing that,

112
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,710
that this is about to go into a two party system blows rant.

113
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,510
Oh, a two party system does blow.

114
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,990
Everyone knows that it's idiotic.

115
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,670
We keep hearing- I want rank choice voting

116
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,470
and no electoral college and term limits.

117
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,070
Oh, term limits for everyone.

118
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,350
I'm so with you.

119
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,130
Those are my, I'm gonna run for something.

120
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,910
Class president of the AB testing podcast.

121
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,470
And those are the three things I want.

122
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,650
I want rank choice voting

123
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,030
so we can get other parties involved.

124
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,550
Even if it takes a while to get them to grow,

125
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,030
I want to get rid of electoral college

126
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,750
because it doesn't make sense anymore.

127
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,190
I'm sorry.

128
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,010
Your arguments are invalid and I want term limits

129
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,760
because just turn on the news and you'll see why.

130
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,400
Let me, I'll just quickly glance through

131
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,640
sort of my philosophy and then give you my prediction.

132
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,320
Meanwhile, the listeners are like,

133
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,240
fast forward 30 seconds, still politics.

134
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,320
Fast forward 30 seconds, still politics.

135
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,400
All right, go on.

136
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,280
Up next on the AB testing podcast,

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,060
religions and which one's right.

138
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,730
I don't know if I can do anymore, man.

139
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,050
So, right now with the two party system,

140
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,050
I actually view the Democrats and the Republicans

141
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,250
as the opposite sides of one very stupid coin.

142
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,610
And the way I view that they differ is the Democrats

143
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:58,370
offer freedom and independence on social issues

144
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,210
but want control of fiscal issues.

145
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:04,570
The Republicans are the exact opposite.

146
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,650
Like the best thing the Republicans as an example

147
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,570
could do for their party is boot the religious right out.

148
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,570
And I think that would attract a large number of centrists

149
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,570
but I am not in a role for political advisement.

150
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,690
A libertarian kind of goes, no,

151
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,530
we want the freedom and independence

152
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,970
on both sides of that coin.

153
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,810
And for those who aren't aware,

154
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,970
the opposite side of a libertarian

155
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,250
is a socialist where as I was saying,

156
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,290
no, no, we want the government to sort of be a big part

157
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,850
and regulate both sides.

158
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,810
Now, that said, so at least on one of those pivots,

159
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,940
you and I agree, my prediction for this election,

160
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,100
I will state that it's a three-parter.

161
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,200
Sadly, I believe Trump will win.

162
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,600
I hope to God you're wrong.

163
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,560
I very strongly believe he will win.

164
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,640
I can even articulate why I think that.

165
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't want you to because I don't believe you.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay, good.

167
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,400
The second thing I believe is he will be impotent.

168
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,400
I think the Democrats will control enough of Congress

169
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,760
that essentially the next four years will be a no-up.

170
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,280
The checks and balances haven't worked the last four years.

171
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,050
It's been a wreck.

172
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,010
It's been an absolute wreck.

173
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,490
Yes, completely agree.

174
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,130
The third thing, and this is the thing

175
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,210
that I am worried about, you asked what I'm worried about.

176
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,490
It's the third thing.

177
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,760
If I am right on the first one,

178
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,480
it doesn't matter if I'm right on the second one.

179
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,320
If I am right on the first one,

180
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,600
I do think the third thing will happen.

181
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,790
And that is literally America will burn.

182
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,890
Yep, I believe you are correct.

183
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,890
And there are signs of what I will call

184
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,650
political blackmail already occurring.

185
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,370
A buddy of mine, and now I haven't confirmed this,

186
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,010
but a buddy of mine was mentioning

187
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,730
that in his neighborhood, he had heard, right?

188
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,930
So this is now a three level indirection.

189
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,930
He had heard of pamphlets being distributed to houses

190
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,770
in suburbs saying if Trump wins,

191
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,850
this house will be damaged or destroyed

192
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,530
or something like that.

193
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,730
Right, Am.

194
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,410
So it's conspiracy land.

195
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,690
Yeah, I don't want to, look.

196
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,290
The thing I'm saying on this front,

197
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,650
the fact that rumors like that are even coming

198
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
is what worries me.

199
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,860
I don't care what the thing is.

200
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,700
All right, I'm gonna close this out

201
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,740
because the listeners are super, super bored.

202
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,580
You know, I could only hope that,

203
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,980
I don't believe you on point two.

204
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,980
If Trump wins, I think he's gonna continue to incite hate.

205
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,100
I do not affiliate myself with a political party

206
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,180
so I think the two party system is broken.

207
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
It doesn't help that you're being a libertarian,

208
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,500
just those are your political views,

209
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,940
doesn't give you a candidate to vote for

210
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,020
because you can only vote for one of the two.

211
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,260
I got a candidate to vote for.

212
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,340
Yeah, it's a wasted vote.

213
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,700
Yeah, and it's already been,

214
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,580
my wasted vote has already been sent.

215
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,020
If a fraction of the voters that voted

216
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,620
for the third party candidate in the swing states

217
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,020
where Trump barely won voted for Hillary instead,

218
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,710
we'd have a different crappy president right now.

219
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,750
Yes, that's absolutely true.

220
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,050
The data will tell you that.

221
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,690
So anyway, again, I don't like either party.

222
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,060
That's a concern this time too though, right?

223
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:04,060
Right, because there are actually a lot of left leaning folks

224
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,740
who are essentially.

225
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,380
Hopefully aren't so stupid

226
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,700
to know that their vote is wasted.

227
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,540
And again, because of our lovely electoral college,

228
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,780
your vote only counts if you live in one of 10 states.

229
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,300
Otherwise, nobody gives a crap

230
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,020
who your presidential vote is for

231
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,060
other than bragging rights for the popular vote,

232
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,020
which I guarantee, unfortunately again,

233
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,060
I guarantee Biden will win the popular vote.

234
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,580
I think it's a 0% chance.

235
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,020
Anyway, let's go on with the podcast.

236
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,220
There's your political commentary.

237
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,420
This is gonna come out Monday.

238
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,580
You can pontificate on this.

239
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,540
I took today off to build some furniture

240
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,540
and to putter around the house

241
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,180
because I, as I mentioned last time,

242
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,420
I wasn't earning any more vacation days.

243
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,280
I am taking Wednesday off as an election recovery day.

244
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,760
I plan to stay up late watching and either crying

245
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,920
or being relieved.

246
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,960
I don't know if I'll celebrate,

247
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,580
but I will be up late, gonna take Wednesday off,

248
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,780
try and recover, get my mindset for what,

249
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,820
based on whatever happens

250
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,900
and plow into the rest of the year.

251
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,580
So let's get into the podcast proper.

252
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,500
How many minutes have we gone by here?

253
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,420
Okay, about after editing,

254
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,300
maybe 12 minutes into the podcast.

255
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,460
We had a great conversation, a meeting this week.

256
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,780
So my manager, our VP of engineering,

257
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,260
has a weekly meeting with all the people managers

258
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,920
in his org once a week for 30 minutes,

259
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,920
which is actually really good.

260
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,520
It's a way to have the right conversations,

261
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,960
align on some things.

262
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,730
Sometimes it's business, sometimes it's just a,

263
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,810
what do you think?

264
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,490
And I had forgotten.

265
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,130
This is a question that maybe early on

266
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,490
in our relationship,

267
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,610
I remember sitting at that Vietnamese place

268
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,930
having a conversation about this topic

269
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,330
and you had changed your mind since then.

270
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,050
And I hadn't really talked about it much.

271
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,770
I have strong opinions about this.

272
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,050
Well, strong opinions about the ambiguity of this question,

273
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,370
but it generated a lot, a lot of discussion.

274
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,290
So I wanna throw it at you

275
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,170
and maybe for our listeners for comment.

276
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,160
And here's the question.

277
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,040
As a manager, how many people should you manage?

278
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,160
What's the limit?

279
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,790
What's the minimum?

280
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,950
Minimum?

281
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,310
Minimum, if you're gonna be a manager,

282
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,470
how many people can you effectively manage?

283
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,070
I don't think there, well, okay.

284
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,470
So minimum's actually easier than maximum.

285
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,030
No, minimum's one, right?

286
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,870
Minimum's one.

287
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,100
But if I were in an executive role, right?

288
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,780
Would I ever do that?

289
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,980
And of course the answer is no.

290
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,140
I can put constraints around it.

291
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,860
So I remember these days, like back in the day,

292
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,260
it was four or five and at Microsoft,

293
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,980
there was a phase where needed to be a minimum of 20.

294
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,620
This was when Microsoft was heavily laden on managers.

295
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,940
And now it is, I would say the policy

296
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,780
is a bit more laissez-faire.

297
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:21,070
It's, we don't see, you don't see too many small teams

298
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,110
and small teams, if they get constructed,

299
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:30,350
generally you'll see in the next budgetary cycle,

300
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,630
you know, a couple more heads.

301
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,870
Notice how Brent still hasn't answered the question.

302
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,620
Minimum, five.

303
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,580
Maximum?

304
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,700
There it's gonna depend on the person.

305
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,860
What is the answer to any sufficiently complex question?

306
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,780
42.

307
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,140
The answer is it depends.

308
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,740
The answer to any sufficiently complex question is it depends.

309
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,580
Yeah, on that one, but still I wanna come up with a number

310
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,640
and I'm gonna say somewhere around 20-ish is the maximum.

311
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,800
Yeah, and it depends on seniority,

312
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,020
what you're working on, et cetera.

313
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,860
I'm flat, flat, flat, flat, flat.

314
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,220
And I fully believe, yeah, you can manage,

315
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,500
I don't know if I go as high as 20.

316
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,460
I currently have 11 direct reports.

317
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,820
I feel pretty good about that.

318
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,020
People say, oh, it's so many.

319
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,220
And I think, no, I think I'm under control.

320
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:26,480
But there was a lot of pushback on the team

321
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,040
from having a high number of direct reports,

322
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,600
like more than eight.

323
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,450
So Brent, how do you manage a team of 20?

324
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,410
A standup with 20 people is untenable.

325
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,420
A standup with 20 people is untenable.

326
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,680
It's not the same topic.

327
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,080
Yeah, yes.

328
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,360
That was an area of pushback that made me go

329
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,520
from leaning back in my chair, going along with to,

330
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,920
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

331
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Wait, wait, wait.

332
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,040
Let's talk about.

333
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,960
Look, I was just thinking through,

334
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,880
I had my data science head on

335
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,960
and one of the things I was thinking through

336
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,440
is essentially like an old econ supply and demand curve.

337
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,040
What would we look at to identify the ideal number?

338
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,360
And then it very quickly comes down to principles.

339
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,320
Now, in this entire discussion,

340
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,880
you've been asking me,

341
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,120
mid and max from managing a team.

342
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,790
I don't give a crap about managers.

343
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,110
What I want is leaders.

344
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,990
And the problem when you have a manager

345
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,310
is with a small team,

346
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,430
they have a tendency to micromanage,

347
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,590
overly focused on the product,

348
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:53,270
fail to encourage autonomy

349
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,910
and fail to come up with vision

350
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,500
or principles or rallying cry.

351
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,180
On the other side though,

352
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,020
I was just thinking,

353
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,820
what's the biggest issue you have with too large of a team?

354
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:10,830
And that's, you have to choose what you spend,

355
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:11,910
like for me,

356
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,270
I currently have a half hour one-on-one

357
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,070
with each of my directs.

358
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,830
At some point in time,

359
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,350
with 40 hours in a week,

360
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,430
that means I could have a max of 80 reports

361
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:29,150
and all I would be doing is one-on-ones.

362
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,990
Right?

363
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,550
Which doesn't scale at all.

364
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,190
There's other meetings you need to go to.

365
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,030
And by the way,

366
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:37,150
I also do weekly one-on-ones for a half hour

367
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,590
with all of my directs.

368
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,590
Any other leads in the org,

369
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,150
so if I have leads reporting to my managers,

370
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,270
I'll meet with them every other week.

371
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,270
And then I have another half dozen or so people

372
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,790
I meet with monthly,

373
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,350
maybe 10 people to meet with monthly.

374
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,950
So I spend a lot of time on one-on-ones,

375
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,050
I find it very valuable.

376
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:01,290
There's something else I was gonna mention, but go on.

377
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,370
Yeah, for me, one of the things that I did,

378
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,890
particularly as at a defense for COVID,

379
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,650
is I kept my one-on-ones,

380
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,370
but when it came down to specific project questions,

381
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,490
I found that my team kept on trying to set up

382
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,330
additional half hour meetings in a one-on-one context.

383
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,050
Right, you had mentioned that before.

384
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,210
Yeah, and so I actually just created

385
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,690
a daily one hour Brent's office hours

386
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:28,210
and say, that's where you come in

387
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:32,450
with your one-off three minute question or whatever.

388
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,010
And that's been effective, it's been effective.

389
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,900
I've gotten everyone to a degree of,

390
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,740
I'm able to spend time coaching them through the career,

391
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,140
coaching them through their development.

392
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:56,270
The team feels like they have a dedicated time

393
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,790
to come in and-

394
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,830
I'm gonna put us back on topic here.

395
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,230
Oh, I thought I was on topic.

396
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,550
Ish, I mean, it's great.

397
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,030
You have one-on-ones, they're effective, awesome.

398
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,670
The other bit of, so one was standups,

399
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:10,430
and of course, the team size doesn't mean standup,

400
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,070
we've got multiple projects.

401
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,070
One bit of feedback I gave though,

402
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,030
when you go the opposite, which is,

403
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,590
we, you and I have seen at Microsoft in these

404
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,070
where every single different feature area had its own lead,

405
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,910
even if they had one person or 10 people.

406
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:30,950
And you end up shipping your org structure.

407
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,310
The other thing I want your feedback on

408
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,160
is a lot of people push back on saying,

409
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,400
well, if I'm a line level lead,

410
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,680
now you just have ICEs reporting to me,

411
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,960
I can't manage more than six people

412
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,270
and still provide any tech leadership to my team.

413
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,710
I'm too far away from the tech

414
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,630
once I manage more than six people.

415
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,110
What do you say to that?

416
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,350
I would say that's a person

417
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,630
you should double the size of their team.

418
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,590
Because they're, and I'm serious,

419
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:06,710
because they're actually focused on managing and not leading.

420
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,070
I agree a million percent.

421
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,190
And it's a wacky solution, but I tell you it works.

422
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,190
It's like, no, what are you gonna do

423
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,150
to put this manager in a position

424
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,510
where he gives up micromanagement as a solution?

425
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:26,600
No, stop, guide, direct, measure.

426
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,280
It's only been in this position,

427
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,520
this is really the first time where I have not been able to,

428
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,800
managing managers of a team of about 60 people now,

429
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,500
where I can no longer contribute anything technically,

430
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,300
whether it's code, whether it's technical documentation.

431
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,080
I no longer have time for that.

432
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,040
However, even when I managed fairly large teams,

433
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,280
moderate teams of 20, 25,

434
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,280
I could still do non-critical, important tech work

435
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,120
if I wanted to stay sharp.

436
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,480
And I found that very easy to do.

437
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
I knew what people worked on,

438
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,600
I understood how it worked.

439
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,660
I just don't get the argument that,

440
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,120
because I'm, and again, I like the fact

441
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,200
that they are putting an emphasis on growing people.

442
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,320
And that does take time.

443
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,800
Recruiting for open positions takes time.

444
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
It's hard to fill a team,

445
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,880
but I just do not buy the statement

446
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,220
that once you manage more than six people,

447
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,120
even if they're all super junior,

448
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,160
because they'll take time,

449
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,280
they will take more time when they're junior,

450
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,480
but I just don't believe that stops you

451
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,120
from being able to contribute technically.

452
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,900
Again, lots of variants.

453
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,600
The answer is, my answer is eight, plus or minus five.

454
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,140
Eight plus or minus five is the-

455
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,980
I don't know.

456
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,400
I just made up a number.

457
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,460
Yeah, that would be eight minus five.

458
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,020
So that means, no, that's a bullshit number.

459
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,400
Yeah, of course it is.

460
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,020
Eight plus or minus two, maybe?

461
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,900
Like the Scrum one, that's an easy answer, right?

462
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,180
There's a lot of actual science.

463
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,060
There's actual science on this one,

464
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,660
where the ideal Scrum team is five to seven.

465
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,260
So if you have 20 directs, all right.

466
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,020
And they're probably not all working

467
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,080
on the exact same thing.

468
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,320
I actually prefer that, I don't even like seven.

469
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,120
So I'm going through a challenge related,

470
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,480
not a challenge, a shift in my org,

471
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,960
where a lot of folks have been,

472
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,280
org I inherited, I should say.

473
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
People worked a lot on their own.

474
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,680
Here's a project, one person worked on it.

475
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,360
Here's another project, one person worked on it.

476
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,960
A lot of stuff being worked on at once.

477
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Not a lot of things, as you can imagine,

478
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,670
being finished.

479
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:51,550
What we're working on now is doing more of these projects

480
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,750
that are shared and worked on,

481
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,280
not only by multiple people, but wait for it,

482
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,680
self-organizing teams that span managers.

483
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,300
Now, how do you do a standup?

484
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,620
You do it with the damn people

485
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,460
who are working on the project.

486
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Therein lies the solution, self-organizing teams.

487
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,820
I'm lucky I can do that,

488
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,620
given the nature of infrastructure and DevOps,

489
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,580
whatever you want to call it, work.

490
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,540
We're going to focus on finishing,

491
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,620
and even better, even better, one little plug for me,

492
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
and I have another topic to do, we can go more in here,

493
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,940
but in my self-organizing teams,

494
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,860
I love this that the people working on the teams

495
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,500
span different managers.

496
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,580
It's going to work great, I'm pretty excited about it.

497
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,820
But also, I'm giving all of the projects codenames

498
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,520
to end after Hanna Barbera cartoons.

499
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,240
That's pretty cool.

500
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,920
So last week I kicked off Project Grape Ape.

501
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,600
I was just going to ask, I was just going to ask.

502
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,680
I can't tell you what it is,

503
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,200
something came up that I had to set up.

504
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,920
I knew I wanted to do something about it.

505
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:01,520
I knew I wanted to get a bunch of people involved,

506
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,760
and I knew it was something that if it had,

507
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,000
there were key words I did not want to mention

508
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,120
in the channel title.

509
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,360
So on the spur of the moment, I made up Project Grape Ape.

510
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,160
Somebody asked me, are you talking about

511
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,270
the children's cartoon or the strain of marijuana?

512
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,110
And I said the children's cartoon.

513
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,950
What?

514
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,790
But very cool.

515
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,450
And so I'm kicking one off again.

516
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,490
I took the day off, I didn't send mail today,

517
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,840
but on Monday, I will be kicking off Project Yogi Bear.

518
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,280
Nice, is Boo Boo going to be your last one?

519
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,840
Do you know how many Hanna,

520
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,590
I mean, I have the whole Scooby Gang to go through.

521
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,670
I'm loading it up.

522
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:45,510
All right.

523
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,670
It is now the single most important thing.

524
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,990
Of course, because you're so ADD.

525
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:55,710
Snagglepuss.

526
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,070
Yeah, Project Snagglepuss.

527
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,990
Huckleberry Hound.

528
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,390
Oh, I always loved Captain Caveman.

529
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,550
Okay.

531
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,420
Anyway, that's how I handle team size.

532
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,980
It just let teams, well, don't let them,

533
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,180
help them organize.

534
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,660
And I know I've mentioned it before,

535
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,060
and I mentioned it to my team now,

536
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,900
the World of Warcraft guide to project management.

537
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,980
Get a team together.

538
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,820
It's like the end game in World of Warcraft.

539
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,380
Get a team together with varying skills.

540
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:26,980
Work together to solve a common problem

541
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:30,580
when you've reached your exit criteria.

542
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,460
Because even in a raid in World of Warcraft,

543
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,700
maybe you don't want to do the whole thing.

544
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,100
You just want to get to the one chest

545
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,420
because you want to help this one guy

546
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,980
get this one piece of armor or whatever.

547
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,180
Whatever the goal is, you accomplish it together,

548
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,180
and then you either take on other tasks together

549
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,840
or you disband.

550
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,200
It's one of the things,

551
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,320
there's a planning event from SAFE

552
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,880
that is very much aligned with what you're talking about,

553
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,800
as we've talked about here before.

554
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,660
Again, I don't like SAFE, so, half.

555
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,630
All right.

556
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:03,430
Shockingly, does not hurt my feelings.

557
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,090
But the planning event kind of solves that problem,

558
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:14,090
where basically a business leader comes in and says,

559
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,400
these are the scenarios we need accomplished.

560
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
The other aspect that really helps here

561
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,360
is when you do self-organizing teams

562
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,960
is that you have missions and not owners.

563
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,900
Right?

564
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,580
I kind of think of it like a military mission.

565
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,620
Hey, we need to go take out that artillery bunker.

566
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,460
Right?

567
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,890
Once it's done, it's done.

568
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,890
But when you have product teams with feature owners,

569
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:47,690
there's this general inclination to locally optimize.

570
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,980
Right?

571
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,240
Oh, yeah, Alan.

572
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Look, we just nailed feature food for the United States.

573
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,000
And then Alan goes back, great.

574
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,880
What's it gonna take to go globally?

575
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,490
Oh, well, it's gonna cost the same amount for each country.

576
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,930
Yeah, but the rest of the countries

577
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,050
are only 10% of our usage.

578
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:15,380
Yeah, well, do you want globally or not?

579
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,220
Right?

580
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,380
It's one of those things where if you were in a more

581
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,460
dynamic scrum type organization,

582
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,500
you might be offered the opportunity to say, no,

583
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,540
actually it's not worth the price tag.

584
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,490
But when you have feature teams, they just,

585
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,930
okay, well, we'll do the next country and the next country.

586
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,570
And I mean, it's a bad metaphor,

587
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,730
but I see that feature teams are product teams

588
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:43,970
when they go down that model,

589
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,170
they have a tendency to sort of local optimize

590
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,170
instead of global optimize.

591
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,450
Short story is self-organizing teams,

592
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,570
let them figure it out,

593
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,810
give them the help and coaching they need

594
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,410
and Hanna-Barbera project names.

595
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,650
I wasn't planning on getting there

596
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,850
from the conversation about how many people should you

597
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,050
manage, but it reminded me of something.

598
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,810
And I think it depends.

599
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,490
I think I don't like managers

600
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,610
only one or two or three direct reports.

601
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,330
I think it's, I prefer flatter orgs.

602
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,170
It depends on the seniority of the manager,

603
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,490
lots of other things,

604
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,290
but I think it's perfectly capable of managing

605
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,850
well into the teens.

606
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:27,250
And as you said, 20, I think it's definitely possible.

607
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,450
It just depends on a lot of different things.

608
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,050
There's only one scenario where I like

609
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:38,880
a manager above a small team.

610
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,500
And that is they are a new manager.

611
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,340
That's it.

612
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,180
That's the only-

613
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,020
Sure, and I wouldn't put it,

614
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,470
I wouldn't give a new manager more than five.

615
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,670
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

616
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,550
Okay, so I have another topic.

617
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,390
Nice.

618
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,830
I don't know if you saw,

619
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,110
a while back in Twitter,

620
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,310
where should I start on this?

621
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,510
Of course we have, plug,

622
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:05,110
the Introduction to Modern Testing course

623
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,990
on Ministry of Test.

624
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,670
Still getting people going through it.

625
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,320
I think it's really done well.

626
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,800
I've also been thinking about what's next.

627
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,200
If that's the 101 for modern testing,

628
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,480
what's the 201?

629
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,320
Put some questions out on Twitter.

630
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,120
Didn't get a lot of good answers

631
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,080
until I think it was Lisa Crispin's answer.

632
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,640
And I forget what she said,

633
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
and I should have brought that up.

634
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,320
Let me see if I can find it in my replies.

635
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,840
No, I can't find it.

636
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,400
But it was something to the effect of,

637
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,520
what does it take to,

638
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,480
the principles are great,

639
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,080
what does it take to be a modern tester?

640
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,430
Or how do you do these things?

641
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,510
That got me thinking,

642
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,030
and sorry, Lisa, for messing that up,

643
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,230
but it got me thinking,

644
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,710
because other things were around the basics

645
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:55,470
of how do you get developers to test.

646
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,470
And I actually just did a talk on that,

647
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,470
an eight minute talk for Test Flix I recorded.

648
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,790
I don't know, I can't remember when the event is.

649
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:07,110
I'm sorry, maybe I'll put a link to it if I remember.

650
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:10,110
But there was that bit,

651
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,390
then it kind of hit me.

652
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:16,370
Because what I'd like to do is a workshop

653
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,290
for Ministry of Test,

654
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:19,450
just to promote the course

655
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,090
and to get some more ideas about that.

656
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,640
But the working title is,

657
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,730
so you want to be a modern tester?

658
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,570
We can start off with, well, of course,

659
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,410
DevOps is a culture,

660
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,890
modern testing is a culture.

661
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:35,530
We have DevOps people to help facilitate that culture.

662
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,410
Hence, we could have modern testers

663
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,600
help facilitate that culture.

664
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,440
So in that, is like,

665
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
one of the things,

666
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,760
if you're want to move the org in that direction,

667
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,600
what are the things that are difficult

668
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,570
in those first steps?

669
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,730
One is getting developers to test.

670
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,890
I feel like I have a good model for that

671
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,650
in pairing with them, asking them questions,

672
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,530
working on coaching,

673
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,810
which is getting people out of telling them what to do

674
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:07,610
versus asking them to think about what needs to get done,

675
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:11,170
get them to actually shift into that testers mindset.

676
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,400
I think that's one area.

677
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,670
Do you struggle with getting them

678
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:21,790
to take over accountability for testing?

679
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,710
No.

680
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:25,030
Because of the way you've described it in the past,

681
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,870
you kind of trick them into it.

682
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,790
It's not, we do trick them into it

683
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,870
by pairing with them or working with them.

684
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,700
And then it's as I've described,

685
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,860
a developer may ask a tester,

686
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,700
can you test this for me?

687
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,860
And instead of saying, sure, yes,

688
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,500
let me please test that for you.

689
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,140
You can ask, well, sure,

690
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,100
what have you tested so far?

691
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,020
Well, nothing.

692
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,180
Okay, let's do it together.

693
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,020
See, it'll be fine.

694
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,860
Maybe the next time it's,

695
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,660
well, I've tested A and B

696
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,140
and they pair together to test on C and D

697
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,340
and eventually gets to the point

698
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,780
where the developers actually done all the testing

699
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,880
and they say it looks pretty good.

700
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,400
Very shortened versions of how that works.

701
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,760
So what happens there is that's a way

702
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,960
to work with developers to get them to be accountable

703
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,760
and feel like they get them over the bridge

704
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,880
where they feel like they can own testing.

705
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,880
But then the next thing that happens

706
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,740
is they don't realize what testing they're missing.

707
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,440
I think continued pairing to get them to think about

708
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,800
after you ask them what testing is remaining

709
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,640
and they can say, I can't think of any.

710
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,120
And you can say, great, what still worries you?

711
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,570
What do you think is still risky?

712
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,050
And then you can probe for questions on perf

713
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:44,370
or reliability or latency and form hypotheses

714
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,650
that you can go form tests to prove or disprove.

715
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,370
I think there's a topic there.

716
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:52,410
I don't believe it's a whole 90 minute topic

717
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,440
for like for a workshop, but maybe it is.

718
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,560
Maybe it is, what do you think?

719
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,450
Is there, because the other option

720
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:03,730
is we could go deep diving in teaching developers to test.

721
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:07,290
It's not that different from teaching testers to test.

722
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:10,210
I feel like if we talk about the coaching,

723
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,890
that would cover that.

724
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,450
I think about the two ways

725
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,170
that I've been able to help teams transform.

726
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:22,930
Honestly, well, it's been the same way.

727
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,130
And I wrote it up in a very, very, very old blog post.

728
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:30,730
And that is essentially shaking the tree.

729
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,290
It's essentially by leveraging unified engineering

730
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,680
and at the same time sort of removing the QA role from this.

731
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,800
It's setting the expectation that from here on out,

732
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:52,480
every member of this team is a developer and a tester.

733
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Now, I know for a lot of our community, right?

734
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,080
That's basically saying, oh,

735
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,800
but you're saying that if I want to be a monetization,

736
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,240
I have to learn the code.

737
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,120
I think we can nip that one in the bud,

738
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,960
but I like where you're going because we could address,

739
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,440
this is all principle seven, right?

740
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,770
This is maybe there's an exercise on,

741
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,850
and this may be in the core.

742
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,210
This is actually in the course already on,

743
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:20,170
what would it take for your team not to have dedicated QA?

744
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,450
What would have to happen?

745
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,090
This is my thinking of it.

746
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,210
In a world where let's say we had two disciplines

747
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,090
on the same product.

748
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:31,770
Let's say we had dev and P, not dev and PM, dev and test.

749
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,630
Well, towards that product in the prior vernacular,

750
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:41,070
we would refer to them as specialists.

751
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:46,070
And as we've mentioned a bajillion times before,

752
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,190
specialists are bottlenecks and modern testing

753
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,430
is anti-bottleneck.

754
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:55,710
Well, the easiest way to,

755
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,870
how do you take two sets of specialists

756
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,150
and turn them into generalizing specialists?

757
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,790
Well, you force them into an environment

758
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,670
where they have to essentially cross breed.

759
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,390
Now what makes them a specialist here is their knowledge.

760
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,790
So we're not actually asking them to cross breed,

761
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,830
but their knowledge to cross breed.

762
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:22,660
And you have to put them in a situation where those,

763
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,660
the only way for them to claim success

764
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,220
after say a period of six months,

765
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,380
is that that knowledge was successfully transferred

766
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,980
both ways.

767
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,140
I'll give you a very tight example.

768
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,780
Number one, one of the ways I see these type

769
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,260
of unified engineering orgs poorly implemented

770
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:49,260
is by putting the prior dev manager in charge.

771
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,660
Because one of the issues is management.

772
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,700
You have two managers often where you only need one now.

773
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:00,760
Well, no, what I would do is instead

774
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,920
is keep the same number of managers,

775
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,080
but swap, basically do team membership trades.

776
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:14,820
As an example, let's say you were a dev manager

777
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,460
and I was a test manager, okay?

778
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,260
What you and I are going to do,

779
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,180
we both manage 10 people, okay?

780
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:28,880
What you and I are going to do is you're gonna give me

781
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,420
your three best developers

782
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,070
and I'm gonna give you my three best testers.

783
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,270
Those three best developers,

784
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,190
they're going to be accountable for driving

785
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,990
whatever relevant knowledge to me, the manager,

786
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,380
as well as to the rest of my team.

787
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,700
But the tester side, right, when it comes down to votes,

788
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,860
because I have seven testers and three developers,

789
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,540
that test side is going to balance out those three folks.

790
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,100
So to be clear, this is your plan for we have a QA team,

791
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,260
we have a test, we have a dev team,

792
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,620
and we're going to just have a dev team,

793
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,060
one way to make that work, I agree.

794
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,900
Yeah.

795
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:17,500
So really, you wanna mix and match the talent

796
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,300
in a way that enables people to learn.

797
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,620
But we should also talk about, I mean,

798
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,700
again, this was your example comes from Microsoft,

799
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,140
where we experienced at Microsoft,

800
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,860
where at the time you did that,

801
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:35,580
we largely had test teams who were roughly even equal

802
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,220
in size to the dev teams they worked with.

803
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,540
I think what we'll find that a lot of companies today,

804
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,060
is that's not the case.

805
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,740
The number of QA folks is a much smaller percentage

806
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,420
of the overall staff.

807
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,700
Typically embedded in teams as an agile team,

808
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,940
they still do all the testing, gross.

809
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
The flavor of that though still works.

810
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,500
I think to answer the question,

811
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,020
I'm all you're telling me I have to code, no.

812
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:04,650
The folks that have formally been in QA for me,

813
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,810
some of them are coding,

814
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,570
some of them are quality coaching,

815
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,730
some of them are in DevOps where they do code,

816
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:10,850
but they're doing different,

817
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,250
it's a lot of infrastructure set up as well.

818
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,250
Some are doing program management or project management.

819
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:19,520
Anyway, there's a lot of different directions you can go.

820
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,000
Aside from the dev stuff,

821
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,080
let's talk about the other thing that I think is hard

822
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,880
for people who look at the principles.

823
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,600
And that's right up your alley, it's data.

824
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,960
Yes.

825
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,440
So there is something there.

826
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,350
So imagine you're somebody, QA person

827
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,700
or quality minded dev person on a team.

828
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,340
And you look at the principles and go,

829
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,900
yep, we care about the business, yep,

830
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,660
DevZone quality.

831
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,620
You go on down list, you go data.

832
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,380
Now we don't do data.

833
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,940
Or we can't do data because it's,

834
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,140
we're worried about collecting the wrong information.

835
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,460
I could tell you from experience,

836
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:03,980
a lot of people are afraid of collecting any usage data

837
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,540
because they think it's PII.

838
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,980
It's not.

839
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
Oh my God.

840
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,340
Does that drive you crazy too?

841
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:13,140
No, knowing which button they clicked,

842
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,300
that's okay, that's not PII.

843
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,100
Okay, there's nothing personal about it.

844
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,940
It's fine.

845
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,820
I actually, for a longest time,

846
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,500
that one would drive me nuts.

847
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,860
I still hear that too often.

848
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:27,840
And this is what I tell them.

849
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,600
Let's play a little game, Alan.

850
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Alan, do you actually know what PII means?

851
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,320
It means personally identifiable information.

852
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,160
Right.

853
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,760
And almost every person I talked to

854
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,040
knows the answers to that, but they have forgotten it.

855
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,280
They don't understand the meaning.

856
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,760
They just use PII, okay?

857
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,950
And I say, okay, so here is a click stream

858
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,270
of a customer going through and clicking our UI.

859
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:03,560
Tell me how you are able to personally identify this person.

860
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,910
Who are they?

861
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,070
And anything you can tell me about that person is fine.

862
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,390
Like where they live, what their phone number is,

863
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,670
their name, their middle name,

864
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,730
any information that helps to triangulate who they are.

865
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:24,690
And they're like, well, I can't.

866
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,350
Guess what?

867
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,990
Not personally identifiable information.

868
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,830
Right.

869
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,110
So let's back out a level,

870
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:34,430
because that one pisses me off and annoys me.

871
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,550
It's not.

872
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,110
So how do we get someone started?

873
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:42,110
Like if your team does not collect any data,

874
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:46,020
any customer data, there are a couple challenges here.

875
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,490
There's a technical challenge of picking whatever

876
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:53,570
off the shelf solution there is to get some of that data,

877
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:55,810
whether it's Google Analytics for a webpage,

878
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:58,560
or I don't even know what exists

879
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,790
in the open source world for a desktop app.

880
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:06,640
But the technical part, what do you collect?

881
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,680
I know the answers to these,

882
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,200
but how do you get the team started?

883
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,920
You have a team who don't care about it

884
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,520
because they haven't collected it.

885
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,570
How do we take a team?

886
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:20,930
How do we lead a team towards no data

887
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:23,410
to collecting customer data

888
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:26,410
that affects decisions in the org?

889
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:29,460
So it's interesting.

890
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Yesterday, I had a developer from a team

891
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,420
that I know very little about.

892
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,510
They had raised, I'll just cut to short.

893
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,110
One of the things that's very common,

894
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,670
maybe once a month and once every two months,

895
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,030
I will do a one-off mentorship session

896
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,110
with somebody I've never met before,

897
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,990
and I have no idea how they found me.

898
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,750
That happened yesterday.

899
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:05,750
And he is a developer, just graduated college

900
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,070
in May with a bachelor's in computer science.

901
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,710
And he took one stats and ML course.

902
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,590
And he came to me, wanted to know,

903
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,110
how do I become a data scientist when I grow up?

904
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,190
One of the things I told him,

905
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,750
I'm not gonna go through the whole thing

906
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,830
because the premise is slightly different

907
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,950
than what you're talking about,

908
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,540
but I actually think the implementation might be useful,

909
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,380
is I said, okay, so you're a new guy.

910
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:42,340
And as you know, well, I don't know if this is universal,

911
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,340
but at Microsoft, new guys in dev,

912
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,140
new people in dev.

913
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,220
Thank you.

914
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,540
Yep.

915
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,660
We'll spend probably the first six months

916
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,660
spending 80% of their time just fixing bugs.

917
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,730
That's how they get their feet wet.

918
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,820
And I said, all right, here is a thought process for you.

919
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,540
This is what I want you to think through.

920
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,860
For every one of your bug fixes,

921
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,980
once it goes to production,

922
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,980
how do you know whether or not

923
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,580
this added value to your customer and or your business

924
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,290
or just wasted your time?

925
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,250
That's it.

926
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,570
That's the question I laid on this plate.

927
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,490
And I said, how do you know that?

928
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:43,560
And then I followed up and I said,

929
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,800
you're probably gonna dive into it and realize

930
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,240
you don't have the right data,

931
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,400
which is gonna force you to have a conversation around

932
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,760
or at least a thought process around

933
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,760
what data do I need in order to make those two choices?

934
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,160
If you try to simplify,

935
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,880
did I waste my time on this bug fix

936
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,970
or did I add value?

937
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:11,100
But the key thing there is you have to be able to prove it.

938
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,900
Because a lot of the times dev goes,

939
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,420
oh, I'm sure we added value.

940
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:18,340
Look, it was a whatever.

941
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:23,140
And I said, once you do that and you do it repeatedly,

942
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,500
you'll learn from your mistakes.

943
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,640
You're like, crap,

944
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,380
I can't statistically prove that I did it now.

945
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,020
That would be probably less than three.

946
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,300
Great, the trend's looking better, but is it relevant?

947
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:39,500
What I did is I said,

948
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,500
I framed the mission in a way that resonated with him,

949
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:50,380
that the more he could proactively determine

950
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,710
without intuition or opinion in play,

951
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:56,630
whether or not he wasted his time,

952
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,630
that would play out well for him in the long-term.

953
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,140
Anyway, is that at all helpful

954
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,260
or is it me yet again blubiating?

955
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,750
I think there's some nuggets in there.

956
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,710
The question I asked,

957
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,190
the opposite version of the question,

958
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:19,660
which is how will you know customers

959
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,500
are being successful with this feature?

960
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,020
Well, it's not the opposite.

961
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,780
It's the same question except now on features.

962
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:29,980
Sure.

963
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,660
Right, you just spent six months doing this feature.

964
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:35,260
Are customers successful or did you waste your time?

965
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,420
I hope it's not six months.

966
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,700
I hope it's not six months.

967
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,340
That helps you figure out,

968
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,980
there's some brainstorming around that

969
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,900
that helps you figure out what you can measure.

970
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,420
There may be a topic in there.

971
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,780
I have a meta question.

972
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,780
So there's one is teaching developers to test.

973
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,660
One is really getting started with data

974
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,940
and maybe a little deeper

975
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,780
because I kind of covered that.

976
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,900
In fact, I use that question in the intro course as well.

977
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,140
But what else do you think is stopping teams

978
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,020
from moving to modern testing?

979
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,660
Tradition I think is the number one.

980
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,460
The fact that in general,

981
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:20,540
I don't think that the test org has ever

982
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:23,140
done a great job answering

983
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:29,740
the implied questions around principle number one

984
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,460
is way up there.

985
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,690
Yes, and I've pointed to it a few times

986
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,290
in one of the three dots, slack.com,

987
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,370
go to moderntesting.org to find an invitation link.

988
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,090
But I wrote an article last year,

989
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:47,370
year before I can't remember just fighting this.

990
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,210
We always hear about the cost of software testing,

991
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,610
which is the opposite of principle one.

992
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:55,410
So I forget the title of the article.

993
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:58,210
I will not probably forget to post a link to it

994
00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,970
in the notes, but I wrote an article

995
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:06,510
for CIO Tech on the value add of good testing.

996
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:10,870
Didn't say testers, I say good testing.

997
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,550
It's not a cost, it's a value add.

998
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,700
Well, not by itself, it's not.

999
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,760
Just doing a bunch of, well, I guess, nevermind.

1000
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:24,800
Because you qualified it by the word good testing

1001
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,340
and more likely than not,

1002
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:32,820
if we were to drill down that, you and I would agree on it.

1003
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,100
I think there's something there.

1004
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,740
I have to remember, I want four,

1005
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:38,740
and this is not in the short term,

1006
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,500
it's batting around in the back of my head.

1007
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,980
I do wanna do something, a workshop that dives deeper

1008
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,380
into how to make these things happen.

1009
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,260
But as I talk through it,

1010
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,060
the gusto's going away a little bit

1011
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:04,060
because really what you need is leadership skills.

1012
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:06,990
You need to be able to influence change

1013
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:09,110
and get people to care about what you're doing

1014
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:13,170
and think what you're saying and trying to do is valid.

1015
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,250
That's probably the most important thing.

1016
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,730
We didn't cover it in either of our two stories.

1017
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:24,170
There are two things that really solidified

1018
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,330
what we now call modern testing for me.

1019
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:28,970
Number one is my own personal experience

1020
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:32,450
of managing a dev team without any sort of testing.

1021
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:37,580
Okay, but number two,

1022
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:42,740
it's the agile principle around removing waste from the system

1023
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,860
and how valuable that is.

1024
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,860
And in order to be able to do that,

1025
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,700
you have to be able to confidently identify waste.

1026
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,420
And the thing that really resonated with me on that one

1027
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,540
was the Eric Rhee story.

1028
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,380
Yes.

1029
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,460
He had his whole company.

1030
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:04,460
They spent six months working 40 hour days

1031
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,780
to produce this one value add system

1032
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:17,620
that at that point in time, they all were true believers.

1033
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:20,980
They all in that organization believed.

1034
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,700
None of them had any data, but they all believed

1035
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:28,090
that of course it must be true that this would be a hit.

1036
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:32,030
And they got 20 downloads the day they shipped, right?

1037
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:33,510
It was an abject failure.

1038
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:37,550
They had misunderstood the problem

1039
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:41,670
their customer needed solved.

1040
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:43,950
And I happened to see a presentation.

1041
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:45,470
Eric Rhee came here to Microsoft

1042
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,360
and I happened to see him to present.

1043
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,760
And he's like, you know, I replayed that whole six months

1044
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,160
over and over and over again.

1045
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,920
And I realized something,

1046
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,680
that if on the day one that we started this,

1047
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:06,140
if we had created a mock-up webpage that said,

1048
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,500
hey, welcome to Eric Rhee's magic project,

1049
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,350
click here to download.

1050
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,410
They could have discovered that same day

1051
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:20,010
just by putting that fake facade up

1052
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:22,330
to see if there was any demand here.

1053
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,050
And I remember like yesterday, the question he asked,

1054
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:27,680
and by the way folks,

1055
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,000
would I have had to implement that download page

1056
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,590
or would a 404 just been fine?

1057
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:35,910
We've told that story before.

1058
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:36,950
I think it's good.

1059
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,910
And maybe one of the things is to,

1060
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,990
you have to wear a little bit

1061
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:45,830
of that project management hat in order to get past,

1062
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:47,510
of course there's the fallacy of now,

1063
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:49,230
what I'm working on now has to be,

1064
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:50,710
customers have to have it,

1065
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:53,150
and failure to launch, which is this case

1066
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,310
of spending too much time waiting for customer feedback.

1067
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:01,510
We do not have time for a rebuttal.

1068
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,230
We're gonna have to call, okay, go on.

1069
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,630
No, I was just going to agree.

1070
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,990
That's exactly right.

1071
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:11,980
It's not even waiting for too much time.

1072
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,980
No matter how much time you wait for feedback,

1073
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,070
how do you make it faster?

1074
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:23,070
Because that's how you eliminate waste from the system.

1075
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:26,790
Yeah, it's speeding up the feedback cycle.

1076
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,550
So maybe there's something there.

1077
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:32,430
I would love to hear back from the three.

1078
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,790
You can either reply to the Twitter post announcing this,

1079
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,350
the LinkedIn post announcing this.

1080
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,750
You can add comments.

1081
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:42,910
You can send us mails.

1082
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:48,100
You can poke us on Slack and let us know what you think

1083
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,500
we should be doing for the community

1084
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,420
to help them get even further with modern testing.

1085
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,660
And I'll try and coagulate that

1086
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,340
into some sort of workshop.

1087
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,620
That's my plan.

1088
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,740
Thanks for a workshop and that with me a little bit, Brett.

1089
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:04,580
Sure.

1090
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,500
We will chat again in a couple of weeks.

1091
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,700
Is that right?

1092
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,420
Post election?

1093
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,860
Yeah, well, that's the plan, right?

1094
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:14,900
We'll see if we're both still here.

1095
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,620
We both live in the hated suburbia.

1096
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,620
So, right, we'll see what happens.

1097
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,060
Okay, thanks everyone for listening this far.

1098
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:24,980
I'm Alan.

1099
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,820
I'm Brett.

1100
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,660
See you next time.
