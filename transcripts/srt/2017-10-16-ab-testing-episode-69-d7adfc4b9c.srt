1
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:21,250
Brant hello Alan we are back for episode. I don't know I have six oh 69

2
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:28,390
69 I had a six and a question mark up on the whiteboard it was really close if you had just finished the loop

3
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,310
I just had to finish the loop got rid of the dot. How you been Brant?

4
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,930
I'm doing super

5
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,170
How's that for convincing answer? That's a that's an awesome answer so I have how about you? How are you?

6
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,470
He's such a

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,120
Worst co-host ever yeah, yeah, yeah, so I may have mentioned this before

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,640
Great drink

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,800
Is that the loophole if we just say may my dad is up there in years had a few strokes

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,320
He pretty much can't do much on his own, but he says my brother and my sister-in-law about

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,570
48 weeks a year 49 weeks a year sometimes longer

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,150
So it's the least I can do to offer to take care of him for a few weeks when they go back and visit family

13
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,630
So I did that for the last three weeks

14
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:21,350
I was I like hey he mostly just naps in his chair

15
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,550
I make him some food hang out with him a little bit, and I worked from home. I got a ton of crap done

16
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,250
I totally got cabin fever by not interacting with real people

17
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,590
So much of my team is remote that only the local team

18
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,290
Like it made any difference to not seeing me around yeah, I don't think anybody else even noticed

19
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,510
but

20
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,640
it's weird I

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,390
I

22
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,150
Don't know if I could do if I could be a remote work. I know companies like Zapier are

23
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:58,230
Every employee is remote. They don't have an office anywhere, and I was thinking I don't think I could do that job long term

24
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,870
I could do it on a contract basis. I could do it for a month two months. Maybe at the most

25
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,630
but

26
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,190
One thing I've learned. It's just I need and I'm an introvert

27
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,640
But I do need a little bit of interaction. I think a lot

28
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,490
Maybe just to get ideas or two

29
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,770
I can't quite explain it yet, but you're in the you're in the knowledge trade and

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,320
if you don't have

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,160
Relevant knowledge to trade and that's give and take

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,440
Yeah, it doesn't surprise me that you'd kind of go a little bit crazy

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:45,160
I do think you know you've mentioned one or two months if you actually made it to three months you'd be golden

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,000
Because I think it takes about three months for a pattern. Yeah, I would get a routine down

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,600
One thing I can tell you though. I worked remotely once before this is deck deck not quite decades ago, but maybe

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,880
Maybe a decade ago, maybe seven or eight years ago at Microsoft. I was

37
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,570
Long story. I won't share, but I ended up working remotely for about two weeks at that time

38
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,770
It was much much worse because slack or whatever you're if you're using Microsoft Teams

39
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,770
for the Microsoft folks

40
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,410
But if slack for everybody else just a lot more a lot more that hallway communication and like I said my remote team had no

41
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,410
idea I was even out of the office, but

42
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,370
We're able to say pretty good communication that helped about three years ago one of my employees

43
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:42,660
Her father was ailing and she asked if she could go to China and

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,840
Work remotely for a month. I said sure

45
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,630
to this date

46
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:55,060
The manager I had it at that time

47
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,890
Still does not know that she spent a whole month in China

48
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,450
And I was I was actually pretty damn productive my day was spread out was weird because I ended up working

49
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,740
Probably worked

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,900
That's probably near my computer 12 hours a day getting in an eight-hour day

51
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,800
There's other distractions, but I got like just a ton of crap done

52
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,020
So it's really good from that perspective, but I'm gonna ask you a question

53
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:27,540
How much of your time do you spend doing your own tasks in soul-sucking meetings a?

54
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,060
Lot

55
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,700
But I forgot I forgot what a culture of meetings is like so thanks for reminding me

56
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:41,860
How much and given that is the hard question to answer but how much of your time do you spend on tasks?

57
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,020
Versus managing your team that can be one-on-ones with them or thinking about their career or the work

58
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,740
They're doing what's what do you think? Ah, it all park it it

59
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:59,690
Like this week. It's mostly on the task front. I would say in any given week. I probably spend

60
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,490
maybe 30% on the

61
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:10,130
The people career growth stuff because usually my time is spent between my people

62
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,690
putting out

63
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:20,610
Random fires one of the one of the interesting consequences of being on a data science team and I didn't

64
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,490
realize this

65
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:30,170
Beforehand, but one of the things that I learned is unlike so people want to treat us like a regular dev team

66
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,370
where you build a six-month plan and

67
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,630
If you don't stick to it you suck the that sort of philosophy that you normally get with a with a dev team

68
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,500
but we have to operate at the speed at which the business needs to make decisions and

69
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,020
So that model just friggin doesn't work

70
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,760
And so a lot of contradictions we get is a lot of fire drills come our plot our way and we have to figure out

71
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,480
How we can best effectively help make the decision

72
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:09,300
Even though we lack the six months of infrastructure that would be ideal and then lastly

73
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,860
Strategic thinking it in particular nowadays

74
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,940
I'm thinking through all right

75
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,880
What's the next low-hanging fruit that no one's really gotten into that's that appears to be a business

76
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:27,100
Problem as well as how the hell do I shut down these fire drills?

77
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,880
so

78
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,760
depending on the week

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
the my balance changed very

80
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,560
rapidly

81
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,840
On our mind the two of the three listeners still listening that that was just an answer to a ratio question

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
But thank you 30

83
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
That's cool

84
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,540
Just I didn't want to say just 30 because 30 sounds low and I wanted to explain why

85
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,080
I get it. I get I'm just giving you a bad time. The reason I brought it up was I think I spent

86
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,480
More time on I still had all my one-on-ones still help solve some problems outside of one-on-ones

87
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:12,480
answered a lot of slack questions and I will manage your stuff, but I think I probably spent more time on tasks in those three weeks

88
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,360
And I have in any other week at unity

89
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,800
usually it's a lot more because then again managing your team is just a lot of

90
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,330
Interaction with developers around the company especially in the Seattle office

91
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,130
sometimes interviews and

92
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:31,210
Just those other things there is a

93
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:38,170
Story and I'll shorten it for the podcast. There's a story. I often tell my mentees. I can tell a story

94
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,410
I'm gonna run to the store real quick. I'll be back. Yeah, I'm just

95
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,900
So back

96
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
when I was still a

97
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,000
part of a dink family

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
dual income no kids

99
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
my wife

100
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,840
worked at as a

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,730
Apartment manager and she had

102
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:05,810
Sundays and

103
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,210
Mondays off

104
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,160
So I went to my management and I said hey

105
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,480
Can I have Sundays and Mondays off?

106
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,560
and

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,200
I kicked ass they said yes, this is generally the bar and

108
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,480
One of the things for the period in time where that was occurring and I think it was close to six months

109
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,280
I

110
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,400
noticed that generally I got a

111
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,520
Darn close to two weeks worth of productivity in one week

112
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,400
And and so when I came into work on Saturdays

113
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,940
There was no one there to context switch me interrupt me

114
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,480
I would just grind it out and it turns out me me not being there on Monday

115
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,720
Really had no impact on the rest of the week

116
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,680
So I would get that's interesting. Yeah, just that one day. I when I was a sink

117
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
single income no kids I

118
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,200
would

119
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,680
often

120
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,840
Microsoft

121
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Turns into a ghost town

122
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,320
The last three weeks of December as people realized they haven't used their vacation

123
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,640
They don't want to lose it and kids get out of school. And so there's nobody there. I would work often

124
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,960
Those especially that week between Christmas and New Year. Oh

125
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,440
My yeah, yeah, the shit I would get done. It was I can't believe I

126
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,320
Can imagine cuz I saw but I still can't looking back

127
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,350
I can't believe like at the end of that time like oh my god. I did holy crap. It is really

128
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,230
And my brain is younger. I could fit more in it's like it. I just had this

129
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:59,950
The decision to work or not during the holidays is really a no-lose. There's no way to lose

130
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:08,810
Yeah, yeah, I enjoy taking that time off now, but oh my goodness that was yeah

131
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,990
If you have already done all of your Christmas shopping

132
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,120
Then yeah, you should work

133
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,660
That's generally not the case for me I need that I need the two weeks off because

134
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,640
I

135
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,850
Vare

136
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:34,050
Generally in the middle of November. I'm like, okay this person that this person that this person that but then I

137
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,530
Changed my mind later and I procrastinate and so then I need the two weeks

138
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,490
This has occurred the last five years

139
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,440
Play the tangent theme song now

140
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,130
We don't have one no, you know what to me do have I

141
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,700
Do I do

142
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:10,960
We have a little backlog of mailbag questions, I thought we'd well three but I thought we'd talk about this, okay

143
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:23,190
Alright why don't you get through question one? No not quite ready yet. Okay. It's good to be back having that

144
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,150
We you may have noticed those you subscribing going. Oh my god, what happened to a be testing

145
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:35,030
They haven't had an episode in a month. I took a week. We took a recording off last taking care of my dad. We are back

146
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,610
Not well, we'll see. We'll see

147
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,740
question number one

148
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:48,040
All right. This is from Camille. The subject is how can I start work as a tester? And here is the message

149
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Hello, I'm 33 and working since forever in the logistic industry

150
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,600
Few days ago. I came across this job offer as software tester. I started to

151
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm gonna fix some slightly broken English here. I have one thing on my mind

152
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,140
I have to try and change my industry and become a tester. I found

153
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:19,140
IST QB certificate and right now I am learning working and getting information about this profession wherever I can today

154
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,020
I found your podcast a be testing that's us and listening to it at work one thing that disturbs me from your number 26 podcast

155
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,160
Is that I have TQB is a not very good piece of knowledge for a good start as a tester

156
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,980
Maybe not try it. We'll talk about that in a second

157
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,980
I am planning to start from that anyway because this is big advantage in the market at least in my region and I'll have to

158
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,500
Try and find some company which will hire me without any practice except certificate and some theory

159
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,820
I have to find company company of people like you that want to be someone's mentor to teach me the best hire me

160
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,340
That is thank you for the message Camille

161
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,260
Can't hire you yet, but what I can do along with my buddy Brent is

162
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:08,780
Give some advice. Yes. What advice would you like to give?

163
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:15,660
I would like to say and Brent and I and as many others do we made fun of the IST QB test because it's a little

164
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,780
the questions are a little on the redic side I think and

165
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,400
There's not a ton of value in the knowledge what you need is the practical knowledge

166
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,160
however

167
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,440
There are many places especially in Europe where having that

168
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,830
certification

169
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,280
can

170
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:44,440
Get you in the door. I do think and before Brent jumps in one thing I worry about is I'm

171
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,320
My spidey sense tingles with the IST QB

172
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,930
only because I see it I'm not sure if it's a

173
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:58,210
benefit the testers the testers or

174
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,050
more of a benefit to the people running IST QB who

175
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:09,450
Charge a big chunk of money to take their class and you know the class T certificate. There's a little bit of

176
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,350
Have some queasyness there that bugs me. So I

177
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,970
Think the answer to that question is entirely market driven, right?

178
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:27,660
You have more familiarity than I do on on the European tester

179
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,840
Testing market we have several listeners that could probably comment to this hmm better

180
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,080
If you better than I I'm thinking of you Patrick

181
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:43,580
The thing is so from from outside looking in ISQ or IST QB

182
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,980
appears to be a

183
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Barrier reducer

184
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,450
meaning

185
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,570
In in a testing market if you have this

186
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,130
You can you can reduce the friction towards landing one of these jobs

187
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,130
And you're right much more true in Europe although I think less true than it was a few years ago

188
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,130
But still very true in Europe

189
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:15,570
I rarely see a US job and never see a US job that I would recommend to anybody that requires an IST QB

190
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,870
Certificate and I think even most American managers at least

191
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,210
People running test orgs don't care

192
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,000
They don't

193
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,350
What we heard is 30 years old they're in the logistic industry

194
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:36,610
They're considering doing the IST QB. I think you should do the IST QB

195
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:43,170
Because it again it does from what I observe it is a friction reducer

196
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,490
I'm going to agree it might so it's probably going to help you

197
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,660
get an interview

198
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:58,530
To the best of my knowledge it may even be help you get a job

199
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,130
But the best of my knowledge is not necessarily going to help you keep that job

200
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,530
Yeah, I would recommend I again

201
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,530
I hate think I have the same advice as much as I've spoken out against IST QB

202
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:16,550
I think in switching industries and getting sort of a basic lay of the land might be a good idea. I would also go

203
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,010
Read I mean you obviously

204
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,390
Have scoured the internet and gone to the darkest corners in order to find our podcast

205
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,510
So on the way, maybe you found sites like ministry of testing calm

206
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,550
Which have a lot of great information a lot of testers from Europe. It's headed by Rosie Sherry in

207
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:41,160
Who's in Brighton? I should mention I'm going to Brighton in March. I'm excited. So

208
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,070
In addition to the IST QB look and see what else is out there. Keep on learning

209
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:51,530
Try things out. There are testing challenges talk to other testers find ways to interact

210
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:57,110
If you have that seeking learning mind and you can use IST QB to get your foot in the door

211
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:01,590
You might have a I do think it shot as a software tester. One of the things I do think

212
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:07,710
So they the person's mentioned they're seeking a mentor in this space

213
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,510
I would reach out to the Ministry of Testing

214
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:15,350
That's much more closer to a relevant

215
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,390
market for for them than

216
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,820
We are yeah, I think it's becoming and in see if there's resources

217
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
There's a lot of you know

218
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
test meetups

219
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,760
Maybe there's one nearby. There is look for meetups. Yeah, so I think you know, it was funny

220
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,860
as

221
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,320
little is

222
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,240
10 years ago

223
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:48,640
Sticky minds is probably the best from ST from software quality engineering people that run star was probably the best resource for

224
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,560
Testing information. It's still a very good resource, but I

225
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,940
Can't think right now of a better resource for software testers

226
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,860
Than Ministry of Testing that is not a paid endorsement

227
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:07,220
Not even it's just an endorsement. I can't think of anything else. Of course

228
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,820
They aggregate blogs if you want to just scrub to one blog feed they

229
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,260
There's forums there's across isn't just like of course there's some traditional

230
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,080
Testing talk there, but also some modern testing

231
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,010
In fact, I should mention the reason I'm going to Brighton is to speak at test bash in Brighton

232
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:33,970
I'll also visit the unity office when I'm there, but my talk you're gonna love it

233
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,730
Adventures of a modern tester nice

234
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:44,510
Nice, I can't wait. I can't wait. I got a little I got a little smiley writing up the abstract and

235
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,410
submitted and

236
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:51,770
I'm super are you gonna do crayon cartoons like that that one girl?

237
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,370
Years ago with the dungeon and oh

238
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,210
I wonder if I should check the schedule I own I own a

239
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:07,250
Mm-hmm. It was her name. Maybe she'll be there. Maybe she can do the the art for you be great

240
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,610
I actually gave a presentation to my team internally

241
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,250
There's a weird thing

242
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,010
I've mentioned before with off the air mentioned to Brent that one thing at unity that I love is I I

243
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,950
Plant these seeds and the seeds grow very fast at unity. Sometimes a day later like we're doing this

244
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,950
I said whoa. Whoa. Okay. Okay, it's fine

245
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,130
Go several months back

246
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:34,170
I was working on getting some of the teams start thinking about working from a zero bug backlog and how that would happen and

247
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,300
I was gonna start with one team and show data and move on direction and then a whole office said

248
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:46,620
Oh, we want to do that. Can you give a tech talk to our devs on how to do that? How to think about that? I

249
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,860
said I can

250
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,420
And I used a lot of hand-drawn pictures in it. That's for the heck of it

251
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:58,680
What's up? All right. Let's start next question. Oh

252
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,740
Look who's rushing things along

253
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Next question

254
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,500
This one is from David on the testing pyramid in 2017

255
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,710
Dear Alan and Brent. Oh

256
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,680
Okay

257
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,190
What you mad didn't say dear Brent and Alan? No, no, no, it's not

258
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,270
I was

259
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:26,390
Quickly loading the testing pyramid and that's what caused the uh

260
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,040
All right. Go ahead

261
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,560
Go did it have to push the ponies out of your brain? Okay, you're Alan and Brent

262
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,680
Because now we can run many GUI tests graphical user interface

263
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,120
You need GUI tests at the same time hence get fast response

264
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,520
Do you think this will eventually lead to more GUI tests and fewer unit tests?

265
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,120
If the time will no longer be an issue, isn't the depth of testing through the GUI make it a better practice?

266
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,650
No

267
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,650
next question

268
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,370
So

269
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:06,850
So I understand the logic. I loaded up a image on

270
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,970
I'm looking at lots of unit tests

271
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,050
Unit tests of the testing pyramid. I loaded up. Oh yours is huge

272
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,410
It says that the base is unit testing then component testing then integration then

273
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:28,010
Then system then acceptance then alpha and beta. No, that's that's a stupid pyramid

274
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,050
Yeah, the UI is not in here. I mean as I see why it's not in here

275
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,970
The pyramid as originally drawn that that pyramid you brought up there. I like this period that one's stupid

276
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,450
You're stupid don't even show that one. All right

277
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,170
the pyramid is unit tests system tests at the very top of the pyramid GUI tests and

278
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,260
what I

279
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:52,340
Have stolen from Google considering how much Whitaker stole from me when he was there

280
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:58,700
Is rather than call them unit and system and GUI? Oh this one

281
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,500
I even think about them as small medium and large test that is the testing pyramid as

282
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,080
Proposed originally so but for now

283
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
Forgot where I was

284
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,740
lots of unit tests

285
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,500
Medium out of system test a small number of GUI tests

286
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,820
Let me put it this way

287
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,560
Now that I've talked about everything but the answer I agree with Brent which is

288
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,340
No weird. I

289
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,840
Don't care if you can run a gazillion GUI tests in a second

290
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:37,620
Well, that'd be kind of awesome. But generally I don't care because GUI tests are no

291
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,500
No, if you could run a zillion

292
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,820
GUI tests in a second just imagine how many actual useful tests you could run in the second

293
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,380
I

294
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,100
think GUI automation is the most difficult to do right and trustworthy is

295
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,920
one of the most difficult things to do in software engineering if you have

296
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,350
The flakiness lives in the GUI tests and maybe it's not flakiness you can control

297
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,130
Maybe you can work past it very difficult

298
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:11,450
You want to write tests that you can trust that when they pass do you know the products working when they fail?

299
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,450
You know the products failing

300
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,730
furthermore

301
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,670
You need a set of eyes on that GUI at least once before you ship anyway

302
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,570
Maybe that comes from some dog fooding at the same time

303
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,290
Just I see no reason I would rather investigate in those super-fast

304
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:34,450
Reliable tests that live lower down the stack regardless of our ability to parallelize our

305
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:41,090
GUI testing I even found that in and friends about to talk but even on we had on teams

306
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,810
Oh God

307
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:49,410
Well, there's the good news taught our developers how to write test automation and they wrote a bunch of really shitty UI tests that were

308
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,490
flaky as hell and they wondered why the system was so gross and

309
00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,690
This system worked fine. Oh, we'll just parallelize those tests. We'll rerun those tests. We'll retry those tests

310
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,260
We'll keep on running until they pass

311
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
No, they're fragile

312
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,220
And with that fragility you end up not trusting them and when they do fail it's a real product bug

313
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,340
Maybe you don't notice because it's a broken window theory just no

314
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:21,050
I do not support writing more GUI tests just because it's easier Brent. You may speak

315
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,640
Thank you. So the pyramid as

316
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:33,980
I have loaded it up says at the very base is unit tests then followed by acceptance tests

317
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,660
Then followed by GUI tests now in this particular case

318
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:46,820
I'm going to choose to interpret acceptance tests in language that we used to use which is the BV T's

319
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,100
From my experience all of the bugs happen at the integration layer

320
00:24:54,270 --> 00:25:00,030
GUI tests sure you could write a whole bunch of GUI tests and

321
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,770
If you had a full complete suite of GUI tests and dev does a check-in

322
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,270
You will be able to

323
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,630
fail a bunch of tests

324
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,900
if they do a bad chicken and

325
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,780
Dev won't have to do the unit test because you know

326
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,660
that

327
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,050
the test failed

328
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Now let me tell you a story

329
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,940
Years ago about 15 years ago now I joined a brand new team. I'm not gonna mention the team

330
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,450
It's now

331
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,770
Yet another Microsoft product I worked on that no longer ships

332
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,610
Not soon though

333
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,970
Which is official now. Did you hear about?

334
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,930
Groove dine

335
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,930
Yes. Yeah. Oh

336
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:58,090
My tangent size yes, it is a B testing one of my one of my predictions one of my rants from years ago

337
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:03,370
Finally came true only after spending a few more hundreds of millions of dollars on it

338
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:10,160
Windows phone is dead. I think that was announced several months ago. Maybe maybe

339
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:18,790
Internally windows phone became officially dead to the public just a couple weeks ago, and I wasn't even happy or it's like about time

340
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:19,870
it's like

341
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:27,190
Like yeah, I told you that when I was working on that stupid science project. We should just stop making this thing

342
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,750
This is dumb

343
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,800
It was just it was

344
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,650
some cost fallacy

345
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:39,170
Yep personified and thank goodness anyway go on. So I joined this team and

346
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,620
they had

347
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,620
Run for six years

348
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:55,260
Shipped three versions of the product and had never shipped with a hundred percent BVT passing in

349
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,900
That six years time

350
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,740
This was a hard problem to them. They did not understand what was going on

351
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:11,060
Management thought automation was just completely useless because they couldn't figure out this problem

352
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,100
and

353
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,380
Again a BVT is a build verification test it is

354
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:25,820
In today's world. It would be somewhere between an integration test and a unit test so

355
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,300
More complex than a unit test less complex than a integration test

356
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,860
Now at this point in time I had never ever ever ever

357
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,620
encountered a team

358
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,440
That didn't have BVT's

359
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,880
Passing at least once a week and this is a team that had shipped three versions

360
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:55,070
It's so funny. It's on me. It's 15 years ago, but yeah, it sounds like a lifetime ago. I just it I I

361
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,350
Can't believe we lived through that without killing ourselves. I've noticed that as I'm getting older

362
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:08,780
Time appears to be passing by faster. Maybe and this goes back to paraphrase something you've said

363
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:13,960
Previously is I think today I worry way more about quality than do about testing

364
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,340
Yes, and I've this is an example of that we were worried about the testing

365
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,780
well, so

366
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,910
The team was I asked to take on this as as a project. I found it fascinating

367
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:35,950
Like it is somehow I knew upfront this team had way over complicated their BVT pass

368
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:40,630
Like to the best of my knowledge up until then it was nearly impossible

369
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,150
to get

370
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,670
BVT's into this type of state

371
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,560
anyway

372
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,200
Shortening the story what I went and researched and I discovered

373
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
Exactly. What was going on

374
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,540
they had designed their BVT suite to

375
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,620
essentially be what

376
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,400
The person is asking us on on this question

377
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:13,460
They had abandoned it so you can take the equivalent of they had abandoned their unit tests done only

378
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,900
scenario-based gooey tests and

379
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,780
They could not get their test pass to pass

380
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,060
Why?

381
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,900
because when the scenario

382
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,870
fails

383
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,870
There was always

384
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,190
approximately

385
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:36,670
250 different check-ins that could have caused the failure

386
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,350
Okay, and you end up

387
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,750
Spending dev let's say the test is provably saying the products failing

388
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:51,770
The problem is is it because you didn't define the failure at the moment the code integrated

389
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,390
You end up spending about ten times the cost

390
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,270
Undiagnosing

391
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,100
the the problem

392
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:08,750
So yeah, this this would be a horrible idea ignoring the fact that gooey testing or gooey automation is

393
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,510
Absolutely

394
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,270
One of the hardest things on the planet to do

395
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Reminds me of a story. Yeah

396
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,240
So on Xbox one which was some little pockets of agile

397
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,400
Encompassed in a big cesspool of waterfall cesspool is wrong. It was a fun project

398
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,820
But what team was this Xbox one? Oh good

399
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,440
We defined we're very careful about defining like

400
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,520
What a BVT was and our levels of testing we didn't use the pyramid as a metaphor

401
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,580
We could have but the BVT answered the question each level of testing answered a question the unit test answered the question

402
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:56,800
Is my code ready to check in and the BVT answered the question is this build worth?

403
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
investing any more testing effort on

404
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,820
So we wouldn't even run the next level of test unless the BVT is passed wouldn't bother

405
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,220
I use those questions. I had another set of questions as well and

406
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:14,940
my set of questions were roughly equivalent to if this test suite passes is

407
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:21,100
The next test suite have an 80 to 90 percent chance of passing as well

408
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,800
So in other words, not only did I use it for a gate for things like check-in and things like that

409
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,720
But I'm like no I want a super fast suite that says whether or not it's worthwhile to begin the next week

410
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:42,630
And different levels of testing answered similar questions until it went to beta users

411
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:49,170
So then recently recently being like maybe six months ago, maybe longer because I can't tell time anymore Noah Sussman

412
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,730
Did a very clever thing which makes a lot of sense. He inverted the pyramid

413
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,040
And did basically the same thing answering these questions

414
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,760
If you look at the pyramid upside down all

415
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,300
Basic functionality bugs should be caught by the unit tests these levels of bugs

416
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,900
We catch here the only bugs that get to here are ones that have failed have somehow passed all those things

417
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,740
I'll see if I can post a link to it. Yeah, so I

418
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:22,350
Think we're both saying the same thing particularly in the world of the the modern tester, right?

419
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:27,560
Calendar time is critical. You can't have your devs spending

420
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,960
a whole lot of their time

421
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Just running through your end-to-end scenarios to figure out what the hell bug they just checked in

422
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:40,760
You also can't have your automators spending all their time maintaining

423
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
extremely challenging

424
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:52,300
Gooey their automators. I don't know what yeah, I don't know what the crazy kids call these people nowadays. I don't know either I

425
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,130
Ask my team to write please write less automation

426
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,740
Help the devs write more that is the way to go. Thank you

427
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,440
Are we done with that? Yeah, we made our point

428
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,400
I don't think you liked our answer, but we're not here to give answers you'd like we're here to give honest answers

429
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:22,000
I and I I understand opinions. I understand the theory but no I'd be too but running the regression suite is

430
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,350
not the

431
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,350
priority

432
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,740
No

433
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,140
agreed

434
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,500
Okay, my stop writing automation post is

435
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,750
Seven years old now

436
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:43,180
Yeah, I think it's I think the way you just said it is the best way. I've ever heard you say it

437
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:49,830
Because when you read it it sounds like you're anti automation and it's

438
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,930
You're not it's no

439
00:33:53,510 --> 00:34:00,590
The people who write the automation should also be the people who wrote the code. I think so me too

440
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:06,930
One more question this one from slack channel one of the three dot slack comm

441
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,970
Contact me or perusee on Twitter if you want to get added, but this is from Danny thought the infamous Danny thought

442
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,710
For an organization that is moving to doing testing in production

443
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,090
How important is it to have a data scientist participating?

444
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:30,380
Does a data scientist ensure that sufficient data is available to show whether an application is having problems in production?

445
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,620
So really we have two questions here

446
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,180
one

447
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,620
Maybe easier to answer than the other as the data scientist

448
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,460
Should you answer first or as the non data scientist should I answer first? I don't care

449
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,040
Would you like me to answer? I want you to care?

450
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,680
Like for me I'm in an organization that is moving to doing testing in production

451
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,480
Yep, and I don't have any data scientists on my team

452
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,920
We do have data scientists in the org that I can and will leverage as needed

453
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,360
But there are some interns interim steps that you can do being

454
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,420
Was just a little bit of math and statistics knowledge and the ability to use or even better yet

455
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:22,100
The ability to use a search engine on the internet you can get by I think for quite a while

456
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:29,820
In moving in that direction what you really need help with in moving that direction is a nice partnership with operations

457
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:35,020
Or infra or devops whoever is building your monitoring system to figure out how you're going to

458
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:40,220
Leverage that and what are the ways you're going to use that to monitor system health tests that run in production

459
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,220
What happens when they fail to those fire alerts?

460
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:51,060
Getting that built up in the first place is much more important than getting the deeper analytics that come from data science in my opinion

461
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,820
When you're moving to testing in production, right the first thing that's gonna happen and by the way, I

462
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,780
Would say a good 50% of my data science team my individual team is

463
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,220
on a problem similar to this

464
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,210
But it is entirely dependent on your maturity model on

465
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:17,530
Where you are with testing in production testing in production

466
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,890
It has two interpretations one is the the monitoring

467
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:25,450
Stuff that you're talking about the other is

468
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,530
The a B testing paradigm I've seen both of these things

469
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:34,730
Classified under testing or production on a B testing

470
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,100
Yeah, you definitely want a

471
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:47,940
Statistician to help you with the hypothesis testing. Mm-hmm. There's multiple flavors of data scientists. Do you need an ml for this? No

472
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,500
it's its basic stats for

473
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:54,530
testing in production from a sense of

474
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:01,020
Monitoring do you need a data scientist? No you can get away

475
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:10,020
For a long time without one will one having one help accelerate and help avoid several problems

476
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,200
Yeah, it will one of the most common problems once you go to testing in production

477
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:23,210
The first problem is signal to noise ratios. How do how do we set these thresholds?

478
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:28,420
The the first practice as you set it to be static values

479
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,880
but then you realize oh crap this particular series is spiky and

480
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:41,610
And we only we only care if it's above the spike for 20 minutes

481
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:51,220
Well the then you go, okay. Well, we'll just add another threshold that says don't alert anybody unless it's been above this spike for 20 minutes

482
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,420
But then the next problem that you run into is oh

483
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,220
Yeah

484
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,430
So we did good on reducing noise

485
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,070
but now

486
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:07,990
Our service has been offline for 20 minutes. So when it's actually a real thing

487
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:15,020
Data science is is is really helpful in terms of

488
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,420
Working through the signal noise problem. I think

489
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,780
Answer the question also depends on

490
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:29,300
What is a data scientist you need to go and the and the canonical answer is it's a statistician who works in Silicon Valley?

491
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
But let's do you need

492
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
your canonical

493
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,300
Do you need like to go hire someone you who is a

494
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:47,140
Self-proclaimed or has a job current job panel as data scientist, or do you just need someone on the team who?

495
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Understand statistics and can and can

496
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:58,160
Tell when there are anomalies and depending on the size of the team like if there is headcount here

497
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,760
Right and depending on the maturity level

498
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,020
just hire somebody that is is

499
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,040
Has knowledge in this space?

500
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
One or two years out of college

501
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:19,360
They will they will probably provide the right amount of ROI for this project

502
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,440
Right and I think that

503
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,120
The biggest thing is they'll stop you from doing some stupid things. It's really easy

504
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,840
I see this happened all the time and I'm as Brent knows I am NOT a data scientist, but I

505
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,240
Can fake a lot of shit and I've read a lot about statistics

506
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,960
I once gave a talk on a be testing and used all the right words and made Brent happy

507
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
I know enough about

508
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:50,640
Statistics I'll say that I could ask the right questions about metrics and understand how to figure out

509
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:57,360
Whether something is statistically significant and in actually in the scenario I just mentioned

510
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,200
The advice I just gave like hire

511
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
Somebody who's just fresh out of college

512
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,480
You would be able to do a lot with that person because you know

513
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:13,570
What data science can do and what it can't do to some degree you may not know how to do it

514
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:20,050
But you understand the language and you understand what it can do so you you would be able to to appropriately

515
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:29,130
Direct this individual. Mm-hmm and a lot of the other places where I've had this question answered you have a bunch of people who

516
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:35,130
Data science is the equivalent of magic. I want to hire a magician, too

517
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,210
And I don't think that's a healthy situation for a young data scientist

518
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:47,290
No, I don't think so another one and you mentioned the AB testing and

519
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:53,970
It's good to differentiate the fact that just synthetic tests tests that you like actual tests that you would run internally

520
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:59,730
Run those against production had them trigger an alert when they fail that stuff does not need a data scientist, but

521
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,730
Whether it's a be testing or just understanding more about customer usage

522
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,090
One thing I found that I'm not great at yet, but I'm better than most

523
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:15,490
Around me because I spent a lot of time studying this is figuring out how to ask the right questions

524
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:20,810
From data like how like that's where a data scientist can help like hey, we want to know X

525
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:29,180
The data scientist is often the best person to figure out the right data. You need to collect in order to figure out X

526
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:33,410
Brent you would think

527
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:42,210
Well, yeah, if not, then don't hire them. No, there's a new phenomenon that's coming in lately

528
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,260
Where I've encountered a lot of data scientists

529
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,660
the kind of X

530
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,820
backed

531
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,500
That all they're gonna do is is machine

532
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,960
Model building machine learning model building. Um, so

533
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,620
No one likes to clean the data. No one likes to

534
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:09,020
Do the data mining to figure those things out?

535
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:16,800
You know do those guys I essentially say, you know too bad

536
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,600
That's not how that's not how it works. The fun data science projects are

537
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,320
Messy the valuable ones are messy. I

538
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,700
Wonder if just like if you were to ask ten testers what they do you may get eleven different answers

539
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:41,220
I wonder if right now while the data science role is sort of growing and evolving that it's sort of the same thing it is

540
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:46,000
It is because summer I know there are ML people there are

541
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,840
Statisticians there are people that ask the right questions that can design experiments

542
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:58,080
I think there's a lot of nuance and expertise in data science just as there is in

543
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,680
software testing so

544
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,720
It took me a long time to come up with a definition of a testers job

545
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:15,180
I have greatly accelerated and I have a definition of a data scientist job and a data

546
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,020
scientist job is is to understand the relationships between

547
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,380
variables that

548
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,020
positively drive action for the business

549
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,700
That's not bad. I know

550
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,620
I know

551
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:32,020
Brett just hurt his shoulder patting himself on the back

552
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:38,420
But you will you talked so it is I've now interviewed several hundred of them

553
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:44,140
And there is a lot of there's a lot of common complaints. There is a lot of

554
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,100
common expectations

555
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,220
right

556
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,100
date several data scientists expect that

557
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,500
They'll be doing everything in Python several data scientists expect that

558
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,960
Someone else does the data engineering and the data mining

559
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,970
This is what's typical in an academic environment

560
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,940
right I

561
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,180
Am actually going to be doing a presentation

562
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,060
in that within the next month for

563
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,980
One of my one of my professors just joined a brand new university

564
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,180
He wants to start a series and he's calling analytics think tank

565
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:29,860
So I got to build a deck around

566
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,060
you know

567
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,060
how Microsoft

568
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,540
Uses data science that it's targeted the academic world

569
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,780
right one of the things I'm going to bring up is

570
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,520
It

571
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,520
So the thing I'm one of my favorite things and I haven't quite figured out how I'm gonna bring it up

572
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:56,710
I'm gonna bring it up. I think and I thought this back in in in the old days

573
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:02,150
That PhD CS students were useless. I'm finding

574
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,100
PhD data science

575
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:12,260
People are mostly useless. No, they're useful for writing papers, but not for practical software applications

576
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:19,850
Yeah, I fully agree with the former. Yeah, it's it's not enough experience latter, but I'm not surprised

577
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,020
There is a big push

578
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:30,540
In society lately where where there's a lot of questioning around what's the value of the university education system?

579
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,780
You got things like Coursera

580
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,100
We're more open source than we've ever been

581
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,660
There's a lot of open content

582
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,860
We don't have time for a rant. Did you see my blog post ranting about their

583
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:48,580
The security VP security the CTO or whatever of Equifax?

584
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,300
is blamed for

585
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:56,180
The their security breach people were freaking out because she's a music major

586
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,640
I

587
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,800
Got up on my horse because one of a music major so a little defensive but to

588
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,440
A university is not a vocational school. It's place where you supposed to learn how to think and

589
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,200
Many people do apply what they learned in their their actual degree towards

590
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,050
What they do, but many many don't and that's okay

591
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:29,650
Yeah, if you if you want to go to school to get a specific job go to a vocational school go to course

592
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:35,210
You know, yeah, anyway big rant there isn't a vocational data science school

593
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:37,290
Yet

594
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:44,370
Yet, but man my crash course part of my crash course in learning data science is courses on Coursera

595
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:49,920
Yeah, no Coursera is a great thing and I I actually I

596
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,080
I do think in in

597
00:46:54,040 --> 00:47:03,490
Probably in our lifetime Alan certainly in our children's lifetime. I think we're gonna see a big shakeup in in the education

598
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,460
system, I hope so

599
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:16,270
But the the point I was trying to make like if you have if you if you

600
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:18,990
Have the desire

601
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:24,070
To to get into let's say data science or computer science

602
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,910
And work in industry

603
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,780
When you start off to college I do

604
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,860
seriously question the value of

605
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,100
pursuing

606
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,060
Bachelors all the way to the PhD before you start going into industry

607
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:53,380
Right if you want your PhD, I might I my recommendation would be

608
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,060
Stop at masters maybe even stop at bachelors get a job in industry

609
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,740
Work through that then go back. I

610
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,020
We could do a whole episode ranting on this, but we are

611
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:13,660
Unfortunately about at a time for today, they're not I so totally agree with you

612
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,460
Yeah, I I've been gonna leave it at that but maybe we'll talk more about that another time

613
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:24,770
I think we need to think hard about that. Oh, so anyway answer the question Danny

614
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,450
Possibly your knowledge may vary

615
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,980
Depends on the type of data scientists you want

616
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:34,890
Do you need one? No, will it be helpful? Yeah. Yeah

617
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:39,330
Should you evaluate the ROI based on where you are also? Yes

618
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:46,410
Yeah, figure out exactly exactly what you want to do, but you don't have to get the the the goat data science

619
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:52,410
It's not magic summit. Oh they decided to see here all of our data will be perfect and we'll make awesome decisions right away

620
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:55,530
Yeah, I'm gonna happen. Okay, everybody

621
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,110
If you're still here

622
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:02,550
I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we'll see you next time
