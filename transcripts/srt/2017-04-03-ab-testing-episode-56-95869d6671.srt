1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,220
Hey everybody, I'm Alan and Brad and we're here for episode number 56

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,080
56 that's way older than either of us

3
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,690
Yelling counting down to episode 100 only 44 to go almost there. We should hit

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,170
I don't wait took us three years to get here. Oh

5
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,910
Happy three-year anniversary

6
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,550
Happy three-year anniversary brand

7
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,670
Hug hug kiss kiss

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,110
So you haven't made a comment yet, but and listeners you can't see this because the video stream is not working today as far as I know

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:49,710
No, it's offline. I'm wearing a you wearing a unity sweatshirt. Oh, look at you and you're in all like fancy pants

10
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,710
Oh, I'm up with that. I

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,230
They're not really fancy pants. You just joined the company. Are you interviewing already? They're not

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,400
I am NOT wearing jeans. I'm wearing a pair of blue pants. So

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,510
They're really soft. I would have you feel them but then

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,220
We might often the podcast would be over probably. Yeah, we have to change our rating

15
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,760
We get all weird and stuff

16
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,740
There's a story behind this particular sweatshirt

17
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,460
one cool thing

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:28,340
We're gonna need a you know, we drink when we say this before yes when Alan talks about how cool it is

19
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,420
I work at unity. We'll have to do something else. I'm not sure what it is. But

20
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:36,730
One of the things that's kind of fun about unity is each of their offices around the world

21
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,570
They have unique swag for that office. Oh

22
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,660
and

23
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,280
People in the Seattle office look at my kind of purple unity sweatshirt. They go. Oh my god

24
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,700
I want that sweatshirt. You can only get this sweatshirt from the Helsinki office

25
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,820
I have a gray unity hoodie for it from the Seattle office and I eventually I hope to collect a rainbow

26
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,040
so

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:06,790
So the sweatshirt model at unity is gives managers the ability to lord over their their travel budget

28
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,950
just

29
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,810
Being stupid so it's not just swag about I spot identity. So it's not just about

30
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,030
It's about swag. It's not just about sweatshirts. I also got a

31
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,180
unity beanie

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,660
Only available there black one. They have socks there too. They didn't have any left

33
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,500
Anyway, it's kind of cool. I haven't really been in the swag rooms as much

34
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,500
They have different swag at different locations different colors and just kind of a fun way to you can kind of spot where someone's from. Oh

35
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:41,220
Like there's like a conference you go. Oh, you're from Unite. Um, it's Copenhagen unity

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,800
Which which location has the coolest color? I don't know yet

37
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,380
What what color is Seattle gray gray of course match the sky, right?

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,720
Copenhagen I

39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,900
Wasn't in Copenhagen long enough to inspect their swag

40
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,120
I was in the office for a half a day and then the next day I was there at a full day off-site

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,900
So, how does the swag thing work you just show up and like hey, I'm here

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,340
No, I had to do a little finagling and sweet-talking

43
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:22,050
So it isn't like you show it isn't like a scavenger hunt where you I'm here give me my box of stuff

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,100
Is it more like so I don't like at the Olympics like the

45
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,780
Athletes they trade something. I'm trying to remember what it is

46
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,220
Well at the end of a soccer match often players will trade their jerseys, right?

47
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,980
That's right

48
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:44,840
If it's all over yeah, in fact, I've I did that I walked into the office and I pointed at someone took my shirt off

49
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,680
And offered it to him expecting me to give me theirs, but they just kind of freaked out and walked away

50
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:54,230
Yeah, that might be a little understandable

51
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,290
Okay, so what do we have for our three listeners today?

52
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,310
For the three today

53
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,350
We've already mentioned episode 56. We wanted to elaborate a little bit on

54
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,770
the comments we discussed before around the role of quality and

55
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,450
How those have played out at least in my work over the last

56
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:27,650
Couple weeks. Okay, it's been a pony a month since we recorded last

57
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:36,430
I have been channeling Brent a lot recently in that I've been saying I've been stealing his line on

58
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,370
The role of test or quality arc whatever I call it is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality

59
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,270
Yep, and the reason I nailed that right is because I actually I've really channeled Brent a lot and

60
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:56,090
Used that line because I think it encompasses a lot of what I want a quality team to do. So thank you, Brent. Yeah, you're welcome

61
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:00,820
So I was particularly proud when I finally connected those dots

62
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:06,260
So what happened was I was at an off-site and I won't go into all the details but

63
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,140
one of our

64
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,580
engineering leaders

65
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,060
Came up with the point

66
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,500
He said that perhaps it wasn't even like seeing this as an absolute says

67
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,850
Perhaps we should consider that all development work should create value or

68
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:30,100
Right. That what I said in the thing. Yeah, I just what all dev work should create value and then Brett

69
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,090
Brent

70
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:39,050
Brett's our engineering leader Brett Brent a blue. Are you referring to me or someone else? I'm referring to you. Okay

71
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,050
You had a reaction to that around ROI. Can you recap that?

72
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,080
The actually my reaction

73
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,030
around ROI

74
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,190
was

75
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:57,870
Was to a comment of what test role because right that comment is around what devs work should be

76
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,570
So my comment was

77
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,150
What test should be doing this? Mm-hmm, right? Cuz that if all dev work

78
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:12,060
I can actually connect this these two I thought you had maybe I just did in my head

79
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,860
I didn't it so it was a different thread, but I can connect it here, right if all dev work is to create value

80
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:27,340
One might be able to use that as an argument for for example unit test moving to test to a test org

81
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:36,320
Right unit tests on create value only product could I would argue they do they create the value that of course you would argue that

82
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,240
But what we're trying to do is talk about like I've had the argument

83
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,920
With dev on multiple occasions like it's all along with the theme of well if we dev are picking up unit tests

84
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,280
What does the test team do I've heard that

85
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,920
It's been a long long time. I've heard the exact same line

86
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:05,120
I would certainly and I don't think this is the point that we want to get into but certainly I want to be careful with with

87
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,570
absolutist statements like all dev work should create value

88
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,630
Because our create customer value

89
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,970
Because it's pretty clear. It doesn't take much sort of

90
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:27,700
Psychological analysis to come to the conclusion then that means dev should only be working on product code

91
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Because that's what creates customer value. You could definitely spin it that way and

92
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,440
Any

93
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
developer who is on

94
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:47,120
Marching on the the side of all I want to do is write code

95
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,440
That's something that they're gonna use

96
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,760
as a

97
00:07:52,760 --> 00:08:00,520
Yeah, I could I could see how it could fall down that trap and and I could see why in our org

98
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,000
why it would be safe to make that statement because

99
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,000
All of our devs consider writing tests part of writing code

100
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,120
But definitely you definitely have a culture in place for you to say an absolute this is not and to be clear

101
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,720
This is a statement. I wanted to capture out of context

102
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,960
To have this conversation. Okay, it's not a statement on like how unity does development and how

103
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,080
People are rewarded or anything like that. It was a statement. I thought oh, I think this now this is interesting

104
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,360
I want to bring this up in the context of what Brent and I were talking about

105
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,640
Accelerating the Brent and I I'm taking half credit now

106
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Accelerating

107
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm taking all credit

108
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,840
Accelerating the achievement of simple quality

109
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,800
So just I just want to be clear on that that it's not like this is the way unity does stuff

110
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,360
I want to capture this statement because I thought it would kick off a discussion. No, it sounds like

111
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
you you were in a

112
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,080
Off-site with leadership. This is what it sounded like to me and

113
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,640
Your executive is doing what he's

114
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
should be doing which is trying to

115
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
understand and

116
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,240
communicate the principles in which

117
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,360
He was he was digging he wants to come up with guiding principles. This is well

118
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
This is my vision or my not vision but the vision

119
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,290
My understanding of it inception vision. He's he's trying to create principles

120
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,730
You've already expressed that that unity

121
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,120
is

122
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,040
classally less of a command and control structure than here at Microsoft and

123
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,720
And the way you you do that at an executive level as you you create these

124
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
rallying cry type

125
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,400
principles that guide behavior and guide decision-making at the lower levels so many tangents in my head

126
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,280
Trying to control that your face suddenly just turned really red

127
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,600
Oh many so many so I'm gonna start do a couple of them

128
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:06,920
All right

129
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:14,930
One is you mentioned that I just have to say I had no I knew my previous manager Microsoft was a bit of a micromanager

130
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,470
in reflection. Oh my god over the top massive

131
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,550
Micromanager it is relative, isn't it?

132
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,700
Justice we cast some conversations around some

133
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,500
Personnel things and I made some gut calls that this is what I think and I'm good about taking one of the things I have

134
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,860
really worked on being able to do is being able to make a decision giving either a lot of data or a small amount of

135
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,580
data and then but it's so weird to

136
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,860
Make that decision or offer the decision. Here's what I think I'm gonna do or here's what I want to do and

137
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,980
Not have it completely picked apart and second-guessed and it's like wait that sounds right. I trust your decision instead

138
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,220
It's weird. It's good

139
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,930
But yeah, the other tangent before you go on is you mentioned rallying cry

140
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,520
Yeah, as I've mentioned many times

141
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,280
I'm a big fan of Pat lunchioni's business fables around leadership and and growth

142
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,800
He probably the most famous one is the five dysfunctions of a team, but probably not even in the top five of his books

143
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,440
One of the things he mentions in one of the books and I forget which one is the need for a rallying cry and a lot

144
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:39,240
of companies will develop a rallying cry as a reaction to a crisis and Brent and I will remember in

145
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:48,680
2000 when Microsoft was just full of viruses with code red and slammer how the whole company basically went offline for a

146
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,800
while a few months month to just study security and learn how to write secure software and

147
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,080
Build a security culture. We had a rallying cry around security. Yes

148
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,160
And and to this day now Microsoft I believe is

149
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,160
Knows more about writing secure software than most companies in the world because it's really beat into the culture

150
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,020
But the challenge is and what we're potentially even

151
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,740
Overdoing it perhaps but what I'll tell you like every third action on my desktop right now

152
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,660
I have to take out my badge and

153
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,020
Do a FA. Yeah, the internal security is great. I don't miss that

154
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,980
I don't miss I have a normal password on my phone. I miss type the password. My phone doesn't get wiped

155
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,780
I told some of my teammates

156
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,700
My boss and some and a colleague

157
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,340
About the fact that if I type my password wrong three times my phone to get wiped out and their jaws just dropped and they

158
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:52,340
Freaked out they couldn't believe that could ever actually happen anywhere. That was a tangent on top of a tangent. So rewinding one tangent

159
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,160
What's important for a company to do an organization is have a rallying cry even when there isn't a crisis

160
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,630
Have have this this ties in a little bit maybe to in lean analytics. Yeah. Yeah, the one true metric

161
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,630
What's the one thing we care about?

162
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,650
right, so a

163
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,930
And it can be context sensitive. I find

164
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,930
that it's helpful if you have for example a

165
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,320
An executive that has different sorts of teams

166
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,730
right, I

167
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,170
think it's okay that he gives a

168
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,930
different sort of

169
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:36,950
rallying cry or a sub rallying cry for that team, right

170
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,830
He may be focused on reducing cycle time

171
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,790
Right. Yeah, and that's gonna be something that's gonna be really important for

172
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:52,620
The whole business unit that may be his master rallying cry, but he may go to the engineering systems team and

173
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,620
Create a more actionable one. That's like hey, I want 15-minute builds

174
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,310
Yeah, right. All right. Let's put a pin in that because actually I have some

175
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,670
Principles for my team at Unity, but I want to hit those a little bit later

176
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:10,150
You want to pop the stack a little bit and come back to I wanted to set context on

177
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,870
The comment about all dev works should create value. Let's say that was that's not a

178
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,310
principle or a rallying cry of unity that was a

179
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:25,390
Statement made to start another discussion which I captured in order for us to have this discussion which we are having now and

180
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,490
Well, this is this is the first time I think we've ever like

181
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,980
Decomposed our tangential route I

182
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,680
Had to remember in order for me to remember what we were

183
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,860
Back I had to pop the stack and remember how the hell we got there

184
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:53,140
Which is really just skip over it. There's this awesome thing. We write up for the episodes every time

185
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:59,940
Just go straight to it. Yeah, you know, what would be good. I wonder if you played a

186
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
This podcast over

187
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,900
Over

188
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,060
With the sound muted the movie inception if our conversations would line up with the dream within a dream within a dream

189
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,070
I'm sure it does

190
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:21,990
It's be like when you play dark side of the moon with Wizard of Oz and there's another one of those

191
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,810
Okay. Yeah. All right, then so so anyway

192
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:31,050
You were talking. So do you want me to well, where do you want to go?

193
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:34,570
Do you want to get to the ROI discussion the nuance?

194
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:40,970
I want to discuss was you talked about ROI in the sense you can I'm gonna paraphrase it while you're looking it up on

195
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:46,490
Your phone and then you can talk about it the point you got to that if the goal of test is to accelerate

196
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,970
the achievement of shippable quality

197
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,240
Then blah blah blah the goal of test is to reduce I

198
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,000
Reduce the investment make it easier to achieve result. So what I said in this context

199
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,000
Right. This was on the slack channel and

200
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,030
One of the three dot slack calm

201
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Several of the three were sort of

202
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,910
chatting back and forth

203
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,820
It started off with a question

204
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:24,370
Around us mentioning that there should be an emphasis on only working on stuff that provably increases customer value

205
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:29,370
And then there was a question. What would you do when you get into a company?

206
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:35,530
where the codebase is horrible without any automated tests and or we're running a

207
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,560
Linter linter a static analysis tool. Okay or some other

208
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,640
Similar tool. I don't have my reading glasses on I apologize

209
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,120
Finds all kinds of bugs or potential bugs

210
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,820
Would you invest any time in improving the codebase and or writing automated tests or do you expect?

211
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:04,820
Approved the direct relation of this to customer value how etc. And then there was a bunch of discussion

212
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:08,420
Amongst the three well, you're scrolling down

213
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,440
I'll say the first thing I do in a company like that is by a bunch of copies of Michael feathers working with legacy code

214
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,860
Fantastic ideas in that book for how to deal with that sort of mess

215
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,650
Yeah, and I would also bring in them

216
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,320
Martin Fowler's refactor. I find that book is fantastic. Yeah

217
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,240
There's a pair then what the hell might as well bring in his continuous

218
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:35,060
Delivery book I forget the name of it is a continuous deployment

219
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,220
Martin

220
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,170
Part is Martin and Fowler combined and in a fortunate way

221
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,290
Martin Fowler is just a fantastic author for these type of things. Alright, so my comment was

222
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,660
All features should be done to provably

223
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:03,140
Proveably create customer value, but they should be done in ROI order and then I state testing in this light

224
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,330
serves one goal and one goal only to reduce I

225
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,700
That and that's what I want to discuss because but when I was saying in this light it was on the conversation of

226
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,640
Fixing devs crappy architecture. Yeah, so

227
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,050
I for now you put that in context the discussion is less relevant. So I looked at that I thought yeah and

228
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:36,410
The first time I saw that statement I thought I said that's actually

229
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,470
Gets to the crux of your initial statements. It's a reduction of

230
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,630
Accelerate the achievable quality right then that made me think

231
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,500
Inception inception inception. It made me think that well if the goal of test is to reduce I

232
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,940
Then is the role of test merely a cost reduction

233
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,100
rule I

234
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,620
And and then I have tried to abstract that out and I don't think it is

235
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:11,100
And it could be in a way, but I never wanted to be counted that way

236
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,620
No

237
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,780
but if you so even my even my mantra that you've talked about here like the

238
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,840
That our role is to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality

239
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,290
Right. I picked the word acceleration on purpose

240
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,180
right because it acceleration is

241
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,600
the the act of

242
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,200
Taking an existing speed and speeding it up

243
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,460
right, so

244
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,270
it's an auxiliary role if you think of it from a from a

245
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,780
into in business type of thing it is

246
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,940
It it implies that there is another

247
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,370
element that is a

248
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,050
working to achieve shippable quality and

249
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,930
Test roles in this is to take that element

250
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:13,090
understand the processes of the missing tooling and speed it up and

251
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,170
Now ROI can be framed in terms of costs like it normally is

252
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,650
But as you're aware

253
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,010
Normally nowadays when I think of these sorts of things

254
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:38,510
The biggest cost I'm concerned with is calendar time. Mm-hmm. Right, but it might I I have mentioned this before

255
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:44,230
But my number one concern is are we producing business value?

256
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,830
My number two concern is how do we shrink calendar time?

257
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:54,980
My number three concern is how do we shrink the number of engineering hours required? Mm-hmm. Yeah

258
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,960
I

259
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Think my very first blog on this topic

260
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,320
Was on what is the ROI of test?

261
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,800
in another light one that I think is more for

262
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,960
Might be more helpful or more lightning or more

263
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,040
useful to the audience is is around

264
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,330
risk reduction

265
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,260
But one of the things that I do see

266
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,300
tests like what was communicated on the on the channel is we see a lot of

267
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,340
Tests saying hey this code base sucks. So we should create a bunch of automation to

268
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,340
To what make it easier to

269
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,460
Determine when you screwed up the code base. Is that not enablement to some degree?

270
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
right at the it's

271
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,990
We

272
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,510
tests in my humble opinion, right

273
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:04,670
Really wants to construct the practices that enables

274
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,740
This acceleration on a regular basis

275
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,180
right

276
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:18,540
Creating a multi-million dollar test suite upon a crappy code base doesn't really do that

277
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,380
That can be a little bit of the if all you have is a hammer. Everything's a nail. Yeah, automation

278
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm gonna do this what I have I'm curious to your thoughts on this now is

279
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,270
When I elaborate on the context of your statement, which I've stolen as stated before

280
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,510
I talk about it's now public domain

281
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:43,850
I talk about my love and admiration of the theory of constraints quite a bit. Yes in that

282
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:49,100
Figure out not what sucks, but what's the biggest bottleneck?

283
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
to our

284
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,140
Process here. What's the biggest bottleneck and not solve it completely

285
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:03,900
Mitigate it until it's not the biggest bottleneck anymore and then take on the next I will say so I like that approach

286
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
I just don't like the word mitigate

287
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,410
So what would you use instead? I would say

288
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:15,010
Solve enough of it. I think it's is that what it means it does now mitigate to me means

289
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,760
You know, hey the the buildings on fire

290
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,880
We're gonna mitigate the pain by just removing everybody from the building

291
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:30,260
Let the building burn. I will look for a better word, but you get it. It's like the conversation I had

292
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,320
With someone just last week is like our devs really want some end-to-end tests as part of their

293
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,540
Chicken suite and we're gonna help them get started on that. But I also have this I

294
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,980
Also want to make sure we get this other

295
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,220
multi-machine thing running for

296
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,100
That going in the details. Okay, and

297
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:56,740
In order prioritization, you know, it's maybe even goes to ROI from the acceleration side, right? Which one solves the bigger bottleneck?

298
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,900
So well the devs already have a bunch of check-in tests. But one thing we can't do is we have we're totally blind over here

299
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Okay, do that. So we're not blind anymore. Maybe don't get all the way done

300
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,940
But get rid of blind spots goes through the crap out of me big ROI there

301
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:17,620
Yep, and then if the devs getting some more end-to-end tests as part of their suite is the next biggest bottleneck for our

302
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:26,180
Accelerating the achievement of shippable quality then do that but otherwise but reevaluated every step. It's a constant reprioritization right and to your point around

303
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,660
Solve enough of it so that it's not the biggest bottleneck like

304
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,220
one thing I might consider if I were in your shoes like

305
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,330
so you

306
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,370
this

307
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:44,370
This end-to-end suite right? So let's theorize. Hey, there isn't

308
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,250
There isn't the test hooks necessary, right? So the

309
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,190
from my experience

310
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,170
It sounds like an age-old ask of hey

311
00:24:55,170 --> 00:25:00,990
I want you to build me and end-to-end test suites for my check-in tests and

312
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,190
And I might go well

313
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:12,110
I have this huge major thing that we're completely blind to that it that is bothering me more. But what I will do is

314
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,020
I will take one guy offline and

315
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,890
Make it make a library such that you can build that in the end test suite

316
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:29,010
That's exactly it's what we do is we bootstrap. It's it's really they have a bunch of

317
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:34,150
Unit level tests and they wanted to have some selenium tests running there as well

318
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,590
And but they don't know how to write selenium tests very well. It's a basically they want to be bootstrapped

319
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,910
They don't want they don't want please write all of our tests for us

320
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,910
It's like please make it so we can write selenium tests that run and then and then we can jump in and do that

321
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,950
yeah, and and

322
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,960
again, if if that if

323
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,200
Breaking down

324
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,740
The workload in the smaller tasks and you determine the smaller tasks captures

325
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,540
70% of the ROI for the whole thing

326
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,340
And it's cheap do that first if it's not then do what's next first

327
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,400
So on the slack channel you mentioned

328
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,320
That there was some nuance have we covered this then I think we have covered the nuance

329
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,520
I just wanted to talk about the eye a little bit and see if I think we're in large agreement

330
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
So it wasn't as exciting. Okay

331
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,480
Tangent and I'll figure how to edit this to its less

332
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:34,470
Penis smacking so the the one thing though they still

333
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:43,310
Do have a problem with on a just from a dev centric point of view is the statement around all dev work should create customer value

334
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,510
Right and the other we don't need to go into it

335
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:51,990
but the other thing that I do see as a problem with that is that potentially a

336
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,530
argument

337
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:00,080
For the complete elimination of architectural improvements

338
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,320
And you could and there's plenty of ways to blow holes in that statement. Yes, it's absolutely not true all the time

339
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,120
It's absolutely true some of the time and let me tell you a case where it is. I

340
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Believe in I

341
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:18,900
culture of experimentation. Yep getting to a stage where everything you ship is an experiment and

342
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,810
in order to

343
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,690
Determine the success of that experiment. You have to have some

344
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:35,250
Criteria for determining that and that's and what you want to determine is what is the business or customer value of this experiment and

345
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:41,410
Then find a way to measure that and determine very quickly if that experiment was a success or a failure

346
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:46,970
My my success or failure did it do that it improved business value as I thought or it didn't and

347
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,530
When you're in experimentation

348
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,290
Experimentation culture you do this so often that you don't care that

349
00:27:53,930 --> 00:28:00,450
Seven out of ten experiments fail or eight out of ten because you're doing it quickly enough and often enough that those two or three

350
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,770
That do increase value

351
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:10,230
Over time add up to massive improvements for customer happiness and love etc

352
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:18,270
You you there's another reason why you don't care about them failing is because you've crafted the experiment and that every

353
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,630
failure is still a win

354
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,480
It it's a learning experience. Yes

355
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,480
But so that's an example of why if all I'm doing is experiments

356
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,360
Then of course, but then of course everything provides value, but you're right. There's architectural improvements

357
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:40,520
There's building that safety net of a good unit test suite all those things you could say they

358
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,800
Supply

359
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,800
Indirect customer value they make it so we can give you new features more quickly because our stuff can't break

360
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,340
But but in the end the statement falls apart under analysis and that's okay

361
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,820
Which is why I want to get the caveat early on this is not a statement of how to make software not a suggestion

362
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
It is a

363
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,160
Often in debate or discussion. It's great to make a statement

364
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,960
That's partially but not entirely true and the learning comes from picking it apart. Yeah the

365
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,340
So like my favorite these type of rallying cry type principles

366
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,460
Well number one I generally

367
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,080
Despise

368
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,660
absolutist statements

369
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:33,980
Right and even things like the agile manifesto like you know very well. I hate the thing and it's it's

370
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,220
Because it creates a sort of absolutism that is

371
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,740
When it's read wrong, which it's read wrong. I know

372
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:50,980
I know it says given this or this we value both we prefer this one more right

373
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,580
But people therefore we should go all in on this one thing people don't read it that way and I saw a Rex black tweet

374
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,820
This morning. I was gonna reply. I thought I'm not gonna bother but he went off on

375
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,940
Basically he

376
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:10,620
He went off on is the process the software talking about all the love for agile scrum XP and

377
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:16,220
As you and I and the three know those are a means to an end

378
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,460
They're a way of doing things that may help you

379
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:23,430
Get customer about get better customer value to customers sooner

380
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:29,910
But if you just follow the process blindly I think it's gonna make you make great software. You're stupid blind faith is always stupid

381
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:36,110
It is a system like this is something that just drives me batty

382
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,470
producing software is a system and

383
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:42,430
No, if you follow if you follow the process

384
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:49,230
Just you're perfect your golden all you have to do is follow the process very carefully what process you define it except for the

385
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,430
First process the process Rex Rex's process

386
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,030
I'm being

387
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,430
Right because following process

388
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,950
blindly in anything in software in school in whatever is

389
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,270
dumb

390
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:07,070
improving the system

391
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,110
Always relies on

392
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,770
understanding

393
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:16,090
the technology base that we have the people that we're working with and the

394
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:20,610
Processes that combine all three and if you just focus on the process

395
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:26,690
You're gonna screw up the people a three. Guess what Brent sounds like he's context-driven

396
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,320
Again it's redundant just because I use the C word

397
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,600
All right

398
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,720
Anyway, it's healthy go on to the mail. I guess I'll back off the edge of the cliff here. Oh

399
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,900
All right good to be back recording again, you know cue that up

400
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:55,940
male

401
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,540
Alright, so

402
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,340
one of our

403
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,220
listeners posted a question

404
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,020
I'm gonna read the whole thing. I will sit back in my chair and relax

405
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:13,570
All right in the in the most recent episode there was it was a month ago. I'm sorry. Oh wait

406
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,250
That's not the right one anyway

407
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:27,310
All right. I'm it in the last podcast you stated. This is to Alan in the last podcast you stated that your

408
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:33,670
Mission or part of it is to create some sort of a unified testing culture across the organization

409
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,940
question is

410
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,060
How to do such a thing where I work we have a much simpler situation

411
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:47,060
Four teams in the same building all part of some sort of scrum teams

412
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,900
And the difference is the difference in approach and skill set are painful

413
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,970
How would the first steps to creating it a common culture?

414
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:00,500
would look like

415
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,540
bonus

416
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,970
How to do that without being a manager and bonus number two?

417
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,900
How do you intend to do that in your organization?

418
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,340
Where you have to gap multiple cultures and time zones all right?

419
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,600
Let's just take all those in no particular order at the same time intermingled

420
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,560
Okay in this session brand-new session we call

421
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Alan's life at Unity oh

422
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,670
I'm totally

423
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,260
That was unlike mailbag, I don't think you could do that

424
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,300
Totally improvised I'm not sure if that's gonna make the cut or not, but we'll see what happens

425
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,500
It's good to be in control of the editing sometimes

426
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:53,620
So really I'm gonna answer that by telling you what how I'm approaching that at Unity

427
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:58,240
And I've been there just about two months exactly now if you can believe it I can

428
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,470
so I think the first step in doing any sort of organizational change is

429
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,430
Take some time to learn what's going on

430
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,390
Figure out

431
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:13,030
There's noise in the background it's freaking us out

432
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:17,570
You need to get a good assessment of the current state

433
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,610
When I think about organizational change to think about current state and desired state

434
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:28,850
And then you can worry about the steps in between, but you need to be able to find where you are so I did that I

435
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,130
have

436
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:36,550
Now met in person most of my team and we'll have met all of them in person face to face

437
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,390
Probably by the end of May and that's helped out a lot. I'm gonna do a

438
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,950
Interjection. Yep

439
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:45,950
this is this is a

440
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:52,190
Very simple insight that I see a lot of people when they're knee-deep into it, but they forget

441
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,620
They either know where they are or where they want to be

442
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:02,500
right and and then they start taking action they don't

443
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,510
Spend the time to figure out that other part of

444
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:15,990
We'll call it the line like if if and I use will use a metaphor like if you're in, California

445
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,350
and you like oh

446
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,920
this sucks, I got to keep moving and

447
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,690
You start driving and realize you need to go to Hawaii

448
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,660
right, it's

449
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:37,540
Not gonna help you right you didn't properly plan out that you can't drive there right another similar situation

450
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
Right I've used this metaphor

451
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:49,180
It's so we're in Washington State which is north of California, and there's many times where I observe that people are

452
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:56,600
Driving to California by heading north yeah theoretically you'll eventually get there

453
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:05,010
But it's not the efficient route right so in that case like they know where they want to go

454
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,930
But they're not taking the direction that gets there so

455
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:15,450
understand not only where you want to be but where you are now and

456
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,160
Then build a plan to bridge sure sure and it sounds obvious

457
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,280
But I see people forget this all of the time and the other thing is it's not

458
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,280
There isn't a teleportation chamber that takes you from

459
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:34,030
Washington to California not yet not yet so

460
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,190
Part of it. I'll go this a little bit deeper you understand where you are where you're going

461
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:45,710
You want to take a baby step that direction and then by the time you take a couple baby steps your destination may change

462
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,030
We may start getting down the road. We're south

463
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:54,030
We're like get on our way to Portland, and we realize that you know what we actually need to go to Vegas

464
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,050
So things can change so

465
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:03,250
Taking this from the abstract to the concrete a little bit

466
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:08,690
I have a pretty good idea of where we are and in learning where we are there's

467
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:17,570
What I'm finding is parts of my organization are farther along that road towards where I want to go

468
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:21,090
Which is a data-driven data-centric culture for for services

469
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:27,930
Parts of the org are actually part way down that road and some are well that sounds really interesting

470
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,690
I actually found one of our our teams

471
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:39,970
You'll be happy to hear this brand they're talking about how they're approaching this one sort of testing said and they said so what we do

472
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:42,550
Is we just?

473
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,880
I guess don't need to give any context about this

474
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:51,680
So what we do is we just run a bunch of tests, and then we detect errors by analyzing the log files

475
00:37:52,280 --> 00:38:00,480
Which is what you talked about I said that's a good approach really say yeah, that's actually a very good approach

476
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,900
Yeah, no I love that approach I thought you'd be happy about yeah, yeah, we can do more of that

477
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:15,160
So anyway, I have an idea who my allies are and make sure do they do the do they use their

478
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,180
How do they analyze these log files and are they using the same tooling on prod?

479
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,980
it says

480
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,980
One thing I didn't want to go deep dive into context the thing about my you just say yes or no

481
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,060
It's not applicable and okay. It's NA all right because

482
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,140
although I

483
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,700
Am the director for all of quality for all of Unity services

484
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
I also

485
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,300
air quote own

486
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Wherever those services touch clients or editors so basically anything that is connected to a back end I own whether that

487
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:02,260
Code actually runs on a client device or a computer or in the cloud, so I do have some client testing as well

488
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:08,180
Like we have a feet so so you own the client the service integration as well. Yes

489
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,180
So I own how the service connects to the editor the Unity editor as well as how?

490
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
if the service

491
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,100
Like we have an SDK for example for doing ads on mobile devices

492
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,260
So I own how that SDK works on the mobile devices as well

493
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:31,330
Okay, okay, so anyway. I've learned

494
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,290
Where my allies are which is important to do if you're gonna make change and also

495
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,130
It would be stupid of me, and I'm sure I've mentioned before to go in there and go I have ideas

496
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:43,130
Here's what we're doing. Let's go

497
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:48,330
One of the things I said to the team both publicly and privately to people is I

498
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:52,220
Have a direction where I think we should go

499
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,420
But I want to do it in a way that by all means does not screw up any of the good things already happening here

500
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:03,910
Which I I I just think it would be stupid of me to take a company that

501
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:09,870
Full of smart people full of people working in really good ways and then tell them they're doing it wrong like you're doing it wrong

502
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,590
So I wanted to share I sent some just this week. I said

503
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,350
I did some bouncing. I've

504
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:23,990
My team structure just you know is I have three leads reporting to me with various sized teams plus like nine ICs

505
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,990
nine individual contributors so I have a combination of

506
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,630
Areas, I'm directly in charge of plus some leads take care of some areas, and they're spread out throughout the world

507
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:40,260
So probably worth as I loop back into trying to answer this question the next five minutes or so is I

508
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Have these people all over the world and

509
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,640
One thing I've told the team is that they all report to me

510
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,300
or up through me

511
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:58,540
But their work is almost entirely dictated by the feature teams. They work on they are everyone is a member of a feature team a scrum team

512
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,540
Many of them use calm bottom instead of scrum to make bread

513
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:10,440
But they remember that feature team they I suggest and most of them do already have one-on-ones with that feature team lead

514
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,520
In addition to me or their other lead who has one-on-ones

515
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,880
The the test folks the QA folks they don't already know I make sure they have one-on-ones with their feature

516
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,560
As well as me I I have one-on-ones with my whoever serves as PO for right because that's that's where their work comes from

517
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,640
They're gonna get better feedback on their day-to-day work

518
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,360
So I tell them I don't I'm not in charge of the QA organization as much as I'm in charge of a QA community

519
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:44,390
Okay, and the value of community and I wrote that up and then I said well am I thinking of community the right way?

520
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,390
So Q tech comes back

521
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,000
replanted to unity gosh

522
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,840
No

523
00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:02,440
Probably maybe maybe but I didn't type the definition up here, but community is a group of people who share

524
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,000
common

525
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,040
Knowledge with each other and and and I think it's a good way to describe it

526
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,000
And for the listeners Q tech because I out whenever I mentioned an acronym

527
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,640
I always get slammed on slack channel Q tech was the name of a community that

528
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,600
Alan ran here at my quality and testing experts community. Yes

529
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,790
many years ago

530
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:33,190
Basically, I shared like here are here's how our community is gonna run. I explained like I get out of your way blah blah

531
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:37,470
But I wanted to plant some seeds to get people used to things

532
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:44,790
number one use data to understand how our features work in production and how customers use what we make and

533
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:50,710
In that I explained that some teams are using monitoring in production as testing very well

534
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,750
I've started them off on Ed Keys talk as a

535
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,970
As a start there. I'll give them some more more things after Brent gives me a good list to share

536
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:07,740
And that works on the service by getting services side used to using monitoring as testing in production they know how that works

537
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:14,060
They're gonna start thinking that way and then for the client bits using that customer data to understand

538
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,540
Analyzing it seeing how customers use the products

539
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:21,860
I believe that kind of moving in that direction without saying I'm moving them from data oblivious to data aware

540
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,260
Yep, that's that's step one. That's that's the mission right now

541
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,390
number two, how is that

542
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:33,670
Resonated very very well, okay. I made sure it would first I bounced things

543
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,310
before I

544
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:42,540
Probably worth mentioning is I would never just spout this out saying okay, please follow this direction

545
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:47,020
I made sure it was gonna work with the majority after had the allies you're gonna go this thing right to you

546
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:49,780
Yeah, let me tell you why everybody gets it. They're all on board

547
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,100
Okay, but I just wanted to say it out publicly and our slack channels are are shared

548
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:02,620
They're all wide open. We have a few private ones for like, you know some managerial stuff, but they're mostly wide open

549
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:04,620
in fact in my

550
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,080
I never use email anymore. I posted this to our public slack channel

551
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:16,340
And what's great was a lot of the likes and comments came from devs and support people reading about how we're going to

552
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,700
I'm structuring QA. So that was good. Number two discuss our hard problems and solutions with each other

553
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,660
So what I found in doing my my rounds around the world is like, oh, here's a really good thing you're doing

554
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,220
Here's a really good thing. You're doing Oh God, if you guys just shared this stuff and with each other

555
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,420
Both right beginning with the solutions, but also the hard problems like I have a hard problem figuring out how to do this

556
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:44,540
we're really challenged with this and encouraging the community to

557
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:51,560
Collaborate and just using something like slack works much better than email for this where you can find a way to have an open

558
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,800
discussion around anything from conceptual to

559
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:03,520
Concrete like technical solution. I want to bring up something because actually this this hit me at my work this week

560
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,360
And I want so on that one. I love it be proactive in

561
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,010
stating that

562
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,650
Duplication of effort is okay

563
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,560
but

564
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,920
Doing so without collaboration is not

565
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:25,490
Yeah, right

566
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:32,090
So the there's this one in and I've rallied against it in my entire time here at Microsoft

567
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,810
this one prevailing belief that

568
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:40,890
Duplication of effort is just naturally evil and it is is not

569
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:46,970
Because it's again very context sensitive. Yes

570
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:53,130
so it and they've already heard me early on in in not

571
00:45:53,450 --> 00:46:00,930
Like stating principles for the org just talking about how I work is that I really value learning and learning from mistakes and

572
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:07,010
Trying new things out they get that so this is a natural progression. I like that. Let's share what we're doing

573
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,010
It's important that we learn from each other

574
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:15,950
Right. So and that's it and then I wanted I truly believe this and I wanted to be a little aspirational is

575
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,630
earlier in the week or last week I

576
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:24,270
Shared some of my favorite services tech blogs with them like the Netflix tech blog the Etsy engineering blog

577
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:28,670
There was a great article about engineering at Pinterest this week

578
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,590
I love you saw and I I share those and so they're kind of getting the idea again

579
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:38,950
Helping bring them from our team them our team from data oblivious to data aware

580
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:42,610
Yeah, and it's also you're doing the element of sort of

581
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:46,570
Greasing the wheels on

582
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:50,690
Crowdsourcing to some degree. Yeah. Yeah, it's like that look

583
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:53,330
We're here to solve problems. I don't

584
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,570
care

585
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,760
to to

586
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,400
Create a culture of not invented here. Well, absolutely not

587
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:07,780
Yeah, yeah, and and the last one I put is I think a logical extension of that is of all that together is

588
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:16,000
Unity has a tech blog and sometimes there are quality related posts on there mostly to this to at this point talking about

589
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,560
how

590
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:23,520
Like we've handled some complex testing for the shaders and the graphic stuff like you can imagine like it would be in an Xbox blog

591
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:29,000
Good stuff on there. There was one just last week on how we do exploratory testing, which is very good

592
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,320
But I encourage them number three was share our best technical solutions publicly

593
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I have aspirations of

594
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,640
unity services blog being

595
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,480
unity tech blog having posts which are right up there in that group of my

596
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,120
other people look at as their

597
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,590
Tech service blogs if you look at again Netflix at sea, you know, maybe Pinterest

598
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:58,630
Unity and they get there. I think there are some good solutions already, but to start thinking about

599
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:06,550
How important those are for not just to share with the public to show cool things we're doing but to inspire customer confidence

600
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,430
I think

601
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:14,390
one of the reasons I'm amazed using Netflix is because I look at their blog and I know how much cool science and technology

602
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:20,550
Goes into how they do selection engines and uptime and streaming and things like Chaos Monkey and the whole

603
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:27,030
Simeon army as they call it. I think there's some good stuff there and I want to strive for artwork to be there, too

604
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,710
So so so whining back. Hold on because I because

605
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:33,310
the omits questions

606
00:48:33,830 --> 00:48:37,510
But I think you've nailed the how you're approaching this

607
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:41,130
But then I don't think you've covered

608
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,360
What you might suggest if you were doing this and you weren't a manager and

609
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,800
And more specifics around how you're gonna handle the the geopolitical

610
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:59,640
Time's only boundaries. Okay, the second one's easier because I actually think I have covered that have the discussions in the open

611
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,240
transparency is key and

612
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,960
My org is all over the world and it hasn't been a problem people

613
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,360
It's so have the conversations like at your company

614
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:18,800
You're saying no don't call me and have the conversation have the conversation with me on slack channel

615
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,040
Right an exam everything is just transparent in the open around the world. Everybody can participate

616
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:30,920
Like like I said my team channel on my team channels. I have you know, there's QA services QA

617
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:33,720
component QA

618
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,560
they're all public channels and

619
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,760
Anybody can jump in and anybody's is

620
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Encouraged to jump in and it works around the world

621
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:51,160
I think a tool like you heard it here first Alan Page wants to kill the hallway conversation the hallway conversation is slack

622
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,390
you because

623
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:59,630
Because of the world being flat and having organizations everywhere if you have a geo distributed company

624
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,890
Slack is your hallway

625
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:07,050
Channel we have the company of 1,400 people. We have 800 slack channels

626
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,690
There you go

627
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,830
You join the ones that got 600 more to do I just joined the Seattle coffee walk

628
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,050
So if someone wants to go get coffee

629
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:23,330
We we have like a great coffee machine, but we'll walk over to cafe Laudra for just to get outside in the gray sky

630
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:28,650
Good yeah, it's good and the last question was so not as a manager

631
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:37,640
It's largely the same. There's probably two things. I will add to this before we close up for the day

632
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,600
I'm gonna change it. Yeah, not as a manager in

633
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:47,310
a command and control system. Oh god, so I've done this before so

634
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,730
I've done this actually a very similar role in Xbox as an IC

635
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:57,370
most of my IC time at Microsoft was spent sort of as the

636
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:01,690
Technical assistant to the director of test or test manager person running the queue

637
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:06,890
Yeah, it's not a real IC and you know it it but it is but it's a leadership role

638
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,650
The thing is individual contributor can be a leader

639
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:16,050
So what I how I did this in Xbox for example largely command and control although my manager Chris was very

640
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:19,770
Definitely not a micromanager, which was awesome

641
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,630
Is I built a community again?

642
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,450
I just because you're not a manager doesn't mean you can't build a community

643
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:33,690
I could have sent this message to slack as a senior IC and said here's how I think we should be doing and

644
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,730
Just have my manager like it

645
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:38,970
as a as a

646
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,090
mode of support

647
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:45,970
But I don't believe even in a command where I worked at Microsoft for most of my career in command and control

648
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:52,370
most of my career at Microsoft was in a command and control system as an individual contributor that

649
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:59,580
Didn't stop me from attempting or trying or sometimes being successful at being a leader across an organization

650
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:05,860
That's that went even beyond my managers often almost always went beyond my managers

651
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:10,440
Organization because I thought I did the work in a way that

652
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,060
Was not

653
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,500
Dictatorial

654
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:23,260
Like a dictator. Yep, but just in this these same ways as I'm doing now

655
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:31,380
Constantly spreading seeds and doing things at a like very slowly turning up the heat to get people moving in a direction

656
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,860
And like I said realizing that the direction may change over time

657
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,740
So the one thing that I'll say

658
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,880
Because I've gone through this sort of conversion

659
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:49,010
Repeatedly now, right? The way I like to run my teams and the way I like to get them going when they're

660
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,460
running smoothly

661
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:59,660
Means the team doesn't come and ask me for to make decisions all the freaking time. Yeah, because you don't

662
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,590
number one you avoid the command and control

663
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:06,800
As much as I can that is around you

664
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,340
I mean you've almost had to do that in most teams at Microsoft

665
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:12,260
I was told that you know if you do that too much you get fired

666
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,760
Like if if I were to solve this for Microsoft

667
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,220
I would just say like look if you're a manager you have to have at least 15 reports

668
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:27,970
Because you can't do micro management very well with that

669
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:32,000
And if that's your style you'll get pruned up pretty quickly

670
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:39,240
Right, but the other thing but there's another aspect because I'll tell you one of the really hard problems around

671
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,680
around this when it comes to individuals

672
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,320
right command and control

673
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:49,680
creates a safety net it says

674
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,240
I

675
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:59,130
the leader the command and controller are the is the one that's accountable for risk-taking

676
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:05,950
Because there there is there is no leadership without risk-taking

677
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,660
correct and

678
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,620
really what this comes down to like what I do is I I

679
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:20,890
I boil frogs and I teach these individuals first thing that has to happen is to teach these individuals

680
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:23,770
What it means to influence and lead?

681
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:27,020
Right because a lot of times I get the questions like well

682
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:33,780
How do I do this as an IC and what they really want is a formulaic step-by-step plan that guarantees success and?

683
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:43,100
You have to have built credibility as a leader and maybe that's the answer is how do you do this as an IC you lead

684
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,940
You learn to become a leader. Yes, exactly. I think this will inspire some more questions

685
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,820
We'll get to you next time. Yep, but we should probably close for the day and

686
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:57,770
Put episode 56 in the bag or the can all right. I'm not Brent and I am

687
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,460
See you next time. Bye
