1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,660
A.B.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:33,160
Test

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
New Year!

4
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
Welcome, welcome.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,880
Good to have you here on the A.B.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Testing Podcast.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
I'm...

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,880
All three of you.

9
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:45,200
Yes, thank you all three of you for listening yet again and joining us in 2019.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,120
And I made this rant one year ago, almost exactly, in 2018.

11
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,480
The proper way to pronounce the year we're in is 2019, not 2019.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,000
If you disagree, you can just stop talking to me.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,120
If you feel like it's something you're going to repeat every year...

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,080
I wasn't born in 1965.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,540
I was born in 1965.

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,540
Just saying.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,940
Yeah, if you're going to do this every year, perhaps you need to be a bit more assertive

18
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,710
or tell them what, you know, something a bit stronger.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,560
Like it's 2019, right?

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,240
Yeah, I don't know why I would need to be assertive.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,120
I was like, do I need to be assertive saying that two plus two is four?

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,400
No, people should just know that.

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,840
Well, you know, the other thing too, I don't think our listeners would pronounce it incorrectly.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,200
I don't think they really care about this conversation.

25
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
So let's move on.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Okay.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,920
Anyway, happy new year, Alan.

28
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Yeah, you too, Brad.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,080
Did you enjoy your break?

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
I did.

31
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I did nothing but play Xbox and watch Netflix pretty much.

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,520
I did some house cleaning.

33
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,920
It was fun.

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,520
I did not get away from the screen, but I watched a lot of Binging.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,680
I watched Bandersnatch.

36
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,520
I watched Birdcage.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Birdbox.

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Birdbox.

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,520
Birdcage.

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Awesome movie.

41
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,720
Totally different plot.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,680
I watched the Birdbox.

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
It was good.

44
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,480
It caught up on my Luke Cage, got into my Daredevil.

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,800
I'm kind of behind on the whole Marvel, Netflix thing because so many come out.

46
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
And I don't have that much time.

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,120
Yeah, you get a lot of time.

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Yeah.

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,120
And so I didn't get as far as I wanted.

50
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Excellent.

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,280
I can get caught up without worrying about when is the next Jessica Jones coming out,

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
which is my favorite.

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Is it?

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
Yeah.

55
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,240
I liked Iron Fist, but I have a martial arts background.

56
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Yeah.

57
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,760
And that's probably the most.

58
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,560
The Iron Fist ended it so freaking weird.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,680
I haven't watched that one yet.

60
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,360
I was a big fan of the comic book.

61
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Yeah.

62
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
Both.

63
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
I have many issues at home of Luke Cage, the comic, which turned into Power Man, the

64
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
comic.

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,960
I also have the whole Iron Fist series, only 15 comics.

66
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,160
And then I think John Byrne, who did X-Men, drew all those and tell the stories.

67
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,560
But I also have the Power Man and Iron Fist series.

68
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:14,090
I have a comic book collection at home that is probably worth today around $30,000.

69
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,290
And so let's excuse us for the tangent.

70
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,090
So Marvel's DC?

71
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,650
Mostly Marvel.

72
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,690
I was a big Marvel thing.

73
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,130
I should give you my stash link.

74
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,200
Okay.

75
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
I don't know what that is.

76
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,040
It's a website where I have all my comic books cataloged.

77
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,220
Yeah, you should.

78
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,060
I would love to.

79
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,420
So I was almost all Marvel.

80
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,220
I haven't cataloged.

81
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,100
So I used to catalog them in Excel.

82
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,900
And then I would download the, what is that, one catalog book.

83
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,190
It's a huge, the Over...

84
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,030
Overstreet comic book guide.

85
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,990
I used to keep little index cards of all my comics.

86
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:01,910
So I had condition and writer and artist, et cetera.

87
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,910
So what was your jam?

88
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,670
What was your go-to comic, your favorite?

89
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:05,670
Oh, Thor.

90
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,670
Oh, really?

91
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,670
Yeah.

92
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,670
Thor.

93
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,670
That's interesting.

94
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,670
I was total X-Men.

95
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:16,670
I had pretty much everything from, for a while, I sold some of the more expensive ones in

96
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,870
college to make some money, but from the, what do they call them?

97
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,870
The new X-Men.

98
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,870
But from 1994 on?

99
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,870
The new ones.

100
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:24,870
No, no, no.

101
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,870
Those came much, much later.

102
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,200
So that was more mid-70s to early 80s collecting.

103
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,400
I didn't stop collecting.

104
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Actually, you know when I stopped?

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,280
When I moved to Microsoft.

106
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
I stopped in college.

107
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,280
I was out of money and actually sold some comics in college to make money.

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,240
So I did, I didn't stop comics, but what I ended up doing, I made a lot of money off

109
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,440
of magic cards during that same time period.

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Oh, interesting.

111
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Interesting.

112
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
I never got into that.

113
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
I think the writing on some of those X-Men series was so good.

114
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,190
I had a girlfriend in high school who was way into soap operas.

115
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
Oh.

116
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,190
And which, like, whatever.

117
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,190
Oh, soap operas.

118
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,190
It was high school.

119
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,830
But I remember giving her my X-Men, like, check these out, and she got totally hooked

120
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,870
reading through those stories because they're so well written and so well, you know, cliffhangers,

121
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,870
every issue.

122
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,150
Do you know, do you remember the name Walt Simonson?

123
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,150
No.

124
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:28,820
So he was the writer of the Thor books back in the day.

125
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,360
And the stories he wrote are a big part of what's in the MCU right now.

126
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Oh, interesting.

127
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,360
Very, very interesting.

128
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Yeah.

129
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,280
And of course, X-Men, those who don't pay close attention to the Marvel universe, X-Men

130
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,000
actually live in a different universe than the more mainstream.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In the MCU.

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And do you know why?

133
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,250
Actually, I don't know why.

134
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,690
Because Sony owns the rights to X-Men and they can't.

135
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:01,130
That is why Scarlet Witch got her powers from the Infinity Stone and not actually being

136
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,130
a mutant.

137
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,740
Yeah.

138
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,740
Yeah.

139
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Okay.

140
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,900
Well, you got to do what you got to do.

141
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,900
Indeed.

142
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
Speaking of cliffhangers, do you want to...

143
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,900
Oh.

144
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
It's episode 96.

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,660
Yeah, this is episode 96.

146
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,460
So you just hung out for the break.

147
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Yeah.

148
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,970
I ended up spending a week in Carlsbad, California.

149
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,850
I saw it with the Disneyland, which is not in Carlsbad.

150
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:30,410
No, it's in LA, Anaheim.

151
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,410
Right.

152
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,050
So I grew up in LA and man, is Disneyland different.

153
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,210
No.

154
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,740
Disneyland itself isn't, but the parking structure wasn't there.

155
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,180
I've never parked there.

156
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,860
I've always just gone for a conference or flown down a stain at the hotel and then

157
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,380
walked over to the park.

158
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,140
The Downtown Disney thing seems to have changed quite a bit from...

159
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,820
That didn't exist when I was there.

160
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
Yeah.

161
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,980
And the California thing didn't exist.

162
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,220
The crowd was crazy.

163
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,220
Yeah.

164
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,260
I definitely, now, I've been to both, but at this point in time, I definitely prefer

165
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,340
Walt Disney World.

166
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,540
If nothing else, because it spreads the crowd out through like 18 different parks.

167
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,540
Yeah.

168
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,180
I went to Disneyland Japan once and that was...

169
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,820
You think the lines in California were long.

170
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,900
It was every single, every attraction was two hours.

171
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Yeah.

172
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,380
We didn't have that problem.

173
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,580
There's a great app that we took advantage of.

174
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:40,880
We very quickly, me and my son, who were more efficiency minded, worked together and

175
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,970
worked out like timing and minimizing wait times.

176
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:45,970
Very lovely.

177
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,850
My agile training got involved in...

178
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,850
Very well done.

179
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,850
Walking through.

180
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,850
Very well done.

181
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,850
And then there's an update that I have.

182
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:09,690
So as the three know, I've only had one class left and just before New Year, I finally

183
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,280
went and tried to go sign up for the class.

184
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,760
And I couldn't.

185
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,000
The website said, not a student.

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,790
The web, a bunch of other signs on that.

187
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,190
And I'm like, holy crap.

188
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,470
And then I went and looked up requirements on the degree.

189
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,350
It's in the University catalog.

190
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,270
And it said, you have to pass these things and you have six years to do it.

191
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,270
It's one thing that's nice about my school.

192
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,070
For a master's degree, you have six years.

193
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,070
It's online.

194
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,950
You can really take it easy.

195
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,310
And then if you work at something like Microsoft, with six years, you can really spread out

196
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,910
the classes and take advantage of the education benefit here, where they'll pay for school,

197
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,960
but they'll only do a max of 10K a year.

198
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,040
Anyway, I, as several people know, I was iffy.

199
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,120
I'm like, God, I don't want to do this.

200
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,120
But it's one thing.

201
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,900
And going back and forth.

202
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:19,540
Well, once I discovered that the choice had been taken from me, I was actually surprisingly

203
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,700
depressed.

204
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,960
I'm like, oh, okay.

205
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,720
What do I do on my resume?

206
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,640
What do I do if people want to...

207
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,240
Just lie like everyone else.

208
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Yeah.

209
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,800
Well, you weren't there at the time.

210
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,640
So the couple of days later, I sent mail to the registrar playing dumb saying, hey,

211
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,720
I can't register.

212
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,490
What's going on?

213
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,560
And they came back and they said, oh, yeah.

214
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,640
I just put a block on you because you took the last year off.

215
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,960
I'll re-enable it and you'll be able to go and register.

216
00:09:51,960 --> 00:10:01,640
And then I realized even though 2019 minus 2013 is six, I still have all of 2019 to complete

217
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
my sixth year.

218
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,400
And I'm like, so a little bit of relief.

219
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Signed up.

220
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,140
Class already started.

221
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,450
I still am not happy that I have to do this.

222
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,450
But you don't have to.

223
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,450
I don't have to.

224
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,450
You don't have to do anything.

225
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,450
No.

226
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,620
So now I realize that if I don't...

227
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,540
I will regret it if I don't complete it.

228
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,020
So that little thing actually closed the decision making process for me.

229
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Cool.

230
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
Anyway.

231
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,460
You can join me in having a master's degree.

232
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,460
That'd be nice.

233
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,010
Of course, my master's is useless, but well, I learned how to learn.

234
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,410
I don't think your master's is useless.

235
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,770
All the research part, I still apply every day.

236
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:53,400
And the other thing I'm excited about, because I've known this for two years now, is that

237
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,360
is once I am done, I already know what I'm going to go do next.

238
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,040
And it's relevant because I'm going to start taking guitar lessons.

239
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,580
All right.

240
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,580
Cool.

241
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,900
Do you want to do a podcast?

242
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
Sure.

243
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
Let's do a podcast.

244
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,260
All right.

245
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:19,380
If you haven't listened to episode 95, our year in review, which by the way...

246
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,140
You didn't do it like Voiceover guy.

247
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,740
Last time on...

248
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,820
Last time on AUB testing.

249
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:33,720
One, our episode was mentioned in the latest weekly update from Ministry of Test.

250
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
That episode was?

251
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

252
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,720
Why?

253
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,200
Because it's cool to listen to.

254
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,720
Oh, the podcast, sure.

255
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,720
But why that episode?

256
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,040
Because people like reflections predictions.

257
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,240
So then they can come make fun of us when we're wrong.

258
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:52,600
But as we were leaving the room, as I was heading on my vacation, you were returning to yours.

259
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,640
You said something interesting.

260
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,800
I did.

261
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,780
I believe I have discovered a missing principle from MT.

262
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:06,900
You have, have you?

263
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,580
I believe I do.

264
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,060
Is it the Peter Principle?

265
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
No.

266
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:18,260
Since that one is well established, doesn't need to be part of MT.

267
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:25,240
Although actually, in a twisted way, yes, it is the Peter Principle.

268
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,080
Tell me your hypothesis.

269
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,250
And for those of you following, we don't add principles willy nilly.

270
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,450
We don't even edit them willy nilly.

271
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:41,530
We vet them significantly among our three listeners who all hang out with us on one

272
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,930
of the three.slack.com.

273
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,810
Of course, you can go to moderntesting.org and click the link to join that Slack group.

274
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,810
Free to join.

275
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,810
But.

276
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,810
And it's the only place to get the cool sticker.

277
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:56,610
I don't know what you're going to say, but let's talk about this proposed principle

278
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,820
number eight, which I already feel strongly against.

279
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,300
And we will discuss it.

280
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,890
And you feel strongly against just because seven's a cooler number than eight?

281
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,430
Because I feel like the principle.

282
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,870
More and more, I feel like the principles are complete.

283
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,060
Okay.

284
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,380
Let me sum the current principles.

285
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,670
Number one, I'm not going to read this whole thing.

286
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:31,470
It's around guiding people towards the key focus, which is the business.

287
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:38,630
Number two, it's about being in a team accelerant and it speaks to sort of an execution model

288
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:44,740
and the types of differences we use to execute.

289
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,940
Number three, a force of continuous improvement.

290
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,970
If you were to sum up, this is about adaptability, not prescriptability.

291
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,880
We're helping the team learn.

292
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,040
Sure.

293
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,420
Well, then I would say number four is about the quality culture.

294
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:09,840
And I think that's a big part of helping the team learn, but it's a team focus.

295
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,920
You help the team grow.

296
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,300
Number five, it's about the customer.

297
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:24,570
And in my view, it is about the true definition of the word quality.

298
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,670
Number six, data.

299
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:33,750
Data is great, but in another aspect, it's about an execution model.

300
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,860
It's about a how.

301
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,130
And then finally, we expand the testability and know how.

302
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:50,010
This is about testing scale and in my view, removing testing specialists from being a linchpin

303
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,330
in the system.

304
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,330
Sure.

305
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,200
Okay.

306
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:01,560
One of the things that we've talked about over and over again is followers of MT need

307
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,760
to be accustomed to taking a leadership role.

308
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,200
I think the fatal flaw right now is in the MT principles.

309
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:20,220
If you go through and you do this and you do this too soon, what happens to you?

310
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:27,220
And I think one of the aspects that is missing from MT is that, and I wanted to talk about

311
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,220
it today.

312
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,060
I wanted to propose it and see if you agreed and then maybe brainstorm around the language.

313
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:40,280
But I think the issue that we are missing is, you know this whole phrase, you can't love

314
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,760
anybody else if you don't love yourself?

315
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,760
No.

316
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Okay.

317
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
It's a phrase it's old.

318
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,840
I think it's similar to leadership.

319
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,800
One of the first things around learning leadership is leading by example.

320
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,160
I do think one of the things that you have that is missing from MT is some sort of principle

321
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:14,720
that specifies you need to guide yourself, you need to control your own destiny as a result

322
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,350
or as part of this as you go through and migrate people to an MT philosophy.

323
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,190
Thoughts?

324
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,500
I will say it is on the slide channel, why you're thinking.

325
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:35,460
One of the most common questions that we have is, well, what happens to me or where do we

326
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,620
go or how do we do it?

327
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,460
They're very tactical things.

328
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,060
So that point is true.

329
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:49,820
A lot of questions we get are what happens after I transition my team to modern testing?

330
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:58,350
If I'm going through that myself, continually shrinking my team, what do I do next?

331
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,110
So that part I fully agree with.

332
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,990
That part we need to discuss because the answer to that is a bunch of different things.

333
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,990
And then getting into your point, yes, it's important that we think about how do we,

334
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,510
what does our transition role look like?

335
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:19,990
But the difficult part is for that question is that it is unique for, it's going to

336
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,670
be unique for every single person.

337
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,390
There isn't a blueprint like the person that transitions teams to modern testing.

338
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,310
This is the role they typically do, that it looks like X.

339
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,220
That's stuck in a habit.

340
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:41,560
I actually like that modern testing principles are about how they're really an extension,

341
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,080
as I called it before, of Agile testing.

342
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,280
But they're about the team, how the team becomes a top class software engineering team.

343
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,200
What things do they have to do to make quality software that combat all the things that

344
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,280
are wrong with traditional test blast, test as the bottleneck, test as the scapegoat, testing

345
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,280
approaches?

346
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,920
I completely agree.

347
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
I like that.

348
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,840
So it's tough for me.

349
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
But let me add one counterpoint.

350
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,760
Okay, then I'll go on.

351
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,380
If we have software teams today, it's going to be about leadership.

352
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:31,430
We talk about transitioning of activities, as well as supporting or investing in several

353
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:35,350
execution activities.

354
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:42,820
The one thing that has occurred in both your and my careers in the past is as we work towards

355
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:50,430
elimination of things that are stupid, we've both discovered that we get acknowledged and

356
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,740
moved into a different role.

357
00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:01,900
However, I don't know that it's entirely accidental or luck driven.

358
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:08,700
Both you and I, for example, as I moved out of test, I went to dev.

359
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,020
How did I get to dev?

360
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:18,770
Well I invested myself because at minimum I needed to pass the stupid interview.

361
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:30,110
The leader in the empty space that we're targeting here needs to have a sense of where they're

362
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,270
going and needs to invest in themselves as well.

363
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:37,910
I think while you were talking, I got why it doesn't click with me.

364
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,540
And maybe this is where some feedback would help.

365
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:46,660
The modern testing principles, again, I call the antidote to traditional software testing.

366
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,860
That's how we make software in a much better, more efficient way that's going to be better

367
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,140
for our customers and better for our business and more efficient overall.

368
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,580
They're team based.

369
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:06,670
I think where the glitch comes in is we've talked about this before, but very early

370
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,110
on in our discussions about modern testing, we said there's no such thing as a modern

371
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,150
tester.

372
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:20,670
But we've also acknowledged that someone who's leading the team towards modern testing principles

373
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,740
could be referred to as a modern tester.

374
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:30,660
But I still, and that's I guess sort of the role I'm in, I'm not a new name for that.

375
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,820
If the person that led the team towards modern testing principles was called the Poobah,

376
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,820
I'm in the role of a Poobah.

377
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,100
We have language for it.

378
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,620
We call it the coach.

379
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,820
Okay, so I'm the coach.

380
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,530
These aren't coaching principles.

381
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,770
They're about the team.

382
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:55,630
So it just so happens that I'm in individual role, but the principles, having a principle

383
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:01,290
around an individual role takes away from the modern testing principles which are about

384
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:03,890
team achievements and team capabilities.

385
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:06,350
I hear what you're saying.

386
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:14,700
So I'm still not thinking it's a principle, but given the amount of questions that

387
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,420
given what I'm going through myself, given the discussion we've had on the Slack channel

388
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,340
about this, given how open ended is, oh my God, what happens?

389
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:28,100
And also adding into that the fact that just like when Microsoft or Yahoo or whoever just

390
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,300
got rid of their testers thinking getting rid of the safety net entirely was all you

391
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:38,340
needed to do, there is a probably legitimate worry as more and more teams become aware

392
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,740
of what modern testing is going.

393
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,020
Okay, let's do that.

394
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,860
Let's skip to the last half of principle number seven that'll accelerate it.

395
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,300
It accelerates in the mission statement.

396
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,740
We'll make all that happen.

397
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,280
I think there is some sort of a den.

398
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,040
I'm not sure what the proper name for this is.

399
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,600
Let's not get semantic yet, but there's a lot of principle.

400
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:03,880
There is a supporting paragraph or a supporting manifest, a supporting something.

401
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,800
I don't know if it's a principle or not.

402
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:13,480
That supports the leadership and the individual role and what happens when someone

403
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,310
gets caught.

404
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,910
But I have just realized, so this is fantastic.

405
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,030
This is kind of what I was hoping it would happen.

406
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:31,620
So principles, let's ignore the semantics.

407
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,860
If it's important enough, you and I will agree it's a principle.

408
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,780
I'm not going to try to fight that.

409
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,420
I think there's agreement that it's an important topic.

410
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,140
Principle number five.

411
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,820
We can have this discussion to vet it out, but only the customer, our listeners, people

412
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,980
who only our listeners can help us figure out what is right here.

413
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,460
We'll just have the debate to get the ideas out there.

414
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,140
Okay, go on.

415
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:02,860
One of the things, and what you just said triggered a thought, and it's a thought that

416
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:08,220
I've seen over and over again in the teams who I trained through Agile.

417
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:15,340
I now have gotten very good at de-specializing teams.

418
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:24,680
But once there's momentum in that direction, you need to stop them before they overgeneralize.

419
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,600
So you can think of it as a pendulum between specialists and generalists, and you de-specialize

420
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,040
and they are becoming nice, TC people, but then they don't stop.

421
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,520
Until they're flat as a pancake.

422
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,240
And the risk with overgeneralized people is that they're all the same.

423
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,120
So the problem with having a team is teams are made up of individuals.

424
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,750
You can't treat them.

425
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:59,150
There is an investment that needs to be done within a team at an individual level because

426
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,630
they are part of the team.

427
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,710
In a soccer team, you don't train everyone to be a keeper.

428
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,510
You don't train everyone to be a forward.

429
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:14,800
You do want some versatility, but the people who are talented at keeping and forwarding

430
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:24,100
– yeah, I know all the soccer's – you want to invest in that specialization while

431
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
still maintaining that generalization.

432
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:38,170
And I think language that is highlighted around that is important and missing.

433
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,620
Your turn.

434
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Now I've got to think about that because now it's clicking a little bit better.

435
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,740
I don't know.

436
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,300
I've got to think about that for a minute because it doesn't have the same sort of trigger

437
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:56,540
as the – let's have a principle about the individual.

438
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,940
Agile's different than MT.

439
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,060
MT fits within agile very well, like a foot in a sock.

440
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,300
There's probably a better metaphor there.

441
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:12,970
Is there anything in modern – anything in the principles now that would lead a team towards

442
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,940
overgeneralization?

443
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,980
I think.

444
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,580
I don't think so.

445
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,060
Convince me I'm wrong.

446
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,220
Boy, we could –

447
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,380
So here's the thing I'm saying is that there's nothing that prevents it.

448
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,700
I don't think it's anything that encourages it either.

449
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,740
No, it's – so what I will tell you is, at least from my experience, like a lot

450
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:40,780
of the principles we have here, as you well know, come from Lean and –

451
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,300
And DevOps.

452
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,310
And DevOps and other things like that.

453
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:57,090
But this is – much of what is discussed here is we're telling people to battle against

454
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:58,930
external forces.

455
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,610
And I think it's entirely possible.

456
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:05,290
Let's take your situation as an example.

457
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:09,690
I think you're leading all of this just fine.

458
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:18,480
But once you have created a stable quality culture, once you have converted people into

459
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,880
understanding the customer and not the PM is the only one that matters, once you've

460
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:32,300
convinced people that the team is stronger by spreading out the testing abilities – right?

461
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,460
Let's take that aspect.

462
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,220
So for a lot of teams – and I'm certain this happens within Unity, but I don't know.

463
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,860
I don't work there.

464
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,980
Several people are going to view you as, in fact, the test guy, regardless of what decoration,

465
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,220
what title, and how you frame it.

466
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,820
You're going to be the test guy to at least one person –

467
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,820
Probably more true for the people on my team than for me.

468
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,820
Right.

469
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:07,980
When you succeed in publicly spreading out your secret ingredient, your special ingredient,

470
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:15,130
the reason why they hired you, and you've convinced them that, yeah, in fact, we don't

471
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:21,710
need Alan's team, if you haven't invested in some fashion of where you're going to

472
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,850
go next, that puts you at risk.

473
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:28,650
I think that lives outside the – I don't feel at risk.

474
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,930
The absolute worst thing that happens –

475
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:33,370
Well, yeah, but is that just because you're chock full of self-confidence?

476
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:40,700
No, I don't have nearly enough self-confidence, but I do have enough – I mean, the absolute

477
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,340
worst case thing that could happen is they say, thanks for fixing all this stuff, Alan.

478
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,340
We don't need you anymore.

479
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,860
Then I go find another job.

480
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,780
That's the worst case, but that's not going to happen.

481
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:57,700
So yes, you need to think about probably earlier than you think about what you do

482
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,460
next and how your role evolves.

483
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,860
It's really not a next.

484
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:01,860
It's not a step.

485
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,620
It's an evolution.

486
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,620
Yes.

487
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,260
As you are helping the team adapt, you yourself need to adapt.

488
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Yeah, absolutely.

489
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
That's –

490
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,260
And I get that, but I think –

491
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,660
And you can't ignore it.

492
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,820
That's the message I'm trying to say.

493
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,780
This is something we'll continue to discuss.

494
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,820
I'm not bought in yet.

495
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:25,970
I think the individual growth comes outside of modern testing.

496
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:31,850
But while you were talking about overgeneralization, I wanted to walk through the principles real

497
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,170
quick and ask you this.

498
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,170
I'm curious what would happen.

499
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:39,330
It's like, can you overdo any of these principles?

500
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,170
For example, walk through with me.

501
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,690
Listen, don't read.

502
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,170
Could we improve the business?

503
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,250
Could we over-prioritize improving the business?

504
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,210
I guess, yeah, if you put it that way, maybe.

505
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,820
Yeah, for sure.

506
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,960
You couldn't improve it too much, but you could over-prioritize it.

507
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,390
Could you accelerate the team too much?

508
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,190
I guess you could focus too much on it.

509
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:03,990
Now that I'm reading through it, you could overemphasize it.

510
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,950
The way you're going to go is very much my complaint about the Agile Manifesto, right?

511
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,390
People, the part of the thing about the principles is they're intended to balance each other

512
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:20,280
out to make sure that you don't overemphasize one thing in contrast to another.

513
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
So I'm going to say if there were to be –

514
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
It's a system.

515
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,640
I was going to say if there were to be an eighth principle, that it would be that these

516
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,680
principles are a system.

517
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,680
They work together.

518
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,760
Actually, this is maybe going somewhere.

519
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,480
I'll get the right phrasing here, but leaving one out or overemphasizing on one is not

520
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
modern testing.

521
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,990
It's a balance.

522
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,310
It's a balanced system.

523
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,950
You can't just go, yeah, these are great, but we're not going to do the data thing

524
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,680
because we think they're stupid.

525
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,240
It's not empty.

526
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,840
Or these are great, but it's somebody else's problem to improve the business.

527
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,840
We're not going to focus on that.

528
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,840
That's not our thing.

529
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,280
This is a challenging topic.

530
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,240
When I coach people through, particularly if I'm going to coach people through Kanban,

531
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,720
if they're in waterfall and I skip straight to Kanban, it's foreign to them.

532
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Oh, no shit.

533
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
I mean, yes.

534
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,740
And the biggest problem – and here I will say a problem in this context – with a shift

535
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:26,180
to Agile, let's say, again, like Kanban here, is it's principle driven.

536
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,860
It doesn't tell you what to do, per se.

537
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,720
It tells you how to decide.

538
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:40,140
I like Mary Poppendyke's principles that she uses.

539
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,740
For example, the one I'm thinking of right now is optimize the whole, which says you're

540
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:54,600
going to have some business KPI, optimize the business KPI, don't decompose it into

541
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,520
its component parts and try to sub-optimize those.

542
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,040
From a data science point of view, I know that to be true because you end up having

543
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:13,050
one KPI, one of these component KPIs cannibalizing the other and having no effect on the whole.

544
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:20,320
But I did the analysis and I said, okay, I think she has seven principles in her list.

545
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,160
And I said, what happens if I do – I did this for each of them.

546
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,640
What happens if I do all the others but not that one?

547
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:33,760
And every single time, I was able to go, oh, this dysfunction would creep out.

548
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,640
I see the same thing with ours.

549
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,480
Not to break my arm, patting ourselves on the back, but I think they're a system.

550
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,040
So I'd be curious to look at hers.

551
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,360
Did she talk about them being a system and working together?

552
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,000
Or does that just come out of the fact?

553
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't recall.

554
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,640
Because maybe I've taken that for granted.

555
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,590
But no, I think it's – or maybe it's in some text that goes around them.

556
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,590
I don't know.

557
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:02,270
But when I guide people through it, I said – so my process is I guide them through.

558
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:09,350
I spend three months being their scrum master of sorts.

559
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:15,030
I run their standup and – to help reinforce what I taught them, because it's too much

560
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:20,750
all at once until they can sort of get it and they can hand off to an internal coach.

561
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,270
But one of the things that I tell them is when you start this, you – I will tell

562
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:28,070
you a set of rules and you will follow those rules.

563
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:37,240
It is an advanced topic to – and as you know from your cities with Kanban, you are

564
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:44,720
permitted and encouraged to modify the rules as long as you have a rationale.

565
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,100
But what I've discovered is when people start doing that and they don't understand why

566
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:57,920
the rule was there in the first place, they always, literally 100% of the time, hurt themselves.

567
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,450
All right.

568
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,530
So I haven't sold you on –

569
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,530
No, you haven't.

570
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,290
But I do think – you sold me on the idea.

571
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:08,580
Even with all the questions about what happens when I get my team towards modern testing.

572
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,220
I mentioned earlier, the worst thing is they – is Unity says, well, thanks.

573
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,220
You did everything.

574
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,220
Nothing left for you to do.

575
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,220
Get out of here.

576
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,620
But that's not the case, because although we're moving towards modern testing, we have

577
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,380
a ways to go.

578
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,660
More on some teams, much less on others.

579
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,580
It's certainly not self-sustaining in many places.

580
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,740
So there's a lot more to do.

581
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:40,080
But I think optimizing the whole is a good way to put that.

582
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,660
I think making sure that we are accelerating the achievement of shipable quality across

583
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:55,740
all teams is still a goal, still a mission, and there's still work to do there.

584
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,260
Let me tell you my motivation.

585
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,220
And you know this already.

586
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:06,900
MT in my mind is an amalgam of our experience towards something that you and I had a lot

587
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:11,020
of passion around when Microsoft went through this.

588
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:24,670
And that is helping to remove the FUD from the test organization when this was announced

589
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:32,550
and helping them guide – or helping to guide them towards a place where they would

590
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,190
add value.

591
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,030
And I will say first, certainly in the orgs that I was in, I was in the minority of seeing

592
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,390
the clear path here.

593
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:44,910
I was talking with tests and they were like, oh my God, I'm going to lose my job.

594
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:47,750
I'm like, yeah, with that attitude, you will.

595
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:53,690
Whether you're right or wrong, what you believe will happen will happen.

596
00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:01,530
But open them their eyes that, no, they are not – they are at a fork in a road, not

597
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:07,330
on a path that guarantees a leap off the edge of the cliff.

598
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:11,660
When you're scared, when you're frightened, you don't see that other path.

599
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:17,500
What I worry that in this particular case, right, we have the three listeners.

600
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:22,550
Oh, by the way, for the three, FUD is fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

601
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,210
Yeah, the scary future.

602
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,650
I don't think you and I scaled to be able to be there and intercept each individual

603
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:38,560
as when they're not able to see that positive path forward.

604
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,980
And maybe that's it.

605
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:48,920
Maybe it's – maybe what I'm seeing is perhaps just a slight language change to Principle

606
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,920
7.

607
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:54,830
Let's – if you don't want to join the Slack group, that's cool.

608
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,790
You can email us, allanatangryweasel.com.

609
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,630
And if you have feedback on that or thoughts, you can just let us know.

610
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:07,470
But I have a feeling some more discussion after feedback will come up on this in Episode

611
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,470
97.

612
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,870
I have a hunch.

613
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,870
Yeah.

614
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:16,950
And one of the things I'm actually excited about as well, and it's on the Slack channel,

615
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:22,620
if you have an interest in it, you'll need to join the Slack channel, mostly because I'm

616
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,040
lazy and I don't want to look it up.

617
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:36,570
Danny Fought is about to do a presentation on his experience leaving test.

618
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:47,000
And I think those type of things are going to be helpful towards the MT believer follower,

619
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,020
whatever we call them, to make sure that as they're doing the right thing for the quality

620
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,660
culture, they're also doing the right thing for themselves.

621
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:05,580
Because I didn't get into this to create a new way for these folks who I believe add

622
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,900
great value.

623
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:10,900
I didn't get into this to find a new way for them to lose their jobs.

624
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:16,270
I got into this to find a new way for them to still add value.

625
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,110
I'm not, as I mentioned last time, I'm not planning on doing any conferences, especially

626
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,750
not test conferences in 2019.

627
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,910
But while you were talking, I had an idea for a talk I want to do, but it'll have to

628
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,670
I'll just plant the seed someone else can give it.

629
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,670
I'll help you with it.

630
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:34,510
But it's a life after test talk, which is, which is good.

631
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,550
Danny's stories is his individual story.

632
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,630
I think sharing four or five or six different paths, because I know at least that many

633
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,630
off the top of my head.

634
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,750
I don't think it should be a talk.

635
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,890
I think we should do it on the podcast.

636
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,860
I think we should invite people in and interview them and do that.

637
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,100
You know, one of my predictions for I don't know if I talked about it last time, one of

638
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:00,340
our predictions for 2019 was that we would have an external guest, a dial in guest.

639
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,180
And we could still do that.

640
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:08,810
I have the hardware to do that to get a good recording, which I haven't tested yet.

641
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,090
And I'd also have to the only way I know how to do is Skype.

642
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,490
But I have to install Skype, which is a little bit which I hate, but I guess it could

643
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,490
happen.

644
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,930
Something we could do, we should have.

645
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,210
We really need to have some guests to talk about the transitions this year off to

646
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,650
figure out how to do that.

647
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,170
I had a as an aside, usually we keep the recording equipment here in.

648
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,930
I'm sorry, I forgot what's the name of your company?

649
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,410
Microsoft.

650
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:36,170
Microsoft usually keep it here at Brent's office at Microsoft.

651
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,650
But I had it with me over the break.

652
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:44,850
And I should have taken some time when I had it to try out the adding a remote

653
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,820
color hardware to my setup here.

654
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,100
But I didn't.

655
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,860
It's not that much harder to take the gear and instead of walking it to my office,

656
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,460
walk it to your car.

657
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,540
I know, I know.

658
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,980
I could just take it with me.

659
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,900
Right.

660
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,500
You're right.

661
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,580
I could just take it with me today and then go check that out.

662
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,620
Maybe I'll do that.

663
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,380
I don't know if I have time in the next two weeks.

664
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,520
I'm taking off.

665
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,350
We didn't get this in the pre-patter, pre-chatter, pre-chatter-patter.

666
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:19,350
I am leaving to Europe for 10 days in, when do I leave?

667
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,310
Two weeks?

668
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,310
Work or?

669
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:22,310
Work.

670
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,980
Work.

671
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:30,610
Two days in manager meetings and then travel day to go, a whopping two hour train ride.

672
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:35,660
Travel day and spending a five day internal conference in Sweden.

673
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,300
Nothing like going to the beach in Sweden in January.

674
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,220
Five day internal conference?

675
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,250
Yeah.

676
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,980
How many people, how many employees does Unity have?

677
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,980
Total?

678
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,860
About 2,000, but there'll be about 100 of us there.

679
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,540
So is that more like a ginormous offsite then?

680
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,540
Kind of.

681
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,100
It's kind of a ginormous offsite, but it's all, it's, remember what we used to do at

682
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,100
Microsoft?

683
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
Sounds like a Windows all hands.

684
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,020
The engineering days, the, what was that called?

685
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,020
Hackathon?

686
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,620
No, it was a call when we had over in the conference center the week of talks and

687
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,780
workshops.

688
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,660
EE, the org I was in ran the thing.

689
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Yeah.

690
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:16,460
So the one I pay attention to is called the MLDC.

691
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,380
No, it was way before then.

692
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,580
There was like for three or four or five years straight.

693
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,900
Machine learning and data conference.

694
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
Yeah.

695
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,900
So yeah, we call it a conference.

696
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,300
Anyway, it's that sort of thing.

697
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,460
So about a hundred of the people in quality roles across and some other roles across

698
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:38,060
Unity doing talks, workshops, lightning talks, hanging out, getting learning from each

699
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,060
other.

700
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,460
You know, I'm a big believer in community.

701
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,700
So this is something I'm really excited about.

702
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:44,560
So it's a Barney event.

703
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,560
What's a Barney event?

704
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,240
It's sharing is caring.

705
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,560
Oh my God.

706
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,180
Yeah, that's right.

707
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,480
We would love to hear what you think about the discussion today.

708
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,850
I definitely am leaving with a lot to think about.

709
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:58,910
I'll post the question up on the Slack channel.

710
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,150
It's technically a Slack team, right?

711
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,150
I don't know.

712
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,150
There's channels within the team.

713
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,630
Yeah, the Slack thing.

714
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,300
I don't.

715
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,660
Yeah, that thing.

716
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:15,060
I was on LinkedIn the other day and saw a posting for someone from my old team at

717
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,820
Microsoft Teams posted.

718
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,020
And it was interesting because it was largely like, oh, I was like taken from a job

719
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,620
break that I wrote.

720
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,140
I recognize this job break.

721
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,860
I recognize these words.

722
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,860
Yeah.

723
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
Teams.

724
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,460
Teams is the thing now.

725
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:36,950
Teams has almost successfully gotten rid of everything in Skype within Microsoft.

726
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:41,990
And as I get more and more accustomed to it, I'm hating it less and less.

727
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,110
And to be fair, it's a good product, but you would never, it's.

728
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:53,020
There are things that I, that I, there's little bells and whistles that I think the

729
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,660
wrong decision was made.

730
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:03,460
But I also, so I want to invite any new listeners to join the Slack team.

731
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
There you go.

732
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,620
I think that is right.

733
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,290
Yep.

734
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:14,450
I think we have enough queued up in the mailbag to do a mailbag next episode.

735
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,450
All right.

736
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,090
Let's schedule that in a moment here and we'll figure that out.

737
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:24,810
Or we can, if there's enough interest in the three, we can keep going on principally.

738
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,810
Yeah.

739
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,810
We'll just wing it.

740
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,170
But for now we've babbled long enough and probably nobody is left listening.

741
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,410
They've all hit end.

742
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,410
We'll see you next time.

743
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,570
I'm Alan.

744
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,570
I'm Brent.

745
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:36,770
Bye.

746
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:05,260
I discovered a way.

747
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:09,110
Yes.

748
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:10,110
And it will be.

749
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:13,710
I am so going to keep this part on the podcast.

750
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:14,710
What the.

751
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:15,710
I started recording already.

752
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:31,040
It's still going to fall down.

753
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,730
I think I have to do righty tighty lefty loosey.

754
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,730
Ha!

755
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,730
Inanimate object.

756
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:44,440
At least for this podcast, I've defeated you.

757
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,260
And one of these is shut the fuck up.

758
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,820
I wonder, I'll make that the inner groove.

759
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,820
What?

760
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,820
Where the inner groove is?

761
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,820
No.

762
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:59,740
The inner groove is like sometimes you buy an album back when you buy a record album.

763
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,140
A vinyl disc.

764
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,300
Oh god.

765
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:07,500
And sometimes they put a little bit of like audio in the inner groove, which is that groove

766
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,100
that when you get to the end of the record, whether it's a 45 or an LP, you get to the

767
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,500
end that little space in there.

768
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,980
Sometimes they put a little, and the needle would go, it would just kind of go round

769
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:19,860
and round there until you lifted it off.

770
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:24,140
Sometimes they put a little bit of fun audio or music or a spoken voice in there.

771
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,350
It's called the inner groove.

772
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:27,900
Okay.

773
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,900
Wow.

774
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,470
You're old.

775
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:32,500
I am fucking old.

776
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,420
You know, growing up, I never did a lot of vinyl.

777
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,420
Alright.

778
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,420
Because you can't play records in your car.

779
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,890
That was a cassette tape.
