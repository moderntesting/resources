1
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,900
Hey Alan.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,420
Good morning.

3
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,660
Good morning to you.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,660
So we are back again for another episode of A.B. testing.

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,100
Yes, number 80.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,940
Holy cow, nice even round number.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,180
And a good little milestone on the way to 100.

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,020
It is, I like it.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,320
Which we will not hit this year, I don't think.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,720
Unless like a bunch of stuff happens and we go crazy.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,800
We took a little time off from podcasting.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,950
We skipped last time two weeks ago.

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,790
Yes.

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,610
Life happened.

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,210
Life indeed happened.

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,650
I am sorry for that Alan.

17
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,410
It was the last second thing.

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,890
I am, I am happy to give our listeners a break

19
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,350
from us rambling for 45 minutes.

20
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,330
But you'll be happy to know,

21
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:53,810
it's usually we're rambling for an hour

22
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,450
and I edit out down to 45, 50 minutes.

23
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,130
Yeah, hour-ish round.

24
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,360
Sometimes I add stuff and just put some things on repeat.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,280
They don't notice.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,520
They just heard random droning from a couple old guys

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,840
talking about crap ideas.

28
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,570
I bet you we could actually do that.

29
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,170
So, A-B testing is, and I need to write this down,

30
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,170
some day a podcast about, from Alan and Brent,

31
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,250
that's what the A-B is for,

32
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,530
but we talk about testing, software quality,

33
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,150
agile, leadership, change management,

34
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,710
agile, agile testing, and most recently,

35
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,570
this thing we've been talking about

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,930
for a year now on the podcast,

37
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,770
or maybe actually in depth for a year,

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,490
but for a lot longer, is modern testing.

39
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,440
I got a tweet today.

40
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,280
That's great.

41
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,520
I know, it was very exciting.

42
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,320
No, I got a tweet today.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,540
Apparently, years ago,

44
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,720
I had commented on someone's blog post.

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,000
This was like 2013, and he was talking about,

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,040
I think test needs to go in a certain direction.

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,940
And I'm like, yeah, the only thing I can see

48
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,480
on your thing was that you're missing

49
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,680
something along the lines of using telemetry data

50
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,090
to understand the customer.

51
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,850
So he circled back and was like,

52
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,170
hey, this sounds a lot like MT.

53
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,970
And I'm like, yeah, you know what?

54
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,450
Sorry for the delay.

55
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,050
I guess we kind of figured out

56
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,330
what that something bit was all about.

57
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,490
Okay, okay.

58
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,850
Hey, speaking of Twitter.

59
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,690
Yeah.

60
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:29,330
I woke up this morning and looked at Twitter.

61
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,570
Not the first thing, I'm not Donald Trump,

62
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,930
but I was looking at Twitter,

63
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,770
kind of catching up on stuff

64
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,450
because I had some notifications on my phone,

65
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,290
and Andrew Morton tweeted,

66
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,250
I met Andrew at Test Bash.

67
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,020
By the way, welcome Ministry of Testing listeners

68
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,220
if you're new, because this is the month

69
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,060
where if you are looking at your Ministry of Testing

70
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,900
calendar for 2018,

71
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,260
you'll see a nice little orange thing.

72
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,060
Let your eyes wander to the orange rectangle.

73
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,940
And April is sponsored by AB testing.

74
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
Yes.

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,940
So if you came here because of that calendar

76
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,980
to check us out, that's fantastic.

77
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,820
We love you.

78
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,660
Thank you very much.

79
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,940
Anyway, I met Andrew at Test Bash.

80
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,220
Andrew is the new dev boss at Test Bash,

81
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,300
but we played some card games together.

82
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,740
Played Flux.

83
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,980
I don't know what Flux is.

84
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,820
Oh.

85
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,580
Or what a dev boss is.

86
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,940
Oh, so he does the development

87
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,780
and Ministry of Testing.

88
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,530
Everyone's a boss.

89
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,090
Okay. Richard is the boss boss.

90
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,290
That's a title?

91
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,570
Yeah. Boss boss?

92
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,410
Yeah, boss boss.

93
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,230
He's a dev boss.

94
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,650
Anyway, not the point.

95
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,690
Not the point.

96
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,810
Still not the point.

97
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,250
But now, tangent time, Flux.

98
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,770
Flux, I play, it is fun.

99
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,810
It's a card game where you try

100
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,920
and accomplish the goal using rules,

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,400
but the rules and the goal change throughout the game,

102
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,910
depending on what cards you play.

103
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,710
I think that summed that up pretty well.

104
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,710
I think I summed that up pretty well.

105
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,390
Yeah, we should play On the Air sometimes.

106
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,270
That'll be a fun podcast.

107
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,390
Can you play it two player?

108
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,960
I think, I don't see why you couldn't.

109
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,640
But anyway, if I recall,

110
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,100
and I think I do recall.

111
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,900
Are you and Andrew now playing over Twitter?

112
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,340
No, no, he won.

113
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,180
He won.

114
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,500
And I don't even hold it against him because he was cool.

115
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,780
But the point I'm actually eventually going to get to

116
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,980
and maybe get to faster,

117
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,040
depending on how much of this I edit out,

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,640
is that he was on the latest episode

119
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,780
of Desert Island Discs.

120
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,620
Cool.

121
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,540
Which is the Ministry of Testing podcast

122
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,940
or sponsored podcast from Neil Studd

123
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,700
on Desert Island Discs.

124
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,380
If you remember, I did episode five.

125
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,220
Yes.

126
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,020
In the 2017, Andrew is Test Chef on Twitter.

127
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,620
If you want to follow him just straight away.

128
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,010
But the cool thing is,

129
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,570
is Andrew gave a nice plug for not only,

130
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,990
he talked about my Test Bash talk on modern testing,

131
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,450
but he gave a nice plug for A-B testing.

132
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,290
Sweet.

133
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,370
He started, he's one of the three,

134
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,810
and they even talked about one of the three

135
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,810
how he needed to recount.

136
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,490
And I just recounted again today,

137
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,970
and there's still only three listeners.

138
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,390
So, done, done, Neil.

139
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,130
Neil said, we need to recount?

140
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,850
Yeah, he said, surely there's more than three.

141
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,690
I said, nope.

142
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,690
And Neil also know that every time we count it's three,

143
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,410
just let everyone know I recounted him.

144
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,450
Thank you, all three listeners.

145
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,610
We do appreciate it.

146
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,530
I don't understand.

147
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,570
I'm a data scientist.

148
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,170
Like, it's three guys.

149
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,530
Yeah, take it.

150
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,130
Data science is magic.

151
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,650
So if he says three, it's three.

152
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,490
It's three.

153
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,330
There's no other believable answer.

154
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,480
Andrew's been listening since episode 30.

155
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,070
Wow.

156
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,350
But he did recommend the whole,

157
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,190
he said, just go back to like 70,

158
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,950
just watch the evolution of modern testing,

159
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,870
and they really dive into the last one.

160
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,070
It was a really nice, probably 60,

161
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,310
he said 70, but 60.

162
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,830
Some podcast hosts would go, just go listen to them all.

163
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,630
I'm not gonna tell you that.

164
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,170
I think you can start,

165
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,470
you can do 60 forward is really good.

166
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,110
And you can definitely go farther back.

167
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,990
Which episode do you happen to recall which one

168
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,030
I give you the ISTQB questions?

169
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,030
Keep talking, I'll find it.

170
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,030
Keep listening, you'll find the answer to that

171
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,870
if you wanna go back.

172
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,710
It's a good episode.

173
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,550
A lot of people like it.

174
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,390
I think that's actually one of them

175
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,390
that I have actually managed to title.

176
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,990
Yeah, but anyway, the point is,

177
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,830
is a really nice plug for A-B testing

178
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,990
from both Neil and Andrew.

179
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,030
We much appreciate it.

180
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,190
We love to have new members of the three, so thank you.

181
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,590
One other thing I did this week

182
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,550
is if you want to be part of the background discussion

183
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,610
and get early by two days releases

184
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,610
of the A-B testing podcast, you can join our Slack team.

185
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,370
And to do that, you used to have to email me,

186
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,910
but weirdly, more and more of the three

187
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,950
kept on emailing me and that got out of hand.

188
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,910
So now you can just go to angryweasel.com,

189
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,750
whack A-B testing, and click on a link

190
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,150
on the right side and you'll get invited automatically.

191
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,550
I can't not tell you how happy I am

192
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,390
that you figured that out.

193
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,150
And try and tell me, try and tell me how happy you are.

194
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,960
Oh, show me via an interpretive dance.

195
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,900
And we're back!

196
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,740
Yeah, that was a little bit more than I was looking for.

197
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,900
That was pretty happy.

198
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,540
Oh, wow.

199
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,350
Wow, oh, wow.

200
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,470
What was it, IS?

201
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,870
No, what is the acronym?

202
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,750
You can't imagine what it's like to be in here, ISTQB.

203
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,470
Do you need me to spell that for you?

204
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,950
Why is it QB?

205
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,350
Quality Board, International Software and Testing Quality

206
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,350
Board, I don't know what it stands for.

207
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,110
I wonder if anyone does.

208
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,170
I wonder if there's a name for an acronym

209
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,850
that no one knows what it stands for.

210
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,220
Okay, so back to A-B testing.

211
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,460
Hey, everybody.

212
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,500
I hope you've enjoyed the show so far

213
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,780
because it's off to a roaring start here

214
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,900
where Brent tries to scroll and find titles on his phone.

215
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,740
It's okay.

216
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,580
It's okay.

217
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,540
You can just send it to me later.

218
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,380
We can do this.

219
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,220
26.

220
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,410
Episode 26 is where I ask Brent about giving some questions

221
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,010
from the ISTQB.

222
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,810
There's some gems in there.

223
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,610
We definitely got better as we went along.

224
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:22,730
We definitely hit a roll, definitely starting with 60,

225
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,810
but probably before that, I think we actually had

226
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:26,450
some stuff under control.

227
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,170
And then there was the episode I did,

228
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,570
oh, without you, which was fun.

229
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,410
And don't look up the number.

230
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,250
Stop looking at your phone.

231
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,090
Stop, stop, stop.

232
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:35,690
I'm shutting it down.

233
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,890
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

234
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,250
Oh, and then speaking of doing an episode without you,

235
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,370
may or may not happen,

236
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,620
I'm going to star East week after next.

237
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,460
Congrats.

238
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,300
I'll be back in time for the podcast.

239
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,140
Don't worry.

240
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,430
I'm not.

241
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,270
All right.

242
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,830
If I can fit it in, I'm only going for two days.

243
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,310
Three days?

244
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,150
Whatever.

245
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,190
I think I've gone three days.

246
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,230
I'm gonna try and bring a little,

247
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,870
see if I can bring some recording equipment,

248
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,790
and maybe not do a podcast,

249
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,270
but it might be fun to interview some testers

250
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,760
about modern testing.

251
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,720
It'll be interesting there because a lot of testers

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,520
are more on the newer side.

253
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,560
I haven't figured it out.

254
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,960
I may just sit in a corner and look at cat pictures.

255
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm not sure.

256
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,720
That's interesting.

257
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,520
Actually, we need to circle back with Joel as well,

258
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,320
because I would have thought that we would have seen

259
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,000
the survey results for this year by now.

260
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,840
Yeah.

261
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, did we?

262
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,960
I thought we did.

263
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,890
Maybe we didn't.

264
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,330
But your thoughts are-

265
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,370
A note for after the show,

266
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,850
go see if those state of survey testing results came out,

267
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,970
because now that you mention it,

268
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,730
I don't recall if they did come out.

269
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,540
I'm fairly certain we would have done an episode on it.

270
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Your interview idea is what reminded me of that.

271
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,500
Yeah, I think we should talk about what sort of questions.

272
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,180
I think that could be,

273
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,320
I think that's a very interesting concept.

274
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,160
Okay.

275
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,880
Shall we pretend to do a podcast?

276
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,600
Hey, we're just about ready to get started with the podcast.

277
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
Yeah.

278
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,080
So I think it's,

279
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,360
I love that you can,

280
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,640
like most podcast listeners have that fast forward

281
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
30 second thing,

282
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,600
which you can hit about five, six, 12 times

283
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,280
on any A.B. testing podcast,

284
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,400
if you still want to get right to us

285
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,640
actually talking about anything relevant to your job.

286
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,640
I don't think that that's statistically provable.

287
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,480
Okay, fine.

288
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
And because-

289
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,880
I think there's probably a 70% chance

290
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,560
that no matter what you do with that thing,

291
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,400
you're going to get to some random tangent.

292
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,440
Because you're a data scientist,

293
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,580
if it's data, I believe you.

294
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,180
Okay, so we have a question

295
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,260
or a couple of questions to answer today.

296
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Are these questions from-

297
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,740
We do not have questions.

298
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,420
You lost the poll.

299
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,750
Do it.

300
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,100
Do it.

301
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,660
Do we please have a,

302
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,040
wait, how many people voted

303
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,080
that I should do the Nickelodeon

304
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,650
copyrighted mailbag intro?

305
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,170
Don't look it up.

306
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,890
I was just going to tease you about-

307
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:20,090
I'm gonna say 20 versus one, you.

308
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,160
I guess there's one thing we've learned

309
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,400
in the last 18 months of American politics

310
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,080
is that lying is totally acceptable.

311
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,710
And if you lie enough, it becomes the truth.

312
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,800
Right.

313
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,680
Not sure what I was talking about.

314
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,650
This is not a political podcast.

315
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,940
By unpopular demand.

316
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,780
Mailbag!

317
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,620
Yes!

318
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,460
Okay.

319
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,380
Yes, we do not have questions.

320
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,780
We have mailbag items today.

321
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
All right.

322
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,020
You want to start with Patrick.

323
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,420
So one thing, one bombshell we dropped

324
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,420
and worth some elaboration is,

325
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,220
if I remember correctly on the last episode,

326
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,200
Brent asked me, is modern testing a role?

327
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I said, is there such a thing as a modern tester?

328
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,440
And I said no.

329
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,200
And it was a revelation, a slight revelation for me too,

330
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,320
but I just needed that moment of reflection.

331
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,160
Think no, it says modern testing is a way.

332
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,000
Right.

333
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,320
It's a, yeah, it's a air quote way.

334
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,280
But I want to-

335
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,280
I'm actually glad Patrick, hey TestPappy, thanks.

336
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,240
And then actually just to piggyback,

337
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,000
and then I made a comment, like if it does exist,

338
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,240
right, I don't have our principles numbers memorized,

339
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:59,160
but if it does exist, one of our last principles

340
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,620
necessitates that it disappears.

341
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,220
And I thought about it some more since then,

342
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,060
and I'm glad you mentioned that,

343
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,580
because I think there is,

344
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,700
a modern tester is the role that leads a team

345
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,100
towards modern testing.

346
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,180
But then by definition, yeah, it is transitory.

347
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,210
Right.

348
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,530
I don't want to dive into the next question,

349
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,010
like thanks, Pepe, on to the next one.

350
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,690
Because they do overlap a little bit.

351
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:23,530
They do.

352
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,150
But if you look at the, and I don't have this

353
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:30,310
in front of me, but there are three principles

354
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,670
called the ways of DevOps.

355
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,510
You looked at these?

356
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,350
No.

357
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,290
Brent will look at his phone right now,

358
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,130
and look them up.

359
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,970
No, no.

360
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,810
But I don't have them in front of me,

361
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,570
but they overlap, interestingly,

362
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,370
quite a bit with modern testing principles.

363
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,330
It doesn't.

364
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,410
Shouldn't surprise.

365
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,770
It doesn't surprise me.

366
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,500
Like a lot of what modern testing is,

367
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,580
in my view, is sort of a,

368
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,100
it's a repackaging of a lot of existing principles.

369
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,940
Absolutely.

370
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,500
Susinctly, and then with a test skin.

371
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,660
One of the things I ask,

372
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,540
well, a quality spin.

373
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,580
What I view these principles are about,

374
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,070
and how do we focus in,

375
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,230
and help the test community do their part

376
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:23,030
to stop being a cost to the business,

377
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,470
and shift to being a value add to the business.

378
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes.

379
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,420
But with a heavy focus on their existing strengths,

380
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,820
which are very quality focused.

381
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,940
So many things to talk about.

382
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,980
So let me go through the thoughts and order in my head,

383
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,400
which is a difficult thing.

384
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,640
My last team at Microsoft.

385
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,990
I, teams.

386
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,810
As I've mentioned before, drink.

387
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:52,770
I was brought in as the quality guy.

388
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,010
The guy to influence quality,

389
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,340
basically the modern tester.

390
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,100
I think that was near literally your title, wasn't it?

391
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,940
The quality guy.

392
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,780
Yeah.

393
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,340
Across a fairly large dev team.

394
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,780
Once my manager put more and more burden on me

395
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,380
to own the quality,

396
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,300
or to be at least be the scapegoat for quality

397
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,140
in some ways,

398
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,940
responsible, everyone I put it.

399
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,300
Which I didn't totally hate,

400
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,660
because I did feel like my role

401
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,820
was to mature the quality culture,

402
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,980
to improve quality.

403
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,190
But what I ended up realizing,

404
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,510
sort of taking ownership of,

405
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,310
or a green thick ownership of,

406
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,630
was basically everything from the developer desktop

407
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,470
to deployment.

408
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,710
Everything from the dev teams

409
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,070
could take care of designing features.

410
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,900
But once they started writing code,

411
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,300
all the way until deployment was handed off

412
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,580
to our site reliability engineers.

413
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,260
All that was under my team one way or the other.

414
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,100
We were writing productivity tools for developers.

415
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,060
We were writing gates for check-ins.

416
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,300
We handled deployment.

417
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,340
We handled bug tracking.

418
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,060
We handled reports.

419
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,740
We handled all of the compliance issues,

420
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,340
everything in there.

421
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,500
And then,

422
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,740
and even for my last several months,

423
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,580
doing release management.

424
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,980
Reviewing every change going in

425
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,660
and making sure the right changes were going in.

426
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,500
Or the right work was going into the changes going in.

427
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,740
Yeah, I remember all this,

428
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,660
but hearing you summit,

429
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm just,

430
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,140
vomiting a little bit in my mouth.

431
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,680
I'm just like.

432
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,200
I wanna come back to that.

433
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,120
I wanna know where the vomit comes from,

434
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,960
other than your gut.

435
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,280
Because to me it seems like

436
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,940
you're your last manager.

437
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,140
And maybe it's innocuous,

438
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,580
but the way you just described it,

439
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,940
like over time,

440
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,660
every time you take one of these things,

441
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,820
you're sort of rebuilding up the,

442
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,060
I like how you put it, I use it a lot.

443
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,090
Resolidifying your role as the team scapegoat.

444
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,210
Right, if it doesn't ship fast enough,

445
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,050
whose fault is it?

446
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,890
Alan, if the quality's low,

447
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:01,810
whose fault is it?

448
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,650
Alan.

449
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,170
And to be clear,

450
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:06,530
my last manager was a piece of crap.

451
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,320
But honestly,

452
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
my last job was perfect for me at Microsoft

453
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,360
because I got to do a lot more,

454
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,880
I got to get a lot nicer view of end to end,

455
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,080
that whole pipeline,

456
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:19,920
which I wanna come back to.

457
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
I think it's very important.

458
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,280
Everything from developer desktop to deployment.

459
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,960
I got a good view of how all that works,

460
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,520
what common pitfalls are,

461
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,180
I learned a lot.

462
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,100
But also I had a bad enough experience

463
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,580
with team culture and management

464
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,870
that it put me in a job

465
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,740
that I'm a thousand times more happier in.

466
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,100
Full, full, I got experience,

467
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,940
but also the right kick in the butt to get out.

468
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,020
The universe prepared me

469
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,500
to go have a great time at Unity.

470
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,860
So I'm, I'm,

471
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,700
There you go.

472
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,590
I'm happy with the way things turned out.

473
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:57,030
So I have a similar experience

474
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:59,910
between my current job and my last job.

475
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,290
And, and as you know,

476
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,110
your current position,

477
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,110
you will always find something to,

478
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,150
to begin to really hate.

479
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,830
But one of the things that I

480
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,070
currently fall back to

481
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,390
is I go,

482
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,130
yes, but you know what?

483
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,590
It's still not my last job.

484
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,550
Yeah.

485
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,730
Sometimes you need to have,

486
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,270
you know, a rough experience

487
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,190
to set that bar really low

488
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,390
so you,

489
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,110
you can appreciate your current situation.

490
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:35,430
It's all relative.

491
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,430
One of the great learnings I got from that is I think

492
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,550
the modern tester looks at everything

493
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,630
from developer desktop all the way to deployment.

494
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,230
That's their playground to find bottlenecks

495
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,750
and to find places for improvement,

496
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,710
to find places where

497
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,140
the quality can be injected.

498
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,140
Accelerating the achievement of simple quality

499
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,980
requires that you look at everything

500
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,020
from developer desktop all the way to deployment

501
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,940
and figure out where,

502
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,900
where the acceleration part or help can come in.

503
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,740
Right.

504
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,710
So let me tell you something that I'm working on

505
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:09,330
that's relevant to this, right?

506
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:10,750
Now I'm going to do it from a,

507
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,870
a statistical or a machine learning point of view.

508
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,070
Remember, remember listeners,

509
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,040
that means it will be true.

510
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,880
That,

511
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,000
Okay, go on.

512
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,840
Yeah.

513
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,000
The,

514
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,160
but the problem is,

515
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
is relevant period.

516
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,830
So here at,

517
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,670
at Microsoft we,

518
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,750
much like any other place that has a service,

519
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,590
we have,

520
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,010
we have a DevOps type of thing.

521
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,750
And we have these,

522
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,970
I'll just call them things called outages.

523
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,730
And an outage is,

524
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,130
Hey, suddenly we stopped providing service

525
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,770
that we have promised to customers.

526
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,610
Right.

527
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,800
You can imagine,

528
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,640
you know,

529
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,120
a big outage would be a whole data center going down

530
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,320
due to like a power situation.

531
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,420
Okay.

532
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,580
One of the things that I am deeply involved in is

533
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,660
the,

534
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,980
the measurement of success

535
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,980
and the process by which we get all of the developer leaders

536
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,260
in a room and work through,

537
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,680
how do we make this stop happening?

538
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,520
Okay.

539
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
It's a very expensive meeting.

540
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,760
It happens every week.

541
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,220
It's an hour and a half.

542
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,060
And now,

543
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,700
now I have a little VOD coming up in my throat.

544
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,180
Yeah.

545
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,020
Well,

546
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,200
and so good.

547
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,060
Rightfully so.

548
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,720
Very expensive meeting hour and a half.

549
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,950
You've got partners and VPs in this room.

550
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,930
And what I've observed is a lot of the times it's,

551
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,170
it's regressing down to,

552
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,090
very simple suggestions.

553
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,010
So this meeting,

554
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,360
we have a lot of high power.

555
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,620
And what I've now concluded is we really don't know,

556
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,280
there's a process that those above us have pushed on,

557
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,400
pushed even down onto the VPs.

558
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,280
But no one's really evaluating,

559
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,940
is this process having an effect?

560
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:26,940
Are we getting the value from the investment?

561
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,780
Right.

562
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,060
So one of the problems is like outages,

563
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,360
a big part of the outage problem is human error.

564
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,640
Someone's trying to do something.

565
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,960
They did a typo.

566
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,440
Instead of doing what they intended to do,

567
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,300
they had an unexpected consequence and something else.

568
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,220
And now they've created another outage.

569
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,360
This actually happens.

570
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
Yeah, Phil, I've experienced many of those.

571
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,930
But all of these are sort of one-offs.

572
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,770
Right?

573
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,610
And so,

574
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,160
what I'm trying to work through

575
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,440
is do we even need this meeting?

576
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,280
Right?

577
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,680
It's a very expensive meeting.

578
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,800
And are these suggestions actually adding value?

579
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,080
So what I'm now gonna try to do,

580
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,900
and it's a difficult data science problem

581
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,740
because it,

582
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,740
data science as you know,

583
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,840
works better when you have multiple data points.

584
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,360
These are all one-offs.

585
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,730
But that type of analysis and that type of quality check,

586
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,290
one of the things that I'm actually looking to do is say,

587
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,650
hey, maybe we don't need to optimize this process,

588
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:44,210
or rather what we need to do is optimize this process

589
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,170
by removing it, right?

590
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,510
And coming up with something else.

591
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,510
My current theme, every year it seems like I have a theme

592
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,190
in the team.

593
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,770
You should have a theme song too.

594
00:22:58,770 --> 00:22:59,670
You should work on that.

595
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,220
All right.

596
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,380
But my theme last year, for example,

597
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:07,220
was Cosmos is dead.

598
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,700
So for the uninitialized,

599
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,820
Cosmos is the massive data lake used for storing

600
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,340
all kinds of crap at Microsoft.

601
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,180
Yes.

602
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,860
And it's slow and has low reliability.

603
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,020
And another fine team in Israel has created for us

604
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,780
a much better solution.

605
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:31,700
Now Cosmos, so we do have a...

606
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,080
Is it called Cosmos 2 Business Edition?

607
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,320
No, we do have a...

608
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,440
We do, and this is one thing I also don't understand,

609
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,420
but we do have an official branded product called Cosmos DB.

610
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,810
This is not the thing I'm referring to.

611
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:50,700
The theme this year is around,

612
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:58,690
essentially, how do we automate away the human?

613
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,010
Now don't take that out of context,

614
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,990
you context-driven people.

615
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,110
It's in some cases, automating away the human

616
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,790
is the right thing to do.

617
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,980
What cases is it not?

618
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,240
To the CDT people?

619
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,450
I don't wanna make...

620
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:18,530
Oh, you're talking about the...

621
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,690
Automation is replacing the job of the human tester.

622
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,490
Testing is a sapient process

623
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,810
requiring thinking and creativity.

624
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,570
Yes, agreed.

625
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,850
Get over it, move on.

626
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,690
Fine.

627
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,510
Fine.

628
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,650
Anyway, sorry for the tangent,

629
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,330
but I have to play devil's advocate voice.

630
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,170
What I am trying...

631
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,130
Voice of the prick.

632
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,610
What I am trying to do in this particular case

633
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,000
is create a system that learns from the human,

634
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,560
but then automates the decision-making process

635
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,040
because as we scale up,

636
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,120
and I did a presentation to Alan a few months ago,

637
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,980
and one of the things that I was able to show

638
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,760
is Azure is massively growing.

639
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,650
Don't believe you.

640
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:02,490
Fine.

641
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:05,750
Financial reports coming out very soon.

642
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,030
Read that, believe that.

643
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,340
Just full disclosure,

644
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,330
my team's data feeds into the financial disclosure.

645
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,250
So if it's wrong, you're fired.

646
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,170
Yeah, but I'm a data scientist.

647
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,010
So it must be true.

648
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,830
Right.

649
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,670
Gotcha.

650
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:21,500
Nevermind.

651
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,260
Anyway, so the point I'm trying to...

652
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,140
Yeah, but what is the point you're trying to make?

653
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:31,020
So just analyzing that process

654
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,380
and accelerating isn't...

655
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,740
Like it says accelerating

656
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,180
the achievement of shippable quality.

657
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,900
Just remember, it's not just about...

658
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,260
Just because that's the first word

659
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,440
doesn't mean it's the most important.

660
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,280
Right?

661
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,480
That there's also of,

662
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,760
okay, how do we achieve the goal of shippable quality?

663
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,680
And then in my view,

664
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,120
the MT principles or the modern testing principles

665
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,480
should feed into that.

666
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,920
Sometimes the right thing to do is say,

667
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,880
this process is stupid, get rid of it.

668
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,300
Yeah, absolutely.

669
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,320
It's the systems thinking aspect.

670
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,640
Talk about bringing our strengths to the table

671
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,680
to help the team transition to a modern testing way.

672
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,300
Part of that is just looking at the system as a whole.

673
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,960
A lot of people can work for years successfully

674
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,680
as a developer by only seeing their part of the system.

675
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,440
It's up to us as people driving modern testing

676
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,120
to view that whole system and...

677
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,600
Measure it against the end goal.

678
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,080
I can't tell you,

679
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,240
back when I wore the title test manager,

680
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,180
one of the things that I realized all the time.

681
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,560
And I then started measuring,

682
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,560
and it really did start to sicken me.

683
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,760
Where, right, dev would find this clever thing

684
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,980
that shortened the dev schedule.

685
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,460
And they would be praised and held up as heroes.

686
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,460
But that same thing that they did

687
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,860
added three weeks to the test schedule.

688
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,420
Yeah.

689
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,420
And so there was this sort of component level optimization

690
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,380
instead of optimizing the whole system.

691
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,460
I'm like, look, your stupid decision

692
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,060
actually changed the schedule by a whole,

693
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,680
extended the schedule by a week.

694
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,980
This was a bad call, not a good call.

695
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,540
Why are we rewarding this guy?

696
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,300
Right.

697
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,060
Lean talks about optimize the whole.

698
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:36,580
The whole process, not a subcomponent.

699
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:38,620
Because it is absolutely not true.

700
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,900
I think we're saying the same thing.

701
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,740
Yeah.

702
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,140
If the processes are independent,

703
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,420
yeah, you can go component by component.

704
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,140
And optimize that individually.

705
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,660
But if a decision from an upstream process

706
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,260
could negatively impact the one downstream,

707
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,580
then you need to go after the whole system.

708
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,980
That's still a theory of constraints.

709
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,130
Yes.

710
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,460
I want to make sure we have time

711
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,620
to talk about the next question.

712
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,440
Go ahead.

713
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,900
I think to wrap up,

714
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,420
I think it's something we'll discuss more.

715
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,100
I think if questions come up around

716
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,020
this transitional process and modern testing

717
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,900
being a way versus a role.

718
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,700
Because I see the modern tester really

719
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,320
as the person who facilitates the transition

720
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,320
into a team doing the modern testing principle.

721
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,900
I think the modern tester is transitional.

722
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,740
I think his primary role is to be a leader

723
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,180
and an example that others follow

724
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,340
to get the rest of the team aboard.

725
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,700
Put a pin in the leader part.

726
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,220
And then this next mailbag question,

727
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,300
I only need to do it once per episode,

728
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,660
was actually a direct message on Twitter

729
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,860
and from a month ago, so I'm so sorry.

730
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,880
But we're getting to it.

731
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,460
From Just Voskul.

732
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,700
I think it's probably Just.

733
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,340
Just, Just Voskul.

734
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,010
Yeah, because the J's are wise.

735
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,290
Scandinavia.

736
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,610
Yeah, he sent a DM.

737
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,050
Which I shared with Brent.

738
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,970
Yep, and I will say.

739
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,450
I probably broke a European privacy law.

740
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,670
TLDR, we're not gonna go through the whole thing on this.

741
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,410
It's very smart mail.

742
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,090
It's not a mail, it's a tweet.

743
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:16,930
DM.

744
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:17,770
DM, sure.

745
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,460
So a couple points we wanted to cover in this.

746
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,420
Let me start with, I got the last question.

747
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:28,060
So one of the things that he had an issue with

748
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,200
was us saying we want you to focus on quality

749
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,900
and not code correctness.

750
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,580
Yeah, what do you mean by that, Brent?

751
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,140
And then he asks if we are responsible

752
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,420
for the quality culture, it's quality

753
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,860
and then he concludes it's quality in the widest form,

754
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,780
including code quality maintainability.

755
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,380
Maybe I'm missing the point there, can we elaborate?

756
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,560
Yeah, we can elaborate.

757
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,480
We can.

758
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,960
If nothing else about this podcast.

759
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,680
That's one thing we know how to do is elaborate.

760
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
We can elaborate.

761
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,120
Please elaborate.

762
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,200
I'll tell you my perspective on this.

763
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,840
As part of the transition I think is absolutely critical

764
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,250
that tests get away from any semblance

765
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,610
of what we've called the dysfunctional loop.

766
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,490
There is a more positive way of describing this

767
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,480
and perhaps you'll get to it as well.

768
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,220
But one of the behaviors we have to get rid of

769
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,520
is any semblance of the scapegoating

770
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,980
that it is test job to find these bugs.

771
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,100
Yes.

772
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,340
Dev gets to write the bugs and test gets to find them.

773
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,780
Which might be-

774
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,860
A lot of vomit in the back of the throat.

775
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,820
I mean, there's some places where it is fun.

776
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,820
The Easter time, the Easter bunny goes and hides all the eggs

777
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,880
and then we have to go and find them.

778
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,780
But in this particular case,

779
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,460
the Easter bunny doesn't come and slaughter those

780
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,020
who didn't find enough eggs.

781
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,500
No, what we wanna do to actually move quality upstream

782
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,100
is we have to get rid of that safety net and say,

783
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,900
no, on code correctness, Dev, you're wholly responsible.

784
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,260
Now-

785
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,280
And to be clear, Interject,

786
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,960
I look at from the Agile quadrants.

787
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,320
Of course, modern testing principles

788
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,120
are based largely on Agile testing.

789
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,000
Brian Merrick's Agile testing quadrants,

790
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
which were elaborated on quite a bit

791
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,080
by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory and then others,

792
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,920
are a good model to look at

793
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,560
to understand the holistic view of testing.

794
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,440
And there is code correctness in the quadrants,

795
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,240
but if, I could look at it two ways,

796
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,850
let me finish both for you, Interject.

797
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,050
One, I could say a team where the team

798
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,570
I could say a team where the Dev team doesn't own

799
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,750
or won't take ownership for code correctness

800
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,970
isn't ready for modern testing.

801
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:57,570
Or alternate view is the first thing

802
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,050
that a modern tester,

803
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,230
someone helping with transition should do

804
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,450
is make sure and coach the team

805
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,490
and give them the tools and information they need

806
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,690
to help own their own code correctness.

807
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,330
I'm gonna push back on your first comment

808
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:12,210
because yeah, they're not ready,

809
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,370
but they absolutely need to become ready.

810
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,730
Yeah, which is kinda led into the second one,

811
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,970
which if you're going to,

812
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,690
if you do want to evolve and be able to

813
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,810
stay in business, frankly,

814
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:26,370
you're going to need to transition

815
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,170
to something towards modern testing.

816
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:31,130
I actually think we, the last episode,

817
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,410
we talked about my tourniquet metaphor.

818
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,250
Yes.

819
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,070
Right?

820
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,850
And I think if you find that the Dev team

821
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,410
is not willing to do this,

822
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,300
I actually think that is a viable place to rip the band-aid.

823
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Because your other choice is to let it persist.

824
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,860
Famously, and I say famously because I saved the screenshot

825
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,380
and had it even in my test bash talk

826
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:00,840
was the headline Yahoo Eliminates the Safety Net

827
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,300
to improve and to improve code quality

828
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,780
or to improve quality.

829
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,900
I forget the exact quote,

830
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,160
but it was the article from when they

831
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,660
got rid of all their testers

832
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,100
and figured, well, automatically now,

833
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,440
because people don't have testers,

834
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,970
they will automatically own quality.

835
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,860
And that case, it was a tourniquet.

836
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,010
I think, could be either.

837
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,830
Yep.

838
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,170
Where I think, and the way I'm driving modern testing

839
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,890
at Unity is, and the thing I learned from my last two teams

840
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,930
at Microsoft where we did transition

841
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,930
to Dev teams owning end-to-end quality, more or less,

842
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:43,410
was my big takeaway is that a transition is needed

843
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,410
and modern testers and coaches are needed

844
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:47,890
to help the team get there.

845
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:50,790
It won't happen automatically if you get rid of testers.

846
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,410
That's the biggest mistake I see teams moving

847
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,610
to unified engineering do, is think,

848
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,450
okay, nobody's a tester anymore, it'll all work out.

849
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:00,970
You need someone to manage the transition.

850
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,810
Oh, oh, oh.

851
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,650
Or to lead the transition.

852
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,240
The only way where I've seen it actually work

853
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:10,240
is in that regard is you actually eliminate the testers.

854
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:16,060
Because you've visibly gotten rid of the safety net.

855
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:19,760
I remember when Microsoft first started doing this,

856
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,760
we tried to come up with a way to sort of ease the balance.

857
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,560
And I remember one team, they had a 10 to one,

858
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,880
they went from a one to one Dev to test ratio

859
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,600
to a 10 to one Dev to test ratio.

860
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,600
And they just ended up with a really busy tester, right?

861
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,440
Yeah, actually, I think they did.

862
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,600
Yeah, actually, no, and this is the reason why,

863
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,520
this gets back to why I am so focused on,

864
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,280
no, get out of the code correctness game,

865
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,440
because your Dev are meant,

866
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,640
they have this mental muscle memory,

867
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,740
and it is hard to get them out of the frame

868
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,540
that they own their code correctness.

869
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,540
And I was actually in, I was having lunch,

870
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,140
and I was with a Dev and a test,

871
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,980
and the Dev looked over at the test guy,

872
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,340
who was the one and the 10, looked over at the test guy,

873
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,300
and I was like, I don't understand what leadership is doing.

874
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,130
How are you going to do all this?

875
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,730
And I looked at him, I'm like, he's not, you are.

876
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,540
It requires leadership because they didn't know that.

877
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,940
Just remember, because we're going through

878
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,980
a little bit of this,

879
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,380
I'm not going to dive into details,

880
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,780
but the main point it reminds me of is,

881
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,620
Google had this thing called test ready,

882
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:47,620
which meant, until you can show that you've done everything,

883
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,260
and some pretty high levels around code correctness,

884
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,140
don't even ask for any help from testing experts.

885
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,100
Because you need to show that you can

886
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,900
take care of yourself first.

887
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,930
I agree with that.

888
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,930
I think at Microsoft,

889
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,130
There's something to that.

890
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,250
I think at Microsoft,

891
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,970
I've seen things similar to that,

892
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,810
and in different names, I think at Microsoft,

893
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:13,010
what would happen is we would find

894
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,010
that the developers would set their test ready bar too low.

895
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,750
The thing that I would say on this one is,

896
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:25,790
number one, QA's new value proposition

897
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,630
is around the measurement of quality.

898
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,070
One of the things that I would do in Xbox, for example,

899
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,830
this is the last time I remember doing this,

900
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,310
I'm like, we are spending 300 million, not 300 million,

901
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,830
but there was one feature that we spent

902
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,340
actually a million dollars on.

903
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,940
And I'm like, why?

904
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,340
What evidence do we have that anyone's going to use this?

905
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,540
Turns out I was right,

906
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,860
and after we had spent the whole million dollars,

907
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,940
the feature got cut,

908
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:56,020
because it relied on a super niche market.

909
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,060
And I'm like, we need to get some venture capitalists

910
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,980
into some of these decision-making positions,

911
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,270
because when it's their money versus Microsoft's money,

912
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,270
people are making smarter decisions.

913
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,050
On the code correctness,

914
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,690
modern testers job is essentially,

915
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,210
no, we're here to teach others to fish, okay?

916
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,170
So I think the main point to get across

917
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,610
is that it's not that we don't care about code correctness,

918
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:31,210
it's absolutely important,

919
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,210
but it's, we can't lead modern testing,

920
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,010
we can't scale if,

921
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,070
and a team essentially can't achieve

922
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,130
accelerating the achievable quality

923
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,890
without a dev team that really understands

924
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,410
and owns code correctness.

925
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,770
I've actually gotten to the point

926
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,770
where I've realized that the only way to get tests

927
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:59,340
to realize that their role is to teach others to fish

928
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,780
is to make it hard for them to give fish,

929
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,580
because once that starts,

930
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,280
you're inviting the dysfunction loop again.

931
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,280
So that in a nutshell,

932
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,880
as we have enough more people,

933
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,370
the right balances will be struck.

934
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,190
But right now, I don't think that's the current

935
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,270
shape of the world.

936
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,270
Yeah.

937
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,390
Just say no.

938
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,030
So one thing,

939
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,550
I can't remember if you just had a question

940
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,550
about this directly,

941
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,750
or what the exact question was,

942
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,590
and you can look it up while I talk,

943
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,430
is the leadership aspect of this,

944
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:38,110
the leadership needed for a person functioning

945
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,260
in the modern testing role.

946
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,340
It's become, as I've thought about it more and more,

947
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,080
and as I've looked at the people in my team

948
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,980
who are leading their teams towards this,

949
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,060
these, towards these principles, towards this way,

950
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,320
I realize it's almost entirely a leadership issue

951
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,120
and entirely dependent on their ability

952
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,360
to grow as leaders.

953
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,440
It's not entirely.

954
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,680
I mean, the transition,

955
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,680
like if you don't have influencing skills,

956
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:13,600
if there are multiple ways,

957
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,240
it's one of the reasons why I say,

958
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,060
hey, you need analytical skills.

959
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,120
Because a lot of times,

960
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:21,520
if you personally don't have the soft skills to influence,

961
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,120
if I'm gonna build a model,

962
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,480
a triangle pyramid, whatever,

963
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,120
I won't go into the tangent there.

964
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,440
I think the basis is,

965
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,480
you mentioned it before, you have to have influence skills.

966
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,680
The basis is leadership.

967
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,600
Everything else builds on top of that.

968
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,000
If people don't wanna do what you say,

969
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,120
or people don't see your value,

970
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,480
or people don't agree with the direction

971
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,310
you're trying to go in, good luck.

972
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,910
It's gonna be very difficult.

973
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,150
Well, no, it's not good luck.

974
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:56,150
Go read a book on the topic.

975
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:00,550
Pick three things from that that resonate, try them.

976
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,910
And if this still doesn't work, go get a different book.

977
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,510
Like, don't give up.

978
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,910
Never surrender.

979
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:09,270
Just like testing where we try new things all the time,

980
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,190
as a leader, and not as a manager,

981
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:12,590
as a leader, well, as a manager too,

982
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,110
but in this case, talking about leadership,

983
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,670
you need to constantly try out new things.

984
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,910
If you keep on trying the same thing over and over,

985
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,550
like, well, I asked them to do it,

986
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:22,550
and they didn't do it.

987
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,870
Well, I asked them to do it, and they didn't do it.

988
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,830
Well, I asked them, it's like,

989
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:29,790
dude, you suck, or I guess Brent says go read a book.

990
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,510
But seriously, you need to, it is hard.

991
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,710
Leadership is, effective leadership is just as hard,

992
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,070
or harder than any of the technical stuff

993
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,750
that we do as testers.

994
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,710
You also have to have a little bravery, I think.

995
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,980
I was thinking about the tourniquet stuff.

996
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:53,140
I remember at one point in time,

997
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:55,900
I made a decision of, you know what?

998
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,860
Yeah, I got a lot of testers,

999
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,610
but the nice thing is they're my testers,

1000
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,650
not yours, Mr. Dev Guy.

1001
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,710
So here's the deal.

1002
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,780
I basically invented something similar

1003
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,480
to what you talked about with Google,

1004
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,940
and I said, yeah, we're not available to you.

1005
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,420
But what about Check-in?

1006
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,860
Yeah, what about Check-in?

1007
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,280
And I remember one time,

1008
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,860
Devleed came to me after I'd done this,

1009
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,260
and she's like, why wasn't this found before?

1010
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,260
And I'm like, well, if you wanna set up a meeting,

1011
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,820
I'm happy to sit down and look through your unit tests

1012
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,700
and help you answer that question.

1013
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,600
And she looked at me like, what?

1014
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,440
I'm like, yeah, I'm here to help.

1015
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,640
Yeah, there's a, right?

1016
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,760
She was already pissed when she came to my office.

1017
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,640
That one comment just blew her over.

1018
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm like, I don't know how to make it more clear.

1019
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I can't help those that can't help themselves.

1020
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,540
Right, right.

1021
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,800
I didn't make up that quote,

1022
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,140
but it's very applicable here.

1023
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,160
I don't know where it came from,

1024
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,920
but we can help those who can help themselves.

1025
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,120
But that actually started changing her world,

1026
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,800
because what she did is she did what she has always done

1027
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,020
when she's getting heat post-ship for a bug.

1028
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,780
But what we have to be able to do as modern testers

1029
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,180
is be able to drive that behavior and quality

1030
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,810
before the crisis comes, before the bad bug comes.

1031
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:36,730
Right, we can't wait till, okay,

1032
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,570
we'll just wait till they fail badly.

1033
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,930
No, that's ideal, that's ideal,

1034
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,570
but it's those crisis things

1035
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,970
where the principles are tested.

1036
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,370
Yes.

1037
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:48,220
And what I did is I said,

1038
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,340
wow, that's a really crappy situation.

1039
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:55,740
And here's a person attacking me as if I'm responsible

1040
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,170
but I'm not.

1041
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:04,170
She wrote the code and so now I'm gonna ignore her emotion.

1042
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,490
I'm gonna use this as an opportunity

1043
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,310
to redirect her effort towards something that's productive.

1044
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:13,230
Yeah, I'm happy to, you know what?

1045
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,110
I am a test expert.

1046
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,050
Let's sit down, I'll set up a meeting tomorrow.

1047
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,590
Let's sit down, look at your test

1048
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:22,790
and figure out the answer to her question.

1049
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:24,390
Now, what really pissed her off

1050
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,350
is because she was hoping to use me as a story

1051
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:30,350
for it was Brent's fault,

1052
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:32,870
but I had already covered all of those bases.

1053
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:35,250
Let me talk about how maybe it could be proactive there.

1054
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,190
Let's say you're working with a team and they have,

1055
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,550
you know from looking at data,

1056
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,670
you're looking around the teams you work with

1057
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:44,110
because a lot of times the modern tester

1058
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:45,790
is working with multiple teams.

1059
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:49,270
There's the quality coach for multiple teams

1060
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,030
and you look at a team that from the unit test

1061
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,150
has like 25% code coverage.

1062
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,990
You could be proactive there and just say,

1063
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:01,030
hey Devlead, looking through my data across the team,

1064
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,350
I see your unit tests only have 25% code coverage.

1065
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,510
Can we set up a half hour, an hour to kind of walk through

1066
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:11,670
and figure out what the plan is to get the code coverage up?

1067
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,150
That's an A approach.

1068
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,590
So, and again, I need to preface this by saying

1069
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:20,380
code coverage is a wonderful tool, but a horrible metric.

1070
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,220
You know what I mean?

1071
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,040
I do.

1072
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,880
All right, now so go on.

1073
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:23,720
That's one way, but.

1074
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,120
Anyway, what I actually, so my version of that same question

1075
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,760
is, hey can we set up a meeting?

1076
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:38,120
And I'd like to understand why you don't view that as a risk.

1077
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,900
So what I'm trying to do is,

1078
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,540
because what I don't want to do is get them to think that,

1079
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:51,280
okay, I am the guy, I'm God in the ivory tower

1080
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,420
and I will happen to look down and say,

1081
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:57,240
your magic statistic is too low.

1082
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,840
No, because I want them to own it.

1083
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,680
Like, hey, did you consider this?

1084
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,430
Why don't you view this as a risk?

1085
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,930
And, because generally that will just be a conversation

1086
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,940
and it'll end up being, okay, this is a risk.

1087
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:12,860
So I like taking the Socratic method on that.

1088
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,440
But it may not, I mean, again, it's a leadership is,

1089
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,350
a lot of leadership is just initially, especially,

1090
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,550
is forging these relationships.

1091
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,150
You have to have a relationship where we can have

1092
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,770
a frank and honest conversation about it.

1093
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,370
Because it may be, well yeah, but my manager is

1094
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:32,350
really pushing us to get these features out.

1095
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,550
So getting those out is more important

1096
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:35,450
than reducing risk right now.

1097
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,970
And then the other thing actually both of our examples

1098
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:44,260
help with is teaching that dev leader,

1099
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,790
hey, there is a way to measure this.

1100
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:52,830
There is a way to have a coaching conversation

1101
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:57,850
around whether or not you're too low or at risk.

1102
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,290
And I think also, and I brought that up as an example,

1103
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:05,610
but really I'd want to have a more holistic conversation.

1104
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,510
It's like, hey, can we talk about quality for an hour?

1105
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,130
And I'm gonna come in with, what are your quality goals?

1106
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:12,450
And if we can establish some quality goals together,

1107
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:13,370
how are we gonna get there?

1108
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,130
And co-coverage can come up and risk

1109
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:17,370
can come up as part of that.

1110
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:21,760
Could also be other risks in the pipeline.

1111
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,420
Again, looking at everything from developer desktop

1112
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,280
to deployment, what are some other risks,

1113
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,060
what are some other things we want to do to improve quality?

1114
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:29,260
How are we gonna do that and balance the new feature work?

1115
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,260
What's important for the customer?

1116
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,020
How are we going to measure things?

1117
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,400
The only thing you're missing so far

1118
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,220
is what's important to them.

1119
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,220
Because one of the things I've actually discovered

1120
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,430
if you go, okay, no dev team has enough engineering hours.

1121
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,270
That's just great.

1122
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:46,110
That is absolutely true.

1123
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,230
Remember the data scientist said that, so it's true.

1124
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:54,230
So how do you use what they care about

1125
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,700
and help them to remove some of these brute force methods?

1126
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,820
Right, why do they not want to do unit testing?

1127
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,240
Because the value's not immediately clear to them.

1128
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,560
They need a way to connect the dots.

1129
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,180
And it steals their engineering hours

1130
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:17,250
because there's this belief that feature development

1131
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:21,070
is what builds business value, which it does,

1132
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,230
but then there's more to that.

1133
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,230
Like my favorite example, you've heard it from me

1134
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:29,910
a million times before, perfect code that no one uses

1135
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:33,430
is lower quality than buggy code that everyone uses.

1136
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,530
Striking that balance and getting trust

1137
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,690
and getting the guy going, no, look,

1138
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:44,910
I'm not stopping being your test guy

1139
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:46,430
because of anything with you.

1140
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,350
It's because the system is broken

1141
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:52,960
and I'm a part of that broken system.

1142
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,040
Me, this handoff between dev and test.

1143
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,920
No handoffs.

1144
00:47:58,920 --> 00:47:59,760
No.

1145
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,330
I would say no handoffs to operations either.

1146
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:05,360
I don't like handoffs.

1147
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,380
Yeah, that's a different topic for a different episode.

1148
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,640
Different topic for a different episode.

1149
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,020
So I think there's a lot more to talk about there.

1150
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:17,020
I do think that leadership and developing leadership skills

1151
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,890
and doing that via forging relationships

1152
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:24,010
versus asking someone for a top-down mandate

1153
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:27,890
is the absolute basis for establishing

1154
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,570
any sort of modern testing.

1155
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,170
I think we're gonna go into more detail

1156
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:33,650
on each of the principles.

1157
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,290
Do you wanna start that next episode?

1158
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,130
Yeah.

1159
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:37,970
Okay.

1160
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:38,810
So why don't we?

1161
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:40,770
One of the things that I'm saying,

1162
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:45,240
like leadership is a foundational basis of this.

1163
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:48,720
So we'll go into more depth on this topic

1164
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,560
as we go through the principles.

1165
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,400
We will.

1166
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,180
So just for those planning their listening schedule,

1167
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,400
one of the things Brent and I have been talking about doing

1168
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,520
and I think we'll be ready to start it

1169
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,560
with the next episode is we'll spend an episode each

1170
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:02,040
on each of the modern testing principles.

1171
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,240
Maybe two.

1172
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,440
We'll see how things go.

1173
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,680
Yeah.

1174
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,920
And just diving deep with a normal amount of tangents

1175
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,060
and fitting in some mailbags as needed.

1176
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:13,160
But one to explain to the listeners,

1177
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:16,280
as anyone who's been listening to the last 10 or more

1178
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:21,280
episodes, 20 knows, modern testing is evolving.

1179
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,940
We flush out a lot of our beliefs on modern testing

1180
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,800
as we record the podcast.

1181
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,640
So I think that's what we do.

1182
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,400
We do as well as through the mailbags and questions.

1183
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:32,920
So keep the mailbags coming,

1184
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,560
join the Slack channel, post questions there.

1185
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,200
The Slack channel is actually something

1186
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,780
that I'm extremely fond of because now

1187
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,880
people will post a question

1188
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:48,040
and some other member of the three will respond

1189
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,920
and I actually like a lot of these responses.

1190
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,240
It's grown into a self-sustaining community.

1191
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,080
It is, yeah.

1192
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,580
Which as a community leader is the ultimate goal.

1193
00:49:58,580 --> 00:49:59,900
So very proud of that.

1194
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,520
Thanks Perzy for setting that up.

1195
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,080
And thank you all three listeners

1196
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,440
for hanging out there and having the conversations.

1197
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,880
Okay, we're out of time or more.

1198
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,720
I'm Alan.

1199
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,540
I'm Brent.

1200
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,380
We'll see you next time.

1201
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:13,220
Bye.
