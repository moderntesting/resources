1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
And to be clear, when I was in college, I worked at a grocery store and I was a checker.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,310
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,750
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, Agile, and anything else

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,990
that comes to mind. Now, on with the show. Hey, hey, everybody. Hey, hey, hey.

5
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:39,390
Hey, it's AB Testing. It's AAB Testing. I was thinking Fat Albert. Hey, hey, hey.

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,540
We're doing a podcast and did you know we're doing a podcast? Are you aware of this fact?

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:56,510
Are you aware that we have a podcast? I just call in. What are we on? 167. So we've been doing this

8
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:03,150
podcast. Here is the question of the day, a little podcast trivia. And you can play along at home.

9
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:10,460
Just open your favorite podcast app and put in this code. What was the date that we posted

10
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:19,740
episode one of AAB Testing? Wasn't that April? April something April 1st.

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:32,610
What year? Oh, God, I have no idea. April 13th, 2014. Okay. We are coming up. We're six months

12
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,230
away from our nine year anniversary. Not too bad for two people who started a podcast for

13
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:46,670
really almost on a dare from Michael Hunter, right? Yeah. I don't know if it was a dare.

14
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,510
You guys should make a podcast. We're dumb enough to go. Um, sure.

15
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,030
I interpreted it a little bit differently. He could have said you guys should stick your

16
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:04,990
finger in a light socket. We would have gone. Um, yeah, sounds great. You might've. So I might've

17
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:10,770
because I'm not particularly bright, but what's interesting. And I want to do a little meta and

18
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,450
talk about the podcast a little bit here today. I was in a meeting today with some folks,

19
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:23,090
external to unity and with some folks internal to unity and, and almost all the time I'm finding

20
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:30,290
more and more stalkers and you know who you are. It's like the podcast was a different thing when

21
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,330
everybody who listened was an anonymous human being. We didn't know. Remember when we had three

22
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,580
listeners and like Jim Moore would come up and say, Hey, I'm one of your three listeners.

23
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,900
And Steve would say, I'm one of your three listeners and we only have three listeners,

24
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:51,040
but yeah. Okay. Good. Anyway. The point I was getting to was as you type away on your keyboard

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,600
is that these folks in this meeting are like, Oh, Hey man, you know, Alan was a podcast.

26
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,280
They listened to the podcast. So hi, Wyatt, hi, John. Hi, Stephen. I,

27
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:08,130
and anybody else is listening. It's not a very good podcast. I guess it is an excellent example

28
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:16,210
of the, this is no 98% invisible. Now it's the Malcolm Gladwell. Stop. This is an excellent

29
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:25,650
example of a podcast for the genre we invented. What's the genre? I'm leaving that for the

30
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:33,570
listeners. Oh, you know, actually we are the number one podcast of all time in our genre as well.

31
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:42,450
Absolutely. I completely agree. I'm, I'm picking up what you're laying down. So I switched to

32
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:47,090
anchor FM for hosting, which has been really good. And this, I'm not, I could do ads for anchor and

33
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,050
they pay us, but I don't, you know, uh, but anchor has been pretty good. There's your ad anchor.

34
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,970
If you're grepping text in our podcast, but they keep stats much better than my previous

35
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,250
platforms I used. Do you know? So it's been less than a year. It was last January. I

36
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,170
changed everything over to anchor and screwed up everybody's feeds and got it all correct again.

37
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,730
Guess how many another Japanese question. Another is on your quiz app. Everybody

38
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,450
guess how many people in that last year have gone back to listen to episode number one and

39
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:29,660
made it through the vast majority of it. Three. Oh, that what's weird. It could,

40
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:38,940
it could be the same three people each doing it 254 times because we have 700 or two wrong math.

41
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,860
You know, we have 712 listens of episode one in that last year. I don't know what you people

42
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:51,180
are doing. That is, uh, even though even its debut episode was still the top of our genre,

43
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,460
it was not even meh. It was, it was Brenton Allen trying to figure out how equipment work,

44
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,900
trying to figure out what to talk about, which is kind of what we're doing here. Eight and a half

45
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:06,880
years later. Yeah. You know, when you, when you master a skill, you make it part of the

46
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:15,280
environment and we'll call it the dark genre as well. But we've made it very clear on this

47
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,560
podcast and specializing generalists that I'm really a master of nothing. My secret skill

48
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,240
is I can learn enough of anything to be super effective, but I'm not a master of anything.

49
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:39,600
I will say your secret power in this context. And I do not, I do think that this phrase very well

50
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,960
captures it. And I do not in any way, shape, or form mean any offense. This is nothing but praise.

51
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,720
Right. You are the master of fake it till you make it. Oh, 100%. That is, you know, maybe that's how

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,160
we work together. So I was thinking about how different you and I are. Like I was making,

53
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,520
they're asking about the podcast and I, and someone brought up the fact we're talking about

54
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,640
politics sometimes. And I said, yeah, Brent's one of those stupid libertarians who let his political

55
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,480
views get in the way of actually making progress in the country. But we'll get, we'll get back

56
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,510
to that later. But also in this context, you know, Brent said, you're number one, number one of my

57
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:28,510
genre. That's great. So you have, you are a deeper expert in the areas where you need to be like,

58
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,910
you were deep in test automation and wrote a, a very good and probably one of the best

59
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:43,790
test automation harnesses used at Microsoft. Both a praise and a dig. Also what you're doing now with

60
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,030
data science and it's, it's super deep, what you know, and I'm more of a, I mean, you've seen me,

61
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,510
I can get around in the data science world and, but I faked everything, but it's, it's even

62
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:59,970
before I got into tech, that was my thing. I played in high school. I played clarinet and

63
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,490
saxophone. I did not want to bring my nice saxophone outside to play in the marching band.

64
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,810
So I learned how to play drums well enough to make the drum line in my high school. So then

65
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,130
I played drums and drum core, I played drums in college, college marching band. I even,

66
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:22,450
I did not know that. So here's the funny part. Not only did I do that, and then I played, I

67
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,880
played percussion. I made the top jazz band playing vibraphone vibes.

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,440
If you like those are. Is that the cool thing that they use to make the

69
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Star Trek sound? It's like, no, no, no, that's a theremin. It's like a xylophone,

70
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:44,720
but metal wider keys, two octaves or one octave below often use in jazz. So a big fan of Gary

71
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,520
Burton for those of you want to dig in there. So I, I wanted to do it. It was actually easier path.

72
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,360
There was an easier path to me to get in the top touring jazz band playing mallet percussion

73
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,560
than it was for me to get in the long, long line of saxophones. So I did that for a while.

74
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,160
And then here's the funny part. I went out and everybody knows this that I taught school for

75
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,820
four years after I graduated. I came back to graduate school. You know, it was, I went back

76
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,540
to graduate school at the same school. They knew me, but we had a new percussion director who was

77
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:20,380
just fantastic. And in graduate school, I studied composition. I did not have to play an instrument,

78
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:28,290
but it was, I needed a place to like get people to play my composition. So I, so I lied a little,

79
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,090
what did I do? I don't know if I lied. I, I told them I was a percussionist and I joined,

80
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,730
and I joined the percussion department and I studied private lessons under not the grad assistant,

81
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,130
which all the, the noobs had to take underneath the professor. And I played in the, he put me

82
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,890
in the top percussion ensemble, assuming I knew what I was doing. And I absolutely faked it

83
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:52,370
until I make it. I remember him giving me a timpani solo. You want to tip, you know,

84
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,410
a timpani or like kettle drums. Yeah. They're cool. Yeah. But they're, they're tuned with your,

85
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,450
there's pedals that tune them and they're not easy to tune. There's a lot of ear in there and

86
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,050
a lot of like feel. And I just, you know, I practiced till I could do it. And I, I nailed

87
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,690
my timpani parts. I ended up playing timpani in our top orchestra as well. And just, I didn't

88
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,050
know what I was doing. I was faking my way through it. So that was my, so I faked my way through there,

89
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:24,370
but even, yeah, my whole life I have, I do like, if I want to do something, I'll learn just enough

90
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,330
so I can do it. And that's, um, until I'm not good enough to do that anymore. And then I do

91
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:37,650
something else. That's my thing. Yeah. I just wrote down five letters, J I T G E just to see if

92
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:46,590
it spells something cool because you are just in time good enough. Yeah, absolutely. To me.

93
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:56,480
So I'm a, I'm a believer in faking till you make it the problem. One of the things I think that is

94
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:06,050
different than you and I on that front is we both have sort of imposter syndrome.

95
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:15,500
I, you're in my way of resolving it is fundamentally different. And I'm trying to, like for me, I go to

96
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,540
an analytical space. I say, okay, I need to know this. So I'm going to frigging know it.

97
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:29,420
And I, in my quest for that knowledge, just to, just to alleviate the fear I have a random

98
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:37,060
imposter syndrome. I go, I definitely go deeper than, than you do. I don't have a solid sense of

99
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:42,340
good enough when I'm in that phase when I'm, when I'm running from my imposter syndrome fear.

100
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,460
Honestly, I think it is. And this is, you know, I don't mean this demeaning to myself or praising

101
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:51,540
to you, but it was a different, we have a different kind of intelligence or smartness.

102
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:58,830
You're able to go deeper. I get to a point where there are vastly diminishing returns on

103
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:04,590
me going deeper. I am, I am much better knowing a lot about a little than I am knowing a little

104
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,070
about a lot. And there are some things, obviously music, cause I faked it so long there. I know

105
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,230
some things about the same thing with, with computers and debugging and some of the areas

106
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:21,520
I've dug into, but I think the way I'm wired, I'm better suited to just to what I do.

107
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,080
I do what I do. Cause it's what I'm best at. This J I T G E is,

108
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:34,320
is the way for me to be the most effective in anything I'm doing. And I don't, I don't,

109
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,970
I just don't think I'm just build up more clearly. I don't know if I have the mental capacity to go

110
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:46,690
as deep as you do on some things. Well, uh, I don't know that that's true or not.

111
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,810
Cause I think I don't mean it's self demeaning. I kind of mean like I just,

112
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,690
I think it's the way it is.

113
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:58,130
Maybe, maybe. I mean, there's other, uh, there's other commonalities we do share,

114
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:04,580
right? We both, I would say we are both more starters than, than

115
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,740
closers in a lot of regards. You are a better closer than I am for certain.

116
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,900
And maybe that's why you were driven by good enough. It's like, okay, I, uh, you, you got

117
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:24,220
to close. Um, whereas I'm like, no, I got to figure out how to defer closure. Cause there's not enough.

118
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:33,090
None of here to make my imposter syndrome go away. But we, we are both fascinated by the new,

119
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:39,890
very interested by the new, right? Like, even though you and I are discussing our differences,

120
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:46,930
it doesn't, doesn't at all alleviate that we are, I don't know if there's a term for this, but

121
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,090
from a technical standpoint, ADHD written. Let me talk about the new because let's see if our

122
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:58,050
approach to the new is different. Cause I believe that I have read, you know, I read a lot of books

123
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,490
and when I'm in a groove, I'll read a book every two weeks and digital cover to cover,

124
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,090
but I probably have 50 books I've read half of because I get halfway through and I feel like I

125
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:15,890
have learned everything. I w I'm fascinated in chapter one. I am pattern matching the hell out

126
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:22,050
of chapters two through 10. And then I'm kind of done. Cause I figured out how to incorporate it.

127
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,850
So when I get a new idea, whether it's from a book or a video or a lecture or wherever,

128
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:33,730
I want to learn it well enough to understand if it fits within the other patterns that I know

129
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,970
and how to connect it. And once I get it there, though, I'm kind of done with it.

130
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:49,440
I have a similar collection of books and I'll say 50 of them. Well, so if we assume a subset of 50,

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:59,600
I would say 50% of them, I have at least finished chapter one. I'll say easily 25% of that 50,

132
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:06,560
other than opening the book to go, Oh, my book came. That's all I've done with it. And then

133
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:15,650
the other 25%, right? I'm still multitasking and working my way through it. Yeah. It's when I

134
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:23,170
collect books, I do it from a, usually I do it from, I have a very tactical problem that I'm trying to

135
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:31,940
solve. And I'm like, I think this thing is, is going to, to help fix it. I used to, my daughter

136
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:39,460
and I were talking about this, so I used to be a big sci-fi reader. And ever since shifting to data

137
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:49,860
science, I haven't, I haven't read just to read in forever. Stephen Johnson books, those are sort

138
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:57,780
of the last ones that I would read to sort of understand certain concepts better. Like where idea,

139
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,500
so we've talked about this before on the, in strength finders, I have ideation where ID

140
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:13,840
ideas come from is absolutely fascinating to me. And strength, the strength finders thing

141
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:21,150
very much indicates that the more you, that it's not a attribute of me, it's something that it's a

142
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:27,220
skill, it's something I can develop and take advantage of. And I do. Yeah, so that's sort

143
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:34,740
of in personal development. I see you reading things from my perspective. Some of the things you read

144
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,620
are just, I just go, that's randomly random. It doesn't, let me talk about what I'm doing.

145
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:46,900
So I have, let me go back to the first time I was a people manager and in hindsight, I didn't know

146
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,780
what I was doing. I was like, look, look at me. I'm not a micromanager because I'm giving people no

147
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:57,700
coaching, no guidance. I'm leaving them alone so I can do my own IC work and we'll talk when we

148
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,110
have time. Not very good. I didn't know, I didn't get people nearly enough feedback, good and bad.

149
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,310
I was lucky to have a good team. So we performed well. So if you look at how the team, if you

150
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:13,470
look at as a manager's reflection of the team doing well, I looked good because my team was

151
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:17,870
doing well because we had hired well. Then I struggled the first time I had employees who

152
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,950
weren't delivering and maybe I didn't realize they were delivering because I wasn't paying

153
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,430
attention. So I learned a lot. And then, so talking about running away from imposter syndrome. So now

154
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:34,270
I have a bank. Like I have a bank of knowledge I use to lead my team, to manage people, to

155
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,270
influence people, to make decisions, to build strategies, et cetera. I have a bank of knowledge

156
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:46,190
in my head, which has come from both a practice on the job training or on the job practice and

157
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:52,670
reading a bunch of books. So all the time I am looking at when I see a book or hear about a book,

158
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,760
or if I hear a review of a book, because I listen to so many damn podcasts, I hear people talk about

159
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:06,480
books. I will consider like, can this book bring new knowledge into my new knowledge,

160
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,280
into my body of knowledge? So my goal in all these books I'm reading is I want to think about

161
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,200
the pattern matching. I want to read this book and figure out, can I pattern match this? Does this

162
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,600
change? Does this change my body of knowledge? Does it make me make a fundamental like,

163
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,360
oh, I was looking at this wrong. Does it emphasize things I'm doing that maybe I want to do more of?

164
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,480
Like I, there's a psychological fallacy for this I'm sure, but the books that preach to what I

165
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,840
already do, I nod my head and go, wow, this is a great book because I already do this stuff.

166
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,400
I must be awesome. But still you get ideas on how to influence things. You get those anecdotes

167
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,940
you can tell to help, to help with all of those problems. So I'm just trying to add to my body of

168
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:51,820
knowledge and I ignore all the rest. So I talked about when I get halfway through sometimes,

169
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,660
and not all books are like this, but sometimes I get halfway through and it's like, well, I don't,

170
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,940
I've read last three or four chapters and found no new knowledge to incorporate. So I go and tell

171
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,700
my ROI on reading the book has faded. And that hasn't happened in a while. I've been reading a

172
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,500
lot of books all the way through lately, but I've been slowing down because work's been super busy

173
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,300
and gross and all that stuff. But that's sort of my approach. I'm trying to add to my knowledge,

174
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:25,260
bring in as much as I can to help me just get my, I was trying to like you and I the same,

175
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,740
trying to get better at what we do and it's incremental. But I always feel like there's

176
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,860
got to be one nugget that's going to help me do just a little bit better next week.

177
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,820
Because that's what I'm searching for. Yeah, I am constantly, I pay attention to

178
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,880
how do I stay in a leadership position in the things that I'm doing, but I'm also paying

179
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:58,850
attention to the next transition. Right. We've talked about this. So my role is a data science

180
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:05,810
and I do believe we're at the end of the data science era and it converts into a primary

181
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:16,530
dev role sometime before I retire. Right. And so I feel like, okay, while I'm working, I'm beholden

182
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:24,610
to number one, improve myself there and then guide my team in that direction. Right. And they

183
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:30,770
kind of benefit each other because then I'm leading by example as well as, you know, coaching and

184
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:37,730
guiding. Now the other difference is you're now a highfalutin executive and I'm still frontline.

185
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:47,940
So you're going to be probably guiding your directs more on the strategic sense and how to set good

186
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,420
principles. Yeah. And no, maybe. Yeah, you know, absolutely right. I am much more management

187
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:59,740
overhead, but also even, you know, when I was frontline, like my main objective,

188
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,620
and we've talked about this before on the podcast drink still in this role is, and one of the reasons

189
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:13,980
it's so challenging is I'm still trying to make myself obsolete. And this is a fun part. Never been

190
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,580
in this position before as, you know, really purely a manager and, you know, working across

191
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:26,220
the company, my entire role is to take my nine direct reports and make it so they can all

192
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,020
function completely without me. Let me give you an example. Well, that part makes it. It's not an

193
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:37,970
example. Let me give you an anecdote. I took last week, last week, oh God, we didn't talk about our

194
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,890
stuff. So last week I flew, which is a red eye Saturday night, a week ago, but no, it was two

195
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,690
weeks ago. I took a red eye from Seattle to Detroit and then flew from Detroit to Buffalo,

196
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,290
hung out with my kid for about six hours, went back to the airport, flew back to Detroit,

197
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,290
flew from Detroit up to Montreal, spent Monday, Tuesday, half day, Wednesday in Montreal.

198
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:00,860
Flew back to Detroit, back to Seattle. And I worked on Thursday.

199
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,980
Oh my God. That's so exhausting. All that, I did not catch COVID. Pretty exhausting. A lot of work.

200
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:11,820
It was necessary for me to spend a little time there and see some people. But one of my directs

201
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,500
pinged me and said, do you have time to talk to it? I said, okay, yeah, totally. Always have time.

202
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,780
And they said something to the effect of, I know we don't, because I cancelled all my one-on-ones

203
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,460
because I was traveling for that week. I took a week off from one-on-ones. And they said,

204
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,460
I'm so glad you found time. It's really hard, but I don't have a chance to check in with you every

205
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:35,340
week. And while I think the one-on-one is the most important meeting you can do,

206
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,860
that is a little bit of a yellow flag for me. I have to get, I think, I don't want that to be

207
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:50,080
the case. I want people to feel like they have the courage, autonomy, confidence to execute

208
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,920
without checking in with me regularly. Yeah, it does feel a little codependency-ish.

209
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:08,320
Well, it's not COVID. It's coaching. More coaching I need to do. It tells me I'm not obsolete yet,

210
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,520
so I'm still working. I got a ways to go. And I need all the skills and tips and tricks I can get

211
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:22,480
to get there. Yeah, I have similar phenomenon. Meanwhile, there's always rumors of, okay,

212
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,880
I'm making some progress and they go, oh, Alan, your org is good. Can we put some more teams in

213
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:39,580
your org? I go, no. Who are these people who get to define good? So before we get off even further

214
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,020
into whatever agenda we're actually talking about. No, the agenda is this winding road. For

215
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:50,860
those of you on the first time, welcome to the AB testing podcast where you learn what we're saying

216
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:58,700
pretty much the same time we are. It's not going to publish. It's, yeah, extra, especially

217
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,380
tangential episode. I know some podcasts have like a title and agenda before they start. Like,

218
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,660
imagine that. I feel like we used to function that way and then we don't, but this is kind of,

219
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,140
oh, by the way, today is international podcast day, which is why I wanted to take some more

220
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:20,500
time to talk about the podcast itself. That's there. There's the agenda. Anyway, you were saying,

221
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:29,740
oh, gotcha. Usually segues happen first, but you know, innovation is coming from Alan today.

222
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,740
Watch me magically edit this entire podcast coherent.

223
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:40,940
Yeah, you don't have the time for that. No, I don't. And you, I don't know, like you,

224
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,220
there was a time when you would listen to the podcast with your, with your son in the car,

225
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,100
but I think your sons are older now. They don't ride in the car with you anymore.

226
00:23:49,660 --> 00:24:00,780
Uh, they don't, they don't. My daughter does still, you know, very often, but she is now at a point

227
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:08,540
where appropriately, uh, she doesn't want to listen to the podcast. Right. One of the things I'll

228
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:15,420
bring up, like I had not one of the three. Got it. She is not one of the three. Uh, my oldest

229
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:22,780
still was, uh, for a while in college, just, I guess, cause you know, he missed dad or something.

230
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,180
It's a way of checking on you to make sure you're not talking about him.

231
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,900
Right. But I encountered something that you've been dealing with for a long time. I encountered

232
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:46,640
it for the very first time. Um, on August 1st, I met my new employee who started off with,

233
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,790
I'm one of the three. No shit. And I'm like, what? Why?

234
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,350
Do you really not have anything better to do with your time?

235
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:07,310
Yeah. So it was my first day meeting her. So I didn't want to go into incessant mocking on the

236
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,070
first day, you know, good impressions and all that. You gotta work, you gotta build a relationship

237
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:17,390
where you can mock each other. Yeah. Right. Um, but I'm like, dear God, why?

238
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,470
Right. And that is my reaction to what I, today, when I heard these people say,

239
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,630
Oh, you should have got Alan's podcast. Alan is a podcast. And they're like, Oh God, no.

240
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:34,830
Anyway, go on. So the reason why is she, she knew person straight out of college,

241
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:42,110
was hoping to get some Intel on the manager. Right. And the title of the podcast is A B

242
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:48,750
testing. She's coming into a data science role. I see. Did she ask you? So I listened to your

243
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:55,550
podcast and it kind of sucks. What's your data behind continuing to do it? I had my one on one

244
00:25:55,550 --> 00:26:03,570
with her literally an hour ago for this week. Uh, I may, I may need to bring up questions like that,

245
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:13,580
next time. Is it just basically seriously why like, it's almost to my mind, it almost should be

246
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:20,140
an interview question. Do you listen to the A B testing podcast? Yes. Oh, sorry. Yeah.

247
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,820
That's not, no, you need to make it a behavioral question.

248
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,260
Tell me about a time you listened to the A B testing podcast.

249
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,460
I wonder, I'm just putting myself in, into the threes shoes right now. And they're like,

250
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,900
what the hell? They're just spending the last 10 minutes bashing their own podcast.

251
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,940
To be fair, I mean, look, it is no 98% invisible. Like I said before,

252
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,940
but it is number one in this genre. It is number one in this genre. And,

253
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:57,260
what is that genre? What do we, it's, is the genre, it's something like two dudes talking

254
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:00,540
while they're drinking beer, even though I think we're both drinking coffee right now.

255
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:09,680
I have a Coke. Yeah. And we've only actually drunk anything adult beverage once.

256
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah. On my very last day at Microsoft. But that was a good adult beverage.

257
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,080
That was, that was an excellent adult beverage. So, uh, here I am, do you know,

258
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,880
and just to get an idea how time flies on the podcast and I should go look up what episode that

259
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:32,400
was. I think for sure, for sure. We have done more episodes with me, not at Microsoft than we have at

260
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:40,540
Microsoft for sure. I have been at unity now five years and seven months and the podcast is about

261
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:46,380
eight and a half years old. Doesn't that blow your mind a little bit? But when I think about

262
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,740
years in time, I try and anchor it to things, which has been really hard over the last two

263
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,260
and a half years. I've lost all my anchors. Like if the pandemic could have began three months ago,

264
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:00,780
it's all just kind of a blur or 10 years ago. But anyway, yeah, it does blow my mind. Been

265
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:07,200
here a long time. Still liking it. Yeah. Yeah. It's challenging. I, I tell, I, I need to tell

266
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,680
myself the same time, the same thing I tell people on my team. If it was easy, it wouldn't

267
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:23,060
be fun. Right. And that's absolutely true. Although the corollary, the corollary is true too,

268
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:34,000
I think that if it's not easy, then it better be fun. Well, oh, I ran into tangents. I keep on

269
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,320
running into people I knew in a past life. I found one of my skip levels worked on teams.

270
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,770
He joined after I left. I thought that was kind of funny. Oh, and then I found somebody else who

271
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:51,330
just met in the office in the day. They used to work on, they remember me from Xbox and I,

272
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,930
I had forgotten who they were. Yeah. We're, we're at that age too. No kidding, right?

273
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:04,160
They're, they're all the time now actually with COVID. So the other thing that's happening

274
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,260
is I'm doing with COVID, you do end up doing a lot of presentations online and you have no

275
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,900
like, you don't even see the audience list on teams a lot of the time, right? Because it's,

276
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,220
it's, it's like 70 people and you, you just see like the three that had their hands raised.

277
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,500
You don't have, does teams not have like a gallery view where you can see everybody?

278
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:35,180
They do. Because like when I do a team meeting, I use gallery view so I can see people's like,

279
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,860
I can, these days I'm getting good at, I can zoom in on facial reactions. I can say,

280
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,300
Hey Lance, you're making a face. What's up? Do you actually have a guy named Lance on your team?

281
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:51,900
I do. And I'm probably listening right now. Sorry, just pick, just pick the name.

282
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:58,380
The, uh, you're talking about teams and lectures. So that's the subject I want to talk about,

283
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,820
but go ahead. The point I was bringing up is, is it's often the case someone will come up

284
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:11,970
and it will go, Oh, Hey Brent. And then I'll look at them and I'll go

285
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:20,610
and they don't have a mask on, which, and I'll still go, Hey person,

286
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:27,410
based off of your reaction, I should probably know, but have no idea why you know my name.

287
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,210
It is difficult to match from the 2d world to the 3d world. But I was in Montreal two weeks

288
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,530
ago. I had a lot of that and people both that I had been on my team. I never met in person to

289
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,970
people I knew that I had seen before in the 3d world is a lot of people said, Oh, Hey, Alan.

290
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,370
And of course I have this, um, uh, small beard makes me more recognizable, but like,

291
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,710
they're there. I just, a lot of that. Well, it depends. Like if, if you, uh,

292
00:30:53,710 --> 00:31:00,030
if you go and search for you on, on the interwebs, right? You find the football

293
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:06,350
player, Supreme court justice, Alan Page. No, no, no. You, you I'm, I'm saying find you not search

294
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:12,990
for your name, but search for you. Okay. Right. You, you've had facial hair forever, but not

295
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:23,150
this glorious, uh, uh, uh, noun that you, that you're sporting. Now I could come up with a good

296
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:29,630
noun. So, uh, yeah, feeling your best Maine. Maine's a good one that you're, you're sporting now.

297
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:36,670
Yeah. It's my tribute to COVID. And a lot of the times, a lot of the times I'll go on conference

298
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:43,230
calls and I keep my camera off. And so it's a picture that I haven't updated in like 10 years.

299
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:51,310
I keep the camera off because I'm a big old fatty fat from fat Phil now. And I can't stand looking

300
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:58,670
at my camera. I, if you notice right now, I'm like backed away because then with my eyesight,

301
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:03,630
my own image kind of just blurs out and for you, I can just stare at you.

302
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:08,270
All right. And that is a beautiful thing to look at. So, um, I know originally when we talked three

303
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,830
weeks ago, I took last week off, but we talked three weeks ago, uh, we were going to talk about

304
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:18,430
how someone goes from testing into a more experimentation role and we may get there today,

305
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,590
but I do have one more question now that we're on the subject of, let me talk about podcasts.

306
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,590
And this is not the normal AB testing, but what the hell we can do. We want. It's our podcast.

307
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:34,100
I heard a podcast and again, adding to my knowledge and a lot of times what happens is

308
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,780
I'll get an idea and I want to experiment with it. So I heard an interview with a leader at

309
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:45,780
Doest and Doest is the company that makes a to doist, which I'm a big user of for task

310
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:53,570
tracking. And they also make a, um, sort of a Slack teams like app called, uh, twist,

311
00:32:53,570 --> 00:33:01,730
which I'll come back to in a minute. They are just 90 people in 30 countries and which is,

312
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,850
you know, a little unity, like we're pretty spread out. And I was talking to somebody this week,

313
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,690
you know, Microsoft is actually talking to one of these folks, he used to work at Microsoft in

314
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,170
the Vancouver office. I have one of those on my team and Microsoft. I don't think you can argue

315
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,170
with this brand. It's very Redmond culture that maybe it's different from what I've been there,

316
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,970
but very Redmond culture, 90% of the companies in Redmond. If you're not in Redmond, it's kind of

317
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,250
it's common knowledge. At least it used to be, it's harder to get promoted, harder to make,

318
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:31,090
you know, influences the, the, it's a very Redmond culture.

319
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:41,340
Um, I will say, yes, that is still probably true, but it's, it's far different.

320
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:44,940
Yeah. I imagine, I imagine skinny, but you're getting more global. And I was thinking about,

321
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,380
well, where I work at unity, we're not definitely not every third person in a different country,

322
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:58,460
but our, our headquarters isn't even our largest office. So, uh, so that, but it's a little,

323
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:05,010
it's a lot more the same ever, but anyway, do as, uh, because they're global and we're global too.

324
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,050
And you know, I have people spanning 10 time zones. Actually, if I don't count my teams in

325
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:15,970
APAC, nothing against people in APAC, I'm just limited hours in the day, lots of time zones,

326
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:26,140
but doest do almost everything asynchronously. And it made me think like, what am I doing? How,

327
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:31,980
one thing we haven't learned, I'm curious if you've got any tips or tricks on this is as a company,

328
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:39,580
we're not great at working asynchronously. And I want to get better at it. So I started reading

329
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,620
more of their article. They have great articles on doest.com on, on how they've learned to work

330
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,580
asynchronously things they do. And some of them are kind of out there, but it's like even their

331
00:34:49,580 --> 00:35:00,850
CEO has like four meetings a week. Okay. I'm listening. Right. The, the, if this,

332
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:14,260
my problem with asynchronously is I do not, I do not yet know of a good technique to work asynchronously

333
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:27,540
and still build a, a strong team. Right. And so, so as you know, from like my discussions with

334
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,300
Colossal and things like that, what I, what I work towards is not making a team of rock stars,

335
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:39,570
but a rock star team. And if this book can, can solve both of those things, like,

336
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:45,780
yeah, well, there's no book. There was a block or there was a podcast that I listened to and I then

337
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:52,020
started reading articles from the company. And so there's no book. And also you're absolutely

338
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,020
right on the relationship building and the team building, it accelerates so many things.

339
00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,220
It's like you got to get people to the whole team together for a week and then they can work

340
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:06,450
apart asynchronously for a while and be pretty successful. It is really hard to do it off the

341
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,330
bat. It takes, I think it takes some discipline and practice. And one of the reasons they built.

342
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:17,460
So actually this is something teams is better at than Slack. Oh my God. Did I say that

343
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,580
is, uh, if you remember way back in the day, um, I worked on teams, um, we had threading built in

344
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:32,100
Slack said, Oh, threads may be convenient and sort of, they added threads, but they're really lame

345
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:39,380
threads in Slack or lame. So, so what really bugs me is in Slack, somebody makes a post and sometimes

346
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:45,470
there are comments and reactions or, um, questions to that in the main channel and some are on a

347
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,390
thread and they get intermingled with other messages. It's very confusing. So they built,

348
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:57,150
it wasn't working for them. And so they built twist, which is just yet another messaging only

349
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:02,270
pla it's messaging only platform, but it's threaded by default. So it's the old style.

350
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:06,430
If here's a post and you make comments on that post, you don't make another post to reply to it

351
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:11,630
just to kind of force people down that path. And they use these threads to work asynchronously.

352
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:18,590
So it is possible. Uh, you got to get people engaged on it. A lot of times people,

353
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,390
yeah. If you don't get them in that meeting to draw them out, it's hard,

354
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,030
especially if they don't know you, there's that level of trust involved.

355
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,750
I think it takes a ton of work. So kudos to them if they're working asynchronously.

356
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:33,070
It's you can't just say we're going to work asynchronously now and have it work.

357
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:41,710
No, it is a battle. No, because there's, there has to be something that is

358
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:50,460
guiding what gets done next. What, what direction are we heading? Do we adapt, persevere? Like that,

359
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:58,220
that just going straight up all async from an intellectual point of view. It's fun to think about.

360
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,740
Well, let me talk about a couple of things I'm going to do after reading all this stuff.

361
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,660
One is I'm still going to do all my one-on-ones. They do async one-on-ones. I need

362
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:15,020
the FaceTime, but how many, I'm going to ask you this. How many times in your one-on-one

363
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,340
does your direct report ask you a bunch of questions or give you a bunch of information

364
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,740
that didn't have to be in the one-on-one? It could have been in a team's message or an email.

365
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:31,950
Oh, 50 to 80 percent of the time.

366
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:37,390
More than would be more than is necessary. And that to me, that cuts down on the time we could

367
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,270
talk about career, earlier before we talked about career growth and strategy and working

368
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:48,910
with them on that. So one thing I'm going to do is make sure we have a shared channel so we can have

369
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,180
discuss more of those tactical things asynchronously, those little check-in things.

370
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,540
Like what do you think about this? I want to do that. I don't want to take our one-on-one

371
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:03,220
time to do that. I want to take our one-on-one time to talk about how I can help them grow

372
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,460
enough where I can be obsolete. That's my goal in the one-on-one. And if I have to check in on,

373
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,300
hey, what do you think I should do with this hiring thing? I don't want to just ask me elsewhere.

374
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:16,020
So that's one thing. So there's a little tweaky adjustment I can make. I can add some async and

375
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:20,260
keep the relationship building part. Well, that's where I think the coaching habit works well.

376
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:26,260
Yes, absolutely. And that's the kind of, that's what I want. I would like 90 to 100 percent of my

377
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,620
one-on-one time to be coaching and take care of the other stuff. Async. So that's one thing

378
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,140
I'm going to do. The other thing is I should probably glance up my calendar for a second,

379
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:40,180
which is. Are you writing these down? Because it seems like you're proactively writing up your

380
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:47,620
New Year's resolutions. No, I don't do resolutions. Oh, gotcha. Okay. So the other thing is that a lot

381
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:52,820
of meetings I'm moving to from, I don't know how it is with you. I know that Microsoft, a lot of

382
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:58,660
the meetings weren't very useful where I'm at now. Most of my meetings are, but I'm actively

383
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,340
moving 60 minute meetings to 30 minute meetings. All of my 30 minute meetings right now appear to

384
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,980
be one-on-ones looking at my calendar. Anyway, just looking for things like,

385
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:14,530
there's a meeting coming up on Monday. I'm not going to name the meeting or the group it's with,

386
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,010
but it is a monthly meeting that is constantly a meeting that should be an email.

387
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:24,850
And if I gave some feedback after the last one, and if it happens again,

388
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:32,500
I will do something. I'm not going to tolerate it anymore. My time's too valuable and not like I'm

389
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:40,180
like, Oh, my time's too valuable. I need some, I got to eat my caviar at 830. I'm tired of meetings.

390
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:47,700
No, I actually, that's an interesting topic because one of the things, so I have two

391
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,780
newly minted principles working for me.

392
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:03,780
It is nice, but so I'm trying to help them adapt to what that role means. Because when you switch

393
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,220
bands, it's very common for people to initially start off with, Oh, it's the same thing as the

394
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:16,340
other band, just more. And new, no, it's not. And they're like, what? Yeah, no, it's not. And

395
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,740
walking them through it. And one of the things that I've been trying to get them to understand,

396
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:36,240
and I haven't, you kind of touched on it. It's like, look, I want you to be allergic to being,

397
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,480
to spending your time on things that a significantly lower level person can do

398
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:53,570
competently. Right. That is not, there is no ROI for your time on that.

399
00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:00,530
But Brent, what if as your principal, I can do it twice as fast as the more junior level person?

400
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:10,690
Well, then if it is something like there's a live site where I need the fire put out,

401
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:17,810
then it might be the right call. But if it's something that's repeated, then actually,

402
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:26,050
you are not helping me grow these lower level folks. Yeah, exactly. Right. And I do put it on them.

403
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:32,370
Like, look, whether you wanted the job or not, you're now a principal and people are looking and

404
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:40,460
watching and you are leading by example. And I want that example to be something when you look back

405
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:51,340
on it, you go, oh, I am proud of what I did there. Right. It's not around being a dick and say,

406
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:58,700
do you? Right. No, I'm not doing that. Let's say you're talking to a PM or something. Like I talk to

407
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:05,660
lower level PMs all the time and they're like, okay, great. Can you do this? This query for me?

408
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:19,500
Mm, good. I can. Not gonna. Right. If like with in particular with PMs, my strategy is

409
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:27,500
so far until I can't scale. Anyone who wants to learn to fish come to me, I will spend the time

410
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,020
and I will teach you to fish. But if you're coming to me thinking I'm the fish welfare department,

411
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,720
yeah, you're wrong. Go away. Yeah. So actually this reminds me as we as we spin our web through

412
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,760
tangentville, you took a little bit of shit. We had an incident with one of our internal systems

413
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,800
two weeks ago and I spent some time in the incident channel helping to debug because

414
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,280
debugging is one of the things that I got good enough that I I'm pretty good at.

415
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,900
I think somebody gave me some crap or like as a as you call me, the uppity exact.

416
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:05,460
Is it really a good use of your time to spend time looking at this incident and actually

417
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,600
given it was mission critical? Yeah, yeah, I can spend some time there poking around. It's

418
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:13,920
all right. Yeah. Yeah. But regularly I don't want to do that. I shouldn't be in every incident

419
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,980
helping them debug. That would be dumb. No, it it's it's it's a good it's a good thing to get

420
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,620
your hands dirty on things like that every so often so that you can you can get a sense of

421
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:35,140
why can't someone lower level? Yeah, figure this out. Let's rewind the stack once. So I'm going to

422
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,460
I'm committing to not making a resolution. I'm going to make my one on ones better by having

423
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:48,500
more async communication with my direct reports. I am going to again, this is just I'm looking at

424
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,060
information is what I do. I take a bunch of information in I figure out how much is practical

425
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:58,660
to incorporate with or to experiment in the current way I do things. I want to encourage

426
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,300
more async work. I want to encourage more communication. Sometimes it's a European to

427
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,500
America handoff. I don't know how do I get those conversations to happen? I don't know

428
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,980
getting discussion or we don't really have discussion meetings, but getting

429
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,460
a check in meeting or need to make a decision to get those to happen faster.

430
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:22,000
I think 90 percent of 60 minute meetings can be done in 30 minutes. I think probably a lot of

431
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,600
30 minute meetings can be done in 15 minutes. Let me go. Can I tell you one thing that bugs

432
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:32,830
the hell out of me is when we are in a 60 minute meeting or a 30 minute meeting, I don't care,

433
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:39,970
a long meeting and we get down to five minutes left and we're done and some buddy running the

434
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:45,040
meeting says, okay, we have five minutes left. What should we talk about that? Does that happen

435
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:52,000
to you all the time? That's how the that's how the meeting gets converted from

436
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,840
ending early to going a half hour over. Oh my god. Why do people do that? I like I try and make a

437
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:01,600
practice of it like I have I have employees to do this too and I give them feedback.

438
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:07,360
If there is a minute left, you do not get to say one more thing. A minute left is done. Anything in

439
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,760
five minutes. If there's a pause in the conversation with five minutes or less left,

440
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:18,580
the meeting's over, especially in the in the online world where I need a chance to go fill

441
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:25,010
up my coffee cup or my water glass or use the bathroom. That's that said, that said,

442
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:34,130
if I have five minutes left, I would rather and someone has a burning question. Why did it not come

443
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:46,140
up in the first 25 minutes? Sometimes people forget things. Right. When the I would rather them ask me

444
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:54,300
that now, then set up a whole other half hour meeting, but it's cyclical. They should be asking

445
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,460
you that question in teams or slack or whatever thing you have. But they're because we haven't

446
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,580
figured out how to work a sink because those questions don't get answered. They feel like

447
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:09,420
they have to ask you in the meeting. Right. And that's wrong. And I want that to be fixed.

448
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:16,700
That's my point as a world in technology, the fact that we have not learned, and I should say we

449
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,100
generally do rock this as well as probably many other companies. But you and I can say

450
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,100
for our respective worlds, we have not learned nearly as much about working

451
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:34,220
asynchronously in the last two and a half years as we should have in hindsight.

452
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:41,580
No, I do think there has been a lot of learning around working autonomously.

453
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:52,300
Yes. But asynchronously towards a mutually agreed valuable direction has definitely not

454
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,260
occurred in a lot of regards autonomously in that same direction has often not occurred.

455
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:07,310
Autonomous, autonomous. Yeah. Anyway, go ahead. No, I can fix that for you. So autonomy without

456
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:13,070
alignment doesn't work. If I give you autonomy to do your work, you still need to know what

457
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:19,360
problem you're trying to solve. And so what's happened is we have these meetings to try and

458
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:24,640
get alignment. We're unable to get alignment asynchronously. We use the meetings to gain

459
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,950
alignment or we don't gain alignment at all. And people work autonomously and they just work

460
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,910
on random shit because they don't have any alignment of what they're supposed to be doing.

461
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:38,930
Autonomy does not work without high alignment. Sorry. High autonomy does not work without high

462
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:47,730
alignment. Right. No. In a team environment with that. Sure. But seriously, if I'm

463
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:54,290
working by myself on something, my solo project to do whatever, I already have autonomy because

464
00:48:54,290 --> 00:49:00,400
I'm not accountable to anybody. I can do whatever the hell I want. Anyway, Async would love to hear

465
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:08,240
each of our three listeners from you on what it means to work asynchronously and how your

466
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,680
companies are doing. I would love to read much, much more about this. There's a ton of articles

467
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:17,760
from Doest. You cannot believe how many are out there. I'm sure other companies do this. I would

468
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,480
love to hear how it works. And I'm a little embarrassed that we haven't done better. That's

469
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:27,970
all. Okay, man. So I know I said this at the end of the last podcast, but really next time we

470
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:35,840
should really talk about what it takes to go from being a traditional checker, tester, whatever

471
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,870
people do, whatever they call themselves. Nobody calls themselves a checker. So why do we call

472
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:44,030
it checking versus testing? I have no idea. I guess it's because the devs keep checking,

473
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:47,470
but they're called developers, not checkers. I don't get it. Anyway, I want to talk about

474
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:55,550
how someone goes from a more typical testing role into doing experimentation or A-B testing or

475
00:49:55,550 --> 00:50:01,310
something that actually helps you understand what your customer is doing and make their lives better.

476
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:09,090
And to be clear, when I was in college, I worked at a grocery store and I was a checker.

477
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:15,570
Oh, nice. Nice. Nice. That's good. Then I left that job to become a tester.

478
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:20,370
That's a really good point. Did you do anything in between? Did you go from college,

479
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:26,770
right, into testing at Microsoft? Yeah, no, remember. Well, you may have forgotten.

480
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:32,750
So my path to Microsoft was a little unique. Oh, yes, that's right. I remember now. And then

481
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:37,900
did you ever read that book called How We Test Software at Microsoft? No, I possess it.

482
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:48,780
I possess it too. I've scanned a few things, right? It's for me because I know all of the authors.

483
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:53,660
It was kind of fun to kind of go through and say, okay, can I guess who wrote which and things?

484
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:59,660
Did I tell you about the time when I was actively looking for new jobs outside of Microsoft? And

485
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:07,820
I had a recruiter literally asking me. So on a scale of not at all to the author,

486
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,100
how we test software at Microsoft, how much do you know about testing at Microsoft?

487
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:16,270
Are you asking me? No, that was that was what I was asked. I didn't realize I was one of the

488
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:20,990
authors or the main author. Really? Is that what they said? Yeah. You're like,

489
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:29,150
um, to be clear at this point in time, 120%. Well, there I did the math. I said, well,

490
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:37,230
the other authors wrote about 70 pages each and I wrote about 270 pages. So, um, I did the math,

491
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:41,870
whatever percentage that is, that's how much I know. Plus whatever you've learned that now makes

492
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:45,870
that book. And what's funny is they didn't contact me back after that. I think my answer

493
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:51,010
was too much of a smart ass. I decided I was a Dick. Yeah. Well, it's okay, man. I ended up

494
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:56,610
with a good gig that I like. So all is good, man. All is good. Dumb things happen to all of us in

495
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:01,490
life. And we, and we, we avoid the life is all about just getting through the obstacles and

496
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:08,850
surviving. Life is an obstacle course. I completely agree. But on that last thing that you just said,

497
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:16,770
I absolutely am supportive of being your, your true self in an interview. And if they don't

498
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:23,410
call you back, that's frigging fantastic. Did I tell you about the time I interviewed at Amazon?

499
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:28,770
I decided about a quarter of the way into my second interview. There was absolutely no way

500
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:36,130
I was ever going to work there. No, you did not. And then I, I, and I, I just, that was my attitude

501
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:43,200
the rest of the day. What was that? I really convinced me. I want to work here because I

502
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,760
don't want to be here. They made me finish my day of interviews. Um, I asked a lot of

503
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,160
questions about, I kind of mocked their questions because they were, I was, I maybe didn't have a

504
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:01,600
good panel. I don't know. It was a joke. And I felt like I was inside of like a business firm more than

505
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,120
a software company. And then they actually, they, uh, called me back and said, well,

506
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,640
Hey, you weren't a good fit for this role, but we can, we'd like you to come back for a lower

507
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:18,160
level job. And I said, actually, no, I'm good. Yeah. Thank you. No, not a good, not a good fit.

508
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,480
I'm sorry, Amazon. I, I, I spend a crap ton of money with you, but you're, you're not the place

509
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:32,080
I would ever work. I'm sorry. Uh, nor, nor will I. And I too had my own, uh, I had my own experience

510
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:37,280
there and I'll just say like the, the, their bar razor, you know, do you know that? Yeah.

511
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,960
Yeah. I know all about the bar is actually, I should say Amazon's a big company. There could

512
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:46,000
be groups at Amazon that I would love working in. I just had like this experience of like, wow,

513
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,420
thank you for bringing me in because now I know I don't want to work here. This is actually very good.

514
00:53:52,370 --> 00:54:02,000
Yeah. Their bar razor had a, had a laptop that had a sticker on it that had, had F but not F

515
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,200
the full spelled out Microsoft. Oh, that's awesome. Right. And, and there, and I'm like,

516
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:17,740
interesting laptop. Right. And, and to me it was interesting because I'm like, okay,

517
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:24,700
what culture where you're, what, what can you say about the culture that, that sort of permits

518
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:30,780
profanity on laptops? It doesn't have like a, some sort of stigma against it. I mean, I'm not,

519
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:36,700
I'm not anti profanity, but I'm like, okay, that's an unusual thing about, uh, and, uh,

520
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:41,500
to me that's, that's an antithesis to the culture that I experienced in my interview.

521
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,140
But I do want to say that speaking of the bar razor, I am taking an online training course

522
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:53,900
available through, uh, unity on, uh, interviewing, which is actually excellent. And it's done by a

523
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,460
guy whose name I forget who was, I don't know if he was one of the inventors of the bar razor or

524
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:04,540
anyway, or he's involved in it at least, I don't know, but really good tips on not just tips, but

525
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:09,900
guidelines on doing good interviews. I've seen a lot of bad interviews. As you know, I wasn't as

526
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,940
appropriate at Microsoft, like a gazillion interviews. I had seen so many bad interviews. It's good to,

527
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,220
good to have a refresher. And again, it goes back to that book of, I like the books where I

528
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,740
nod my head all the way through. So I'm, I'm watching this training and kind of nodding my

529
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:27,660
head all the way through. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is good stuff. More people, more people should,

530
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:32,940
should watch this anyway, man. I don't think anybody's still listening because, uh,

531
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,740
this was a, they kept on waiting for us to get to the point. And the point is that the podcast

532
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:44,660
is now over. Yeah. I mean, I understand. I stopped listening like 10 minutes ago. Same. Same. All right,

533
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:51,700
man. It's been good hanging out with you. I will see you in two weeks for episode 168 on the road

534
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:57,220
to 200 and the 10 year anniversary. We'll see how things go. Awesome. All right. I'm Alan.

535
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,660
I'm Brad. Bonne voir. Bye. Sayonara.
