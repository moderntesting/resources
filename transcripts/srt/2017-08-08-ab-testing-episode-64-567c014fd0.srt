1
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,310
Hey, Alan.

2
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,430
How's it going, man?

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,670
Going good.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,190
We are back for a brand new episode of A.B. testing.

5
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,390
Episode number 64.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:22,150
Square number.

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,790
I once again can't believe I made it this far, but I'm happy.

8
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,190
And we will find something new and interesting or regurgitated

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,430
to talk about, which is pretty much the way

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,950
things work at A.B. testing.

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,180
Yes.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:33,780
Good to be here.

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,460
Good to see you hanging out in our hazy Seattle weather.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,200
Canada sent all their fire smoke to us.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Yeah, it actually caused some disturbance in the Jensen

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,520
household, because my kids were like, dad, why

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,760
does it look so foggy?

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,040
And I'm like, that doesn't look like fog.

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,840
That looks like smog.

20
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,240
And they're like, what?

21
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,200
Smog?

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,920
Yeah, they looked at me like, what?

23
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,600
Why?

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,640
Oh, dad making up words again.

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,960
I'm like, no, this one's actually a thing.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
You just don't see it much in this part of the country.

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:06,880
No.

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
In our green, green Seattle.

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,750
Where I grew up, you see it all of the time.

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,290
All right, I'm heading off to Helsinki next week again.

31
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,410
Didn't you just come back from someplace?

32
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,530
Actually, I haven't traveled in a while.

33
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,610
I go to San Francisco a lot.

34
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,890
I don't even count that as travel anymore.

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,780
I just call that a longer commute to work.

36
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,220
And often, most times I go down, I will go down for the day.

37
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,100
I'll take the 630 flight.

38
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,020
I'll get into the office by 9.15 or so,

39
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,100
and I'll spend the whole day there and take a 7 o'clock

40
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,940
flight home.

41
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,740
It must have been a trip to San Francisco.

42
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:48,860
I vaguely recall you diatribing on interaction

43
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:53,140
with some of our fellow humans on your last flight.

44
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,340
Oh, probably.

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,060
I always complain about my humans.

46
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,580
Actually, for the commuter flights,

47
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,980
they're actually doing pretty good.

48
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:04,620
I went to Helsinki once already in March,

49
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,060
but heading back, having a leads off site there

50
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,900
to talk about people, do some planning, et cetera,

51
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,900
should be a good time.

52
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,100
And there may be some drinking.

53
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,740
I've heard that happened in Helsinki.

54
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,500
I've heard it happens in Helsinki.

55
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,500
But I didn't look it up.

56
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,660
I think the day should be about 20 hours long, 22,

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
somewhere in there.

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,900
Yeah, it helps you go to sleep.

59
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,760
All right.

60
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,960
Hey, before we get started today,

61
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,880
we have a sponsor for this episode.

62
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,520
Once again, the lovely folks at Star or TechWell,

63
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,320
I should say, who do the Star conferences

64
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,240
also have a conference called Agile Dev East.

65
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,800
What?

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Yeah, what?

67
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,840
What?

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
And if you are looking for customized learning options

69
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,280
to explore test-driven development techniques,

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,600
tool selection, automation design,

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,560
to fully integrate testing into Agile's delivery teams,

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,440
you can attend Agile Dev East, which is the premier Agile

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,160
event covering the latest techniques and topics

74
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,720
to understand the efficiency necessary for project success.

75
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,200
And that is this November 5th through 10th

76
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,960
in Orlando, Florida, home of Disney World.

77
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,600
So is Star renamed, rebranded?

78
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,880
No, Star is in May.

79
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,400
This is actually Agile Dev East.

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,160
TechWell does a whole bunch of different conferences.

81
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,480
This one largely geared towards Agile Dev.

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,080
But there's like, I think it's coming up here in my script,

83
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,910
but a whole bunch of topics on Agile testing.

84
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,910
Love it.

85
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,190
Me too.

86
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,150
Learn the technical and team skills

87
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,430
testers need for success in the world of Agile development.

88
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,350
Immerse yourself in hot topics such as Agile and Lean

89
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,350
development principles and practices,

90
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,550
scaled Agile development, Agile teams and leadership,

91
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,630
digital transformation, and more.

92
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,270
And once again, stopping for annotation.

93
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:56,150
As I was thinking while I was reading that is,

94
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,830
this would be a great conference to,

95
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,310
if you're an Agile tester or a modern tester,

96
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,990
attend it with some of your dev counterparts.

97
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,470
Yeah.

98
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,630
The whole team can go.

99
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,470
I actually really like that idea.

100
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:09,950
Yeah.

101
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,990
As an added bonus.

102
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,010
Bonus?

103
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,810
Who doesn't like an added bonus?

104
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,930
Agile Dev East is co-located with better software and DevOps

105
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,610
East conferences.

106
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,850
Your one registration automatically

107
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,970
gives you access to all three programs.

108
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,850
Holy cow.

109
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,090
Bring the whole company.

110
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,490
What are those conferences?

111
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,570
Better software.

112
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,090
OK.

113
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,610
And DevOps East.

114
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,730
And there's so much overlap.

115
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,530
We've talked about, there is a massive,

116
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,930
especially where I work, a gray, gray, almost white,

117
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,730
invisible line between ops and dev and test.

118
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,290
So I could, this would be one of those conferences

119
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,130
where I would maximize my value by watching

120
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,280
like 10 minutes of every talk, skipping from room to room.

121
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,080
Hopefully they have them recorded.

122
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,680
Yeah.

123
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,280
Wow.

124
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,720
Back on track here, your one registration, as I mentioned,

125
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
automatically gives you access to all three programs

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,960
with insights and solutions across the dev lifecycle

127
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,080
to build a customized week of learning that fits you

128
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,960
and your organization's specific needs.

129
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,520
Explore the program at well.tc, W-E-L-L.TC,

130
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,960
forward slash A-B testing.

131
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,560
And I'll put this in the notes on the website.

132
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,210
And of course, I wouldn't have gotten this far

133
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,530
if I wasn't going to mention this.

134
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,810
A-B testing listeners can use the code A-B test

135
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,570
to receive up to $200 off their conference registration fee,

136
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,850
register by September 8th, super early bird deadline,

137
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,130
which isn't that early for a conference in November.

138
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,970
That's great.

139
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,290
For combined savings for up to $600 off.

140
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,840
And when you start talking about bringing your whole team,

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,360
that's a heck of a savings overall.

142
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,280
You can tell your boss that's in the whole team

143
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,800
and take the money saved.

144
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,000
And Alan said you could have that money as a bonus.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,720
You did say an added bonus.

146
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah, I did say an added bonus.

147
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,240
TechWell does not guarantee your boss will give you that bonus,

148
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
but that is a suggestion from me.

149
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,280
Let me know how that works.

150
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,000
Again, well.tc, WAC-AB testing.

151
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,880
I'll post that later.

152
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,760
But that sounds like, I mean, that's a good idea.

153
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,920
That's like putting, that's like a food court.

154
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,080
I'm going to use this.

155
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,400
And thank you, TechWell, for the sponsorship.

156
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,520
And I hope our listeners go.

157
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,280
But I want to use this topic to this ad, this sponsorship,

158
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,160
to in thinking about this show, it's

159
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,120
inspired a lot of questions that I thought

160
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,920
I could think about myself, or I could just bounce them off

161
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,200
of you here today once you stop looking at your phone.

162
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,320
I'm just looking at the topics here.

163
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,960
Lots of topics.

164
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,160
They got lean, they got safe.

165
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,960
Scrum, something called Icy Agile.

166
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,440
I've never heard of that one.

167
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,960
You ever had lunch at Google?

168
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,680
Yes.

169
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,460
So you have a whole bunch of different kinds of food

170
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,700
you can eat.

171
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,960
And you can eat as much as you want.

172
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,350
This is that for agile.

173
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,410
OK.

174
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,050
Yeah, the second part of your phrase

175
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,290
is a little scary when it comes to agile.

176
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,970
Yeah, just fill up a little bit of a,

177
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,530
go to the sushi bar, get some of that, and go,

178
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:19,970
you know what?

179
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,250
I'm kind of hungry today.

180
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,930
I'm also going to go to the pasta bar.

181
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:28,290
And this guy's making fresh smoked teriyaki something.

182
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,490
I'm going to have some of that.

183
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,450
And because I'm desserts.

184
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,010
And yeah.

185
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:38,900
So agile is a little dangerous when you pick and choose a la carte.

186
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,390
OK, don't take my metaphor for what it's worth,

187
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,630
and then shut up.

188
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,230
Shutting up.

189
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,510
Shutting up, yeah.

190
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,550
So I want to talk about agile and agile testing.

191
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,710
One thing I'm all out of order here

192
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:52,870
because I'm thinking while I talk and this shit happens

193
00:07:52,870 --> 00:08:00,000
is our podcast, A-B Testing, is as much of an agile podcast

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,020
as it is a testing podcast, as it is a quality podcast,

195
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,540
as it is a podcast about nothing particularly at all.

196
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,260
And then every now and again, data.

197
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,420
And data as well, absolutely.

198
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,060
So we're, which I like.

199
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,340
And I am going to break my arm a little bit

200
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,540
and pat ourselves on the back because I

201
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,380
do listen to every podcast, not in its finalized form,

202
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,140
but during editing.

203
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,060
I get to re-listen back.

204
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:33,660
And I also listen to a lot of podcasts in my car.

205
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,860
My car has TuneIn radio built in, which has podcasts built in.

206
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,970
So I can just have my favorites there and listen to them.

207
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,610
TuneIn has a podcast here?

208
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,330
Yeah.

209
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,450
And I listen to a lot of different podcasts

210
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,650
about a bunch of different ideas.

211
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,850
And as far as production quality and speaker quality

212
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,130
and pretty much intelligence quality and everything else,

213
00:08:53,130 --> 00:09:01,890
we don't compare at all to things like most 99% invisible.

214
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,850
I mean, there's some really well-done podcasts out there.

215
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,370
But I got to tell you, when I listen to agile podcasts

216
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,810
and testing podcasts, and this is just my ego talking,

217
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,770
but I think we have a pretty damn good podcast,

218
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,050
despite the fact that we're idiots.

219
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,650
It's amazing.

220
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,690
I think it's listenable.

221
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,850
I think we have topics that inspire thought.

222
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,210
And I'm proud of all we've done.

223
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,490
I am as well.

224
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,240
Yeah, I've listened to several agile podcasts.

225
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,160
And one of the things I personally think,

226
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,320
I think we're a lot more entertaining.

227
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,720
I like to think so.

228
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,560
So tell your friends that we're cool.

229
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,640
I am now up to this is the awkward thing.

230
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
I have an awkward point in my life.

231
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,440
This never happened to me at Microsoft.

232
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,680
Now it's happened at Unity, is I now

233
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,520
have at least three people who tell me they actively

234
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,440
listen to the podcast.

235
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
That are employees?

236
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,920
Employees of mine.

237
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,880
I have employees that, in our one-on-one topics,

238
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,880
list an episode of A-B testing where

239
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,960
they want to talk about something I talked about

240
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,880
on that episode more.

241
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,860
So I have to be clear.

242
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,100
Did you tell them the mailbag link is right here?

243
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,820
Yeah.

244
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,980
Talk to the hand.

245
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,780
And the hand has an A-B testing tattoo on it.

246
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,060
No, I want them to post it on the mailbag link

247
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,580
just so that I can help them torture you.

248
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,620
Oh, great.

249
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,180
And usually it's like, so far it's been, I like that idea.

250
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,640
How do you think that applies here?

251
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,160
Oh, that's good.

252
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,000
So yeah.

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,500
That's good.

254
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,400
Anyway, it's scary and bizarre.

255
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,280
And then someone internally asked about,

256
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,880
are there articles or podcasts I should

257
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,520
listen to and one of them post, check out the A-B testing

258
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,000
podcast.

259
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,840
No, I don't need more listeners.

260
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,340
No.

261
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,380
But I don't think I've ever said or I'm not

262
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,620
one to guard my words.

263
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,820
So I think if I ever said anything, totally controversial.

264
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:15,260
I work with a VP who's a something.

265
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,500
One, it's just not true.

266
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,740
But two, I think they go, oh, yeah, totally.

267
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,460
Like if the thing is, I'll phrase it.

268
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,140
I think you have done that one, though.

269
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,380
Actually, I have had.

270
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,180
There is one VP in particular I'm thinking of.

271
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,500
At Microsoft or here?

272
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,380
Microsoft.

273
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:29,880
Oh, yeah.

274
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,380
Yeah.

275
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,780
And that's what I was going to say.

276
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,740
It's like, I will call it like it is.

277
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,560
And most the time, it's like, yeah, that's true.

278
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,120
Definitely, I work with some dipshit VPs at Microsoft.

279
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,200
I think that stays in the PG-13 area.

280
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,240
So I'm going to leave that in.

281
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,740
So yeah.

282
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,160
So we're talking about the podcast.

283
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,760
It's good.

284
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,440
People like it.

285
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
They listen to it.

286
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,630
And then Agile.

287
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,430
I'm going to ask you.

288
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,910
Before you do that, just to close out the star thing.

289
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,830
Oh, sure.

290
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,150
I love this Agile Dev conference idea.

291
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,350
I really do.

292
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,270
I love the idea of people bringing their whole teams.

293
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,310
Especially with the three conferences co-located.

294
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,470
That's like a conference extravaganza.

295
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,550
The topics are interesting and diverse.

296
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,260
One of the things I think might be interesting as well

297
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,460
is that they had tracks, depending

298
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,300
on the maturity level of your team.

299
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,780
I think they will have tracks.

300
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,620
And one thing I've done, and Lee Copeland

301
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,540
suggested this at the conferences.

302
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,940
And I suggested, I hinted at it earlier when

303
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
I said I'd go to a bunch of talks for 10 minutes,

304
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,940
is you really do need to vote with your feet.

305
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,260
Because you're going to have, I

306
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:48,180
can imagine, as much as 10 or more different talks going

307
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,500
on at once, maybe more across the conferences.

308
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,020
If you can't decide between two or three or four,

309
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,700
it's OK to rotate through and find the one that

310
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,940
fits what you're looking for.

311
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,900
I think you have to use the power of your feet

312
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,540
and realize you're not going to offend a speaker

313
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,340
if you step out in the middle to get your most

314
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,940
value out of the conference.

315
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,900
Completely agree in terms of learning.

316
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,680
But I won't say this for too many topics, but for Agile,

317
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,560
I will.

318
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,360
It's one of those things where you

319
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,080
do want to at least understand the minimum number of rules

320
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,560
before you begin and follow those rules directly.

321
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,800
Yeah, and I agree because I have seen probably

322
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,960
one of the biggest mistakes I see in Agile

323
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,320
is just doing part of it for Agile.

324
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,320
Yeah.

325
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,600
Doing part of it or doing a part of it to the extreme,

326
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,830
just see every rant I've done on A-B testing

327
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,430
on the Agile manifesto.

328
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:58,070
But I love this idea.

329
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,570
I love the team inclusiveness.

330
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,650
It's fantastic.

331
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,090
I had never heard of this before.

332
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,280
This is a great idea.

333
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,680
I'm glad you approve.

334
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,280
I have so many things to talk about.

335
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,920
I'm not going to skip that one, but I'm going to go on.

336
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,870
I want to talk about Agile testing.

337
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,550
What is Agile testing?

338
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,110
Testing.

339
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,590
Agile testing, to the best of my knowledge,

340
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,830
is when you have a separated test team that

341
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,130
is operating in an Agile software delivery cycle.

342
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,610
You mean like a separate organization?

343
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,680
Yeah.

344
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,320
That's where I've seen that term used the most often.

345
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,630
So I reread Agile testing, the Chris and Gregory book,

346
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,230
the first one.

347
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,230
OK.

348
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,550
To be honest, I reread the first three

349
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,030
quarters of the book that I stopped

350
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,510
because I had some other work to do.

351
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:01,910
And I had read it, it's probably my third time reading it.

352
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,110
I didn't realize how much I'd forgotten

353
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:07,950
and how much has either subconsciously or just

354
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,430
by way of work become very relevant to what I do,

355
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,590
what we do, what we've talked about on the show.

356
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,710
I saw you on Twitter.

357
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:18,870
And I'm going to get to that.

358
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,310
So one example is on your definition

359
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,190
is in the Agile testing book, Crispin and Gregory

360
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,430
definitely advocate the role of the embedded tester

361
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,010
on the team.

362
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,930
The tester is in the end.

363
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,810
So a test specialist.

364
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,850
Yes, exactly.

365
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,450
Exactly.

366
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,650
And I also noticed they talked about the idea

367
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:47,370
that a test organization can be separate,

368
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,930
run by a separate person, even though those testers are

369
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:50,770
embedded.

370
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:56,080
And then I was surprised, maybe not surprised

371
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
is the wrong word, but like I.

372
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,520
Flabbergasted?

373
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,880
A little bit flabbergasted.

374
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,960
Maybe not too strong of a word.

375
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,080
But right there on page 60, and I've talked about,

376
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,080
and I thought I came up with this organically.

377
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
And I may have, and I don't know,

378
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,640
the brain works in mysterious ways.

379
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,320
But they talked about, and we've talked about this,

380
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,560
shot, the test team being more of a test community run

381
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,360
by the QA director or QA manager, whatever it's called.

382
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,240
And they used those exact words in the book.

383
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,920
I thought, holy crap.

384
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,420
And obviously, their words came out way before I

385
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,500
came to this conclusion.

386
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,980
But I think it's, I've been talking about this

387
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,860
since I joined Unity.

388
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,540
I figured this community thing out a month in.

389
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,860
Like, oh, of course, this is how it works.

390
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,460
And they thought so too.

391
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,260
But then did my brain see that once and then

392
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,260
make the translation?

393
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,780
But I do really feel like it was something I recognized.

394
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,820
Because my background for even years before that

395
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,980
has been building communities.

396
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,980
So I feel like I came to that on my own free will.

397
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,620
But very interesting.

398
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,660
I love that idea.

399
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,660
And I love, I always think about it

400
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,980
I always love when I read a book that supports the ideas I

401
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,730
already think.

402
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:15,250
Yeah.

403
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,170
It validates me.

404
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,690
I like to feel validated.

405
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,330
That's the last book I read along those lines

406
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,010
was the head first design patterns.

407
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,230
Because I always designed in a design pattern way,

408
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,790
but without realizing it.

409
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,830
And then when I read that book, I'm like, oh, this is what I do.

410
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,550
And oh my god, there's ways to do what I do better.

411
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,230
And honestly, that is the, as far as learning design patterns,

412
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,270
that is the number one book I recommend.

413
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,750
Yep.

414
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,550
It is.

415
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,230
I mean, I read the Gang of Four book.

416
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:49,870
Actually.

417
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,870
Why?

418
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,390
Let me tell you, I can't say read.

419
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,270
I looked at all the words in the Gang of Four book.

420
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,300
But it could, it was, it's a cure for insomnia.

421
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,140
And it's such good information.

422
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,460
But it's just I don't read books like that very well.

423
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,340
But I enjoyed, I mean, how many times

424
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,220
you got a textbook that was sort of a page turner?

425
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:16,580
And to me, head first design patterns, really, it was engaging.

426
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,700
It was.

427
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,760
I read the whole, I read, number one,

428
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,040
it's very rare that a textbook, I read it cover to cover.

429
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,760
I read this one cover to cover, and I did it in two weeks.

430
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:34,080
Including stopping, taking a design.

431
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,120
There was a tool I was working at the same time.

432
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,400
And I would, every time I learned a new pattern,

433
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,920
I artificially included that in the tool.

434
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,120
In some places, it made a horrible design.

435
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
But in other places, it was fantastic.

436
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
Cannot recommend that book enough.

437
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,120
On design patterns, and then we should go back

438
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,920
to the other topic, but on design patterns,

439
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,040
there are only three books you should buy.

440
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,120
Head first design patterns.

441
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,600
A book by Al Shalloway and his team at NetObjectives,

442
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,160
which is called Explaining Design Patterns.

443
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,520
Which I haven't read.

444
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
And then the Gang of Four book.

445
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,840
No.

446
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,760
And the reason why is, number one,

447
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,520
the head first design patterns book is going to tell you

448
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,440
why design patterns are frigging useful.

449
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Al Shalloway's book, Explaining Design Patterns,

450
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,150
is going to show you how to design with them.

451
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,690
You have lots of options with design patterns.

452
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,250
If you need to connect two objects,

453
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,690
should you use the adapter or the bridge or the facade?

454
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,450
Al Shalloway's book helps you through that.

455
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,810
And then the Gang of Four's book

456
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,490
is really a reference manual.

457
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,610
This gives you the, for some reason,

458
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,090
you need a design pattern beyond the common 20.

459
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,180
The Gang of Four book has them.

460
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,500
That's it.

461
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,540
You should read the Gang of Four book

462
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:11,660
with as much vigor as you would a dictionary.

463
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,910
All right, Agile Testing, Modern Testing.

464
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,670
I should point out here,

465
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,870
and I'll put this on the website.

466
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,500
I think I may have mentioned this to you, maybe not.

467
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,220
The Chris and Gregory book, Agile Testing,

468
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,020
their follow-up, More Agile Testing,

469
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,460
which is a whole new book.

470
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,700
It's a whole new book.

471
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,380
And Gang of All the books, especially the Gang of Four book,

472
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,500
which is called, and the Gang of Four book,

473
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,300
for those not familiar with design patterns,

474
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,080
there's four authors, and it's just called Design Patterns.

475
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,920
Yep.

476
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,160
You can internet search Gang of Four, it'll show up.

477
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,400
There's the O'Reilly headfirst, O'Reilly's publisher,

478
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,040
Headfirst Design Patterns,

479
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,640
which uses Java as examples,

480
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,400
but it's totally readable, totally fun.

481
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,840
And the Al Shalloway book called?

482
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,480
Explaining Design Patterns.

483
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,310
Now, I wouldn't recommend this for the Headfirst book

484
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,950
because it's full of great pictures and things.

485
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,750
But if you ever like listening to books on audio,

486
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,430
our listeners can always go to audibletrial.com,

487
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,950
WACAB testing, and get their first free month

488
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,300
of Audible for Free, the first month of Audible for Free.

489
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,140
Yeah.

490
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,980
I haven't promo'd that before,

491
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,820
but I'll just throw that in there

492
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,980
because we're kind of in book mode.

493
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,820
So.

494
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,500
And then I guess the last Design Pattern book,

495
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,740
because you talked about the Gang of Four book.

496
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,100
Do you know where the Gang of Four book

497
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,540
got their idea from?

498
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,020
Yeah, from, oh shoot, what's his name?

499
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,020
The Architect.

500
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,900
It'll come to me, give me a hint.

501
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,230
His full name is actually the name,

502
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,350
the combined name of My Two Boys.

503
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Not a great hint for you, I know.

504
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,200
That is not a good hint, give me initials.

505
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
C-A.

506
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,110
It's Alexander.

507
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,270
Last name is Alexander.

508
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,110
Yep.

509
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,110
It's Charles.

510
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,110
Yep.

511
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,340
I do remember it's Alexander.

512
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,620
I'm awful at guessing games.

513
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,380
Let me give you one more second though.

514
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,570
Dunno.

515
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,410
Christopher Alexander.

516
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,410
Christopher, that's right.

517
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,250
Damn it.

518
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,370
Timeless way of building.

519
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,210
Did you name your kids after the Design Patterns?

520
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,930
No, it was accidental.

521
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,690
I didn't even know about Christopher Alexander

522
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,530
until after my kids were born.

523
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:34,610
Maybe not consciously.

524
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,740
Yeah.

525
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,660
But back to this idea of,

526
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,160
like Stephen Johnson,

527
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:52,060
he talks about how ideas can only happen

528
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,700
when there's enough of a background for it to be possible.

529
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,060
And then when it's possible,

530
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,060
it's very common for them the same idea to pop up

531
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,620
in multiple different places.

532
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,540
Because it's just,

533
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,020
in a lot of regards,

534
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,780
it's just a logical conclusion

535
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,420
to the two ideas coming together.

536
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,260
You.

537
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,660
This is Stephen Johnson.

538
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,100
Where good ideas come from?

539
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,540
You have constantly been involved in testing

540
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,460
as well as you have constantly been involved

541
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,500
in community building.

542
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,500
So I find it not surprising at all

543
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,420
that you may have independently come up

544
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,380
with the same idea.

545
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,300
Yep, totally fine.

546
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,140
Totally fine.

547
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,190
It's been a long time since I've read

548
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,790
the Crispin Gregory book.

549
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:46,750
So when I hear about this talk about community,

550
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,150
I constantly think of it in terms of

551
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,590
a matrix-style organization.

552
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,430
Yes.

553
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,030
And that's what they're referring to.

554
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:56,310
Yeah, and I use that explanation a lot.

555
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,270
Kind of how we work.

556
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,110
So in rereading that book,

557
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,390
it's like a lot of head nods.

558
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:03,110
Yeah, embedded, obviously they don't use the phrase,

559
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,470
accelerating the achievement, the shippable quality.

560
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,350
But there's a lot of test specialists

561
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,190
sort of working with that.

562
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,310
If they want to, we can make the licensing.

563
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,700
Yeah.

564
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,980
Not having, and again, that is a book,

565
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,740
probably the book on Agile testing,

566
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,140
but there's a lot of variations out there

567
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,940
on what testing is on an Agile team.

568
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,940
So the question I have for you is on this show,

569
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,900
we've talked a bit about what you and I

570
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,460
are called modern testing.

571
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
Yep.

572
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,980
What do you think some differences may be

573
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,020
between Agile testing and modern testing?

574
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,780
Or is modern testing just Agile testing

575
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,260
rebranded by A-B testing?

576
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,940
Well, one of the things that I think is,

577
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,540
I kind of wish we had the show notes from.

578
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,820
And I have ideas.

579
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,740
And by the way, we talked about Agile testing

580
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,860
before we talked about it for 10 or 15 minutes

581
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,420
in episode eight.

582
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,260
Okay.

583
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,540
All right.

584
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,980
And you know this because of one of your employees?

585
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,820
No, no.

586
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,490
So the one thing I would say that seems obvious

587
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:09,010
is this specialist versus generalist idea.

588
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,930
In my view of modern testing,

589
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,210
yeah, we don't really have the embedded IC tester.

590
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,770
We would have maybe an IC similar to the role

591
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:24,210
that you served previously.

592
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:27,820
Sort of a, I don't wanna use the word architect role,

593
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,500
but something along those lines.

594
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,260
So this goes along the lines of on a good,

595
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,060
it's an evolution in that way because

596
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,700
if I do my job well enough,

597
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,260
I talked about this on a Twitter rant as well.

598
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,720
The role of, if your role is to be that test coach

599
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,960
or the role of any coaching job, really,

600
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,640
in Agile coach, test coach, quality coach,

601
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,080
we wanna call it is to work yourself out of a job.

602
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,650
Yes.

603
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,750
So on these, or work yourself out of a role maybe,

604
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,270
maybe take on a more of a generalist role.

605
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,670
You do it for a larger part of the org.

606
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,460
You do something bigger and wider.

607
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:12,220
So that's one good distinction.

608
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,060
I thought of two.

609
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,260
One is the role may not be needed

610
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,580
because the test knowledge, the testing knowledge

611
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,340
and the quality knowledge is dispersed among the team.

612
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,370
The other thing though that I don't recall

613
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,170
from Agile testing, what we're calling in modern testing

614
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,170
is we place a heavy focus on defining customer quality

615
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:38,610
through the use of data.

616
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,730
And that's the other one I was getting to

617
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,810
is just data in general.

618
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,050
One thing not mentioned in Agile testing,

619
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,410
which is huge to how we see quality being done now,

620
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,450
especially in the future is a heavy, heavy reliance on data.

621
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,130
Data driven at a minimum, data centric as an ideal.

622
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,170
What I recall from Agile testing

623
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,930
is still a book on testing.

624
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:06,130
Like what I'm saying on modern testing,

625
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:08,130
it's not really about testing.

626
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,970
Yeah.

627
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,810
We can look at this as a bit of a maturity model.

628
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,530
Agile testing is the book you need to understand

629
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:19,370
how to give you a good insight

630
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:24,370
and understand how to adapt from a predictive test last world

631
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,630
into a iterative or maybe even adaptive test as you go world.

632
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,350
There's a lot of insights in there

633
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,290
into what that looks like.

634
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,210
So you read it the whole way through recently

635
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:40,970
because I do remember it covering the iterative,

636
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,770
like this Scrum type model very well.

637
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,620
I don't recall it covering the adaptive model.

638
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,140
Not directly.

639
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,460
Not directly.

640
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,500
But again, another...

641
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,460
Maybe that's in more active testing.

642
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,020
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

643
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,220
But one thing we've have talked about before,

644
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,740
which is an important distinction is this idea

645
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,460
that waterfall model, very predictive.

646
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,640
Some people are happy with Agile being just a pure,

647
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,400
iterative model, but I think Agile done right

648
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,640
must be adaptive.

649
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,540
So I don't see why they...

650
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,250
While you can get stuck in the iterative,

651
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,250
I think if you're talking about learning,

652
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,930
and actually I wanna pop back to something,

653
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:23,690
adaptive becomes very important.

654
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,450
When it's done right, I'll tell you,

655
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:29,050
when it's done right, it is adaptive.

656
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:32,670
And the reason why is because when you've done it right,

657
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,010
you've struck on something

658
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:38,330
and you can't scale with the iterative model.

659
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,490
You have to adapt.

660
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,770
You have to have a mechanism to cut things

661
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,790
that aren't worthwhile doing.

662
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:48,770
Let me give you two examples from Unity.

663
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,050
On my team.

664
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:54,970
One is I have one lead who very good at Agile.

665
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,490
In fact, so good that in one of the teams

666
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:05,360
that he barely works with doesn't have a lead right now.

667
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,880
He's not leading the team, he's just leading their,

668
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,600
he's just basically playing their role of product owner.

669
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,000
Product owner or Scrum Master?

670
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,010
Both.

671
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:16,850
Scrum Master.

672
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,030
So he's not telling them what to do,

673
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,030
he's telling them how to do it.

674
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,870
Correct.

675
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,870
He's a very good Agile coach.

676
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,830
So he's playing that role across the teams.

677
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,630
And again, specialized in generalist,

678
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,150
he owns some quality stuff,

679
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,390
but he's playing the role of a Agile coach.

680
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,430
Okay.

681
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:37,630
And just nudging,

682
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,590
nudging that word,

683
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,140
live along a little bit and good improvements,

684
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,220
great feedback.

685
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,930
He's helping those teams become adaptive.

686
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,970
So I love it.

687
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,030
Another example, my most,

688
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,950
I won't use the word dysfunctional.

689
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,750
The team that needs the most improvement

690
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,430
out of all the teams I work with,

691
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,270
I had a conversation.

692
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,230
Do any of these teams list this team?

693
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,070
Maybe.

694
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,910
Hey.

695
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:06,890
I am full transparency.

696
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:10,270
I'm not gonna say this team sucks because they don't.

697
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,330
Do they have some more room for growth

698
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,450
and learning and becoming more adaptive?

699
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,290
Yeah, for sure.

700
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,610
And nobody anywhere in the org,

701
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,170
whether they're test dev ops would argue with me.

702
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,130
All right.

703
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,090
But the point is I asked this question

704
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,990
because I'm some,

705
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,770
I kind of dive in and out of being directly involved

706
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,610
in the different teams

707
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,570
and all in like 12 different products.

708
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,050
But I popped in on one of the channels and said,

709
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:38,660
hey, does this team do retrospectives?

710
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,340
Kind of knowing the answer based on,

711
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,820
you kind of can tell whether a team does or not.

712
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,620
And it was great because the answer was,

713
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,640
we used to, but no, not anymore.

714
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,820
But then I had a few people message me privately and say,

715
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,580
no, but we really need to.

716
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,700
Can you help start doing these?

717
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,540
So they're,

718
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,940
each time you wanna make any sort of change,

719
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,580
having allies is good,

720
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,260
but part of being a learning organization

721
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,060
and part of getting to an adaptive state,

722
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,740
like you can't do adaptive software development

723
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,290
if you don't do a proper retrospective.

724
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,330
Because a retrospective is about taking some time

725
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,450
to reflect and learn.

726
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

727
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,460
No, the thing that I'm thinking here though,

728
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,190
that gives a clue,

729
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,940
it's essentially what I find

730
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,060
is the most successful retrospectives are the ones

731
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,370
where essentially the leadership is disinvited.

732
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,950
In order to get there,

733
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,630
now this is in the Microsoft mentality

734
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,630
where command and control is so pervasive,

735
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,550
it's hard to compare it to anything else.

736
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:49,280
And it sounds different than the Unity model.

737
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,640
But if they're asking for your help to get there,

738
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:59,940
that to me sounds like a call for command and control

739
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,140
to kind of nudge in a better direction.

740
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,120
In this role, it's me not as a leader,

741
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,360
it's me in the role of a specializing generalist.

742
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,300
Just a couple weeks ago,

743
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,980
I hit the reset button on my own team's retrospective.

744
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,420
We had gotten a little bit formulaic,

745
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,300
the team was going through,

746
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,540
but the team was pivoting around being polite to each other.

747
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,340
And so the really important things

748
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,700
that needed to be talked about,

749
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,060
like no one ever brought up the elephant in a room,

750
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:41,080
I took back control and started pointing out the elephants.

751
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,350
I find that my role,

752
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,710
particularly as a leader in this part,

753
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,650
is I can build a better team by getting the whole team

754
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,990
to heat me simultaneously in retrospective.

755
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,470
Now, because I'll go,

756
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,330
I'm throwing you all under the bus.

757
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,810
And it ended up being, I got on the retrospective,

758
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:08,130
each one of my ACs came after the medium was like,

759
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:11,930
I am so glad that you did that.

760
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,410
So in retrospectives,

761
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,090
one, there's a couple of observations I've had

762
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,090
in my experience with Agile,

763
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:23,180
which is not as extensive as yours, but not bad.

764
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,780
Retrospectives, and maybe because I'm such a big fan

765
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,160
of the learning organization,

766
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,580
I think it's one of the most valuable,

767
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,310
not the most valuable practice you can do.

768
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,310
And that's probably before-

769
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,010
I go back and forth between retrospective or standup.

770
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,250
I'm gonna go on the retrospective side for now,

771
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,530
but the other thing is,

772
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,570
is that there are a ton of things you can do

773
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,050
in a retrospective.

774
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,530
There's not one true way.

775
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,890
There's multiple structured models.

776
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,250
And I've found that varying that,

777
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,150
everything from, there are games you can do,

778
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:55,730
there are just whiteboard.voting,

779
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,130
there are a bunch of different things you can do.

780
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,410
And the goal is not to solve every single problem

781
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,250
of the team.

782
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,650
It's just like the rest of Agile,

783
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,250
it's a prioritization exercise.

784
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:09,970
Like what are the biggest levers we can pull now?

785
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:14,970
And surfacing those and coming up with not a-

786
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,300
one of the mistakes I see in retrospectives is,

787
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,620
yep, these are the problems,

788
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,780
let's all think about these

789
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,540
and we'll see if they go away, and they don't.

790
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,180
You need to go away with an actionable plan.

791
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,020
Like what are we gonna do?

792
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,780
What are the next steps we're gonna do about these?

793
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,340
And what do we expect to see?

794
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,980
The feedback with retrospectives is,

795
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,320
that's the most common is,

796
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,890
hey, we've said this before

797
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,810
and we've done nothing about it.

798
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:43,150
One of the goals, so I run,

799
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,290
when I do retrospectives,

800
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,490
I run two different general models.

801
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,450
There's two different structure types that I'm fond of.

802
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,850
We do one weekly and then one quarterly.

803
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,630
And both have to end with a minimum

804
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,060
of two things to change and two things to celebrate.

805
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,020
And the things that are on the change,

806
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,940
they go on a particular rail in our,

807
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,300
if it's work we had to fund

808
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,740
versus sort of a philosophical change.

809
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,440
It will go on a rail and it'll get funded.

810
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,000
What you and I talk about a lot

811
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,360
is another evolution of that,

812
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:26,240
where the pure testing specialist may not be needed

813
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,720
or is not needed on the team

814
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,080
because the team gets that.

815
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,960
And actually I have in the dev teams that I work with,

816
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,000
there is at least one that doesn't have a tester on the team

817
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,920
because of that, they've evolved.

818
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,680
And actually two things have happened there.

819
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,480
You can look at this, if people that have seen this

820
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,100
is that team one, writes very good tests themselves

821
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,000
and anticipates where quality issues may happen.

822
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,140
And two, they're the most reliant on data.

823
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,170
Yeah.

824
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:55,330
So that makes sense.

825
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,170
Yeah.

826
00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,380
It also occurred to me that that may be a sign

827
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,660
of the maturity model that we were just talking about,

828
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:07,930
shifting away from iterative to adaptive, right?

829
00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,070
Because adaptive, in order to adapt,

830
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:12,970
it's about optimizing the flow of knowledge

831
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,530
throughout the team.

832
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,530
In order to adapt,

833
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:20,010
you have adaptation is about picking

834
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,120
the better direction to go.

835
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,120
I think you can be...

836
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,120
And that requires knowledge sharing.

837
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,680
It does.

838
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
And I think as...

839
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,040
But I think you can be adaptive

840
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,970
without following like we talk about with modern testing.

841
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:37,810
Oh no, no.

842
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,630
But I think it helps with the...

843
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,470
I'm trying to generalize.

844
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,290
Yeah.

845
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,090
Like I think the Scrum model,

846
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,290
I think the Waterfall model,

847
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,890
I think they solidify.

848
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:53,850
If you have a testing specialist,

849
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,170
they kind of solidify those roles.

850
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,260
They make it a dependent part of the process.

851
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,740
We've talked about codependency quite often.

852
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,300
Whereas in the adaptive model,

853
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,100
you're like, wait, no.

854
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,620
So when I do my presentations on Agile,

855
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:20,250
the term specialist in my mind,

856
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,130
I reframe it when I do the presentations.

857
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,490
When Dev says,

858
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:28,050
but you're saying I get this from Dev all the time.

859
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,290
I'm a specialist and I'm not feeling special in your model.

860
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,410
And I'm like, you know what a specialist is

861
00:37:34,410 --> 00:37:36,290
in the Agile world?

862
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:37,770
And they look like, what?

863
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,630
I said, they're called a bottleneck.

864
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,260
Because if there's only one person

865
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,660
who knows how to do this stuff,

866
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,380
and if that stuff's important,

867
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,080
then your bottleneck's behind their ability to get it done.

868
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,920
Yeah.

869
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,760
Right?

870
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,720
In an adaptive world, you really despise bottlenecks.

871
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,920
Yeah, absolutely.

872
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,380
Yeah.

873
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,220
Fully agree.

874
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Shall we, anything else on,

875
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,100
did we finish on Agile testing?

876
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,100
So was it just those two things?

877
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,500
Specialist versus generalist and adaptive versus,

878
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,640
no, quality versus testing?

879
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,240
And are those the biggest difference?

880
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,880
Because I do think,

881
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,400
because modern testing, when I thought about it,

882
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,520
it was very heavily framed in Agile philosophy.

883
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,860
I think it is too, but I think the differences are,

884
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
it's an evolution.

885
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,700
I think so.

886
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,240
And it's, I don't know if quality versus testing

887
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
is a given, but I think the two big things are,

888
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,320
is that the test specialist may not be needed,

889
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,390
and extreme reliance on data.

890
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,510
Yeah.

891
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,550
I think those, in thinking, in reflecting

892
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,650
about what we've talked about in our discussions

893
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:50,570
on air quote modern testing,

894
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:52,090
I think those are the biggest differences

895
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,010
in between what we've talked about

896
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,010
and where we see testing going,

897
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,890
where we see quality going.

898
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:58,610
The Whitaker talk on all this testing

899
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,330
is getting in the way of quality.

900
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,730
That title keeps on popping in my head.

901
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,010
Yeah, when I read that one,

902
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,440
that one was kind of a,

903
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,190
that helped put the final seal in the coffin for me.

904
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,230
I'm like, oh, I completely get what he's saying.

905
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,070
Yep.

906
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,870
That really added clarity.

907
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:19,250
I think that'll inspire some questions

908
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,090
for the mailbag.

909
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,970
I'm thinking through the world that we were talking about

910
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,490
when we talked about modern testing.

911
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:29,460
I'm thinking the world where it's all personalization,

912
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,820
everybody has their own little AI bot running in the cloud.

913
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:40,040
I don't think Agile testing is gonna help in that world.

914
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,120
No, no, it has to be, it's a different approach.

915
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,440
And there's actually a webinar

916
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,120
from the folks at Behave.org,

917
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,540
who used to be called Which Test Won?

918
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,660
experimentation website on using AI

919
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:57,240
to do experimentation in multivariate testing,

920
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,800
which is actually an awkward,

921
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,640
an unplanned segue into the mailbag.

922
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,980
We have a mailbag question.

923
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,820
We do.

924
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,460
Which is kind of about this same topic

925
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,020
that we somehow evolved into.

926
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,610
Which was odd.

927
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,450
This time it was really accidental.

928
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,410
It was truly an accidental segue.

929
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,290
Brent, do you wanna read that question?

930
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:26,650
Yeah, so on the Slack channel,

931
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,660
Adrian posted a article.

932
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,500
Adrian!

933
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:36,670
Posted an article around something called Bandit Tests.

934
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,710
And he asked,

935
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,430
is that something you have come across in your job

936
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,400
and have found it useful?

937
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,320
Have you heard of it?

938
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,680
I hadn't heard of it before I looked it up.

939
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,600
And to me, and you know more about the things being

940
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,440
about the statistician and math thing,

941
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,000
it sounds like a sort of a variation

942
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,240
on multivariate testing.

943
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,170
Is it not?

944
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,690
I mean, you're testing multiple things at once

945
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,450
and you use the results to drive what you test next.

946
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,050
That's the different part.

947
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,290
Yeah, it's-

948
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,770
So multivariate, as I understand it,

949
00:41:05,770 --> 00:41:09,660
is instead of an A-B test, it's an A-B-C-D-E test.

950
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:14,420
The multivariate, the way you phrased it-

951
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:17,260
Really, it's an A-A-1, B-B-1 testing.

952
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,060
You're testing multiple things at once.

953
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,140
So you can contrast it with A-B testing

954
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:25,100
and multivariate testing.

955
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:29,140
Bandit testing is extremely useful.

956
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:34,140
It is harder to understand than multivariate or A-B testing.

957
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:42,630
But it is something that my team does use in our job

958
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,870
and we do find it useful.

959
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:54,190
And we've actually productized our version of it

960
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,990
and it's helping to run Azure today.

961
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,740
Dun, dun, dun.

962
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,730
Did you know it was called bandit testing?

963
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,130
You heard about it before?

964
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:09,050
Yeah, actually its full name is multi-armed bandit testing.

965
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,450
You'll often hear it in its acronym of MAB,

966
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,690
multi-armed bandit.

967
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,170
I don't know if I'd often hear that, no?

968
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,010
But anyway, go on.

969
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:23,330
But you hadn't heard of that democratization

970
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:26,350
until it came up here.

971
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:29,950
So the general thing on this one is it's,

972
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,350
they call it multi-armed bandit

973
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:37,090
because they're thinking about slot machines,

974
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,370
also known as the worn-armed bandit.

975
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,210
And-

976
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,180
Of course.

977
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,380
I guess maybe not, of course.

978
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,820
That was obvious to me because in the article

979
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,260
they had a picture of slot machines.

980
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,580
Yes.

981
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,420
So the way-

982
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,100
I realize that may not be people listening

983
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,370
but I go, I don't get why it's called bandit testing.

984
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,940
Do you put a mask on?

985
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,780
All right, go on.

986
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,650
No.

987
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,690
So let's imagine that you're a gambler

988
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,210
and you have 10 coins

989
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,610
and you have three slot machines.

990
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:09,210
And you can put those 10 coins

991
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:13,710
in whichever slot machines you want.

992
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,310
But you wanna do it in the ones

993
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:18,880
that will pay you off the most.

994
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,120
And so the problem with a multi-armed bandit

995
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,280
is number one,

996
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,720
you only have a limited number of resources.

997
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,680
Like you start off with this 10 coins.

998
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:34,120
You can't test everything at infinite item

999
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,920
which is one place where it's different

1000
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,360
I think from multivariate or AV testing.

1001
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,320
Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.

1002
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,160
No.

1003
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,400
Because they don't necessarily,

1004
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,880
I mean, yeah, that restriction's there.

1005
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,960
You still would have an ROI sort of call on those ones

1006
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,680
but in multi-armed bandit testing is essentially

1007
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,640
you have a limited number of experiments

1008
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,200
in which to learn from.

1009
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,490
And at each experiment,

1010
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,490
you have to choose between exploiting the knowledge

1011
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:12,610
you've already learned from prior trials

1012
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:16,060
or experimenting again.

1013
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,940
So it's multi-armed bandit testing,

1014
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,020
in my view, makes a lot more sense

1015
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,340
when running in production.

1016
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,740
Yeah, absolutely.

1017
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,960
Right.

1018
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Doesn't all experimentation kind of run in production?

1019
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,280
No, no, no, this isn't an experimentation thing.

1020
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,210
This is essentially a decision framework.

1021
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:36,050
Okay.

1022
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,160
So you can think of it as

1023
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,960
if we're trying to choose

1024
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:49,080
between a best resource for something,

1025
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,960
we can look at prior history

1026
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,920
or if there's a new set of resources that come online

1027
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,560
and we don't know how good these ones are yet,

1028
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,480
we can experiment with these new ones to see,

1029
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,760
hey, do we like these new ones better than the ones

1030
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,390
that we've already been using?

1031
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:13,390
So you can kind of think of it as a way to build ML

1032
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:19,470
and do sort of a A-B testing type of system online, in line.

1033
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,300
Gotcha.

1034
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:25,460
There you go.

1035
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,300
So it's extremely useful.

1036
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,300
It's a slightly different thing than A-B testing.

1037
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,620
I get it, I get it now.

1038
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:36,720
My head's spinning with, as you know,

1039
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,920
the one thing in this statistics world

1040
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,000
I've studied a little bit

1041
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,440
because I've impressed you with some fancy words in the past

1042
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,880
is experimentation.

1043
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,080
I think moving towards a culture of experimentation,

1044
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,280
again, my head's spinning.

1045
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,760
I realize experimentation is different

1046
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,230
than bandit testing.

1047
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,750
What was it called, M-Mab?

1048
00:45:56,750 --> 00:45:57,670
Multi-arm bandit testing.

1049
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,300
Multi-arm bandit testing.

1050
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:05,300
But I think there is a marriage of ML, AI,

1051
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,940
and experimentation that is yet untapped,

1052
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,340
but what I'm thinking of in my head

1053
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,100
is take a typical experiment.

1054
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,540
Which treatment is better?

1055
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,900
Treatment A or treatment B?

1056
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,660
Typically the way you do that is you route some traffic,

1057
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,300
some portion of traffic to the new experiment.

1058
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,300
You look at the result you want,

1059
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,500
whether it's a click or a signup

1060
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:33,100
or whatever business result you want from that,

1061
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,320
you measure the difference.

1062
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,280
And you come back and you look at the experiment results

1063
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,160
and you go, okay, this worked as expected or didn't,

1064
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,680
let's try something else.

1065
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,080
But I'm predicting, I mean, it's not too much of a stretch

1066
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,800
to think of a world where you could be a lot smarter

1067
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,400
in that sampling of who you route to.

1068
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,080
You could change based on what responses you got.

1069
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:56,880
You could say, oh, you could write some tools

1070
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,600
and just tell like, oh, in this demographic

1071
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,760
or in this part of the world or in this time zone.

1072
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,640
If I show you the ad between two and three,

1073
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,380
I get a lot more good things, clicks,

1074
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:11,340
whatever it is, clicks.

1075
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:14,940
There is a lot of, in addition to the just traditional,

1076
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,820
like do they like it, do they don't like it,

1077
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,220
is you could use some computer power

1078
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,260
to figure out why and when or where

1079
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,300
or how they like it or don't like it

1080
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,820
and adapt automatically.

1081
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,460
A lot of the A-B testing that's done even today

1082
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,870
is about finding the best least common denominator.

1083
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,030
Yeah.

1084
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,670
Right, as you were talking,

1085
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,470
I was thinking of other examples.

1086
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,660
Like, so for example, is Unity in the cloud?

1087
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,780
Do they operate in the cloud?

1088
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,100
Yeah. Okay.

1089
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:51,740
That's why I'm employed.

1090
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:52,780
Okay.

1091
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,980
Let's imagine that,

1092
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:59,460
so here's an example for multi-armed bandit.

1093
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,460
Let's say you need to create a new VM in the cloud.

1094
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:03,780
Okay.

1095
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,060
And you had some success criteria, reliability,

1096
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:12,180
availability, some other itty, I don't really care.

1097
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,470
Okay.

1098
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:16,290
Now, what you can do,

1099
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,800
now Azure offers,

1100
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,340
I think we have 20 different regions

1101
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,580
in which you could deploy that VM.

1102
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,940
So which region should you deploy it in?

1103
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:38,540
Right, you can deploy it in the one you're already in now

1104
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,700
or you can deploy it in some new one

1105
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:43,420
that you haven't experimented with.

1106
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,820
But once you deploy it, it goes to prod.

1107
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,300
So if you deploy it,

1108
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,740
you could deploy it in the ones

1109
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,380
that you've already been doing

1110
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:58,380
and with a well-known base of the reliability or availability,

1111
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,020
or you could deploy it in something new

1112
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:04,010
that could be worse, but it could be better.

1113
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,810
And multi-armed bandit testing

1114
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,770
helps you adapt the right strategy.

1115
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,530
So you go, okay, I'm gonna put one here

1116
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:15,530
so I can start getting information from this one

1117
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,430
to see if it's better or worse.

1118
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:21,230
And then if it ends up being better,

1119
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,150
then the ML would eventually,

1120
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,510
as you bring down some of these VMs,

1121
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:30,430
it would bring up a few others here.

1122
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:31,270
Got it.

1123
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,350
It's a method of making a data-driven decision.

1124
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:37,230
You have a choice to deploy in this new DC,

1125
00:49:37,230 --> 00:49:40,430
but you wanna make that choice based on data,

1126
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:44,070
gives you a safer way to,

1127
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,510
well, a way to use data to make that decision

1128
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,350
in the long term.

1129
00:49:47,350 --> 00:49:50,870
And most importantly, it automates that decision making.

1130
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,070
Absolutely.

1131
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,030
Which is like, you don't care.

1132
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,420
What region is deployed in,

1133
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,820
that's not something you wanna spend two weeks on,

1134
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,100
studying. No, absolutely not.

1135
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,490
Yeah, cool.

1136
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:09,330
I think we're out of time.

1137
00:50:09,330 --> 00:50:10,730
We are. I'll let you go back on vacation.

1138
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,450
But as always, thank you, Brent.

1139
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,650
Thank you, Alan.

1140
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,690
All right, we'll see you next time on A B testing.
