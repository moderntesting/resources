1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,040
Howdy.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,120
Hey, guess what?

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,430
It's episode number 40.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,200
40.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,000
40 of 80.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,900
The big four-o.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,080
So it's a week of anniversaries, because Monday

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,330
is my 21-year anniversary at Microsoft.

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,490
Congratulations.

10
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,650
And I am not, to celebrate, I'm going to Vegas.

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,730
And we talked about this last time.

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,890
You're not a gambler yet.

13
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,250
French, oh, here goes the tequila.

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,750
We don't have tequila, so we'll do coffee shots

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,430
when Brent says we've talked about this before.

16
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,810
All right, so you're not a gambler,

17
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:51,050
so what's happening in Vegas?

18
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,930
I'm going to Vegas to talk about A-B testing,

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,850
not the podcast, the actual experimentation.

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,510
That's right.

21
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,770
That's the conference this weekend.

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,610
Well, it's Monday.

23
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:04,410
My workshop's Monday.

24
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,170
I'm flying down Sunday.

25
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,450
Give them a workshop Monday, flying back Tuesday.

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,570
That was it that I could announce last week,

27
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:17,320
but those that follow the conference world on Twitter.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,600
Holy cow, it's going to be a fun day of Alan

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,120
not being able to talk.

30
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,920
Every day for A-B testing, recording,

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,800
I bring in two cups of coffee for me

32
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,700
to drink throughout the episode,

33
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,460
and neither one have been started yet.

34
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,560
And I think it's a problem right now.

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,480
You rode your bike today, I guess?

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,080
I did.

37
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,040
Yeah, so you weren't pre-caffeinating on the way

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,660
in then.

39
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,620
It is really hard to drink a cup of coffee on a motorcycle.

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,740
First of all, balancing on the gas tank, pain in the butt,

41
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,220
and then getting the cup in your helmet

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,280
without pouring coffee all over your chin, really difficult.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,200
What about one of those football beer helmets?

44
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:03,290
That is an idea that I feel just dumb for not trying.

45
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,090
I will be in the city of brotherly love

46
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,040
in November, Philadelphia.

47
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,880
Philly!

48
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,630
Before test bash.

49
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,430
Oh, are you going to be bashing test?

50
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,270
I'm going to be talking.

51
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,070
Sweet.

52
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,230
I'm the one giving a talk about,

53
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,310
I think I titled my talk,

54
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,120
you know, I'm kind of, I mentioned this perhaps before.

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,840
But I have.

56
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,440
Oh, no, no, drink.

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,800
I am evolving this talk around my experiences

58
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,040
with being the guy, the test and quality guy

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,320
on a team with no testers

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,960
and talking to other people with the same experiences

61
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,000
and learning what works and doesn't work

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,040
and watching more failures with the move

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,600
than I see success.

64
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,360
So I'm talking about testing without testers

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,300
and other stupid things or something like that.

66
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,380
I think we learn well from mistakes.

67
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,660
We can watch what others have done wrong.

68
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,000
You only learn from mistakes.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
Oh, so and so teams tried that

70
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,440
and they failed to have a dumb idea.

71
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,800
I've seen that for, well, 21 years now.

72
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,800
At Microsoft.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,640
At Microsoft.

74
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,370
So I think it's important to understand how and why

75
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,970
these fail and when and where they work.

76
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:28,930
So you can figure out if they work in your context.

77
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,930
So I'm giving that talk and it's,

78
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,850
I don't like giving the same talk.

79
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,250
So I've been evolving this talk.

80
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,810
I can say this, I think,

81
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,730
by the time I go to test bash,

82
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,530
this product that I'm working on

83
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,250
will be publicly available or should be

84
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,890
or damn well should be.

85
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,520
So it'll be interesting to talk about it in that context.

86
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,600
Talking about a real thing in November.

87
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,440
November, okay.

88
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,320
So I'm pretty stoked about that.

89
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,640
Appreciate the invitation.

90
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,040
So conferences, we're looking at our

91
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
burn down list here on the board.

92
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,840
So we'll dive right into the,

93
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,250
I forget what the section's called again.

94
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,130
Mailbag!

95
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,960
So Danny Fott, software optimist,

96
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,800
asked if we knew, had any more information on the,

97
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
what was going on at Yahoo.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,840
And I don't.

99
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,120
Did you say software optimist?

100
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,080
Software alchemist.

101
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,920
Oh, okay.

102
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,170
Software optimist is nobody in testing.

103
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,530
It really should be nobody in testing.

104
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:33,670
So I haven't heard anything.

105
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,910
The one person, I used to have some good connections

106
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,870
in Yahoo and they've all left the company.

107
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,310
And wow, they're all testers, that's weird.

108
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,030
My connections to Yahoo are,

109
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,470
god, about eight years old.

110
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,670
Yeah, so I don't know.

111
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,910
I use a news clip of the Yahoo,

112
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,110
getting rid of the safety net

113
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,510
makes us better developers article

114
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,590
that came out when they made this change.

115
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,550
But again, that's press and it's hard to tell.

116
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,390
There could be a lot more going on under the scenes.

117
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,030
Or there may not be.

118
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,870
It's hard to tell.

119
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:12,870
But Yahoo is getting a lot of PR on this.

120
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,950
But they're far from the first big company

121
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,990
to go down this path.

122
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,830
Oh, I know.

123
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,110
But there was, I think he brought it up

124
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,670
because this is the one that got media attention about it.

125
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,270
That Facebook has been doing this

126
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,110
same sort of thing for years.

127
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,030
And Facebook-ish, the thing to remember,

128
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,270
and this is something important

129
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,550
when you think about unified engineering,

130
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,350
combined engineering, or no testers,

131
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,550
whatever you want to call it, is that.

132
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,950
Unified engineering.

133
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,750
The story I bring up is when I went

134
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,350
to the Google Test Automation Conference in Kirkland.

135
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,110
It's been two years, maybe three years ago now?

136
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,430
I can't remember.

137
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,470
I'm old.

138
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,470
I think it's three.

139
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,950
Three-ish.

140
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,070
The guy from Facebook, giving a talk comes up,

141
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,510
swaggers up there.

142
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,790
I work at Facebook, and we don't have testers at Facebook,

143
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,030
like trying to get a rise,

144
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,510
like, these are test-automators.

145
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,180
I'm the engineering lead for a software reliability team.

146
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,260
I roll like a dude.

147
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,550
Whatever.

148
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,430
We don't have testers.

149
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,630
We have software explorers and evaluators.

150
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,950
Right.

151
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,550
We don't have testers.

152
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,150
We have performance analysts.

153
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,040
It's like, and the point is.

154
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,440
Quality analysts.

155
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,680
The three know that the work gets done,

156
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,520
or the work should get done.

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,720
The way you fail at this is you stop doing testing.

158
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,080
But the activities still need to occur.

159
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,520
And what happens in a good unified engineering team

160
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,800
is that they occur in a more optimized manner

161
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,000
than they typically do on a waterfall,

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,450
or a stage, or a separated team.

163
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,290
Yeah.

164
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,490
Anyway, I have no insight.

165
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,530
It's not really talking about there.

166
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,090
But question acknowledged.

167
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,850
Thank you.

168
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,480
Who's Peepee?

169
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Patrick.

170
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
Oh, prill.

171
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,600
Testpappy.

172
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,950
I only know people by their Twitter and Slack handles.

173
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,590
Yes.

174
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,910
But I think it probably is not too cool for us

175
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,430
to continue to call in Peepee on the podcast.

176
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,030
Patrick asks, how does Microsoft grow and recruit

177
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,820
into quality-oriented roles?

178
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,180
Damn good question.

179
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,140
Yes.

180
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,540
I'm going to let you start, because I

181
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,460
have to think about my answer.

182
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,980
The prep was low for this episode.

183
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,060
I think this one's all about you, honestly.

184
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:39,240
Because when Patrick is asking around quality-oriented roles,

185
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,390
like what Alan does, I'm thinking

186
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,350
it's there's two versions of this in my mind.

187
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,830
Number one, what Alan does.

188
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,950
Number two, what Windows does.

189
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,390
Oh.

190
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,190
And between the two of us, there's

191
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,430
only one of us that has an opinion on this.

192
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,430
OK.

193
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,910
All right, while you were talking,

194
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,150
I had a chance to form some thoughts on this.

195
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,750
So it's interesting.

196
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,790
We should probably give some background.

197
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,950
Because it's very recent.

198
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,430
Microsoft has had a lot of Estets, testers, software

199
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,670
divide engineers, and test.

200
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,510
When we made this move, I can't say we kept them all.

201
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,470
But people moved into roles, whether development roles,

202
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,070
some of them.

203
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,590
Some of them did very well.

204
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,750
Some not.

205
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,070
People that were good test developers,

206
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,350
they're pretty good developers.

207
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,510
The thing I have discovered is that people

208
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,210
who were good test developers, for the most part,

209
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:39,360
are making themselves very well known as better developers.

210
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,000
My experience as well.

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,560
In Windows, they just decided to not have a test team,

212
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,560
but to have a quality team.

213
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,800
And they focus on telemetry, data science, really

214
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,880
business intelligence, and some of the illities.

215
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,600
Yeah, the fact that you said business intelligence

216
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,110
data science, I find nearly offensive.

217
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,150
And that's what they're focusing on.

218
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,830
I may poke a little bit.

219
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,490
So this is for background, where everybody went.

220
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,840
So when I came to this role on my team,

221
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,080
they wanted someone to think about this quality role.

222
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,640
Think about quality and being a role,

223
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,600
to think about quality and make sure all the activities were

224
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,240
being done.

225
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,480
I mentioned a minute ago.

226
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,880
That doesn't require a drink.

227
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,280
I mentioned a minute ago that on a unified engineering team,

228
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,720
all the activities, the quality and testing activities,

229
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,960
still get done.

230
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,000
And they wanted someone who actually knew what those were,

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,120
so they could get done.

232
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,720
And that's my role on the team.

233
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,960
So how do we grow and recruit those people?

234
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,160
I don't know that we do.

235
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:51,310
Not every team at Microsoft has someone like me.

236
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,710
Some do.

237
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,510
Most don't.

238
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,110
One of the goals for me on this team

239
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,290
was to show after this product ships,

240
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,610
and assuming it's massively successful,

241
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,050
I'd like to show this is how a unified engine.

242
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,650
This is the example, the template for how

243
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,930
a unified engineering team works.

244
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,930
You have some specialty around quality.

245
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,360
And this is where this is the role

246
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,160
that people who really get that systems thinking

247
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
of testing and quality, as you can see across the product,

248
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,800
can have a place to fit in a unified engineering team.

249
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,710
How do you recruit those roles, NFI?

250
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,040
One thing that's actually a little bit different these days

251
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,400
when you're recruiting from universities even external,

252
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,680
it was difficult, not hard, but difficult, more difficult

253
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,640
to recruit for test roles than it was, SDET roles,

254
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,800
than it was for SDE roles.

255
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,200
And the difference being mainly the industry stigma

256
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,440
around the test role.

257
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I think at Microsoft, most people got here, they go, oh, wow,

258
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,600
this is not banging on buttons.

259
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,600
But it was hard to get over that hump.

260
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,280
Now, since we recruit just for SDEs,

261
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,360
but we make sure that they have some aptitude, good aptitude

262
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,280
for testing and quality, recruiting is actually

263
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,960
a little bit easier.

264
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,640
But how do we find those people who are going

265
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,680
to grow into quality roles?

266
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,350
I don't think you know when you recruit them.

267
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,480
So a couple of thoughts as you were talking.

268
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,360
Number one, so we have probably a more relevant expert

269
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,400
on the Slack channel than us on that particular question

270
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:42,870
with respect to Steve Rowe, who is in a quality

271
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,710
team within Windows.

272
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,950
So I'll definitely publicly invite Steve

273
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,120
to address that question within the Slack channel.

274
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,420
Everybody who isn't on the Slack channel, of course,

275
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,380
you can still.

276
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,100
I'll say two things.

277
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,740
Let's do this.

278
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,140
Let's do episode 40.

279
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:11,300
One, I think Steve's quality team is better than most

280
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,740
or all the other quality teams as far as what they actually

281
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,500
have embraced it and figured it out from the beginning.

282
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,920
But also, I'll go out on a limb here without consulting

283
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,360
with Brant and say we should maybe

284
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,160
have used that little input right there I'm pointing out

285
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,040
on our new mixer.

286
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,000
And we could have Steve come in and talk about this himself.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,920
In fact, that would be a good topic to have.

288
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,880
We could talk to Steve about what

289
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,520
is the quality role in Windows and how does that

290
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,280
differ from what I do here?

291
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,920
Because I can't really speak for him.

292
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,040
One of the things that we just talked about,

293
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:54,080
I like your loophole here, is the Google Test Bash.

294
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,840
And essentially, all Google did is there's still testers.

295
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,800
They renamed is the accusation.

296
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,480
And I will state that at a still far too big.

297
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,200
I think you're confusing listeners.

298
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,560
We're talking about Facebook and their software reliability.

299
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,240
No, you talked about a, oh, I write Facebook claim.

300
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,480
We have no testers at the Google Bash.

301
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:14,960
Yes.

302
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,320
At the Google Test Automation Conference.

303
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,840
Right.

304
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,600
The best bash is the thing I'm going to.

305
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
Please, I've had coffee now.

306
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,240
Obviously, you have not.

307
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,160
Because you're getting your words all confused.

308
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,660
OK.

309
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,760
Thank you for adding clarification.

310
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,280
So one accusation could be, isn't Microsoft

311
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,520
just doing the same thing?

312
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:42,100
And I think the correct answer is, in a large degree, yes.

313
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,580
I think any time you, as briefly tangentatized,

314
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,860
any time you say Microsoft does blah,

315
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,220
or Microsoft, the answer is wrong, or right, or both.

316
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,060
Because the company's too damn big.

317
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,420
Ooh, new fallacy, listen.

318
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,920
My point is, even though Alan and I speak

319
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,800
to a particular direction and push for what quality

320
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,240
means and should mean, even large chunks of Microsoft

321
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,200
isn't fully aboard on this.

322
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,440
And I'm aware of one team that had moved to a unified

323
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
engineering model.

324
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,050
And now they're blatantly moving back.

325
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,710
And I think they're going to pay the price for that

326
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,000
from a productivity standpoint, not a political standpoint.

327
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,520
But you brought up Steve and quality roles.

328
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,960
Like the one thing that I do very much

329
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,140
like about how Steve's team's been rolling

330
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,820
is they're very deeply focused on the topic of quality

331
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,060
and recognize that it is not a synonym for testing,

332
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,380
whereas a lot of places it is.

333
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,740
So I like your suggestion.

334
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,380
In terms of recruit and grow, like if I were thinking

335
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,540
through, and there are many places where I could see

336
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:13,460
at the company and even in my organization,

337
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,340
where we could use someone like Alan.

338
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:25,360
The real challenge is, unlike when we were recruiting

339
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,880
for S-TET roles, there is no way in bloody hell

340
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,000
I would ever recruit someone for this role, say from campus.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,920
This is someone that you would want a crapload of experience

342
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,700
underneath their belt.

343
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,580
So this is.

344
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,860
Yeah, I think the way you do it is like right now I

345
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,700
have a very small team and there's

346
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:54,740
one of the guys on the team who I could see doing what I do

347
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,660
or growing into that role.

348
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
And I think that's the way you grow them.

349
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,980
And then there are, I mentioned on my team,

350
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:05,930
there are a lot of developers and some of them, many of them

351
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,970
are really good testers too.

352
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:11,010
And some of them, as they grow in their career,

353
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:16,860
they'll figure out how the pieces fit together

354
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,660
and look at them with experience

355
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,980
to get all these quality issues.

356
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,540
I think the person you put in this role,

357
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,140
not necessarily a direct testing background,

358
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,140
but I think the thing that helps me in my role

359
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,060
is the fact that I've been doing this for frickin' ever.

360
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,260
Yeah, there's a high degree of experience required.

361
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,820
And I think the recruiting model for this role,

362
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,660
even though, so Alan a couple of years ago,

363
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,740
no, it was just this year, sent me a message saying,

364
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,380
hey, I'm looking for another person like me, who do you know?

365
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:55,140
And that was a really hard question.

366
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,820
That was a really hard question.

367
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:04,940
Because it is very similar to today saying, hey,

368
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,380
I need a deep performance expert.

369
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,380
I need a deep security expert.

370
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:17,640
And I think that's where your role

371
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,800
is today.

372
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,180
Someone needs a deep quality expert,

373
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,140
but quality as a system function, not as necessarily

374
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,460
a super tester.

375
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,700
I think we'll see as time marches on

376
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,070
that we'll see a few more people in roles similar to Alan's.

377
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:47,480
But we will then, in fact, view it as a specialist role.

378
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,240
I think so.

379
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,760
Something I was going to say, oh, which reminds me,

380
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,340
I have, if you know anybody, I'll ask right here,

381
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,660
so the three can know over here in case they know anybody.

382
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,380
I'm happy to have someone external.

383
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,780
But my team owns everything from the moment

384
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
the code is checked in until it gets deployed

385
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,620
to our production servers.

386
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,980
We deployed to 12 servers now.

387
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,080
We're in data centers around the world.

388
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,880
You are the code factory head.

389
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,680
The crank of things.

390
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,480
And in between there, of course,

391
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,320
between the code checked in and going to production,

392
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,080
there's a lot of quality stuff that happens.

393
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,640
So the four of us own all that.

394
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,920
And it's not enough because with scaling,

395
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,920
we need help with mainly on the DevOps side,

396
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,840
Azure management, scripting, getting builds together.

397
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,800
So if you know anybody.

398
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,000
I know a lot of people on DevOps side.

399
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,760
OK, if you know anybody who's like an independent worker,

400
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,040
can just look at ambiguous instructions

401
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,160
and figure out what to do and get crap done,

402
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,000
send them my way.

403
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,400
The challenge is who's looking.

404
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,680
Yeah, yeah.

405
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,960
Same for the three.

406
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,000
If you know anybody, send them my way.

407
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,240
You know, I get ahold of me.

408
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
We're underwater.

409
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,880
I tell my team, we're like a car crash away

410
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:12,300
from being like setting our schedule back like two months.

411
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,620
We're a little bottleneck.

412
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:19,880
I don't like on a team when one person has all the knowledge.

413
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,560
It's a bad situation.

414
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah, that's a scary situation.

415
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,480
It's one of the things that is interesting.

416
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,790
So as you know, I've been running Agile teams for a long time.

417
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,310
All of my reports have been I've been sort of training

418
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,610
and guiding them for a better part of the last three years.

419
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:45,580
And now when it comes to knowledge sharing,

420
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:53,220
they are like in my office want to talk about it at a 101

421
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,060
irritated when knowledge sharing isn't occurring.

422
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,700
I don't know if we really answered that,

423
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,780
but we talked about it.

424
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:05,300
Yeah, so far two questions down and both answers are,

425
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,890
we don't know.

426
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,570
You know, you think for a nice even-numbered episode like

427
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,650
40 would be awesome and not like wishy washy lame.

428
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,850
Right, and the positive thing is, look,

429
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,530
we're already halfway done.

430
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,210
Great.

431
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:21,250
Well, actually, it won't look that way after I edit.

432
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,210
Oh, I see.

433
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:22,730
I see.

434
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,890
So even the word, so let me just say this right now.

435
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,010
As you're listening to the AB podcast,

436
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,890
I want to consider what you've paid for it

437
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,250
and you get what you pay for.

438
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,090
Actually, you don't even get that much because you've

439
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,220
paid with your time already.

440
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,300
Yeah, that.

441
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,060
And hopefully there is a reason we have three listeners.

442
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,100
Hopefully editing has made your lives a little bit better

443
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,620
than it would have been if you're actually

444
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,740
in the room with us.

445
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,580
Oh.

446
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,740
Completely random, like more random than random.

447
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,620
What is more random than random?

448
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,460
Now as a mathematician, we realize how stupid that is.

449
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,700
This is more random.

450
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,020
So we do tangents.

451
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,580
This then would be a random tangent,

452
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
which is not redundant.

453
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,980
This is like inception.

454
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,220
So I.

455
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,180
Tangent to inception.

456
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,180
I was quickly reminded that we have three listeners

457
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,900
which connected the dots of the fact that today's June 3rd.

458
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,100
Which.

459
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,140
Which means what?

460
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,660
Today is National Donut Day.

461
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,380
Holy.

462
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,740
Rollin' O's.

463
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,940
That's right.

464
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,780
B man.

465
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,980
I have to remember this.

466
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,260
Before I leave, because you have my favorite donut shop

467
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,100
right in this building.

468
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,380
One thing about donuts is we have a frost donut shop

469
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,580
right on our first floor.

470
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,800
Yes, I'll be spending 50,

471
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,680
50 friggin dollars for two dozen.

472
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,080
Yeah, they're.

473
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,240
But they're worth it in my mind.

474
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,720
I should buy some for our team.

475
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,600
I'll go down with you.

476
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,760
All right.

477
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,180
OK.

478
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,020
Next question.

479
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,140
Shall we continue?

480
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,060
And who's this one from?

481
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,740
Really?

482
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,390
Danny.

483
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,230
Brent writes like this cryptic shorthand on the whiteboard.

484
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,710
Yeah, it's it's Danny's initials.

485
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,910
Oh.

486
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,710
Tough algorithm there.

487
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,270
I only know people buy their internet handles.

488
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:17,230
So software alchemist, Danny Faught,

489
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,530
asks about what's the best way to communicate about?

490
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,010
Brent, do you write English?

491
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,970
It's English your first language.

492
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,010
What's the best way to communicate

493
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,810
about testing the emergent properties of a system?

494
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,810
Oh, you just left out a few letters.

495
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,080
Yes.

496
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,420
Got it.

497
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:40,140
Oh, so this is about non-functional testing.

498
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,940
Yeah, what he calls para-functional.

499
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,740
Chem Kater calls para-functional testing,

500
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,780
which I think it he asked why it didn't catch on.

501
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,820
I think it didn't catch on because it's a weird frickin'

502
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,620
name.

503
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,500
Absolutely.

504
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,860
I think non-functional is also kind of a weird frickin' name.

505
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,890
I just refer to him as the Illities.

506
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,410
Yeah.

507
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,410
And that's I've used non-functional,

508
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,770
if I'm in a group of people, that's sort of language

509
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,210
they expect to hear.

510
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,410
But usually I just call them Illities.

511
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,690
And then I list a bunch that don't end in Illity

512
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,580
just to add more confusion.

513
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,100
Stress.

514
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Yeah.

515
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,460
The Illities, you know, like.

516
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,620
Stress-ility.

517
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,820
That's how we fix it.

518
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,220
We just make up new words.

519
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,980
The Illities, like performance.

520
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,480
Illity.

521
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,980
Security.

522
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,540
Illi.

523
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,340
Security.

524
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,210
Yeah.

525
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,930
That's a tough one to say.

526
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,730
If chem can make up para-functional,

527
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,680
why not secure-ility?

528
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,440
Are you going to talk about this question?

529
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,120
Well, I actually read what Danny wrote,

530
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,080
so I can figure out how to answer it.

531
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,720
That's somebody.

532
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,520
OK.

533
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,740
The best way to communicate.

534
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,340
So I have a problem when I see the word best,

535
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,900
because I don't ever believe there's such a thing.

536
00:23:53,900 --> 00:24:00,550
There's always a better way to do something.

537
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:06,110
I'll talk about a story that I had just two days ago,

538
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:12,960
where we have this one team that's essentially

539
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,980
our DevOps team.

540
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,770
And they're operating off of what I view

541
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:29,140
is the dysfunctional equation that all of these teams do.

542
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,860
The first time, if you have a team that

543
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,900
is with a mission of something that's a broad scope,

544
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,800
and in our case, it's division scope,

545
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,120
and their job is to sort of cat herd, amongst other things,

546
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,460
their job is to cat herd the illates across all of the vision.

547
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,060
And what is the way that everyone does this?

548
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,780
V teams.

549
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,180
Yes and no.

550
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,500
But if I were to torture you longer,

551
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,860
I know you'd get to this.

552
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,100
The way everyone solves this is yes, with a V team.

553
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,420
But a V team that does what?

554
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,740
Of course, Alan, you're correct.

555
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,900
Produce a scorecard.

556
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,400
Boo.

557
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,200
Right.

558
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:26,480
So the discussion at hand was integration scenarios.

559
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,520
So I'm in Azure.

560
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:35,130
So an example would be creating a VM, deleting a VM,

561
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,300
launching an app service.

562
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,140
And performance comes up, which is a Iliity.

563
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,380
Perform-i-lity.

564
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,100
Yep.

565
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,260
You've pronounced that correctly.

566
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
Thank you.

567
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:56,960
And the typical way people do this is they put the scenario,

568
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,280
and then they put P95, or in this case, it was P95 or P99.

569
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,240
Those who don't understand what that means,

570
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,120
it's the 95th or 99th percentile of their performance.

571
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:18,160
It essentially means 99% of all transactions

572
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,360
were equal to or below this value.

573
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,660
And you do that because, in general, average is stupid.

574
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,580
Average is stupid.

575
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,470
But I pushed back and said 99 is also stupid.

576
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,270
I'm curious to hear why.

577
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,430
So the way that I have found the best way

578
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,190
to communicate in terms of performance

579
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:47,220
is by showing the distribution.

580
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,740
So generally, the distribution will

581
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,300
be a head-tail curve on almost every performance situation.

582
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,940
Agree?

583
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,900
Now, so if you go with 99th, then

584
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,980
you are including a large portion of the outliers.

585
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,550
By looking at the distribution, you can now decide, OK,

586
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,910
what's more important?

587
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,710
Pulling down the outliers or improving the experience

588
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:15,810
for the head.

589
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:23,530
So if you find that the head of the distribution, again,

590
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:31,960
a head-tail curve, if you find that 90% of that head-tail

591
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,240
curve is in the head, then you're

592
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,120
going to be better suited ignoring the outliers

593
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:45,750
and focusing on how do we make that 90% faster.

594
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:46,790
OK, thanks.

595
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,270
So this is one of those things where

596
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:55,480
P99 forces you to collapse it all into one experience.

597
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,310
And I'll introduce what I call the 80-80 rule.

598
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,880
It's not my rule, but I do share it.

599
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:13,820
80-80 rule is 80% of the value costs 80% of the effort.

600
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,740
But the other 20% of the value costs an additional 80%

601
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,220
of effort.

602
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:22,100
Yep, makes sense.

603
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,860
And so if you are looking, in my view, you look at these things

604
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,140
and you look at it as a system.

605
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,940
You look at it in terms of business value or customer

606
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,020
value, and then you break it down in Pareto order.

607
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,540
You want to not just have an overly simple, stupid system

608
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:49,120
that potentially wastes money on outliers.

609
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,780
Have you had enough time to think about?

610
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,900
Yeah, because that's very interesting.

611
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,420
Not sure to answer this question.

612
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,860
So I said a boo when you mentioned scorecards.

613
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:05,700
But often, depending on how you put it, how you build it,

614
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,340
scorecards can be the right solution.

615
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,500
Because people like to watch things that are red, turn

616
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,860
green.

617
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:17,930
And the thing to be careful of is driving the wrong behavior.

618
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:21,970
So this got brought up in the thread.

619
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:28,770
So the best way to communicate about these things, I think,

620
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:32,080
is the same as the best way to communicate anything.

621
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
So a scorecard.

622
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,400
I do like scorecards.

623
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,160
I don't like red, yellow, green scorecards.

624
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,560
It said good, bad, or on track.

625
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,960
Because the problem is, those type of scorecards,

626
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,760
you need to be able to look at something

627
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,520
if you're trying to communicate.

628
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,440
So let's view this.

629
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,440
You have this knowledge, and you're communicating outwards.

630
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,360
So the readers of this are your customers, of your output.

631
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,560
Your customers must be able to clearly understand what actions

632
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,970
need to be taken without questioning you.

633
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,250
And these red, yellow, green scorecards, don't do that.

634
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,570
I agree.

635
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,970
I had an angry moment a month or so ago.

636
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,730
I run our ship room.

637
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,570
And we had one of our, so the way

638
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,330
I took care of making sure our ILLITIES were handled

639
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,730
across the team with no testers is I put one of my peer

640
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,480
engineering managers in charge of every ILLITY I cared about.

641
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,870
So the engineering manager in charge of one of the ILLITIES

642
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,030
for the second week in a row showed this huge mass of red,

643
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,830
yellow, green.

644
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:51,350
And all I said was, everybody's working hard.

645
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,350
We're making some progress.

646
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,870
It's hard to tell from here, but everybody's working hard.

647
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,240
And there's useless.

648
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,880
You may as well show me a picture of a unicorn taking

649
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,440
a crap in the forest.

650
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,720
It would have been as useful.

651
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,240
Did you see the unicorn rainbow snippet at the end of Deadpool?

652
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,280
That cracks me up.

653
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,960
So anyway, the feedback to him was,

654
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,160
what does the team need to know about where this area is?

655
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,600
What are the action items?

656
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,800
What needs to be done?

657
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,360
What are the risks?

658
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,240
What are the goals?

659
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,960
Whatever.

660
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,920
Something around those areas versus a mass

661
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,880
of red, yellow, green.

662
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
So it was going back to your point,

663
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,840
there was nothing on there actionable.

664
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,440
There was nothing on there I could read and go, oh,

665
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,040
this is good.

666
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:42,520
This is bad.

667
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,680
It was just too hard to figure out.

668
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,550
If you have a scorecard, it should be painfully obvious

669
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,270
what it's telling you and what it means,

670
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,110
whether there's action to take, whether there's

671
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,510
risk to worry about that needs to be mitigated,

672
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:01,790
or whether it's truly on track and nothing

673
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,150
to worry about at all.

674
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,990
But if those things are missing,

675
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,160
the scorecard becomes useless.

676
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,240
There's, to piggyback on that, the other problem

677
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,610
with these scorecards is what's the goal?

678
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,810
And oftentimes, like, say, with performance, oh,

679
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:27,340
the goal is to bring P99 down to 200 milliseconds.

680
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,740
No, that's not a goal.

681
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,060
That is a stake in the ground, a target.

682
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,460
Yes, something along those lines.

683
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,800
The goal, in my mind, needs to be something that says,

684
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,360
this is the business benefit.

685
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,510
When I try to communicate these type of things,

686
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,710
generally what I try to do is I look at it, I analyze it,

687
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:59,140
and then I break chunks down into sort of Pareto order

688
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,300
of benefit to customers.

689
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:07,830
A lot of these things, you can just do ad infinitum.

690
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,670
Great, we have everything all green.

691
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,630
This is what we agreed to.

692
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,070
However, a customer still hates the product.

693
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:19,390
So great, we all agreed to.

694
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,350
We can all pat ourselves on the back

695
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:26,030
that we did the best we could, I guess.

696
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,910
But in my view, it's because you're

697
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,910
targeting the wrong goal.

698
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,750
You're targeting the goal of, I actually

699
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,390
had this conversation with an employee this week.

700
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,830
It's like, look, you learning to drive

701
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,600
is an uninteresting goal.

702
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,690
What's an interesting goal is we're

703
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,820
doing a road trip to Vegas.

704
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,620
And you're going to learn to drive in order for us

705
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,100
to execute on that road trip to Vegas.

706
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,940
So you hit on something, a nerve that really,

707
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:59,850
where I agree with you, really hard.

708
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:02,770
Because I think teams can often

709
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:06,090
focus on doing really good engineering.

710
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,610
We're going to put some targets and we're going to hit those.

711
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,050
And we're going to make sure that we can do this.

712
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,010
Our test is going to run.

713
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,970
Our meantime to failure test is going to run.

714
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,970
And we're going to make sure we get all this.

715
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,970
And they focus so much on just doing the engineering work,

716
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:23,530
they forget to make a product that customers like.

717
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:27,010
Execution is really important.

718
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,370
But executing in a valuable direction

719
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:33,570
is also really important.

720
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,930
And I find that these engineering teams that

721
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:40,850
are so deeply focused on progressing on execution

722
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:45,370
are often it's the age old trees versus forest discussion.

723
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,210
Right there they're inside the forest.

724
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,170
So like, oh, neat tree.

725
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,850
Let's do the one to the left now.

726
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,330
Yeah.

727
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:53,050
And going back to my role, that's

728
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:56,260
my part of my role on the team is

729
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,220
to make sure that the guys working on performance

730
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,460
aren't just, it's not hard work.

731
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,300
I go, so what's the user benefit

732
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,280
of getting to this goal?

733
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,320
And make sure there's answers for those questions.

734
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,320
So the answer I think so far that we've brainstormed through

735
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:21,930
is number one, communicate in a way that makes actionability

736
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,380
readily apparent.

737
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,620
Communicate in a way that discusses the system

738
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,380
in business terms.

739
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,860
And I would, there's with any change,

740
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,300
and a change can be an organizational change,

741
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,140
or a change can be an improvement in engineering.

742
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,020
One thing like I have said a million times before,

743
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,580
when you move to agile, if you make a big organizational

744
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:53,260
change, explaining why, like we want to be able to ship daily.

745
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,580
So in order to do that, we're going

746
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,380
to combine our engineering teams,

747
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,380
we're going to agile methods, blah, blah, whatever

748
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,540
you want to explain that.

749
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,940
Versus people go, oh, we want to ship every day.

750
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,300
This is the goal.

751
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,380
And to do that, we have a bunch of other stuff

752
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:06,940
we're going to do.

753
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,800
We're going to learn to drive.

754
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,320
Versus what happens to a lot of teams,

755
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,560
is like, hey, tomorrow you're all engineers.

756
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,960
We'll figure out what that means later.

757
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,400
It's like, the what?

758
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,480
So let's trench that over here.

759
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,640
We need to get performance better.

760
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,720
All right, let's work on performance.

761
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,240
Versus our customers are complaining about performance.

762
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,690
By June 30, we want them to be bragging

763
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:34,550
about the performance of our app over our competitors.

764
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,470
Maybe not the best goal.

765
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:40,710
I would love to see someone brag about that.

766
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,870
So we want to improve the user experience around performance.

767
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,350
We want to make sure people feel

768
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:50,630
that the product is snappy, whatever.

769
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,430
Because we think this will sell a million more units.

770
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,710
So why you're working on performance, why that's a target.

771
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:03,710
Yet, Amazon did this very, at least to me now,

772
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:07,310
very famous experiment, where they basically,

773
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:14,460
their landing page, they put a configurable sleep

774
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,180
in the loading of the page.

775
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,620
And they ran a series of experiments, A-B testing,

776
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:27,820
to be discussed by Alan Page in Vegas at a place near you,

777
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:36,110
as long as it's in Vegas, where they artificially slowed down

778
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,380
the render of their page.

779
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:44,280
And they tracked the abandonment rate of the customers.

780
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,360
So long story short, they were able to determine two things

781
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,160
that are critical.

782
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,190
Number one, how much a millisecond

783
00:37:54,190 --> 00:38:01,960
on their landing page is worth, and where, what's

784
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,480
done in economics terms, marginal utility, where

785
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,720
that utility dies off.

786
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:16,410
Where it's no longer useful to eke out that extra millisecond.

787
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,360
Because if they had a 10-second rendering page,

788
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,320
going from 10 seconds to 5 seconds

789
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,220
is going to keep way more customers.

790
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:31,600
But if you're already at 400 milliseconds,

791
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,220
cutting that in half to 200 milliseconds

792
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,460
saves you not as many customers.

793
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,200
It is not a linear curve by any means.

794
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,540
OK.

795
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,300
You went off on a tangent there, but did we finish the topic?

796
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:52,540
No, so I'll wind back to the performance thing.

797
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,540
And then this will be my coup de gras on this topic.

798
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,960
On the P95 and the P99, if you understand how stats work,

799
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,480
and again, if you guys remember what I just

800
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,000
said around the distribution and it being a head tail curve,

801
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,120
basically I communicated to them,

802
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:21,160
because I have found that a lot of business leaders

803
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,160
don't understand or appreciate data science lingo.

804
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,960
And I basically have shared with them,

805
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,400
look, if you want to have, let's say,

806
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,540
P95 as your one metric that matters for performance,

807
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,640
then if you want one metric that matters, is what I said,

808
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,600
is you need to be clear then on what you're focusing on.

809
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,280
Are you trying to reduce the variance of customer

810
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,070
experience, meaning what's the likelihood

811
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,020
of outliers happening?

812
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,080
Or are you trying to improve customer satisfaction rates?

813
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,000
Because these are opposite things.

814
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,640
And right now, your metric is going

815
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,890
to focus you on removing outliers from the system, which

816
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:18,410
I'm sure it's just code, it's not magic.

817
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,050
We'll get there.

818
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,570
But at the end of the day, if you're

819
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:25,370
expecting higher customer satisfaction rates,

820
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,130
I don't believe you'll get there.

821
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,930
Now, if you're expecting, say, a reduction what's

822
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,570
known as customer calls on CSS, yeah, you'll probably

823
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,330
get a reduction in customer calls,

824
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,050
because the customers who we really, the two or three

825
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:42,350
that we really tanked, they're going to be upset.

826
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:47,560
But that's not going to have a big impact on customer

827
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,770
satisfaction rates overall.

828
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,250
So you guys have to decide.

829
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,570
And in that case, I told them, there's

830
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,970
two metrics that I think are better,

831
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:00,490
one's known as the coefficient of variation.

832
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:06,940
That's much better at focusing on reducing

833
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,740
the variance of the experience.

834
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,980
How do we reduce some people having super fast,

835
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,740
and some people take 10 days for a thing to render?

836
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:25,230
And then median, I find, is a much better stat than P95.

837
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:27,220
All right, cool.

838
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,740
Hopefully that rambled around, and some sort

839
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,740
of answer to the question.

840
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,220
Yes.

841
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,340
We're generating more mail-back items.

842
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,320
One more.

843
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,170
Hey, Alan.

844
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,300
Here's a topic for your A-B testing show.

845
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,380
Our product has been rolling out more and more users

846
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,700
over the last few months.

847
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,620
Our CEO has decided that he does not

848
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,450
want to roll out to more users,

849
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,370
because we're hearing the exact same feedback,

850
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,290
or very similar feedback, from everyone

851
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,210
we've rolled out to so far.

852
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,330
My thoughts are that this is good,

853
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:05,090
because we're not finding more issues.

854
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,330
But I'm fighting against management

855
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,250
to try and push out our product to more users,

856
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,290
even before we fix these issues that are known.

857
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,900
What would you do?

858
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:19,270
So the feedback.

859
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,950
So it sounds like, to paraphrase,

860
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,870
the product is, there's a core set of issues.

861
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,950
We know that A, B, and C need to be fixed.

862
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:29,110
And we go to more people, and they tell us the same thing.

863
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,030
A, B, C need to be fixed.

864
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:33,190
Should we go to even more people

865
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,190
to hear those same things?

866
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,910
Or should we go to more people?

867
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,310
Or should we fix those things first,

868
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:39,990
before we go to more people, so we can get more data?

869
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,710
Do you think you could get more data

870
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,830
by going to wider customers?

871
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,710
Do you think you could find out about DE and F?

872
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,790
Or are you blocked on finding out about DE and F

873
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,590
until you get more people on there?

874
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:49,950
There's a balance here.

875
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:54,030
So one is, hey, we know about this feedback.

876
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:57,550
I presume work is in flight.

877
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:05,030
So the errors, how shall we hypothesize

878
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:12,880
on the president's feedback with respect to the customer?

879
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,340
Do we think the customer feedback is critical to the business?

880
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,860
Or do we think it's, hey, it's a couple of one-off bugs,

881
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,060
like, hey, this button's in the wrong place?

882
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,140
I think more fun.

883
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,860
It sounds like it's more fundamental things,

884
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,700
not necessarily button in the wrong place.

885
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,220
But a feature that would make the product more usable

886
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,700
is missing.

887
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:40,570
But it doesn't sound like it's a showstopper.

888
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,370
OK, I just thought of it another way.

889
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,850
So the question really is how I feel.

890
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,330
The feedback we have to date.

891
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:53,320
So this, I think, is probably the best current answer

892
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,920
in my head.

893
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:01,330
The feedback from the customers that exist today,

894
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:07,000
to what degree do we believe it is causing abandonment?

895
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,680
If we think it is not causing abandonment

896
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,800
and it's really more around taking something that's

897
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,020
good and making it delightful, then, yeah,

898
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,980
I would turn the crank another order of magnitude,

899
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,980
but only another order of magnitude.

900
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,380
So that's actually a good way to put that.

901
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,180
What are some good ways to measure,

902
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,860
I guess you could just look at usage.

903
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,860
I'm trying to think how to measure abandonment.

904
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,380
But it's how you can look at active users

905
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,640
and figure that out.

906
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,760
On a web app, one of the better ways

907
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:46,760
of measuring active users in this case for abandonment

908
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:56,070
is essentially the frequency and the,

909
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:58,190
they call it frequency and recency.

910
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,950
So how often do they engage with the product?

911
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,950
And how often do they re-engage with the product?

912
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:09,480
So you want to look at, you would

913
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,720
want to start tracking new users to the product

914
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,560
and then look at what are the typical rates,

915
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,950
how frequently did they come back to the product,

916
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:27,070
and then how many re-engagement sessions generally

917
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:31,750
do we see before that starts to slow down.

918
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:35,430
How do you correlate those A, B, and C features

919
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:37,950
that are missing with abandonment?

920
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:39,550
You can measure abandonment and you

921
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,190
can look at customer feedback to see

922
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,750
what they think is missing.

923
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,510
But how do you correlate the two?

924
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:50,640
The easiest way is to put a feedback app on the product.

925
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,080
So here at Microsoft, the most famous one

926
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,240
is we call Send a Smile.

927
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,120
Send a Smile.

928
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,120
And it sounds like they have something like that

929
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,720
because they're getting customer feedback.

930
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:07,110
Right, but now if you track what's

931
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,250
known as active, engaged, and then disengaging customers,

932
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:15,010
that's really what I describe there.

933
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:21,060
So looking at new users, then, and you light up the Send

934
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:26,260
a Smile, then you can, most people

935
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:30,330
when they instrument, you're able to see

936
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:36,410
the sessions of the persons who have contributed feedback.

937
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:40,000
And then you can say, OK, is there anything

938
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,240
interesting in the session?

939
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:47,760
In particular, you can look at the specific paths

940
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:55,480
under question and say, hey, you know what?

941
00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:02,680
The specific paths under question, these guys

942
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,840
aren't abandoning with respect to, or in comparison,

943
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,240
to say this other category of folks

944
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:15,080
or not even abandoning at all.

945
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,560
What you're trying to draw a connection to

946
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,960
is does this group that requires this,

947
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,440
what's the size of that group, and how

948
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,080
does it differ from the ambient abandonment

949
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,880
rate of your product that you're already an expert on?

950
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,240
Because that is just pure A-B testing right there.

951
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,000
Very cool.

952
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,960
All right, we are out of time for episode 40.

953
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,600
Yes, mailbag only.

954
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,880
Our second all-mailbag episode, we did one before a while back.

955
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,920
Percy will know the number because he memorizes them,

956
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,000
I think.

957
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,800
Yeah, actually, have you seen them?

958
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,200
I really like what Percy did on episode 39.

959
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,500
Oh my god, yeah, he did the live play-by-play.

960
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,540
I had to go listen to get it.

961
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,780
At 4302, I agree with you.

962
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,820
At 4323, I don't.

963
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,540
Yeah, I was like, what are you talking about?

964
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,420
Oh, yeah, he's right.

965
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,880
All right.

966
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,760
Later.

967
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,880
Hasta la vista.

968
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:15,480
I'm Alan.

969
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:15,980
I'm Brent.

970
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,480
Bye.

971
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,800
Bye.
