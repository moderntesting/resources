1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:10,270
Hello again, howdy

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:16,300
Hey, we're sitting farther apart today. It's odd for me here. Let me move closer. Okay. All right

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:24,500
One day we're going to release the video version of the a B testing podcast people will see our faces and never again

4
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,110
It'll be the final episode

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,110
Maybe for number 100 we should do a video

6
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,050
Okay, I'm kidding people don't want that. Yeah

7
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,850
Welcome to a B testing

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,090
Yeah, we just put an explicit flag

9
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,630
So anyway a B testing the podcast for software development software testing

10
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:56,950
data stuff experimentation leadership test management quality quality leadership and most lately modern testing and

11
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,810
Brent's laughing at me which is par for the course if you're new welcome if you're not you're used to this stuff. So

12
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,340
Thanks for tuning in again, I think it's episode 85. Is that correct? It is 85

13
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,650
But really we didn't figure it out till about 60. So maybe it's only 25

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,740
There were some good ones before then. Ah, you know 60 is when we really started off on the the modern testing theme

15
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,300
I don't want to say 60 because we'll come up with something new eventually

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,980
That'll be the the shiny thing for a B testing and then we'll say that's the new number

17
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,890
Sounds good Brent, right?

18
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,430
Bringing up I got it while we're podcasting here

19
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,370
Uruguay and France are playing I just need to check on the score. I have lost it

20
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,170
I'll bring it up sometime when Brent's talking. It's halftime

21
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,490
So yeah, it's work up time. I'm gonna cheer for

22
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,970
worldwide ah

23
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,970
Viva la France

24
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,990
Talking about the modern testing principles which you can read on

25
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:12,930
Modern testing org and today we're gonna talk about number four which we'll get to in just a second any

26
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,210
Thing else I should be caught up on before we get started, right?

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,400
No, let's just dive in this time. Wow. I know people are so you need it up people are gonna fast-forward

28
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,920
They're already talking about it what happened to their stories of bunnies and squirrels

29
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,380
Okay, Brent. Do you have principle number four loaded up where you can't see it?

30
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:40,580
I can't because the company where you work Microsoft is too cheap to let anyone who doesn't work there have access to Wi-Fi

31
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,140
While they're in the building unless they get like someone to hold their hand and sign their life away. So anyway, I have no eggs

32
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:53,020
Freakin two clicks. Yeah and wait for an email to come through those shitty exchange service. Yeah, you have a phone

33
00:02:53,780 --> 00:03:00,140
I'm looking at it right now. Yeah, it's it's a phone. Anyway, I'm done making fun of Microsoft for now. So

34
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,940
Okay, number four share principle number four

35
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,810
number four

36
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:15,610
We care deeply about the quality culture of our team and we coach lead and nurture the team

37
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,510
Towards a more mature quality culture

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,390
Awesome two big takeaways for me. We're gonna dive into I want to make sure we talk about the why it's important

39
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,390
Talk about what it is and a whole bunch of how but there's two big pieces one is quality culture

40
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,270
We're gonna have to define the crap out of that because that can mean about ten different things to five different people and the other

41
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,110
One is this aspect of leadership

42
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Where I think people

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,080
leading teams towards modern testing principles whether or not that's the

44
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,600
current or former test slash QA person

45
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,280
We need to not be passive and not wait for work to come to us

46
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,760
Like maybe we did 15 years ago in leading a team towards a modern testing culture

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,280
There's a lot of aspects of leadership. You need to be able to do to get that to happen

48
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
and the third call that I'm gonna say that

49
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,260
I think one of our earlier iterations had this

50
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
explicitly

51
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,720
But principle number four is

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,200
In our list. It's the community principle. So the leadership is not just

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,400
You know leading by example and being the best tester creating a community of quality. Yes

54
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,790
Creating and sustaining a community of quality anyone can create a community

55
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,150
Let's start with quality culture

56
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,390
Since that's probably gonna take 85% of the episode today

57
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,780
In various forms

58
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
What is a quality culture?

59
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:59,450
Will gets three different answers of the quality. Oh, very good. Very good. We are also the tautology podcast or not. Oh

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Ponder ponder ponder

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,180
The one thing I think I think

62
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,440
I'll put in one. I think it would be good idea

63
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,200
Here because between the two of us

64
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,590
Right. It's it's

65
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
Alan is

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,690
By far one of the best community builders I have ever worked with seen and observed

67
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,560
But the one thing I think is super important when we call out here

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,040
any time

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,550
there is

70
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,230
and I think this is

71
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:48,310
This is missed a lot and I think we probably need to explicitly call it out

72
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Anytime we talk about

73
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:00,470
The word quality just want to make sure the listeners understand. I am NOT talking about bugs

74
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,000
I am NOT talking about code correctness

75
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
These are

76
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,320
Separate concepts not mutually

77
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,320
But they are separate to me a quality culture is

78
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,010
around

79
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:21,380
how do we

80
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
build up a

81
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,380
strong a

82
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
active and a

83
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,540
For lack of a better word a non into it in intuition based

84
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,940
And I'll just add another useful

85
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,930
View of user empathy within the organization. This is about

86
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,440
For lack of a better word feelings in a lot of regards

87
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,390
Caring about the problems that our customers have

88
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,570
Remember care and quality are two sides to the same coin. They are they are I mean

89
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,810
quality

90
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,290
It's you know, there was a

91
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,230
An old podcast that you mentioned something from your music history

92
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
about art and

93
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,880
You mentioned that art is something that

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,210
Creates emotion or

95
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:38,450
The quality of art is in the interpretation from the user. Yeah, you mentioned some piece

96
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:44,310
I'm sure you you have it on the top of your head where there's like 17 measures of just nothing but silence

97
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,990
well, there's the John Cage four minutes and 33 seconds, which is just

98
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,830
in three movements, which is

99
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:56,310
Just silence but the but the music the art is the audience's reaction to that silence

100
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:00,470
there was a thing in the early 20th century called danger music where

101
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,830
the music the art was

102
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,750
Maybe these boxes you had to reach your hand into you couldn't see inside and some had

103
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,350
Fur and cotton and some had broken glass and razor blades

104
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:19,070
but the art was in your interpretation of your reaction to

105
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,030
The the value is in your reaction to the art

106
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,700
Quality is that not a very similar definition?

107
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,120
It is it's it's a lot of it is is the user reaction

108
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,220
Mm-hmm to what you've built right and you've made the metaphor or maybe it's not a metaphor

109
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,620
many times like what's what's higher quality the product with very few users, but no known bugs or

110
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,560
The or the feature product with a lot of bugs but a hundred thousand users

111
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:59,760
Yeah, I like to talk about Christopher Alexander Alexander when I when I bring this up, right he talks about

112
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,540
These positive and negative forces right and then

113
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,620
Do the force are the forces?

114
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,550
Aligned such that

115
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:22,170
That the person interacting with this the system at play or the in his case the architecture are they?

116
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:29,290
Guided towards positive thoughts or or negative an example. I'll bring up is

117
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,170
he once got called into a house and

118
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:39,020
They had a kitchen with two double doors

119
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:47,760
from the double doors from the kitchen you got to a patio then there was a staircase down to a lower patio and

120
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:56,920
He put or the there was a little picnic table on that lower patio and he found out that no one used it

121
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,690
They never they it was clear from the intent right they intended to have outdoor meals

122
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,360
But they didn't and so he looked at it and he just said oh, okay

123
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:16,160
He got a crew put the picnic table up on the upper deck and that fixed the whole problem

124
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,610
the issue

125
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:25,130
That he identified is hey one of the forces is in order to have a meal there. You had to transfer the the food and

126
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,590
Going up and down the stairs created enough of a friction

127
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,490
That they didn't enjoy

128
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:41,020
The table and it didn't take much like you could go oh, it's so easy to work around this

129
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,700
No, it's it's if you just have a little bit of negative

130
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,550
Force it just changes the entire scenario

131
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:57,230
Agreed. So let me rewind the stack a little bit. I think I like the way you brought it

132
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,630
upper or the you mentioned community because community and

133
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,070
culture have a lot in common, it's

134
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:09,750
shared mindset shared practices shared values shared vision shared goals a

135
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:16,080
Lot of sharing a lot of sharing but because you want a culture means people are a

136
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,970
Quality culture can't just be the a person going. Let's have higher quality. No

137
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,570
No

138
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,920
This is about you know as Barney says sharing is caring and

139
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,680
knowing that the muscle memory of

140
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,600
The group of folks that you are working with is heading towards

141
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,110
the same

142
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,300
For lack of a better word goal because a lot of the times these goals are emergent. They're not

143
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,580
Clearly understood up front sure we've talked about this before

144
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,060
They're adaptive challenges versus technical problems technical problems. All it is is an implementation thing

145
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,220
You got to figure that you got to look up some algorithms, whatever you're done adaptive challenges

146
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,140
You don't know the answer when you start you have to learn it as you go along and a lot of culture things fall in

147
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,720
That direction you have beliefs for sure

148
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,850
But you don't

149
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:22,050
You don't want to stick to them if you if you you want to be able to adapt to new knowledge gain

150
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,490
Yeah, when when starting a culture and I'm gonna get into my definition in a second because I actually created one for better or worse

151
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:35,590
But I'm reminded of a Weinberg quote where he says unless and until all members of a team have a common understanding of the problem

152
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,410
Attempts to solve the problem are just so much wasted energy

153
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:44,010
I think quality culture fits into that as well as a technical problem. You need to have

154
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,170
There's this ad car model which fits into this as well. Let me talk about that for a minute. This is from

155
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,570
consulting company called pro-ci

156
00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:00,530
Anyway, the model seems to work pretty well for culture change talks about awareness of the problem like okay

157
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:06,410
We need to have higher quality. There's the desire. Well, actually awareness is the act quality is bad. There's a desire to change the problem

158
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:12,690
Okay, we want to improve but until you can go each step builds another one once you have awareness and desire you need knowledge

159
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:17,050
You need maybe it's knowledge of tools or things you may need to implement

160
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,010
And then you need ability

161
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,580
You need the ability to do those things

162
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:27,220
So maybe you need some training and how to learn how to use Jenkins for CI or or whatever

163
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,460
Maybe you want to put some other?

164
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:37,050
Tools into your CI pipeline. Maybe you just want to get maybe people need some coaching or training on some agile concepts

165
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:45,730
Or maybe they just need practice. We have you have awareness desire knowledge ability and then finally you need a way to retain

166
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:49,970
those practices you need repeatability, so it's a it's a

167
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:58,570
Model that I like to use for thinking about how to move through changes awareness desire knowledge ability retain

168
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,740
Okay

169
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:07,260
Usually when I go into these speeches, I start with just two it's it's motivation and ability

170
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,760
But I think that a motivation definitely well it

171
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,340
You can't have motivation without the without the awareness. So it just puts a few extra

172
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:25,620
Stats around those. Yeah. Yeah, so the definition of quality culture I wrote and there are again, it's not perfect

173
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,460
It's the one I use

174
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:32,900
It's a shared mindset that delivering high quality software to customers is our top priority and that all of our practices support this effort

175
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,310
Yeah

176
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,820
I'm absolutely fine with that

177
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:46,000
Because it's vague and means nothing until you dive into the detail. Yeah the one thing

178
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,050
Mate, this is the thing. I think we need to hit hard on on

179
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,050
As I've already mentioned in this episode

180
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,580
right

181
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:02,700
What is quality and or more importantly? I think perhaps is what is what isn't?

182
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,340
quality

183
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,250
right

184
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,450
so

185
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:14,970
It is quality. I can't hit this enough. I think I'm gonna be repeating this until I die

186
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,150
Bugs and quality are not in any way shape or form

187
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,340
Sinner nims or antonyms are related one of those nims. Okay. Good

188
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,410
so point made yeah, I the way I think of it is

189
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
getting people closer to

190
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,260
Understanding

191
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
the the problems

192
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,510
That users are facing

193
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,760
how

194
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:59,490
The software organization is geared to solve it and how we're staying current because as we as we release we've already

195
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,690
talked about

196
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,330
The the need for continuous deployment the need for continuous integration

197
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,770
small batches

198
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:13,210
Those are small little

199
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,340
tests

200
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,500
to say hey customers are you happier and

201
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,470
Then and then sort of a discussion around

202
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,510
Okay, why or why not?

203
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,830
You have backed into an important question we need to answer something to interrupt with the question that you continue

204
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,350
Yep, so why is the quality culture important?

205
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,830
You actually already started answering it if you didn't realize it. Why is it important to have a quality culture?

206
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,670
Why is this a principle? Why do we think it's so important?

207
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,800
Okay, do I help you out? Yeah, hi. I'm not connecting the

208
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
So

209
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:01,060
The reasons that a quality culture are important and small batches contribute to a higher quality culture

210
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:06,040
If you're able to deliver quickly, we want to get feedback from our customers more often

211
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,100
We want to be able to understand and react to what they're doing

212
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,640
We want and at the same time we want to reduce risk in our ability to do that

213
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,200
Yeah, all the culture helps with those things and many more

214
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,960
But you're talking about those realize that's part of a quality culture and in order to function in the way we want to function and to

215
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,800
Keep and retain and engage more users. We need that high quality culture and the key thing

216
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,120
I think you talked about just a second ago is

217
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,910
Actually, I love how you phrase that I felt a bit surprised you started off at contributing it to me

218
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,950
Sure

219
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,550
Yeah, yeah, that's exactly where I was going Alan like the continuous deployment

220
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:51,910
We talked about it in some regards with respect to risk minimization, right?

221
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:57,130
This is this is one of the reasons why companies hire testers today

222
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:03,190
They're kind of like an insurance. Yes on the product, right? I will pay and

223
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,070
Thousands or millions of dollars to do an amount of testing to reduce an amount of risk, right?

224
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,460
But

225
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Here we're shifting it towards

226
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:21,540
No, there's another reason why we want these small batches and that that is so that we can react

227
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,890
To knowledge gained. Yes

228
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:28,010
knowledge gained

229
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,050
with respect to

230
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:33,180
Hey, is this causing pain or?

231
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,680
Is this creating delight?

232
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,460
And I like to light delight your customers

233
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,710
It's sad that that meme ended here within Microsoft. No one talks about customer delighters really much anymore

234
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,500
No, but anyway, it is what it is

235
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:58,430
The other thing that I think is important around building the quality culture

236
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
It is all about knowledge share

237
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,140
Knowledge sharing in any system that

238
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:17,970
In a software world, I'll just I'll just say it this way if you have a system in the software world

239
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,490
that contains human beings and

240
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,570
You're not

241
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,570
working towards

242
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,220
Creating something that optimizes on

243
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,820
Utilizing the knowledge within those human beings

244
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,060
You're really

245
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,180
putting yourself

246
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,860
Not in harm but but you're slowing yourself down

247
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,250
Software is knowledge work. Yes, it is and the great thing about

248
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:56,700
Knowledge is that the more you give away

249
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,320
The more there is in the system a

250
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,660
Quality community given given an agile world and sort of an emergent goals

251
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,340
right

252
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,340
by by constructing a

253
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,580
Place where ideas can come together

254
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,390
What happens?

255
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,390
New ideas get formed

256
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:26,170
We may have mentioned this before

257
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:35,360
Thousand times yes, and I can't hit it enough we in the knowledge worker

258
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,370
business

259
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,030
you want to make a mechanism where

260
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,880
the these ideas are

261
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,270
coming together

262
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,750
new ideas form and tested and try out and

263
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,060
that is

264
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:00,060
One place particularly that if it's around the quality culture

265
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:06,460
That's one place where you're really going to accelerate the achievement of shipable quality

266
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,220
And when I think about a high quality culture, I'm thinking about a culture that is purely in optimizing mode

267
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:19,860
So they're in a they're just in a place where everything is about learning and adjusting so to recap the first 20 minutes here

268
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,280
The quality culture is a shared mindset about how we're gonna make quality software and we do it

269
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,440
It's important to do it because it enables us to

270
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Accelerate the achievement of quality

271
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,360
Enables us to much better do that. I'm gonna tweak that because it's I don't think it's about how we're gonna make software

272
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,620
I think it's about how we're going to solve our customers problems. Yes

273
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,910
Right because customers don't want software. They want their damn problem solved, right? So I want to do

274
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:55,990
Some what like what is a quality culture and then a whole bunch of how is it cool that fit in your agenda?

275
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,240
well, so the second part the second part of the

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,470
The principal

277
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:13,670
specifies that one of our goals is to coach lead and nurture the team towards a more mature

278
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:22,310
That is the how so I want to talk about what a more mature quality culture is and then how we lead teams towards that it

279
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,720
The second yeah, and then what is a more mature because it

280
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,880
That's me that that invokes thoughts of any number of

281
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,120
Maturity models, so I have a thing against maturity models

282
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:45,360
So I and only because and I can get over it, but I've just seen them used wrong so many times

283
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,840
and with the biggest culprit being CMMI which a lot of our European listeners have had to deal with and

284
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,280
Two huge problems I have with models like that is CMMI

285
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,960
You go from lockstep to level 1 to level 2 across a whole bunch of different areas

286
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,400
Whereas it may even make business sense for you to grow your maturity model in

287
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,600
different rates in different areas or

288
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
attributes of quality

289
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:18,400
the other thing is is a lot of companies wore their CMMI level like a badge and it turned into much like tester certification a

290
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:26,800
a maturity model certification level where people would pay money and if you if you paid more you might get a higher

291
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:34,840
Rating so it's just I don't like that. I like the model as being a discussion point not a blueprint

292
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,120
It's a way to figure out where you want to improve so that disclaimer in in

293
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,120
Front of it. Yes, it's a maturity model, but please use the

294
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,880
Use the model all models are wrong some are useful

295
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,560
It's a model for learning and a model for assessing and figuring out what you want to do not a badge to wear. I

296
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,130
don't disagree

297
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,390
Maturity model the one thing

298
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,520
quite honestly that that

299
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,000
that I am

300
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,270
I'm not wired. So maturity models are great because they kind of I like them to help

301
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,410
describe

302
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:18,440
sort of a

303
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
known set of patterns

304
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,310
around

305
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,210
what typically people will

306
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,470
once they've mastered a particular amount of knowledge

307
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,120
Where they immediately realize oh if we mastered this amount of knowledge

308
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,800
We'd be able to do these other things, right?

309
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,700
If you remember the a Sierra

310
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,980
Stuff we talked about here a long time ago around data

311
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,140
Right a line collect inform recommend act

312
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,570
Right that that's kind of a journey, but you wouldn't pick much to convert it to a maturity model

313
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,250
Describing going from data oblivious to data centricity

314
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:15,010
Right, but I don't I don't prefer that I prefer sort of a guiding light. Yes and part of the main reason why is

315
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
I view them as

316
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:27,640
Well known sort of practice patterns sure, but I see them often being referred to as best

317
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,220
Practices and that concept offends me. Yeah, it's easy to use them incorrectly

318
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,580
I like the idea of there's another problem on the plus side for the model

319
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,500
Here's a problem they help solve and then we'll talk less abstractly and talk about a maturity model that I'm building for my team

320
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,460
Or my teams. I think often people see okay. We're here

321
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,260
Current state we want to be there the desired state. Let's just do that, but you can't there's a whole

322
00:25:53,820 --> 00:26:00,500
100 baby steps in between so one thing a maturity model like construct does is lets you see some

323
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:06,800
progression towards infancy to adulthood lets you see what adolescents and and and

324
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,300
Teenage years are like in between as a metaphor for maturity or an actual

325
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,450
Not really a metaphor because that's actually actually is maturity

326
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:22,250
I've been working on trying to figure out trying to walk the talk and figure out what is a maturity model for going to figure

327
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,250
how to improve this

328
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:31,120
So I started thinking a lot about what attributes make up a quality maturity

329
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:34,720
And I came up eventually with what I think is a pretty good list

330
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,520
It's probably not perfect and because everything I do iterates all the time

331
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,720
It doesn't matter but I came up with eight or nine different areas

332
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,540
There's testing breadth which is like we just do functional testing to we test we actually

333
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,640
Contextually test all the things that you know, we know when the test reliability security, etc

334
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,580
We do the right right breadth of testing. There's the quality and test ownership. Are the testers doing all the testing?

335
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,580
Or are the testers merely coaching in some cases principle number seven

336
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,700
Maybe not needed because the teen just gets testing testing is part of what they do listening to a podcast this morning

337
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,700
I won't name it because it wasn't very good

338
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,650
But it even in talking about DevOps and the in the podcast I was talking about

339
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:24,250
They were still referring to testing as this unique phase that happened during the process

340
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,250
I just it just made my head shake a little bit

341
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:32,730
Bug lifecycle we've talked about bug backlogs and how those are a bottleneck I think

342
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:38,930
There can even be maturity of how you deal with those from the traditional bug backlog on one end all the way to

343
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,250
Working with a zero bug policy and bugs are dealt with very efficiently and quickly as they come in

344
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:47,650
I know you say this isn't part necessarily part of

345
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:54,170
Without the testers job, but we don't talk a lot about code correctness and code quality, but I think there is a maturity in

346
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,570
in

347
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,230
Code quality code correctness tools how you use coverage analysis tools

348
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:06,770
Etc in your life's up part of your CI. I think you have to do those in order to reach levels of quality elsewhere

349
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,250
Yeah that that

350
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,130
These are for me. They don't have to be for ya. That's fine

351
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:20,150
Customer the data analysis we've talked about a lot of times. This is basically can go

352
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,770
maybe not align exactly with your

353
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:30,450
Your model of oblivious aware driven centric, but there is a level of

354
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:35,530
Starting with oblivious and moving to data centric actually maybe maybe as those

355
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,710
Maybe that that maturity model fits really well within this quality culture

356
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:44,980
The development approach this is where the agile practices come into place you have you can have a total ad hoc

357
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:52,380
People work on whatever it's done whatever sort of thing or on the other end of the higher maturity you have super small batches and

358
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,900
and

359
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,700
the process the process is used to

360
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,390
Build the software or to think about how things are broken down are very mature and efficient and just a few more

361
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,470
learning an improvement where

362
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:13,390
Do you bother to learn from on one end? Maybe you don't even bother to learn mistakes or things where blame happens?

363
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:20,070
But on the other end every failure is an opportunity to learn and that opportunity is taken

364
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:26,830
Very good retrospectives happen on these teams, etc. And then finally you need some level of leadership support

365
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:32,850
And not I don't think is leadership mandating everyone follow all these other practices

366
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:39,590
I think for culture change one of the things doesn't have to be like the person at the top leadership support this can be

367
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:45,590
When you see good quality practice is happening. You need people who will

368
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,860
Point them out and celebrate them people that will you that reinforcement of

369
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,200
Excellent. This team is doing blah or this person is doing blah. This is great

370
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,160
You need a level of support if you have a shared vision or shared values around quality

371
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,360
reiterating those Pat Lincione in his book

372
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,840
the advantage talks about the power of

373
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,240
organizational health

374
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,420
which has a lot to do with mature quality organizational health with product quality and

375
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,070
his

376
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:23,470
Four steps which are really interesting and I love them for building a healthy organization are to

377
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,150
Create a cohesive leadership team

378
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:35,610
Create a great division clarify the vision communicate the vision and re communicate the vision that was five so two of those are actually

379
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,610
combined but it's about

380
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,060
if

381
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:49,220
You have beliefs or values and how you're approaching your engineering efforts or how you approach solving customer problems

382
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,390
you should

383
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,950
Live those how many times do you giving double from Microsoft? How many times in your?

384
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:05,190
Microsoft career which is over 20 years now, right? Yeah almost 25 have Wow. I didn't make it that far

385
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,710
have you

386
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,750
Seen some vision get blasted out whether it's like for your organization and then

387
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,590
No reinforcement of it. Nothing ever happened with it again. It kind of faded away people didn't know what it was

388
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:26,260
If you're really serious about this you need to make sure people it's part of how people function

389
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:33,520
Unity has these customer values around democratized game development solve hard problems and enable developer success

390
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,420
Which actually come up in conversations all the time

391
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,000
I hear stories from my Amazon friends about how their values come up meetings all the time

392
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,600
for better or for worse, I

393
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,680
think if you're going to have if you really want to reinforce and ingrain a shared mindset you need to

394
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,240
Reiterate and clarify and celebrate

395
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,960
Those values the one thing I didn't hear

396
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,240
In in a lot of that like I would actually

397
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:09,360
And maybe maybe that's the right thing in the maturity model. We're in right now

398
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,160
with respect to

399
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,060
To MT although it is interesting

400
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,240
so Alan asked me on

401
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,340
slack just the other day that

402
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,360
Or maybe you made a statement around

403
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,640
surprised not surprised at how

404
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,200
The the community at large is responding to MT

405
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,390
right

406
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,240
We're sort of

407
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
We're sort of

408
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,660
If I were to put it this way, it's sort of a polarizing

409
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,080
There's one set of folks that seem to be saying ah

410
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,850
That's what we do

411
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:01,850
Thanks for giving a name to the practice something to that effect and then there's

412
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:06,170
another set of folks that are kind of

413
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:12,040
Going oh that will never ever ever ever work

414
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:19,760
Right in yeah, there's there's there's there's folks in between but that's sort of where I see the polarization

415
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,320
going

416
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,720
Yeah, there's a lot of in between I do talk to a bunch of people go that's yeah, that's where I want to be

417
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,840
We're not there

418
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,830
which I think is actually a much better place to be in then that'll never never never work because

419
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,800
You're already proven wrong it does work. Yeah

420
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,480
Those the folks that that's claim it'll never work my them

421
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,920
I just sort of

422
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,380
Ignore them and I used to look at them and go all right

423
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:05,370
Do you not pay attention to what's happening in the space and

424
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,790
I basically found out that the answer to that is no

425
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,910
right and I

426
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:21,470
Neither have the time nor the patience to sit down with them and walk them through what they

427
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,470
Should have been paying attention to

428
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,940
On quality culture

429
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:38,820
So I think a lot of those techniques and a lot of those approaches are some a lot of places where where people can start with

430
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,630
today

431
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:47,520
I'd really like to see this shift towards more again

432
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,360
It is not focused on the process. It does not focus on any particular technology stack

433
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
This is primarily around

434
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,810
people people not only in terms of

435
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,500
I have said this on many times before

436
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:12,180
Any time you're trying to make a change there are three things that you need to change simultaneously

437
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,590
The people the technology and the processes

438
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:25,220
So we talked about the technology, but if you if you change the technology, but don't change the people's mindset

439
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
you're not going to be able to

440
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,020
Impact the the process which is the glue between technology and people

441
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,910
You can't change people without the why you can't it sure helps a lot

442
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:45,580
You can change people without the why you could use command and control aspects

443
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:51,980
But I recommend strongly against that because it has a top end on how you scale. Absolutely. Absolutely

444
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,900
One thing I want to bring up and then I want to dive into the how and they just if I do it

445
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,030
right old segue

446
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,060
the

447
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:06,380
Method I used to come up with those list of quality attributes I wanted to improve you should come up with your own

448
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,460
Don't copy mine you can but you shouldn't the method I use that of a book

449
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,420
I've referenced a lot on this podcast in my blog and etc. But called leadership on the line by Ron Heffetz and

450
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,530
this is where this

451
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,890
concept of adaptive challenges come from that I mentioned earlier on the episode and

452
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:29,770
one of the things you do to help solve an adaptive problem is to identify the current state and

453
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:35,620
The desired state and I what I did was a variation on that. I thought about what are I just

454
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,770
basically affinity exercised

455
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:46,290
By myself all the different things. I thought all the different engineering teams I work with and even indirectly

456
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,210
What would that minimum level look like and then?

457
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,130
for all those things I thought about what would the

458
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,760
Highest level look like and then I did some consolidation where I was like

459
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,560
Oh, these things are the same as these things. That's right eventually got down to those eight or nine categories

460
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
I have and then once I

461
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,720
vetted sort of that beginning stage and then the end stage I filled in a couple levels in between and ended up with a

462
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,650
For better for worse maturity model to be used as a discussion point figure out how teams can improve

463
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:27,690
Their quality culture you can do this exercise yourself for the things that you care about for your team in your context

464
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,970
So now that we have that

465
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:37,310
The next step and this is gonna be different for everyone as well. The next step is about

466
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,820
Making that change happen. That's for the leadership

467
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,100
That's for the leadership aspect and the community building aspect of this principle coming to play

468
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,920
Yeah, the I definitely view

469
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,260
The community building part of this is

470
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,540
Is

471
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,540
growing other leaders

472
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,050
There's another book

473
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:08,230
I can't remember the name of but another model of leadership where you have to be in a position of leadership and then have people's

474
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,490
permission to lead them which is about establishing trust and

475
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,050
There's a few levels in between and they one of the higher levels is you're able to

476
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:21,090
You're not able to more of your focus is on building other leaders and

477
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,400
I realized for better for worse

478
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,560
Brent just slipped off his computer a lot of my success and my my success is in

479
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:37,080
Helping move myself out not of a job out of a role is

480
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:43,890
I need to that is hinged on my ability to make the people that work for me now

481
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,820
Good leaders who can build other leaders

482
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,700
so they need to be in much as I'm worried about building community and

483
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:56,500
And leadership they need to be able to be leaders and build community as well. They need to build their own

484
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,260
Quality communities and quality cultures and the teams they work on so I've done a lot of

485
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,260
Over the years a lot of leadership training

486
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,940
one of the things

487
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,930
I'll absolutely share

488
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:17,390
Whenever a mentee comes to me and says hey, I want to be a lead

489
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,870
I

490
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,870
could tell you I

491
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,190
don't know but

492
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:27,870
80% chance that this speech is gonna load

493
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,700
You want to know what the single most important?

494
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,180
aspect of a leader is

495
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:41,440
Please tell me they have followers

496
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,710
True this seems like a tautology

497
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:52,550
It is not this ties right in that principle. It's one thing being a position of leadership

498
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:56,310
it's another level up to have followers or as

499
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,950
This Maxwell maybe as the author to have permission to lead

500
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,790
Yeah, there's a that it's it's a line with that permission to lead

501
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:13,620
The you cannot be re-orged into or out of

502
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
leadership

503
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,420
You can be re-orged into and out of management

504
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,120
leaders have followers and

505
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,740
a

506
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,940
Follower is someone who has made a conscious decision

507
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:36,540
To go in the same direction you are right? Um, so there's

508
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:44,800
To to be good at leadership. You have to be good at communication so that your goals are clear

509
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:48,570
And you have to be good at

510
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:56,780
Influencing and and inspiring others to decide to walk your path

511
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,860
right it this

512
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,300
And then there's another speech that

513
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,740
In this leadership training I've done years ago

514
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:15,160
Right. There's this definition. It's somewhat controversial, but I think it applies here. How would you define empowerment?

515
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,630
Empowerment is very simple

516
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:21,730
empowerment means

517
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:26,050
Others would make the same decision you would in your absence

518
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,430
That's an interesting definition. Yeah, it's some as I mentioned it's somewhat controversial

519
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:38,850
But if you empower someone to make the decision

520
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,480
What essentially are you doing? You're essentially saying

521
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:48,260
Do you think you're saying?

522
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:56,820
So let's say you empowered one of your employees to make a decision in that decision with the same data is

523
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,400
Diametrically opposed to the decision you would make

524
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,240
Right there's a strong chance

525
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:08,430
You're gonna stop their decision-making process

526
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:15,660
Right, unless you unless you can springboard it into a learning lesson or along these lines

527
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,220
This is important. I just read something as recently and I wish I could would have wrote it down

528
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,660
But what's the difference between delegation and empowerment? Oh

529
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,050
That's actually pretty

530
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:34,410
Delegation is I decide you do

531
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
Empowerment is

532
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,860
Is essentially you decide

533
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:49,950
And we do we do you do someone else does I think the do part is

534
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:57,800
Irrelevant there, right? Yep. All right. Where are we going?

535
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,720
We were trying to veer towards and in and dancing around the how

536
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,650
Yeah, so you should take points on that one in this conversation because you've done it a bajillion times

537
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,460
try stuff

538
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,910
fail learn the exact in an

539
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:24,150
organizational change and in improving quality in the how it's just like a

540
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,550
Just like good agile software development. You need to

541
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:35,630
Don't try and make sweeping changes at once. Don't sweep in with mandates and saying we're doing blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

542
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,460
Try little things

543
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,100
Stuff works do more of it or try more things when things don't work

544
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:49,820
Figure and don't just give up do that pivot or persevere the same as you do with experimentation and figure out

545
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,980
Well, why didn't this work? What should we do differently?

546
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,460
What areas do you want to focus on it all those areas I gave earlier?

547
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:01,830
Do you want to would you want to work on improving all those at once maybe probably not

548
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,450
Figure out which ones are the most bang for the buck but make small changes if you're if you have a huge bug backlog

549
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:10,730
Say, okay, we're not gonna have any bugs long any bugs

550
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:16,330
Stage one. Let's see if we can get down to no bugs older than a month three months

551
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:23,490
Whatever makes sense for your team figure out what the right baby steps are going back to heffits leadership is disappointing people at a level

552
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,650
they can absorb

553
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:29,890
So if you try and make a sweeping change people are going to be too disappointed. They're gonna shut down. They're gonna rebel

554
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:33,970
This falls into the boiled frogs parable, but all these things work

555
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:40,490
You need to make lots and lots of small changes and evaluate all the time that said

556
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:43,290
Do you think?

557
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:47,840
Ripping the band-aid never works. I think you need to look first

558
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,630
ripping the band-aid can work

559
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:54,550
I have been on teams where we said screw it. We're killing we're just gonna

560
00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:01,870
Declain bug bankruptcy and close anything older than you know, two weeks fix all the rest and start from there

561
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,780
So you can rip the band-aid off if you but you kind of need a

562
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:12,520
Majority or large part of team buy-in or that culture or that shared values first

563
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:18,060
So you need you do need to take time to see whether it's to see if it really is a tourniquet

564
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,760
Yeah, I was I was actually just thinking about that right? I think I told the story last time

565
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,130
Where when I went to development and being I started off with doing scrum

566
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:35,540
But I described Kanban and I said we're gonna do scrum on the way there

567
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,500
Right and then when scrum failed they said how about this Kanban thing?

568
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:46,300
Right it so so in that particular case, it's a lot easier to rip rip the band-aid

569
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:52,980
When yeah, but the team was ready the team was ready for it. They asked you they were ready for that change

570
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:58,740
Well, they did they did they still didn't understand it. They were just like well this sucks. Let's not do this

571
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,260
Yeah, look just don't assume everything's a band-aid and don't assume everything's a tourniquet

572
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:08,900
Disappoint people at a level they can absorb or as I paraphrase at a level they can tolerate and

573
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:14,850
Yeah, there's there's this concept

574
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:21,870
You've heard of out of the box thinking sure love out of the box thinking it's fun

575
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:27,030
Have you ever tried to implement something that was out of the box?

576
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,900
Give me your example, then we'll get back on track

577
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,780
well, so some the example I'm thinking of right now is

578
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:39,190
When I was

579
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:44,970
Leading in in media center and they had

580
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,690
Gone six years and never passed BBTs

581
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,300
Okay, and it's not a great example, but it's it

582
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,640
They were

583
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,880
holistically entrenched and

584
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,230
This idea is the

585
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:11,180
Way we we need to move forward like they as I described back then they were heavily solidified in

586
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,680
No, what we need to do is have our end-to-end tests in our BV T suite, right?

587
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,920
And this is just a horrible idea

588
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,160
But their whole organization was bought in

589
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,900
But they couldn't get BV T's to pass

590
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,760
In that particular case and I met with a whole lot of resistance

591
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,940
But I basically said no we're gonna stop that. Yeah

592
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,300
Yeah, that's just a dumb definition of what a BV T is

593
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,030
For sure, but I mean the point the point is I was surrounded with people

594
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,620
That said we've tried everything

595
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,280
Last six years. We tried everything we can't make this change

596
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,640
Alright, and some of the times like one of my favorite things to do is

597
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,000
When I realized that a change has to be made but

598
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:11,040
People want to see something but they don't feel it can be done

599
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,920
Because of politics or or

600
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:19,200
You know interactions or people complaining

601
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,280
Right. That's a great place to just rip the band-aid, but it's sure but you're out of the box

602
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:29,120
And what turns out to be a very very small box

603
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,480
Yeah, if

604
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,680
So I think the point is you want to try

605
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,100
These little things they can be things that are incremental or things that can be

606
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,540
Incremental changes from where you are or maybe some out-of-the-box things that can leapfrog you

607
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,620
So what I was gonna say if it's too out of the box

608
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,220
Then what you want to do is around the box thinking so you earlier you're talking about where are you now?

609
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:55,740
Where do you want to be?

610
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,100
right and a third step is

611
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,500
Alright, what is the first action?

612
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,710
that you should take

613
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,750
towards where you want to be

614
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:10,750
And communicate that one action is actually the goal there are a zillion

615
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:17,660
Quilts you can go look up on the internet that basically say the hardest part of any change is starting. Yeah

616
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:24,120
So for anything you want to improve just start just try something then the other bit I wanted to get to is

617
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,560
They're gonna try a bunch of stuff you use different kinds of thinking you're going to

618
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,680
Reflect and try and find new things to do to you're trying to create a learning organization

619
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:40,360
I think it's a lot of parallels between the learning organization as Peter Senge talks about and a culture of quality

620
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,600
In Senge wrote the fifth discipline where the five disciplines

621
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:49,720
Well, the fifth most important one is systems thinking which I think is highly related to a quality culture

622
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,160
but

623
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:56,560
Once you start getting these changes to happen, you need that reinforcement. You need

624
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,280
Some celebration of hey, we're able to cut down our cycle time blah blah blah here. Hey, we were able to learn

625
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,920
This thing from data weren't able to do before. Oh, hey, it looks like we have not a bug older than seven days in

626
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,920
three months

627
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,800
Those little you don't need to have a huge party for all these things but celebrate the things

628
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:21,020
That are leading you in the direction you want to go and by celebrate. I mean, you know, call them out in a slack channel

629
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,760
call them out in a

630
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,080
Standup give some recognition for those things because those that recognition to some people

631
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:37,160
Often is worth more than giving them a monetary bonus, especially in front of people, but it also motivates others to

632
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,760
Try and model that behavior so those things as a leader are very very important you want to

633
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:47,560
inspire your followers

634
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,040
Use your language from earlier to

635
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:55,800
Model the behavior to the behavior you want to see so when you see what you when you see what you like

636
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Make sure other people know that you like it

637
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,170
Or know that it's appreciated. You have to be careful with that

638
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:05,900
right, because

639
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,420
It does it can run the risk

640
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,360
They get misinterpreting. So you want to make sure that what whatever you're celebrating

641
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:23,160
you're celebrating it as a team goal achieved and that it's not being interpreted as oh

642
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,020
I'm gonna do this because this is what makes Alan happy and

643
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:35,440
Then I'll get a good review. Yeah as well right cuz that would then reinforce I see how that could happen at Microsoft so

644
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:44,500
So that is important depending on the culture where you are. I'm glad I was able to load you know load up another Microsoft thing well

645
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:53,080
It's a company obsessed with competition both against other companies and internally with teams against each other and people against each other

646
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:56,900
That is for better for worse the culture that drives Microsoft

647
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,640
Yeah, that aspect is is

648
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,320
The intra team

649
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,300
Competition

650
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,820
I'm not gonna lie to you and say it's not there anymore

651
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,920
but it is

652
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,080
vastly

653
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:20,160
It was there in full force a year and a half ago. It's vastly toned down. All right. I can't comment after that

654
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:25,310
Alright anything else you want to talk about as far as

655
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,370
principle number four

656
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,370
No, I think we're out of time anyway

657
00:52:30,930 --> 00:52:34,930
Excellent well one last thing to say is viva la France

658
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,890
France just beat Uruguay Oh

659
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:42,010
France will go to the semi-final in the World Cup. I'm very excited

660
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:45,730
I predicted France would go to the final where they would lose to Germany

661
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:49,250
But Germany failed to make it out of the knockout stage so

662
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,520
that happened I

663
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,280
Picked a bracket before the before the tournament started and I get another long outro

664
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:05,200
The left side of my bracket was I was France perfect. I got everything right the right side nothing

665
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,200
It's all a big mess of everything's wrong

666
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,280
Okay. Well, I am Alan and I'm brain. We'll see you next time
