1
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,310
Hey, I'm Alan.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:12,810
I'm Brent.

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,850
And we're back for another episode of A.B.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,370
Testing.

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,330
What number are we on, Brent?

6
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,330
28.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,550
28.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,080
God, how did that happen?

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,580
Cool.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:20,840
Yeah.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,240
All right.

12
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,740
Totally.

13
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,040
Apologies for anyone who has sat through all 28 besides us.

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,680
We've gone through 28, right?

15
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
We have.

16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,680
What's worse is that?

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,000
We might have gone through 40.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
What's worse is that I go, not only do I sit here

19
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,040
through these, but I sit through it again while I edit and take

20
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,760
out all the dumb stuff Brent says.

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,400
Not all of it, obviously, but most some of it.

22
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,140
He does a fairly good job at that.

23
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,660
And I said this on Twitter.

24
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,740
Last time, our tech support team turned around

25
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,180
and seemed like just in two hours.

26
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,020
I think there was a long weekend coming up.

27
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,060
I can't remember.

28
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,260
I think it was the Friday before that Labor Day weekend.

29
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,860
So I thought, if I don't get this done today,

30
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,640
it's not getting done for a while.

31
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,480
Well, again, the tech support team did a fantastic job.

32
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,880
So this is weird.

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,580
We use, for those of you interested,

34
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,960
I used to use Audacity, which is a darn nice program

35
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,000
for recording as all the features I need.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
For the first time ever, we have a debut in episode 28.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,880
Something we've never done before.

38
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,720
What's that?

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,340
Well, normally, I'm track one because, you know,

40
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,640
and Brent's track two.

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
But today, Brent's number one.

42
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,040
Woo hoo!

43
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,000
That was purely a mistake.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,440
That'll be fixed in the next episode.

45
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,360
And when I mix down the mono, you'll never know.

46
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,060
But for me, I look and see what's going on.

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,020
And I'm speaking in the wrong place.

48
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,380
So I just wanted to share that with the audience.

49
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,580
So this podcast is going to make you feel uncomfortable

50
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,260
the entire time?

51
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,700
No.

52
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,220
Being in the same room as you makes me uncomfortable.

53
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,100
You're not the first, nor likely the last,

54
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,940
to give me that feedback.

55
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,380
Yeah, I read the report.

56
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,870
It's awkward.

57
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,190
All right, let's get going.

58
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,430
We got our list on the board.

59
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,150
And we'll get through it here and probably get to none of it.

60
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,150
Let's try and see if we can get to at least one thing.

61
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,430
So Strata Conference, we talked a little about last time.

62
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,490
You're going there.

63
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,930
It's in New York next week.

64
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,430
Yes.

65
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,130
Holy crap, Batman.

66
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,010
It's next week.

67
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,010
It is.

68
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,570
So me and one of my employees are going.

69
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,570
We have a goal of recruiting like monsters.

70
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,010
Got for the first time in like 15 years,

71
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,850
we talked about this last time, got new business cards.

72
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,980
And I intend to come back with none of them.

73
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,980
All right, we'll see what happens.

74
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,380
Are you going to tweet?

75
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,260
Is it like fishing?

76
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,220
Are you catching release?

77
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,540
Or like you hook them and you bring them home with you?

78
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,660
I mean, did you book like one ticket there and 50 tickets

79
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,220
back?

80
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,660
That.

81
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,000
You know, I don't know what the limit is on my end

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,380
of my card.

83
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,060
But I am agile, so we'll see what happens.

84
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,620
And the other thing, so last time I issued an offer out

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,840
to the three.

86
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,880
If you want to connect, I'd love to meet you.

87
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:18,100
I did get one of the three to reach out.

88
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,900
So we'll figure out some logistics there.

89
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,740
But you remember Percy from several episodes ago?

90
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,540
He's like a guest member on the show.

91
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,540
Yeah, and actually on the way in, I was thinking through,

92
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,080
hey, since we only have three listeners,

93
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,660
it probably wouldn't be hard to meet them all.

94
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,100
It's great.

95
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,680
And then, yeah, I like to think of anyone

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,040
who submits a mailbag item, or we talk about,

97
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,480
they're part of the show.

98
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,700
Absolutely.

99
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,740
Actually, that was a stretch calling this thing a show,

100
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,220
right?

101
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,140
Yeah, let's just roll with it.

102
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,100
All right, cool.

103
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,940
Speaking of like things and conferences and things,

104
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,460
we talked, I'm not going to recap them going to Eurostar

105
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,740
for the mobile deep dive in November.

106
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,430
But in between now and then, I'm

107
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,130
going to go give a short talk at the GoDaddy office in Kirkland,

108
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,020
which I think is open to the public on October 9,

109
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,500
Friday night.

110
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,860
The talk is?

111
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,340
Yeah.

112
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,940
OK.

113
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,660
So I'm doing like a half hour.

114
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,980
And normally, I talk about very broad things.

115
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,100
So I asked for suggestions, and they gave me a,

116
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,520
what do you want me to talk about?

117
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,460
I'll talk about anything.

118
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,820
And they gave me a list of very specific things.

119
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Such as?

120
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,660
Well, I don't remember.

121
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,280
I only remember the one I selected.

122
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,640
I said I can do that because I work on one of those, which

123
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,680
is strategies for testing a single page web application.

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,720
OK.

125
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,680
But I will turn that into one of my sweeping generalizations

126
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,760
full of opinions.

127
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,260
But I'll talk about it a little bit.

128
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:49,920
It'll be fun.

129
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,280
And then I haven't worked out when yet,

130
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,240
but I mentioned last time the wonderful people at Riot Games.

131
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,500
And Trey McRae invited me to come to a sort of a night

132
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,420
of beer and appetizers they were having in Seattle.

133
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,300
Brew-ha-ha.

134
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,100
A brew-ha-ha, something like that.

135
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:10,860
What was that?

136
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,780
Three or four weeks ago, I had a good time talking to people.

137
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,220
And he contacted me and said, hey,

138
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,540
our people like talking to you.

139
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,060
You're fun.

140
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,260
You should come talk to more of us.

141
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,240
I'm going to go down to LA sometime for a day

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,540
and hang out with them and kind of see what they do

143
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,600
and talk to them.

144
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,360
Of course, I don't know when yet, because my calendar's

145
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,210
been cray cray.

146
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,810
So I got to get back to it and figure it out.

147
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,530
Because I have my, I'm like, he said in the next few weeks,

148
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,030
I'm looking at my calendar and I said,

149
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,530
I think I can make this.

150
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,910
So I got to look at my, sorry, I'll try and email Trey

151
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,190
before I post his podcast, because I haven't actually

152
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,350
replied to him other than the first one saying

153
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,190
I check my calendar and figure anything out.

154
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,430
Does he listen to the podcast?

155
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,170
Yeah, he does.

156
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,090
He apparently, and he's kind of a cool guy,

157
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,410
so I don't know why he would do this,

158
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,770
but he kind of stalks me.

159
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,870
You're kind of a cool guy too.

160
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,910
Birds of the feather thing.

161
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,150
Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe.

162
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,670
I think there's a lot of, I mean,

163
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,390
you have a lot of relevant skills,

164
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,150
a lot of relevant knowledge.

165
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,030
I wouldn't be at all surprised.

166
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,470
Fake until you make it.

167
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,090
Amen, baby.

168
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,790
I wouldn't be at all surprised if TreyTray

169
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,920
tries to convert this into a move move.

170
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,300
No, no, no, that's not what it's about.

171
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,140
He's cool.

172
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,980
We've talked about that.

173
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,260
That's not in the cards.

174
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,310
I am, yeah, long story there, but you know,

175
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,060
at some point after 20 plus years of Microsoft,

176
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,320
20 plus being 20 years plus three months,

177
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,020
retirement, actually, you know what?

178
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,420
I don't know if you know this.

179
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,160
It's September, less than three months,

180
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,300
I qualify for AARP.

181
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,900
So, you know, I'm as young at heart as I sound.

182
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,860
I'm fricking old.

183
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,260
You know, I was having this conversation

184
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,360
with one of my mentees just the other day.

185
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,360
In a couple of weeks, I will have a 17 year old

186
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,920
and I'm just like, whoa,

187
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,880
where the hell did all the time go?

188
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,600
Because when you go into work, right,

189
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,990
we are surrounded by 20 somethings all of the time.

190
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,470
Or people that act 20 something.

191
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,310
Both.

192
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,830
Microsoft is a little like Never Never Land.

193
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,670
You come here and sometimes you never grow up.

194
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,110
You never grow up and certainly physically,

195
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,950
there's this overwhelming perception,

196
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,630
except for the few times in the day

197
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,470
you actually look in the mirror,

198
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,430
where you sort of feel like you're the same age

199
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,110
of all the people you work with.

200
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,130
So it does kind of befuddle me that I'm getting to a point

201
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,730
where I'm gonna start having friends who are in AARP.

202
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,450
I'm not gonna, I'm said I'm eligible,

203
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,570
I'm not gonna join, except for, you know what?

204
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,690
I think I get free dinner at Denny's on my birthday.

205
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,530
So I don't know.

206
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,770
I think everyone does that.

207
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:15,610
Ah, crap.

208
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,050
But the thing that's gonna be weird

209
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,930
is when we start going to lunch,

210
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:19,910
you're gonna go, hey,

211
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,130
do you offer a senior discount here?

212
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,890
What's wrong with that?

213
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,050
Nothing.

214
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,110
It's just gonna be a slap in the face of,

215
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,550
wow, I hang out with old people.

216
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,670
Yep, I do.

217
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,750
Because I'm in a crotchety mood now.

218
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,990
Get off my lawn.

219
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,430
I'm gonna skip ahead to the fourth item.

220
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,390
We'll come back to that other one

221
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:43,110
because that's really a proper order.

222
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,910
So it's been a long time.

223
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,870
It's been a long time since we've had an installment

224
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,950
of Stupid Things Microsoft People Do.

225
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,790
Otherwise known as Allen's Soapbox.

226
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:57,630
Get off my lawn.

227
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,290
So this one, I drink my coffee black

228
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,730
like it should be drank.

229
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:06,850
This is like the preview.

230
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,050
This is like the trailer that comes for the real peeve,

231
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,410
which has nothing to do with coffee.

232
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,610
So I'm not gonna complain about.

233
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,770
But black is the way God and the Colombians intended.

234
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,850
One of the things that annoys people other than me

235
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,850
is people will add milk to their coffee.

236
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,490
They'll open up some milk in their refrigerator

237
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,970
and they'll leave this half carton open

238
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,410
and the next person does the same thing.

239
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,390
By the end of the day, you have like 12 partially opened

240
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,310
cartons of milk in the refrigerator.

241
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,150
So that-

242
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,230
If they're in the refrigerator, what drives me next

243
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,590
is they leave it right next to the coffees.

244
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,920
I don't like milk.

245
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,760
At all?

246
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,720
I think milk was invented to make cheese and that's it.

247
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,340
It has no other usage.

248
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,220
It's not for drinking, all right?

249
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,090
That's gross.

250
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,930
Ick.

251
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,170
What about chocolate?

252
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,810
Yeah, chocolate.

253
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,830
And not necessarily milk chocolate, dark chocolate.

254
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,130
But chocolate milk?

255
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,950
No.

256
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,790
No, gross.

257
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,630
That's disgusting.

258
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,770
Milk chocolate?

259
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:04,210
No, sometimes, but no, dark chocolate

260
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,690
only because it goes well with wine.

261
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,690
Hot chocolate?

262
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,100
No.

263
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,940
Wow.

264
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
Hot cocoa a little bit.

265
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,900
No milk.

266
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,340
Milk is gross, all right?

267
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,620
Not even the right soap box.

268
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,940
Let's get on the other soap box.

269
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,020
Nothing to do with milk.

270
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,900
That's just a common complaint about people.

271
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,420
So I work in a building, I've worked in buildings

272
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,220
with elevators before, but I'm a stair person.

273
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,480
Now that I work on the 20th floor, I'm not a stair person.

274
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,440
Although I do take the stairs down,

275
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,720
if I have to go down to reception,

276
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
five floors below, no problem.

277
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
I take the stairs down from 28

278
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,360
where the cafeteria is to 20 all the time.

279
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,200
But if it's more than two floors when I was three,

280
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,560
I'd use the elevator.

281
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,040
And obviously coming into work in the morning,

282
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,760
I take the elevator.

283
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,840
I don't even know how to take the stairs from the lobby.

284
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,590
So anyway, because our elevator

285
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,970
goes to Microsoft floors, you have to use your card key,

286
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,190
little click thing to use the buttons.

287
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,590
The buttons don't work.

288
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,430
Unless you swipe your card.

289
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,930
Unless you swipe your card key.

290
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,470
So everybody knows this,

291
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,970
because everybody's on Microsoft.

292
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,990
Yet, yet.

293
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:15,550
There's only a card key reader on one side of the elevator

294
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,590
in front of the bank there.

295
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,580
And inevitably, every single day, every single ride,

296
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,780
someone will step on, swipe their card key,

297
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,680
press their button, and stand with their waist

298
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,480
about two inches away.

299
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,640
From the card keys.

300
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,520
Yeah, like I have to stick my hand in an HR unfriendly zone

301
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,440
in order to scan my card key.

302
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,440
So I think, so hopefully, which I have refrained from doing,

303
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,560
we're all introverts.

304
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,480
You're like, excuse me, I need to stick my hand

305
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,840
in front of your, I scanned my card key.

306
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,360
But usually I just hope that they picked a floor

307
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,460
that's a little lower than mine,

308
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,860
so they'll get the hell out of my way

309
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,420
so I can scan my card key and push the right button.

310
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,220
If you're lucky also, there's buttons

311
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,540
on both sides of the elevator,

312
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,220
but the ones on the other side are useless.

313
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,260
Unless you have a card key.

314
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,680
But there is a window of about two seconds

315
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,920
after someone swipes their card key

316
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,780
where the buttons will work everywhere.

317
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,340
So what I try and do is sort of tailgate

318
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,960
on their buttons.

319
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,260
But the point is,

320
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,840
that is like, that is access to the,

321
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,340
you are blocking access to me getting to work

322
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,220
because they're not guarding it.

323
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,260
They're just not thinking,

324
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,460
but it's just the weirdest thing

325
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,980
that they all scan my card key.

326
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,460
I'm gonna stand right up here in this corner.

327
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,140
It's like, dude, you're weird.

328
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,070
And I wonder, do you think,

329
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,490
this is probably inappropriate for the podcast,

330
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,790
but I wonder if there are some people

331
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,350
that maybe they just do it to get,

332
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,540
see what the reaction is from other people.

333
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,380
That's art.

334
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,980
I now suspect you do.

335
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,820
That's art.

336
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,460
But I don't think these others do.

337
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,680
One of the things I studied in,

338
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,840
I'm a music composition major.

339
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,120
So I studied not just classical composition,

340
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,120
but modern composition and some of the modern art approaches

341
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
where the music,

342
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,760
they said the performance, the music isn't the art.

343
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,640
It's the audience's reaction to the music.

344
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,600
That's the art.

345
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,440
Sure.

346
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,200
So when you do like John Cage's four minutes

347
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,040
and 33 seconds,

348
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,720
so you can look, which is four movements of,

349
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,160
three movements or four, I can't remember,

350
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,910
but just silence.

351
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,050
But the point is,

352
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,650
as I got off of my tangent is,

353
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,490
somebody could look at that on the surface and go,

354
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,330
well, that's stupid.

355
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,210
I could write that.

356
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,050
And yes, you could,

357
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:33,250
but the music is how the audience reacts.

358
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,330
And I've not only seen that piece performed,

359
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,050
I've actually performed a percussion ensemble arrangement

360
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,290
of that piece we did.

361
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,090
We did a whole year of John Cage pieces

362
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,730
and the audience reaction,

363
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,850
there is something to that.

364
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,750
It's not all fluffy, fluffly, artsy, fartsy,

365
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,790
is the audience will react and it's interesting.

366
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,720
I've lost you.

367
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,860
Percussion ensemble.

368
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,700
Yes.

369
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,220
I didn't know you ever played any sort of percussion.

370
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,020
Oh yeah, I was primarily a woodwind player,

371
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,860
but I did play a lot of percussion,

372
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,740
enough so that I actually faked and lied my way

373
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,060
into the percussion department during grad school.

374
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,060
What instrument in particular?

375
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,860
We had a professor that didn't know everything.

376
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,500
So mostly, I mean, everything.

377
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm versatile enough.

378
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,880
I could do,

379
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,740
I totally fooled him into thinking I could play everything.

380
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,080
And going in, I was mostly keyboard percussion,

381
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,020
so marimba, xylophone, vibraphone, et cetera, et cetera.

382
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,740
So I did a bunch of stuff there

383
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,000
and then we did some snare drum stuff,

384
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,460
which I can totally kick butt on

385
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
and I could fake my way through it.

386
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,140
And then, and he gave me some really hard timpani stuff

387
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,620
and not on my fourth tape,

388
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,540
but I just, you know, I'm really good at,

389
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,900
again, fake it till you make it.

390
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,540
I practiced a lot and learned something

391
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,120
and looked up some things.

392
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,000
In the library, didn't have the internet back then, I'm old.

393
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,480
And anyway, faked it through.

394
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,270
It wasn't until,

395
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,210
one of the things you have to do

396
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,230
when you're in a music program is,

397
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,370
play.

398
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,250
I'm gonna smack you so hard in the head

399
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,730
that something funny's gonna happen.

400
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,050
You have to do things called juries,

401
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,370
which are the end of every quarter.

402
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,310
Three or four of the music staff members,

403
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,050
usually from your area, plus a few others,

404
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,770
it's, you have to perform a piece for them

405
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,340
and they critique you.

406
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,740
Like this is like your final.

407
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,420
Like you imagine, if you're taking lessons

408
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,860
for a quarter in college,

409
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,780
your final is you have to perform something

410
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,260
to show that you've actually learned something

411
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,540
from your lessons and you're applying

412
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,780
and you've been practicing and stuff.

413
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,740
Kind of the musical equivalent

414
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,900
of defending your doctoral thesis.

415
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,460
Yeah, at a smaller scale.

416
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,000
I had to defend my master's thesis,

417
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,900
which was,

418
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,290
again, I got so lucky.

419
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,550
At the long story, I got so lucky.

420
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,890
It's like, they showed me a score.

421
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,270
So tell me about this piece.

422
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,590
Like a score, you know, a score is like all the parts.

423
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,760
And I'll get back to the other story in a minute, but.

424
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Score contains how many measures usually?

425
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,140
Oh, the score is the whole piece.

426
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:08,980
Oh, the whole piece.

427
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,180
For every instrument.

428
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,020
Oh, got it.

429
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,420
And tell me about this piece.

430
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,440
And I'm looking at it and,

431
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,240
and they don't care if you know what it is.

432
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
They want to describe, like,

433
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,980
you look at how the, what the instrumentation is

434
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,740
and how the instruments are used and chords.

435
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,890
And from that, you can actually do some

436
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,890
pretty easy forensics and figure out kind of

437
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,650
have a good estimate when the piece was written

438
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,090
and maybe even who wrote it.

439
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:34,850
I happened to recognize the score.

440
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,730
Cause it was, one of the things I did

441
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,610
when I was bored in the library,

442
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,690
is I flipped through scores

443
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,570
and I actually knew exactly what it was.

444
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,570
So I played stupid and said,

445
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,210
well, we got this and that and this,

446
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,170
and this is going on here.

447
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,530
So it's probably Stravinsky.

448
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,190
I'm fairly certain it's a soldier's tale,

449
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,870
but this, you know, I think you'd ever.

450
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,710
Baa!

451
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,880
Oh my God, he pushed.

452
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
No, no.

453
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
The only person I impressed with what they do

454
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,040
for the master's thesis defense is

455
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,130
they have three people or two,

456
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,430
three people from my department,

457
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,670
plus one person they grabbed from an unrelated department

458
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,370
to make sure they're not BSing me through.

459
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,370
So I blew him away.

460
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:20,370
So the other part of that story was where was like...

461
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,490
Alan, the walking music genome project.

462
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,330
Oh, I remember.

463
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,850
So spring quarter, I had already done my thesis.

464
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,770
The only thing I had my juries to do

465
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,770
and my professor was there and somebody else,

466
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:37,770
the band director and director of bands,

467
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,430
sounds more exciting.

468
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,430
And then the old, old percussion guy

469
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,390
who was on his way out,

470
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:46,820
but he knew me from undergrad school.

471
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,620
And I play my piece and I go,

472
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,180
he goes, he goes, he goes, he goes.

473
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,420
And he said, you play percussion pretty well

474
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,370
for a clarinet player.

475
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:58,910
And that's when I let the cat out of the bag.

476
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:02,590
I said, my current professor,

477
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,790
progression professor said,

478
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:04,730
so you play clarinet?

479
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,950
I said, yeah, actually I was a woodwind major in undergrad.

480
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,510
He goes, why did you, how come you ever told me that?

481
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:11,430
Because I said, I figured if I told you

482
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,670
I wasn't a real percussionist,

483
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:14,070
you wouldn't let me into the program.

484
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:16,430
And he goes, oh yeah, you're probably right.

485
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:22,490
The, your story, you ever watched the movie Drumline?

486
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,340
Yeah.

487
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,180
It's one of my favorites.

488
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,020
Oh, good, so bad.

489
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,100
But your story, oh, I love it.

490
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,420
It's always been my-

491
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,740
How can you love that movie?

492
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,780
I was, Drumline two sucks,

493
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,780
but Drumline one was a good movie.

494
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,320
But your story kind of reminded me

495
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,100
of the competitions they do to see

496
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,030
who gets to be in the first string

497
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,120
or whatever the hell they call it in a marching band.

498
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,380
The other thing, so we went to Walt Disney World

499
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,260
the other day, and you know the,

500
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,420
I'm sure you know the name,

501
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:00,420
but in the Epcot Center, the Japan area,

502
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,340
they often had these women come out

503
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,700
with these sticks and these large kettle drums.

504
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,540
Okay.

505
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,840
And I could watch these guys forever.

506
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Love that style, love anything you do with the big ass,

507
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,040
what do they call it, are they kettle drums?

508
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,680
Are they horizontal?

509
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,380
No, not the horizontal like marching band things,

510
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,340
but they look like-

511
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,660
Are they tuned?

512
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,500
Yeah.

513
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,660
But they're gigantic.

514
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,920
They're timpani or kettle drums.

515
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,580
Okay, those are cool.

516
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,420
You played that?

517
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,020
Yeah, I played that.

518
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,020
You're slightly cooler now to me than you were before.

519
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,860
That's great.

520
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,320
So does Evan's thing count as a MB item?

521
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,600
It came in mail.

522
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,960
All right, so we got a mail from Evan,

523
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,000
and we're gonna talk about it in a minute,

524
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,260
but you know what has to happen first.

525
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,100
Mail back!

526
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,290
Wow, there was a little bit of lounge in that one.

527
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,370
That was fantastic.

528
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,650
I live for the lounge.

529
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,490
All right.

530
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,730
Wait, I was gonna go into Copacabana for a minute,

531
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,650
but I'll reel in the back.

532
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,770
Reeling it back.

533
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:12,610
Okay.

534
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,450
Copa.

535
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,500
Okay.

536
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,120
What did Evan say in his mail?

537
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,880
Oh, I remember.

538
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,920
So we got a mail from...

539
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,840
Mail back.

540
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,680
...young Evan Lehrer.

541
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,360
We used to work with Evan.

542
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,360
Actually, I remember Evan when his career was just this tall.

543
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:36,350
Now, when I first met Evan, he was freshly minted IC

544
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,510
in the test organization.

545
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,270
He's now grown into leadership.

546
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,870
He's left Microsoft years ago.

547
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,710
He came from X...

548
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,310
Four or five years ago from Xbox, went to...

549
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,150
Amazon.

550
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,510
Amazon.

551
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,060
They sell books.

552
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
Yes, everything else.

553
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,340
Oh, by the way, I used just to see if it worked.

554
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,650
I had Amazon...

555
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,360
We have at Amazon, same-day delivery, bring me some beer.

556
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,170
It worked.

557
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,290
Got like an hour.

558
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,170
It was kind of expensive.

559
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,370
I just wanted to see if I was bored on a Sunday.

560
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,290
Neat story, Alan.

561
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,450
Okay.

562
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,290
All right.

563
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,810
Somebody has to come in handy.

564
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,120
You can go to 7-Eleven, get it in 15 minutes.

565
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,880
Yeah, no, actually it'd take longer.

566
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,510
There's no 7-Elevens that close to my house.

567
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,350
But I could have gone to the store.

568
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,230
But if you're already two hours in and running out of beer...

569
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,110
I could have gone the thrift way.

570
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,310
I just wanted to see how they...

571
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,950
I was kind of curious how the process worked.

572
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,750
It was a purely exploratory order.

573
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,950
You know, one of the problems with the current room we're in

574
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,270
is that we don't see the clock.

575
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,830
We're good.

576
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,670
No, I know.

577
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,300
It's 8.30.

578
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,820
And it reminds me of some feedback we got in the last podcast.

579
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,540
Did you see that Twitter or tweet?

580
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,300
Oh, yeah, after the rambling...

581
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:58,860
After the 20-minute rambling, you guys got to a great point.

582
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,080
I think that was mentioned a positive way.

583
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,320
In my head, that was said positively.

584
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,480
Oh, it was.

585
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,240
And the fact that we actually made a point...

586
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Because usually we have to ramble for 40 minutes.

587
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Sure.

588
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,910
Then improvement.

589
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,710
Wait, go with that white net improvement.

590
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,710
So anyway, Evan sent a mail.

591
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,710
Evan's at Redfin now.

592
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,710
Fast forward to the...

593
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,510
Oh, look, they made a point.

594
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,510
Evan's at Redfin and he asked...

595
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,910
He said, AB testing Roadshow.

596
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,910
Yes.

597
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,910
And we said, Roadshow?

598
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,500
Okay.

599
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
So his mail was to...

600
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,100
Hey, guys, it has been a while.

601
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
I hope it's all as well with you.

602
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,300
Thanks for asking, Evan.

603
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,100
It's going great.

604
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
It is going great.

605
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Alright, keep going.

606
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,100
I recently joined Redfin as their Seattle QA manager.

607
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,100
The company is at an inflection point moving from three-week waterfall releases...

608
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,260
What is that?

609
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
That's like a Scrummerfall thing, right?

610
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,260
Yeah.

611
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,260
Yeah, okay.

612
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,260
But at least he knows that it's not Scrum.

613
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
What ifs?

614
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,260
Yeah.

615
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
What ifs?

616
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
To a continuous integration model.

617
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:11,390
However, there really isn't much expertise in the company on how to navigate this transition.

618
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:19,520
By the way, Evan, if we're releasing NDA stuff, I'm sure Evan's the only one at Redfin that listens to us.

619
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,740
We're probably fine.

620
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,740
You know, I don't think there's anything...

621
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,740
It's not like he said, and we're moving...

622
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,740
We're doing a special new project.

623
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,740
It requires us what it does.

624
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,740
It allows you to blah, blah, blah, blah.

625
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,740
So he has questions.

626
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
Yeah.

627
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,740
There are questions going around like, so do all devs need to write tests now?

628
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,740
Yes, next.

629
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:40,740
And can we ship code to production without QA involvement?

630
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,030
It depends.

631
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,030
Next.

632
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,030
And as a QA engineer, do I have a place in this new world?

633
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,960
It depends.

634
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Let's talk about that.

635
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,080
Yeah.

636
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,080
While I'm trying to help guide, it may be helpful to have some outside experts give a tech talk to the engineers.

637
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,080
Oh, I missed the part where you wanted experts.

638
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,080
I think we're out.

639
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Fake it.

640
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,210
What do you guys think?

641
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,210
I have a question.

642
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,210
What's a QA engineer?

643
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,360
He doesn't say QA engineer.

644
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
I thought you said the QA engineer.

645
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Oh, that's right.

646
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
You're right.

647
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,360
As a QA engineer...

648
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
Of course I'm right.

649
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
Do I have a place in this new world?

650
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Well, the first question's easy, but we should probably give it a longer answer.

651
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,360
So the first question was, do all devs need to write tests?

652
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,040
Do all devs need to write tests now?

653
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Can we ship code to production without QA involvement?

654
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
No, dude, learn to read.

655
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Read that first sentence again so people understand it.

656
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,070
So do all devs need to write tests now?

657
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,070
The long answer...

658
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,070
I give the short answer is yes.

659
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,070
The longer answer is yes.

660
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:54,070
Or affirmative.

661
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,070
Okay, yeah.

662
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:58,320
That is absolutely because...

663
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Well, you tell me why because.

664
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
I don't tell you why because.

665
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Let's actually give a real long answer.

666
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
If not, who's going to write the tests?

667
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
And actually, we've pounded on this forever.

668
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:16,090
I think for many tests, especially unit functional, making sure your stuff works,

669
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:21,090
there is no better person to write those tests than the person who wrote the code.

670
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:28,280
At some point, there's a line in where that's no longer true.

671
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,410
And let me give you an example from my team.

672
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,410
Our team, I wouldn't call myself a QA engineer.

673
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:40,570
I'm just still a software engineer, but on a team that doesn't have any testers.

674
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:47,570
So I guess I cover some of that, but our devs are starting to actually get good at writing tests.

675
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,570
What?

676
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,570
How is that possible?

677
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,570
And not just unit tests.

678
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,570
We have our unit test suite is growing and becoming very valuable.

679
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:58,570
But they're also writing what we call scenario tests,

680
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:00,570
which you could call user journeys or whatever.

681
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,990
But some end-to-end-ish tests.

682
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,990
And they're getting better and better.

683
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,990
The tests are getting less flaky, and they're covering more of the product.

684
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,990
And they're running all those, which is great.

685
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,990
And then we had a weird bug come in last week,

686
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,050
and we thought, well, how do we miss that?

687
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,050
And then it only took me a few minutes to go, you know what?

688
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:29,440
Our devs are very good at writing tests that test the happy path of the product.

689
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,440
And we are actually, we have a good, comprehensive suite

690
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,080
that we make sure our product works as long as you stay in the rails.

691
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,080
If you start doing those weird things that testers think of,

692
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
like what happens if I do this 100 times?

693
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,080
What happens if I, you know, blah, blah, blah?

694
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Those things can cause problems.

695
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,240
So my job as a, I'm still a common software QA engineer,

696
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,240
but part of my job is to help them get better at that.

697
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
And also for me to do some of that myself,

698
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
and I'll spend some time with them.

699
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,240
In fact, I have some meetings set up next week with each of the feature teams.

700
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,330
Kind of spend a half hour sort of brainstorming through the,

701
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,330
sort of how you look at the edge cases.

702
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:18,330
We'll call them edge cases for now, but the nonstandard scenarios.

703
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,330
So, oh, by the way, Brent and I, Brent's taking notes.

704
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:26,330
Yeah, Brent's taking notes because we're actually putting together

705
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:29,330
the outline for our presentation as we cast.

706
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:35,330
Yes, we skipped ahead, but we agreed to go and talk to Redfin.

707
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,330
Yeah, so yeah, we did.

708
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,330
So I think the first thing we talked about is developer testing

709
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,330
and a little chunk on that,

710
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,330
and we'll have some stories and anecdotes there.

711
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,330
And if you want to, you can add something to that,

712
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,190
or I'll shut up and let you talk about the next question.

713
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:54,440
Well, there's one of the framings that I'll put on this one is,

714
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,440
anytime you're trying to do this change management,

715
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,440
you have to consider, and I've said this a billion times

716
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,440
on the podcast, you have to consider three aspects.

717
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,570
The people, how they need to change, the technology,

718
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,570
what needs to change, and how do the processes,

719
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,570
the bridge between the technology,

720
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,570
how we expect the people to use the technology in a new way.

721
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,500
All of these questions, every time I have gone and done

722
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,500
any sort of talk on these topics,

723
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:28,850
the primary issue comes down to, wait,

724
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:32,850
so you're saying that the culture I'm used to is going to have to change?

725
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,330
Yeah, yeah, that's what we're saying.

726
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,940
The other thing I think that we'll have to cover in this,

727
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:45,390
certainly what, why, and how.

728
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:52,770
Usually the why is what seals the deal

729
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,770
in terms of getting them to go forward.

730
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,090
And this is not just, we should understand from Evan,

731
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:04,090
maybe even beforehand, why are they making this change?

732
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,090
Maybe, usually there's a good reason for it, right?

733
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,090
When you might make a change?

734
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:14,120
Like there's a reason they want to do continuous integration

735
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,120
and have high daily quality instead of good quality

736
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,120
once every three weeks.

737
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
They want to make that transition.

738
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,150
They don't have to.

739
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,150
There's a reason for it.

740
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:31,440
Some teams make these changes because they heard from some other team

741
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,440
that it had some benefit and they don't want to be left out.

742
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,600
I've got to imagine that a company like Redfin wouldn't do this

743
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,600
for that type of reason, that there's probably some business goal

744
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
that they're trying to achieve.

745
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,600
But it's important if the team needs to make that transition,

746
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,600
they are much more apt to make that transition

747
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,850
if they understand why they're doing it.

748
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:55,850
Yes.

749
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:58,850
Unless, you know, because there are probably people that

750
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,850
absolutely see it's going to be better.

751
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,850
Some that think, whatever, I'll go along for the ride.

752
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,850
And some that think, screw this, we were fine before.

753
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,850
Why don't we need to change?

754
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,850
This is true for any sort of cultural change.

755
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,850
Yeah.

756
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,850
Yeah, those three camps.

757
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,850
But the way you loop in and get momentum towards making the change happen

758
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,850
is make sure everybody understands why you're making the change

759
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:26,270
and what it's going to get better as a result of moving in this direction.

760
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:34,520
Yeah, and set up the right training, set up the right, for example,

761
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
continuous integration.

762
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
They're going to want to go from moving three-week waterfalls

763
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,520
to a continuous integration model.

764
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:46,780
I have yet to see a team that is able to do that successfully

765
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,780
without some serious architectural investments.

766
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:54,680
Well, I mean, we can talk hypothetically about this,

767
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,680
and we will for a moment before we get to the rest of the questions and notes.

768
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,250
What would I do?

769
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:03,250
You make sure, so they have a build server.

770
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,250
Sure.

771
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:07,250
Because they're building, I don't think they're building once every three weeks.

772
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,250
They're building and testing.

773
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,250
And if I'm going to imagine a three-week waterfall,

774
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:15,280
they do some planning for a couple days.

775
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,280
They write code for a week and a half, then they stabilize for a week.

776
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,440
That would be what I would do with a three-week waterfall.

777
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,440
And some people are thinking, hey, man, that's how my team does Scrum.

778
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Well, that's a three-week waterfall.

779
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,510
No, I don't know if you know this.

780
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,510
I have a bunch of slides on this.

781
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:39,510
They've done studies as to what is the best sprint size.

782
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,510
Two.

783
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:41,600
It is.

784
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,600
Two weeks.

785
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
What's the worst?

786
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Three.

787
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Because it's screwy.

788
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,800
It is indeed.

789
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Three is worse.

790
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Well, three isn't the worst.

791
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,800
The point is three is worse than four.

792
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,370
Three is worse than four.

793
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:02,470
But it's actually three, one, four, two.

794
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,880
Really?

795
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Yes.

796
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,880
And that's interesting because I've done one-week iterations before,

797
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,880
and they're kind of fun, but two feel good.

798
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
I like two-week iterations.

799
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,880
So do I.

800
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,880
I've been pushing our team for that.

801
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,880
I haven't got there.

802
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,880
The main reason why three is what they have found is any team who tries to onboard

803
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:38,080
onto Scrum pure but pick a three-week sprint, it is the forces of evil.

804
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,660
We'll turn that into two weeks coding, one week stabilization.

805
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
And I don't remember the numbers off of my hand,

806
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,660
but it's over 50% of the time.

807
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,980
Interesting.

808
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
So back on topic.

809
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,980
Yep.

810
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:57,980
And by the way, number one or one week is the second worst because the typical

811
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:04,170
Scrum overhead becomes too costly in one-week iterations.

812
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,170
It might depend on the size of the team.

813
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:10,170
But anyway, as I said a minute ago, back on topic,

814
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,170
I don't want to dive too deep in the technology stuff,

815
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:14,170
but they have a little bit of a walkthrough as an overview.

816
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:20,170
They have a build server that have to figure out if it's configurable to run

817
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,170
automatically on check-in.

818
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:26,170
And CI means you have a rich suite of tests that run as part of check-in.

819
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,170
And this can be depending on what they have already.

820
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:35,170
Jenkins is very popular, but we use VSO for CI as does a chunk of Microsoft

821
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,170
because we make it.

822
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,170
It's good for us to test it.

823
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,170
Anyway, there's some technology things we've got to figure out how they can

824
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,170
do builds on every check-in.

825
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,170
You have to look at the size of their team.

826
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:45,170
Maybe they can't do a build on every check-in and they have to batch.

827
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:47,170
There's all trade-offs through there.

828
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:54,170
But the idea is that every build that goes to the CI server is at a min bar

829
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:58,170
quality level defined by the suite of tests that run.

830
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,590
And hopefully that min bar is very high.

831
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,590
And if not, you add more tests.

832
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:08,680
The other thing too that you, like I actually think every one of these

833
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
questions we could do a whole hour tech talk on.

834
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Yeah, so that, yeah, especially you.

835
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Because you babble.

836
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,680
All right, what was it?

837
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Let me put it this way.

838
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
I think you could do a whole hour tech talk on.

839
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,680
There is cultural stuff.

840
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,680
And there's a good story, you know, the Flickr story of, I'll dig it up

841
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
and share it.

842
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,680
Because there's a story where they're, and I'm going to horribly

843
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,680
paraphrase this, like I've horribly paraphrased all my stories that I

844
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
read and forget most of the details on.

845
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,680
But I'm 90% sure it was Flickr where the CEO said, or some other

846
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,900
high ranking person said, I want to be able to ship every day.

847
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:47,190
And his team was doing sort of this three week waterfall thing,

848
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,190
you know, or something like that.

849
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,220
And they said, you're freaking high.

850
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,220
And, but that was his rallying cry.

851
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,220
And the rallying cries were important.

852
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,220
And they got better and better.

853
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,220
And they got to shipping a high quality product every week.

854
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,220
And he had a big party and celebrated.

855
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,220
People said, why are we celebrating?

856
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,220
We need to get to every day.

857
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,320
And it's like, oh, I don't, you know, it's one of those

858
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
things where I set the goal of every day in order to get to

859
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
every week.

860
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,320
And the employee said, screw that every day.

861
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
This is fun.

862
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
The other thing too, right?

863
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Waterfall to continuous, not only continuous integration,

864
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,440
in terms of like the infrastructure,

865
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,440
the technical infrastructure, but it also implies a shift to

866
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Kanban.

867
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Or something you want a shift to high daily quality.

868
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Yep.

869
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,440
A shift to some of the things that have to happen is you're

870
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,440
not going to have, you're not going to think of features of

871
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,440
things that span three weeks.

872
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Nope.

873
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,440
You do things in small chunks.

874
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,440
And you have to have monitors.

875
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Like, I don't know if their technology is that big enough

876
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
that they need to worry about exposure rings,

877
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,440
but they do need to have the ability to do detection on

878
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
prod and quick reverb.

879
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Right.

880
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
And when you think about it, and he doesn't necessarily say

881
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,760
they're doing CI to prod, but CI.

882
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
And you can make that choice to promote the prod.

883
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,920
Moving from three week waterfall releases to a

884
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,920
continuous integration model.

885
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,920
So there's a bunch of knobs to turn there.

886
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
Yeah.

887
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,920
If they're, if, you know, maybe, let's talk about this

888
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
for a second, and we'll, I don't want to, we don't need

889
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,920
to do the whole talk here, but if they had, say,

890
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,920
I assume they have a week of stabilization built into

891
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
their three week waterfall.

892
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
That means it takes them a week to stabilize their

893
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,920
product.

894
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,020
That would, how do you do it?

895
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:37,170
How do you stabilize that product now in a day, so

896
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,170
you can release it in a day or in an hour, so you

897
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,170
got, or continuous.

898
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,170
One, you don't mess it up that much.

899
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,170
You have to automate a bunch of that testing.

900
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,170
You can't, you can't let bugs linger.

901
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:51,170
There's a whole bunch of knobs you have to turn

902
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,170
slowly, and they're not going to get there.

903
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,170
They're not going to go, okay, we finished our

904
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,170
three week sprint today, tomorrow, we start, we'd

905
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,170
start releasing CI.

906
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:00,170
It isn't going to work that way.

907
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,490
So there's a build, like to me creating the right

908
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:10,650
branch integration strategy is key here, and having

909
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,650
a principle that your main branch is always RTM-able.

910
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,650
Yep.

911
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,650
So changes as best as possible.

912
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,650
Don't integrate into main branch unless it's passed,

913
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,650
but you want to evaluate on the change by change basis.

914
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,650
So we have our model, we use Git, and our model

915
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:33,650
is develop branch is equal to our CI environment.

916
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,200
So this goes through CI, goes to the develop branch.

917
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Master is our, currently our dog food, but our

918
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
production environment.

919
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,290
Perfect.

920
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,290
So we just do emerge from when this develop build

921
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,290
is good.

922
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:53,290
But do you have a check-in based integration model?

923
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,290
Yes.

924
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,290
Or is it a batch integration?

925
00:37:56,290 --> 00:38:01,710
We do both because we have, we have actually,

926
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,710
it's a weird, ours is complex.

927
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,710
We have multiple gates, but we're actually moving

928
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:08,710
from batch to check-in.

929
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,710
Awesome.

930
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,710
And the check-in, per check-in runs all of the

931
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:18,930
unit tests, a subset of all of our longer scenario

932
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,930
protractor or selenium tests.

933
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,930
And if any of those fail, it's rejected.

934
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,930
Otherwise they go in to develop.

935
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:26,930
We know they're pretty good.

936
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,930
And then we immediately run a much richer suite

937
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,930
of tests there to make sure there are no other

938
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:35,930
integration problems, other people's checks going in.

939
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:36,930
Yep.

940
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,930
So those are going on all the time.

941
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,930
Continuous testing, all the time on that develop branch.

942
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,930
We also have monitors running in our, both our

943
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,930
pre-production environment and our dog food environment

944
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,930
that find out if any of those things begin to fail.

945
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,930
Actually in our, we have those monitors running

946
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,930
in our CI environment now too, to find out if anything

947
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:56,930
gets like slower or fails.

948
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,930
So we have lots of checks and monitoring things

949
00:38:58,930 --> 00:38:59,930
which are really pretty good.

950
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:00,930
So I don't know.

951
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,120
Again, those are knobs we're slowly turning

952
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,250
because we're not, unfortunately, we're not to see,

953
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,250
we're not to high, we don't have consistent

954
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,250
daily quality on my product.

955
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,250
But we're, so we're kind of along the same journey

956
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,250
a lot farther along than Evan's team is.

957
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:21,250
Yeah, no, I think you guys are exactly on

958
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,250
the same journey.

959
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:26,380
And I also think that turning the knobs slowly

960
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,380
is what makes sense.

961
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,700
Boiled frogs, man.

962
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,700
Boiled frogs.

963
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
That's right.

964
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,340
Because again, you have to turn multiple knobs

965
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,340
simultaneously to get this word.

966
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:41,340
If you shifted, if you were to say,

967
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
hey, tomorrow we're all can-ban.

968
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340
And you don't have the people trained up,

969
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
you don't have the technology in place.

970
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,340
I don't know.

971
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,340
It's an exaggeration, but you probably won't

972
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
have a company in a couple of months.

973
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,630
You have to bring people along for the ride.

974
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,820
We got on this tangent by the QA stuff.

975
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
We're not on tangents.

976
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:02,820
We're right on time.

977
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,820
By definition, we don't tan.

978
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,820
All right.

979
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,820
What else are we talking about?

980
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,820
As a QA engineer, do I have a place in this new world?

981
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,430
Oh, haven't we talked about that a whole bunch?

982
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:16,430
We could argue that was the whole reason

983
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:18,430
we started the podcast.

984
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,430
It is, and I think, oh, wow.

985
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,460
That was nostalgic.

986
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,460
My head really wants to go off on a tangent,

987
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,460
but I have a whole other topic that I'm going to stay right.

988
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,460
There are no tangents in A-B testing.

989
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
We just covered this.

990
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,460
Okay, I'm not going to go there.

991
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:37,460
But I guess it depends, but listen carefully.

992
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:44,970
If the only role on the team is to write software,

993
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,970
implement software, and write happy path functional tests,

994
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,970
there may not be a role for a QA engineer.

995
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:52,970
No.

996
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,360
But that's a really horrible way to make software.

997
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,360
You can't just implement code and write happy path tests.

998
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
You need those generalizing.

999
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,360
I think the former QA engineer is the generalizing specialist

1000
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,360
or specializing generalist that helps the team accelerate

1001
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,360
productivity, applies systems thinking to make sure

1002
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,360
the edge cases and corner cases and things like reliability,

1003
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,360
perf, globalization, et cetera are all addressed.

1004
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,360
They look at the product overall to find out what is the,

1005
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,360
because you're doing CI, how do we get better every day?

1006
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,360
Most of your engineers aren't thinking of that,

1007
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,360
but QA engineers I think are uniquely, former QA engineers,

1008
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,680
are uniquely tuned to do that sort of thing.

1009
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,960
They are.

1010
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:48,000
They're also helpful in terms of training up the other dev.

1011
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,000
My ideal scenario when we're seeing this,

1012
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
now, Evan, there's nothing in what Evan's talking about

1013
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,320
that suggests that they're considering unified engineering.

1014
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,320
That's correct, but even if you're not,

1015
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,320
let's say you have a test team and you're doing it,

1016
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:15,380
but again, I think unified engineering is almost irrelevant

1017
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,380
to this conversation because this role is going to change

1018
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:25,600
regardless to more of an engineer role to do CI,

1019
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,600
if you're going to have daily high quality builds.

1020
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,080
You're not going to be running a test pass every day.

1021
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,080
The one issue, so let me ask you this,

1022
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,080
because we've talked about this in the past,

1023
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,080
but we've now had more experience,

1024
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:46,080
the statement that I've said in the past is still true today.

1025
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,080
Any team that I've seen where they're trying to move

1026
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,240
quality upstream and get dev doing more testing,

1027
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,040
if they have a low to medium level,

1028
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,240
even just one QA engineer in their scrum team,

1029
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,680
the model doesn't work.

1030
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,040
I've not seen a single situation.

1031
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,040
I've seen situations where there was a 10 to 1

1032
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,360
dev to low to middle level QA guy,

1033
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,360
and those devs are like,

1034
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,360
I don't know what management's thinking.

1035
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,480
How is one guy going to get all of this work done?

1036
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,480
The culture shift is just not going to happen.

1037
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,480
The dev seniority at minimum will overpower this one low level guy,

1038
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,480
just as a strong man to defend.

1039
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
Evan's not a low level guy.

1040
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,480
He's not.

1041
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,480
But we're talking about his team.

1042
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,480
I guess so.

1043
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:58,470
I think what you're saying is that if the lower level QA tester guy or girl

1044
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:00,560
is going to have less,

1045
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,720
not going to have the ability to have the influence on the dev team

1046
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,720
to teach them how to help them write better quality software.

1047
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,720
Is that correct?

1048
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,720
Yes.

1049
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,720
And even further,

1050
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,720
and we've talked about this what, two, three episodes ago,

1051
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,720
once the codependency loop starts?

1052
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,010
Yes.

1053
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,010
I think you've got to eliminate that no matter what, right?

1054
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:25,010
Right.

1055
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,010
So let's talk about that.

1056
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:31,010
And we'll maybe give a little bit of information from Evan first,

1057
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:37,270
but you don't want to put them on the scrum team to be dev's bitch.

1058
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:38,270
Right.

1059
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,270
So what is their role there?

1060
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,270
And Evan can help.

1061
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:44,270
Any leadership can help figure that out.

1062
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:47,720
I've obviously done this for a long time,

1063
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,720
but in my team I'm totally comfortable being the one sort of test guy

1064
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,720
for 70, 80 devs.

1065
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,870
Yes.

1066
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:58,870
I don't go to the...

1067
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:03,120
Your experience, right?

1068
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,120
So I got to think...

1069
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,120
You're like, no.

1070
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,570
That is not what I'm paid to do.

1071
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:10,570
Right, absolutely.

1072
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,570
And in fact, we have...

1073
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,570
I have five vendors here that do some testing for us,

1074
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,570
and I've embedded them in the feature teams.

1075
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,570
And it's even less than that.

1076
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:24,570
Not only have the one tester in these feature teams,

1077
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,570
I had them span multiple feature teams,

1078
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,570
because only five of them.

1079
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:33,860
And they are very well trained.

1080
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,860
When someone says,

1081
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,860
hey, can you do this test pass for me?

1082
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:37,860
Can you do this for me?

1083
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Their answer is no.

1084
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,860
That's not what I do.

1085
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,860
They say, what are you...

1086
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,860
But you're a tester.

1087
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,860
I say, what?

1088
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,860
And they're very much a liaison and a consultant.

1089
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:52,860
They will brainstorm with the Scrum team on how to do some testing.

1090
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,860
These are fairly junior people.

1091
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,860
But the model, I think, works.

1092
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,860
Imagine Evan is a senior guy with a bunch of junior people.

1093
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,860
That model sort of works.

1094
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:05,860
As long as he facilitates their role in that Scrum team,

1095
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:08,860
you can have the more junior people there.

1096
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,860
And be successful.

1097
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,860
Yeah, I think the insight we just got on here is,

1098
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:19,080
if you pay active attention to making sure that co-dependency loop

1099
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,150
never, ever, ever starts, then there's hope.

1100
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,150
Yeah, I think so.

1101
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:28,150
And the plans work them well, because not only do they...

1102
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,150
And I talked to the engineering managers,

1103
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,150
who are massively more senior from these testers.

1104
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,150
They still seem as really valuable,

1105
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:36,150
because they provide that different insight.

1106
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:38,150
Testers just look at the product differently.

1107
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,150
And then also, they take...

1108
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:43,150
Because they look at the product collectively as a whole.

1109
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:46,150
In fact, those five vendors probably know the product

1110
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:48,150
end-to-end better than anyone.

1111
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,150
But they'll go to their different feature team meetings

1112
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,150
and bring that information back to the collective.

1113
00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:00,370
So that little bit of that plugging in is super valuable.

1114
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:01,370
So I think if you...

1115
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,370
I don't know, that's the only model that will work.

1116
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,370
But for me, having those five vendors

1117
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:08,370
get connected with those...

1118
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,370
We have eight engineering managers,

1119
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:13,370
who own...

1120
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:17,370
I'm totally estimating here, let's say 15 feature areas

1121
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:18,370
of our product.

1122
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:20,370
And so far, it's working out pretty well.

1123
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,370
They're a little stretch thin, but again,

1124
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,370
it's my job to make sure that if they need to...

1125
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:28,370
It makes sense to spend a little bit more time

1126
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,370
working with a team on this feature.

1127
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:32,370
I'm going to make sure they're ramped back on other things

1128
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,370
so they're not stretched too thinly.

1129
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:35,370
I just had another idea.

1130
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:39,370
Let me interject that and love to hear what you have to say.

1131
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,370
All right.

1132
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:45,370
I'm reminded back to the old days when our friend James

1133
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,370
was still at Google and he was describing...

1134
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,370
What was his name?

1135
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:55,370
James White Watson Whittaker something?

1136
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,370
Whittaker, whatever.

1137
00:47:57,370 --> 00:47:59,370
Yeah, that guy.

1138
00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:00,720
He was describing...

1139
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,720
And Google's changed, right?

1140
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,790
I don't get the sense that the principle they used to have

1141
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:11,790
of if you want to change teams tomorrow,

1142
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:12,790
you just notify the right people.

1143
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:13,790
I don't think that that's...

1144
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,790
I think Google's gotten a lot more command and control-ish.

1145
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:18,790
Yeah, I have no idea.

1146
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:19,790
Get to your point.

1147
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:20,790
Get to your point.

1148
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,790
Okay.

1149
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:27,160
So back in the day, QA guys could pick and choose

1150
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,610
where they wanted to work.

1151
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:32,610
So if they were engaged with a dev team

1152
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,960
and that dev team was trying to do some of this

1153
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,990
dev bitch stuff, that dev team lost their QA guy

1154
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,340
because I don't like working with you.

1155
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,340
I'm going to go work on that thing.

1156
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,340
It doesn't work.

1157
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,340
I mean, yeah, it's harder when you're at a smaller company

1158
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:52,340
because your option is to quit and apply for other jobs.

1159
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:58,240
Yeah, I guess it depends on how many choices you have.

1160
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:04,780
But if you dramatically short the dev to QA ratio,

1161
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:10,810
if there's only one QA per dev team of, say, seven...

1162
00:49:10,810 --> 00:49:13,450
Even that's too high, I think.

1163
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,450
But go on.

1164
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:18,450
Then you could potentially start up a process of,

1165
00:49:18,450 --> 00:49:24,120
hey, one of your QA guys comes to you and says,

1166
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,120
hey, I didn't like this.

1167
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
I need your help.

1168
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
You don't need my help.

1169
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,280
Tomorrow you're going to work with that team is set.

1170
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:33,280
I don't know about that model.

1171
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,280
We can explore.

1172
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,280
So you should...

1173
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,280
You understand what the benefit would be of that?

1174
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,310
Yeah.

1175
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,310
Okay, good.

1176
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:42,310
You want to keep them engaged.

1177
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:44,310
I think we have enough information for an outline.

1178
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:46,310
And Evan may listen to this podcast and go,

1179
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:47,310
all right, guys, I'm good.

1180
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,310
You don't need to come.

1181
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,310
I doubt it.

1182
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,310
I'm good.

1183
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:56,820
We talked about what the themes for...

1184
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:57,820
We didn't even...

1185
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,820
I don't know that we even really covered...

1186
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:00,820
It's done, man.

1187
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:01,820
Presentation's done.

1188
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,820
We're good.

1189
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:03,820
Okay, awesome.

1190
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,820
I'll put together a slide of some sheep and a balloon and...

1191
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:08,820
The Avengers slide.

1192
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:09,820
I like your Avengers slide.

1193
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,820
You should put that one in.

1194
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,820
Oh, we should do that.

1195
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,820
We should do some of that.

1196
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:13,820
So it's P...

1197
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:14,820
Yeah.

1198
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:15,820
Yeah.

1199
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,820
And the one that goes after that whole sequence there.

1200
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,110
Perfect.

1201
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,110
So what do you think?

1202
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,110
I think we better call it a day.

1203
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,110
All right.

1204
00:50:22,110 --> 00:50:23,110
All right, everybody.

1205
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,110
I am not Brent.

1206
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:25,110
And I am.

1207
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:28,110
See you next week or next time.

1208
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:30,110
Again, Strata next week.

1209
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,110
We're done.

1210
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,110
We're done.

1211
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:33,110
We're done.

1212
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:36,410
You don't get to talk after goodbye.

1213
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,410
Reach out to me on Twitter.

1214
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:38,410
See you guys.
