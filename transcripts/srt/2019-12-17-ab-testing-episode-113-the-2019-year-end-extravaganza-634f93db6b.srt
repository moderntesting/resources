7
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:53,980
Friday the 13th so where was I before you derailed me I said you said it was

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,580
Friday the 13th and I said oh is it yes yes and I'm happy because if you've

9
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,060
heard me bitch in the past we talked about these year-end episodes I don't

10
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:12,780
like this 2010 2011 was 2010 2011 2012 and I finally with 2020 people will begin

11
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,040
pronouncing the year correctly I think in 1910 people didn't say what or 1917

12
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:28,440
1919 then say oh the year is 1919 and you won't have to deal with it again

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:35,480
until year 3000 now yes I know and I'm probably gonna live forever and no I'm

14
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,200
actually as we all know getting closer and closer to dying but that's what

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,480
happens I aren't we all yes and I'm closer to death now because I lost a

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,400
couple years of my life in blood pressure wrecking my heart last night

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,900
screaming at my computer while watching the impeachment hearings that was a

18
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:08,180
mistake I sure wish I could get that time back someday sigh so as we do every

19
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,220
actually you know what's gonna happen here in a minute I'll explain it for the

20
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,180
new listeners the new listener man there was a bunch of stuff I was gonna

21
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,140
mention I thought of on the way in here that I forgotten so I'll just say hey

22
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,530
Brent what's new with you uh we'll probably get into it when we get

23
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:32,280
further into the episode alrighty needless to say this is shaping up to be

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:42,580
one of the best I'll call it fiscal years I've ever had we have we've done well my

25
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,590
org new one nice done well well throwing numbers out there because that would get

26
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,790
me fired and I like the job not gonna not ready to get fired yet hey speaking

27
00:02:53,790 --> 00:03:01,110
of which you recently sent out a text about your new manager blaming you for

28
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:06,830
he's not my new manager I've had him for eight months and he took a while for me

29
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:13,150
to get to know and he's still a little hard to read but I'm slowly getting the

30
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:20,220
like I just do what I want it's autonomous Alan a yeah and I which is

31
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,980
funny cuz another in response to this I'll go backward into this one of our

32
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,380
one of our listeners said which we're thinking of Alan having a boss but sure

33
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:33,300
I guess so but yeah I have it's funny you mentioned that because you're in my head

34
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:40,720
because I what are you laughing at I'm just wondering if I'm wearing clothes oh

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:49,060
my god please save me it's not a good place if you're in Alan's head anything

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,660
could happen yeah no you're straightjacket I need to wash my my brain

37
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:03,440
out with the soap gross okay so anyway I for the last as long as I can remember

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,490
my career I kind of do what I want and I'm very good at that not meaning I'm

39
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,890
good at doing what I want because everyone's good at doing what they want

40
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:17,090
I am good and lucky at choosing things that make a difference and he's also

41
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:25,320
very good at showing that allowing him the autonomy will create business value

42
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,280
and that's just not for me that's a culture thing and also when you're an

43
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,440
exec leader you don't want to spend a lot of time in fact I'll put it this way

44
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,600
if you're an exec leader you shouldn't have to spend any of your time telling

45
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,760
people what to do you can nudge him in a direction which he has done from time

46
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,800
to time but which he did with this complaint he gave me which which will

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,880
now back into I put this on our rants channel on one of the three dot slack

48
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,520
calm if you want to invite you can go to modern testing org there is a link

49
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,840
there you can come join the fun and I am trying hard not to go into tangent

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,160
inception anyway I did a rant it was more of a humble brag rant and I'll admit

51
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,880
that I said my boss is blaming me for all of our quality improvements yeah

52
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:17,380
that that and hard to part I don't think so I don't think so what it means

53
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,740
is we've massively increased our velocity decreased our number of

54
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:28,020
incidents and decreased the revenue lost from those interest in incidents all

55
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:36,260
while greatly a big number increasing our revenue over the year okay and I

56
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:43,700
tried to tell you should feel bad for you he'd been blamed is not necessarily

57
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,700
mean bad I don't understand why is it so difficult to parse for you it's

58
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,620
blame so I it was it was it was a written format I can't tell if you're

59
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:05,020
being sarcastic I do you read things very often is this I think you can do it's a

60
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,780
skill I'm developing the idea is are all these things are happening and I

61
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,220
say and and because it's me and I do everything I do is small micro coaching

62
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,300
adjustments and nudges here and there and a little bit of organizing and

63
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,780
asking lots of good questions here and there so I said I'm not sure how much of

64
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,340
this blame I can take and he convinced me how much of how much of this is due to

65
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,100
things I've done and he convinced me whether I believe him or not this is

66
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:37,740
where the blame comes in he says no Alan you did this okay great so that's part

67
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,860
one that's part one of my rant the second part is and okay so I get it

68
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:51,800
for Brent who is dance really really you know what I've been bored for a hundred

69
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,400
thirty episodes give me a break actually no a DD trigger I'm moving on actually a

70
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,520
hundred and eleven episodes because thank God you weren't on one that yeah

71
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:14,440
113 minus yeah this is the 113th yeah I fixed the math that the the I fixed the

72
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:24,560
error in my head anyway everyone every six billion people in the world oh yeah

73
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,360
I know what he means it's a for Brent going it was a good thing he likes

74
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,640
what's happening in quality wants me to put together a presentation explain

75
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:41,720
sort of what we did so you got to do a brag deck for your CEO yes it's more

76
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,840
than a brag deck it's also explaining because we're gonna expand a lot and

77
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,120
this is a good concern and what I'm willing and happy to take on which is

78
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:55,520
if we're going to grow the number of people in the org we've all seen this

79
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,560
before you add a bunch especially Microsoft when you buy a company and say

80
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,720
oh that's not enough people you need to double those then the company ends up

81
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:11,160
dying rant okay so what I need to do is try and put that in a way that shows not

82
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,800
only what we've done but what we've learned and what we're doing so that we

83
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,160
know that when we expand it's all pure acceleration and not create scale to the

84
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,240
CEO I was gonna say how do you make it scale that's so damn cliche that I

85
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,860
didn't want to everybody says and then how do you make that scale I don't

86
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,460
like saying I'm I'm a I'm a loner I don't like saying the things everyone else is

87
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,940
saying so anyway you brought it up so now we're gonna move on this is episode

88
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,620
113 that part doesn't matter what matters is it's the last episode are you

89
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,940
bored again no the last episode of 2019 and we're gonna talk about we're gonna

90
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,780
take some time to reflect on 2019 including the predictions we made almost

91
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,060
exactly one year ago and then we'll talk about what we think is gonna happen

92
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,840
in 2020 and then I'm going to strangle Brent tear off his neck

93
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,760
Travis head reattach it to his neck backward using his hair as thread and

94
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:14,400
then I'll go home and celebrate my happy holidays all right so Brett tellin do

95
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,280
you want to start with a little bit of reflection on 2019 or do predictions on

96
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:25,950
2019 or or interweave them together we could talk about you know the the last

97
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:32,590
year the last year's predictions I did not write those down did you I did heck

98
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:38,260
yeah awesome yeah and we were talking in the hallway on the way to this room

99
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,900
earlier and our predictions were more more of the self-fulfilling variety like

100
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:50,020
they're more of like goals like I'm gonna do this right but most were I am

101
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:56,460
not gonna do this but but some weren't and we were still remarkably accurate

102
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:02,740
for two old dumb guys I had them so Brent we started with yours last year and the

103
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,940
first one is worth worth some mentioning today which is Brent will finally decide

104
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:16,240
whether or not he'll graduate and not only did he make a decision as of maybe

105
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:24,600
a week and a half ago no Monday as of Monday I'm again old Brent has graduated

106
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:33,000
round of applause from the three I have completed it I don't have my piece of

107
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,630
paper yet that should take two weeks for someone to tell me that they're

108
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:44,710
gonna that I get the piece of paper and then another month before doing it

109
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:52,360
that semester was hell as I knew it would be it was interesting going back to

110
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:59,840
listening to the first episode of this year because then I was still knee deep

111
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,560
in sort of the the torturous decision-making process and what finally

112
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:15,470
pushed me over I am done I do not foresee me ever pursuing a PhD oh then

113
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:22,510
you can make everyone call you doctor oh for sure right I was considering making

114
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:29,510
you have to refer to mr. Brent Jensen MS this whole episode but then I thought

115
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:37,020
that was stupid you've never called me mr. Alan Page mm that's true mmm

116
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,740
I got I have a degree in mmm bop the song by Hansen from the 90s you know go

117
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:49,180
on so I'm still kind of reeling it in it this this weekend will be the first

118
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,940
weekend in a very long time where I don't have to come into work to do

119
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:02,860
schoolwork so there's that there's that aspect of feeling that there's a big

120
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:13,380
gaping hole that you should be doing something now that I'm gonna have to fill

121
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,250
yeah I think you'll find something oh I know one of them obviously yeah be way

122
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,610
behind on holiday shopping so I got a I got that one to use you see a couple

123
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:36,910
hours on Amazon and I have not even launched Xbox even to watch Netflix in

124
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:41,190
at least six months expanse came out last night it's all I could do to not

125
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,910
stay up and watch I don't even know what that is you may have to start from the

126
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,950
beginning it's one of my favorite shows of all time now oh on Netflix Amazon

127
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,850
and actually Amazon they they were on sci-fi originally and Amazon bought that

128
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,690
they were gonna be cancer after three seasons and Amazon bought them and are

129
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:05,000
producing more on Amazon I haven't started yet but I'm excited to get into

130
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,880
the boys have you watched that no the boys is a

131
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,280
episode around it's a superhero show what but the superheroes there's sort of

132
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,680
like a Justice League type of thing but then they realize that the best

133
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,440
way to keep it's it's kind of like if you combine Justice League and I robot

134
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,520
where the the all-powerful beings realize that the way to keep peace is to

135
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:41,960
control it and the boys there's our set of regular people trying to revolt

136
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:48,630
against these super-powered individuals I will check it out all right so then

137
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:54,670
you predicted so so more on the ground for one prediction correct one prediction

138
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,150
correct you can keep tally over there a little notepad all right you also said

139
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,790
this one's not self-fulfilling and it's interesting and probably worth talking

140
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,910
about for a moment you predicted there will be more controversy and attacks on

141
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:14,740
modern testing yeah and I'm happy to say and like we've said before and all

142
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:21,910
repeated again is we've had various attacks on modern testing mainly people

143
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,110
not agreeing with some of the principles or whatever there was a conference

144
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:30,630
recently where someone made a passive mark about modern testing they tried to

145
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,950
attack it but they didn't understand it so didn't count I guess but we had

146
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:39,310
someone else write a series of articles on LinkedIn sort of passively

147
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,190
aggressively attacking modern testing principles and what I say to them is

148
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:51,410
welcome to the conversation oh yeah no so I think the attacks have gone up the the

149
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,730
one individual that you're referring to is actually one of the thought leaders

150
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:06,320
on the traditionalist side of testing with confirmed but a confirmed quote where

151
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,040
they're referring to modern testing right it's it it's definitely on the

152
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:17,600
mind of the traditionalist and I do think that that's going to become more

153
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,800
more and more open yeah and to be clear the people that look funny at us are

154
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,040
much more in that traditional test camp and we don't mean traditional someone

155
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,160
brought up software testing techniques which is I said well this is

156
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,440
traditional they never brought it was Rex block to brought that up and

157
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,630
Beiser if I recall correctly Beiser wrote software testing techniques for

158
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,430
developers but anyway I digress I'm not going to find the quote here because of

159
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:52,230
my tweets or all my complaints about the impeachment hearings last night but I'll

160
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:56,760
paraphrase the people attacking this partisan paraphrase people who are

161
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,960
concerned with modern testing are these traditional type testers and they think

162
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:07,000
it's attacking testing but as Brent and I have said we care very little about

163
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,640
testing we care a lot about quality and what the principles are about is

164
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,320
about building quality software we call it modern testing because it's an antidote

165
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,400
or a alternate way of looking at the traditional way of testing last or

166
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:24,280
testing as the way as the primary way to improve or to decrease risk and

167
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,520
improve quality so as many people from the test community who think oh the

168
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:35,520
customer can't evaluate quality or you can never not have testers I'm reading

169
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,480
and I put a couple quotes and this is where the paraphrase is gonna come in

170
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm reading the unicorn project which is about it's a horror story about a dev

171
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,480
ops transformation meaning they describe this company in the worst possible

172
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,240
state is what my all my only complaints about the book is that the

173
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,560
scenario they describe is so contrivedly bad and maybe their companies like this

174
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,720
and somebody will tell me there are that it's a little hard to go yeah okay

175
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,440
surely someone must have done something but anyway one of the quotes in there

176
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,240
is the the main character of the story Maxine is working with QA and she

177
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,440
makes some comment says they'll pair and help on testing here knowing

178
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:20,350
eventually the QA group will move into an advisory or consulting role yeah well

179
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,850
and it's not surprising it's like oh and this goes back to as much as you're

180
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,250
mad at Brent and I for the modern testing principles we're just taking

181
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,290
what's already there and looking at it going this is what works and writing it

182
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:39,690
down and and putting a label on it we didn't invent modern testing principles

183
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,420
much as we corralled them from our influences and how to make quality

184
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:47,460
software and experiences and I think you know moving to coaching as consultant

185
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,420
that was largely driven from my experiences and my coaching to test

186
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,820
teams and then moving to unity doing the same thing this is how it's

187
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:02,830
supposed to work it's not a new concept but what what I think we're doing is

188
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:12,120
we're pointing it out as key right agile testing right the Lee Sin Lee Sin Lee Sin

189
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,080
binder first and last name sorry Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory for those that

190
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,680
don't speak Brent right they've been talking about whole team testing for a

191
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:27,280
very long time yes right and now we're and we're just putting a big the whole

192
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,920
team testing without your specialist taking on a coaching role really all

193
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:38,560
we're doing is putting a big fat exclamation point on it's contagious yeah

194
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:43,080
yeah let's do another one okay so I think like lots of head nods people are

195
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,480
bored as bored as Brent I'm saying I met you don't so far you also and you're

196
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,120
gonna be at three in a second here because you also said we'll begin to see

197
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:58,400
more practical applications of modern testing yes and not only are we hearing

198
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
more like I use these principles we had David from three pull out the

199
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,200
principles during his interview at a job which he got we have people giving

200
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,200
talks about modern testing we had one at the online test conference literally

201
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,960
I read the abstracts said wow this is cool I went to post about it to see if

202
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,160
that person was in our slack group and they joined as I was opening up the

203
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:27,120
slack group said hey welcome I was just don't this is not creepy I was just

204
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,680
thinking of you so yeah we are seeing not just people that have listened to the

205
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,760
podcast we're seeing it the other way maybe at first we had people listen to

206
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,080
the podcast going or see talks that I gave and go yeah I'm gonna there's some

207
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,560
of this I can go try we're seeing people discover modern testing on their

208
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:50,120
own without knowing what it is and then coming and finding us going yeah there's

209
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,440
a home to describe what I've already been doing right it's sort of the like

210
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,160
the the seven degrees of Kevin Bacon right now it's we are seeing signs of

211
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:12,290
modern testing being a thing with people not knowing the source we've had a large

212
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:19,790
number of people this year have presentations with on the theme or even

213
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:26,270
explicitly referred to modern testing it is in as part of that virality we're

214
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:35,640
seeing new people come into it and not knowing the source which is fine it

215
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:41,060
doesn't offend me at all what so what I mean is when people are introduced Alan's

216
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,220
looking at me for those not watching no no no I was thinking I was bored and

217
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,940
trying to remember who said something I wanted to bring up later I was actually

218
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,060
planning I was I was playing 3d chess with our podcast oh I appreciate the

219
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:02,300
strategy okay go on yeah so there are signs that MT starting to take on its

220
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:10,520
own life right it in oh and potentially in a way that that you and I will no

221
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:17,520
longer be able to control yeah that's fine I'm not worried about it and it's

222
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,960
not like I'd ever see someone or you either we wouldn't see someone coaching

223
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,600
their team and trying to make them faster go hey that's modern testing you

224
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,040
have to call it that that's absolutely the opposite of our intent once it once

225
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,560
it achieves that tipping point and it's got its own momentum to me it's gonna be

226
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,120
the sign that you and I need to start thinking about okay what's the no and I

227
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,480
think we're already there we started off talking about like here here's why

228
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,600
these things are important and why you think they're important too we don't

229
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,920
have to sell that as much anymore it's more on the practicality how do

230
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:57,490
you how do you mature on these how do you what's that transition like from

231
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,250
moving into a coaching role and how do you how do you keep the team sharp and

232
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,610
understand new things it's more of the practical and advanced application of the

233
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,130
principles more than the convincing people they're valid part we did in the

234
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:16,380
beginning yeah and then because no one's a winner all the time Brent's

235
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:25,210
final prediction was we will create principle number eight did not happen

236
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:31,500
did not need to happen not to say it will never happen yeah and you can go back to

237
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:41,700
episode 97 ish 96 I did I was yeah the idea there were not won't dive into

238
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,860
deeply was that what about the individual how do we make sure the

239
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:50,570
person doing this is taken care of and maybe that came up in context because as

240
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:55,250
we recorded last year's I was still on job limbo I wasn't moved into my new

241
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:01,980
cool monetization Alan does what he wants role yeah we we we had a good

242
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,700
discussion on that one the way I would interpret number six is our 96 brother

243
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,660
when we talked about my proposed principle eight we had a good

244
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:25,430
discussion I concluded that we we at minimum both needed to be anonymous or

245
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:32,310
not anonymous on it being a good principle before proposing it to the

246
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:41,150
three as at this point in time I don't think empty we curated I don't think we

247
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:48,170
own it meaning it's the principle number five it's a customer's that define

248
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:56,230
it so I don't think we fully closed or locked it down but because we're very

249
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:02,240
ADD ridden we never brought it up again and one of the things Alan pointed out

250
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,400
in that episode is that I don't think there he he didn't think it was

251
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,720
important enough to put on there and I think time has it's I think time has

252
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:19,280
proven that out yeah right so yeah excellent I'm three for four all right and

253
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,480
that was the end of your predictions before we get to mine we had a couple

254
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,720
other predictions throughout the year or for that episode one was from Ryan

255
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,840
quell horse he had a couple but the one I want to call out is the rise of say

256
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:38,780
continued rise of DevOps DevOps DevOps DevOps and I think the unicorn project

257
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,900
and watching what they're doing with the DevOps transformation is a lot

258
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,140
about modern testing so I'm gonna slightly skew his prediction and show

259
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,500
that yes and I've said a few episodes ago and it could just be biased because

260
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:00,300
I'm taking over the DevOps team at in our org at Unity but it is a fantastic

261
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,380
way to draw to accelerate the achievement of equality

262
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,580
I think that is all about 2019 absolutely in the context of the AB

263
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:15,410
testing podcast anyway if not the world I think 2019 was the year of DevOps I

264
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:22,700
can't disagree and did accelerate came out in 2018 if I remember correctly

265
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:29,280
wasn't a 2019 book definitely not could even in 2017 we weren't aware of

266
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,680
it until no I definitely read it in 2018 because it was an inspiration for me in

267
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:42,040
the quality culture acceleration quality culture transition guide I wrote it was

268
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:47,800
some of the inspiration for how I put that together okay so that's how I know

269
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:53,880
is out of year and then Tess Pappy had a couple predictions hey Patrick he said

270
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,800
Trump will manage to go two days in two straight days without being a total

271
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,000
D bag and he's wrong he failed couldn't make it two days and he also

272
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,400
predicted these his other prediction which also thankfully didn't happen other

273
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,800
than a well photoshopped or or CSS edited is he predicted there would be an

274
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:25,160
IST QB modern testing certification yeah yeah a little tongue-in-cheek okay many of

275
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,320
my predictions were also self-fulfilling I'll go through my five

276
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,080
predictions you can comment I said I was well on track to move myself out of

277
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,760
a role done check it's sort of what I do for better for worse and and luckily I

278
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:50,520
tend to land well despite everything around me I think you thrive better in

279
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:58,650
ambiguous environments I do I do I I do that's where I like to live I predicted

280
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,140
that I would not speak at any testing conferences 2019 I did not I spoke at

281
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,500
one conference or it of in as we talked about a few episodes ago so also true

282
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,950
again very easy to make that self-fulfilling come we'll come back and

283
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,950
figure out what I'm doing in 2020 I predicted that Avengers would be my

284
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:28,250
favorite movie of 2019 ooh struggle if he says it wasn't then he's wrong on

285
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,890
the prediction but if he says it was and it wasn't then he's a liar on air

286
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:47,760
what's your choice I don't know I don't think I can add I think it was like a bad

287
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,480
prediction that I shouldn't answer because of exact same things you just

288
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:58,560
said and honestly it's probably between that and Captain Marvel which a lot of

289
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:05,560
people didn't like I really liked it I wrote it down I I did not do a lot of

290
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:13,180
movies this year but of the ones that I did see and here I'm limiting it to the

291
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:21,340
ones that I saw in the theaters Captain Marvel was the best one I saw in theater

292
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:35,440
and I saw in game I did not like in game I did not I like it I actually I like

293
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,160
all the Marvel movies but I liked I think I liked Captain Marvel more to

294
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,040
interesting about that up yeah I definitely like that okay let's move on

295
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:48,560
my last one was not there was no way for me to make this self-fulfilling and it

296
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:55,760
was really made off the cuff but more on gut and maybe more on want and more of

297
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,600
me wanting to we have one of our listeners Michael Richard who is a big

298
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,000
royale Salt Lake fan that's major league soccer for those not in the US

299
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,880
it's it's like it's like real soccer they play in Europe just a little slower

300
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,920
with a little clumsier but I predicted that our local team Seattle Sounders

301
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:20,800
football club would make it to the MLS Cup which is a end of year tournament

302
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:28,160
and that they would win and I'm happy to say that not only did they win is that I

303
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:34,160
was at the game and had a fantastic time watching my home team win the

304
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,640
championship so super happy that one came true and I got to be a little bit of

305
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,320
a part of it exciting stuff congrats well yeah so I look mostly I kicked butt on

306
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,760
my predictions they were kind in hindsight they were kind of safe

307
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:54,160
predictions yeah you know it's better to make predictions particularly if you're

308
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,160
gonna get judged at the end of it it's better reading predictions that you're in

309
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:08,240
control of right so I recently learned I'm not a master of the soccer's but I

310
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,480
recently learned and hopefully it's a true fact that Drew Carey is either

311
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,720
owner or part owner yes he's part owner yeah I didn't I'm like oh neat he is I'm

312
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:30,220
a fan of Drew Carey a fan of Macklemore I could listen to thrift shop Don

313
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,940
repeat all day long I love that I don't know that I would say I'm a fan of

314
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,980
Macklemore I went to college with Michael ones Lee he sings the he's the

315
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:41,580
singer on the song and he's another part owner and Russell Wilson from the

316
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,920
Seahawks is another part owner okay nifty nifty

317
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:52,300
Nift Shop so that's it for predictions a couple other reflections which I'm gonna

318
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,180
I wanted to put in here but I haven't thought through for 2019 do want to

319
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,740
mention I'm thankful for our listeners and not just people who download the

320
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:11,800
show but the slack community we have is it's fantastic there is it's just people

321
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,240
helping each other out people willing to try things people willing to we had

322
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,520
people put together a github account for modern testing to try and capture all

323
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:27,320
our resources just all kinds of help and involvement in trying to spread the

324
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,720
word on what we do so a big shout out and thanks for everyone who helps out

325
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
2018

326
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,400
we're 2019 you had a 2017 prediction I think it was Brent's having your math

327
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:48,830
problems right you definitely had a prediction and it's not this time

328
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:55,680
around modern testing that or would become a thing well we want a modern

329
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:00,760
testing to be a thing and modern note you specifically called out the website

330
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:04,360
modern testing that which is just a link to the principles on anger weasel

331
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:14,450
calm right but because here I'm just gonna credit David directly he had the

332
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,610
idea hey this let's start putting this on github let's start organizing this

333
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:27,210
this get have the three do self-service stuff I actually think him being

334
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:34,050
motivated to do that is going to help your prediction be true albeit quite late

335
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:45,650
but true we are really a show about of and for the people and it's great to see

336
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:54,520
the community take charge and starting to add content I can't wait to see what

337
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,880
comes next yeah that's the fun part I can't wait to see what comes next

338
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,680
other let me join into predictions you probably have some I have it I have

339
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:10,200
several so it's funny so last year let's do some typical things so the

340
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,160
best of right do you have that list I know no but I in my head I do because

341
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,680
they didn't go over I did read through the podcast list so what was the best

342
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,640
episode I think I think some of these things you really easy you don't even

343
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:31,280
need to ask you don't even need to ask our hands-down best episode of all time

344
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,080
was the one that you weren't on no just kidding it was episode 100 that had

345
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:43,560
everyone on it yeah it was fantastic completely agree that was fun

346
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,830
again predictions but that was that was great I think we covered a lot of

347
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,390
ground I when I look back on the earth it will Britain I'll just talk about the

348
00:33:53,390 --> 00:34:00,120
same stuff every time but we don't somehow we don't I looked back and it's

349
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,120
fun to see our thought process and of what we talk about and the things change

350
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,400
which is great and we're rolling with it we're not stuck in the past the themes

351
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:15,880
are I think I mean you can always you can go back to episode one and see

352
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,680
themes that we're still keeping alive today so I mean we're consistent we

353
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:31,860
changed the scale of the content best book oh gosh I don't keep track of what

354
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,980
what year my books come out I'm enjoying except for the contrived the

355
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:40,540
contrivity example I gave earlier I'm enjoying the unicorn project very much

356
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:46,300
hmm that's probably its proximity because all the books are great when I

357
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:53,100
read them but I don't know what else to throw out there I'm going to say given

358
00:34:53,100 --> 00:35:00,860
our official a B testing declaration that 2019 was the year of DevOps the

359
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:06,140
absolute most important and best book for this last year and if you haven't

360
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:11,420
read it you still need to is accelerate okay but didn't come out in 2019 I

361
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:17,020
don't care okay fine it is one of my favorites is one of the books I keep

362
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:21,580
there are a handful of books I keep with an arm distance of my desk I think

363
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:30,020
accelerate it is if there was an MVP of books I think accelerate is an important

364
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,670
enough book to be up there next to product development flow yes and

365
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,270
actually it's another book with lean startup those are those are three three

366
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,070
books that I keep within arms distance of my desk at home all right we talked

367
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:51,130
about movies already I did not do much podcast listening do you have a

368
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:57,140
favorite Oh other podcasts yeah let me think what new podcasts I've added I've

369
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,700
been toying with podcast like thinking about getting a new podcast player

370
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,940
recently but I haven't found what I liked other than the the old-fashioned

371
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:09,010
what I'm using but that's a total big tangent I found what's it called

372
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:15,090
give me a moment let me bring up two podcasts that I discovered over the last

373
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:25,350
year that I really like one is speaking a DevOps DevOps DevOps it's arrested

374
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,330
DevOps if you get it it's a play on arrested development but arrested DevOps

375
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:34,650
is pretty good good interviewers I like what they do they had I found the show

376
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,970
when Nicole Forsger was on it and she was fantastic on her episode and I've

377
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:44,560
listened every episode since the other one I listen to is nothing to do with

378
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,160
software but you know I I like trivia I'm always adding trivia podcast sometimes

379
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,370
I drop them because they they're sucky but I like puzzles too and the one I

380
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:02,410
probably added most recently that I like is a podcast called escape escape

381
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:10,630
this podcast and what it is it's a verbal it's an escape room done via

382
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:17,640
conversation okay so it says you're in a room here's what you see and then the

383
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,460
host has to say you know here's what you find as you as you discover things and

384
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:28,040
it's it's fun I just like the lateral thinking of those things it's it the

385
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,520
problem is they're about an hour long and most podcasts I can pause in the

386
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,880
middle and come back I need to kind of do these on road trips where I can

387
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,190
listen to the whole thing okay because I kind of want to listen to 60 minutes all

388
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,110
at once but yeah I've enjoyed that my favorite new podcast is that one

389
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:46,710
favorite one to write that the listeners would like is arrested DevOps

390
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:52,150
that's an interesting concept how about you man oh I'm only like five or episodes

391
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:55,590
in and I'm way behind I've been around for a couple years so I have plenty

392
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,590
more information to go through no so because of the degree as I mentioned if

393
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:05,790
I don't spend time on on on Xbox right you can pretty much guarantee I'm not

394
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:11,470
gonna do much on podcasts got a drive to work man you got a drive to work yeah

395
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,990
lately I've been listening to my radio station down in California I had noticed

396
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:22,750
that they stream and those who are familiar with the station in LA called

397
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:30,070
Caro Q this year the famous morning show Kevin and Bean being left the

398
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:39,500
episode or left the show moved to England and that show has been sort of a

399
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:49,680
big part of my daily ritual for decades gotcha I do have a best TV show oh

400
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,200
interesting cuz I don't watch much TV yeah oh well and you I know you cut

401
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:02,720
the cable I yeah well you do but you get all the same channels have you heard of

402
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:07,680
the show the masked singer I have seen a commercial for it this is actually good

403
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:17,800
oh it's awesome love that show I can't say enough about it but we're at a time

404
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:26,040
when we got to predict things okay I will put it on my list I have YouTube

405
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,960
TV so I'm sure they have recordings of I can go find you can just make sure so

406
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,840
it's very much about you're gonna go into it I'll let you know so just

407
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:44,090
giving you it it's a guessing game you're trying to figure out who's in this mask

408
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,920
right when I have to know there's ruin the fun really quick and if you go up

409
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,920
on YouTube there's a good chance because of the search engine you're you'll

410
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:00,640
be watching something and then in the search box down below it'll be oh the

411
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:08,360
peacock revealed as an example so it's a lot more fun if you if you don't know

412
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:16,670
the result shall we get into it I have what a whole bunch of predictions to be

413
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:19,910
wrong on next year okay and I don't have any prepared but I'll see if I can

414
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:27,630
come up with some okay go for it all right let me start with the one that

415
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:41,400
will drive you the most insane politics I predict Trump will get reelected but I

416
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:48,590
also predict Pelosi will keep the house listeners of the show may or may not

417
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:53,870
realize I am a libertarian so that puts me in a position where I continuously

418
00:40:53,870 --> 00:41:01,320
either agree or disagree with you I think both of the the two parties are

419
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:09,520
wrong quite often but none of my candidates will ever ever ever ever show

420
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,960
up I don't disagree and and just to be clear I have survived through

421
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,600
presidents I have not agreed with for many years and I'm okay with that

422
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:25,130
that's the way politics works it's the way the country works were yes what I

423
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:28,890
don't agree with is a president committing crimes and having his party

424
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:35,000
back him up because for party lines that shouldn't happen as an independent I

425
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,260
will say and you'll see this in the reports the majority of the independence

426
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:50,160
and I will lie with I will stand with this don't think the impeachment trials

427
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:57,400
are concluding the way the Democrats are espousing I do think if they continue

428
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,120
focus on this it will actually harm the Democratic Party and that will be why

429
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,960
Trump wins yeah I think there's a good unfortunately there's a good chance of

430
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,590
that yeah I'm still glad it's happening yeah all right move on to something else

431
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:16,710
okay if any other day besides after me watching six hours of impeachment

432
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:26,090
last night driving you crazy I would like to move on I'll just start at the top so

433
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,610
we spent a lot of time talking about DevOps I am going to introduce a term I

434
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,490
don't think we've ever talked about on the show oh god and I think this term

435
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:45,370
will mainstream next year the term is AI ops interesting well tell me about

436
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:51,800
because we have an ML ops we talk about ML ops a lot at Unity so I don't know ML

437
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,720
and AI are different so talk to me about AI ops AI ops there's another term you

438
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:05,320
may not have heard of which is RPA and I forget the P but it's robotic process

439
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:11,360
automation okay and by the way Jason Huggins on the show that was one of my

440
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:16,290
other highlights of the year oh yeah that was fantastic I completely agree

441
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:25,330
the croissants are Selenium go on yeah so DevOps is is essentially the dev team in

442
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,690
a nutshell the way where the the name comes from is the dev team owns

443
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,450
operations it's not a separate team you have to create in you have to create

444
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,770
monitors you have to continuously monitor the situation yet to respond

445
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:46,210
quickly okay that decision-making will begin to move to artificial intelligence

446
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:53,610
ML ops is kind of a in my humble opinion sort of a nonsensical concept because

447
00:43:53,610 --> 00:44:00,290
machine learned is it's not decision-making but it's around gathering

448
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:05,210
the data to make it easier to make those decisions so I view ML as sort of a

449
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:13,690
way to scale DevOps but AI ops where the decision is made if by a robotic system

450
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:19,890
will begin to mainstream next year that's a prediction cool that's a good

451
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:29,310
prediction go on MT will mainstream next year what does that mean talk me oh and

452
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,790
I knew you would ask because I told you I'm good at asking questions yes yes

453
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:49,630
yes here's what I lay down I will say up front that literally it will be wrong but

454
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:56,080
I think it from a probabilistic point of view I will end up being more right than

455
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:05,320
wrong I believe that there will be one talk per major test conference specifically

456
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:14,400
containing or about modern testing this next year I think that could happen I

457
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,880
like that and and I want to be because when I say about I don't know that

458
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,400
qualifies as mainstream but it definitely gives it closer to the tipping

459
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:31,950
point yes I think on the tipping point discussion I do with some of the

460
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:38,030
convergence of modern testing and AI ops and software by Alan Page I do think

461
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,990
one of the things that's a potential because I people following me know I've

462
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,790
been constantly looking for wins the tipping point wins the tipping point

463
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:51,630
wins the tipping point I'm actually beginning to worry that that the

464
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:56,470
tipping point will not occur because the tipping point of the next of

465
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:04,280
post-modern testing will actually occur first huh right because if for example if

466
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,840
AI ops does mainstream that that leapfrogs that that leapfrogs a lot of

467
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:19,560
this stuff sure and I'm gonna comment on that one and get a prediction to hear

468
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,360
myself because we could make that self-fulfilling I could go give a talk

469
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,120
on modern testing in every major testing conference that I predict that's not

470
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:34,930
going to happen I predict once again I will I will speak at exactly one

471
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:40,690
conference in 2020 and to be clear and I'll totally honest I have no

472
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,850
conferences lined up I haven't I've said no to everybody so far people are not

473
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:50,290
asking me anymore because I say no all the time which is great but I will

474
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:55,250
predict I will speak at one conference in 2020 it won't be a testing conference

475
00:46:55,250 --> 00:47:03,080
it won't be no I'm it may be a DevOps conference maybe a dev conference maybe

476
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,680
something else I don't know but I'm not speaking at any testing conferences but

477
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:10,200
I will I do think I'll speak at one conference I don't know which one yet I

478
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,840
should probably figure that out just pointing out that I'm not gonna make

479
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,800
this happen by showing up and giving talks at test no the thing is is I'm

480
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,760
like hmm I have a big gaping hole now in my life since I don't it says I

481
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:29,440
don't have school maybe it's time for test bash Seattle oh and if I do test

482
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,880
bash Seattle I can guarantee that Alan's prediction will be wrong so much

483
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:46,280
time plotting for my demise the the other thing on MTV I wrote down two

484
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,120
criteria one I think a one talk per every major conference and I'll even

485
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:58,840
say not by us and even potentially by people we don't know yet currently not a

486
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:07,150
member not of the three I think MT attackers will grow yeah I think we're

487
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:12,550
going to start seeing right now 2018 we see a lot of passive aggression that

488
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:16,510
right I think it'll start being direct I think that I think name calling will

489
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:21,790
begin I think that's inevitable and that's yeah I mean name calling should

490
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:27,430
continue I've been called things no name calling on MT yeah yeah I mean

491
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:35,030
you're a dick I had that when we call that I can recall one conversation about

492
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:40,630
principle number five or I was told I was ignorant and wrong and and harming

493
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:47,950
the craft yeah but I think we're modern animals got deeply sucked into that one

494
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:54,550
modern testing is a threat to those that make a living relying on testing as the

495
00:48:54,550 --> 00:49:00,140
primary way to reduce risk in the project testing is not the threat the

496
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:06,250
threat is the world's changing we put a name on it like yes that us we're those

497
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:13,330
people taking down modern testing does not save their careers I know I deny

498
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:18,490
change is what they're saying when they call me an asshole right that's fine

499
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:26,000
whatever and into those who like we see the change going in and if they say hey

500
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,520
we're harming the craft no we're naturally not because the craft is on

501
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,880
its way to death and I don't care about the craft I care about the people who

502
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,240
are in their skill sets and I care about quality and I care about helping

503
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:46,600
those people transition into the new world yeah and I will not be silenced

504
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:55,630
blah blah blah okay observability the term observability will kill the term

505
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:03,440
testability um I have no idea how I'm going to measure success or failure on

506
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,160
that I don't know so I look at that differently I would tell you why that

507
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,600
one's gonna be wrong now I look at my biggest two levers to improve quality

508
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:17,160
our testability which which includes the testing we do like how quickly can we

509
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,320
do the testing we need to do before we deploy and operability which includes

510
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:25,240
observability among how we do to safe deployments etc but I look at those as

511
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:30,680
done done equal and what I got now I can't paraphrase the quote of the damn

512
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,960
show but I look at those as equal levers I have to help improve the

513
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,880
quality of what I think is gonna happen so tell me tell me the difference

514
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,600
what's gonna what's gonna rock my world here's what's gonna happen all right as

515
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:48,680
empty progresses the term testability is brought up because of separation of

516
00:50:48,680 --> 00:51:00,310
disciplines as empty continues and dev takes over this testability isn't a word

517
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,430
that's in that language we don't have it I still think of it as testability

518
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:09,350
it's all the work we do to make all the code correctness and code simplicity

519
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:17,010
stuff and being able to easily write enough tests that will all disappear

520
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:24,600
that will all just so be wrapped into what does it mean to be a developer yes

521
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,960
and that's really what it's about that and on that front testability will

522
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,840
become accountability look sure right yeah I get that observability is very

523
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,080
similar to testability except what we're now trying to look at is customer we're

524
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,840
gonna have a whole podcast about this because I agree with you but my my

525
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,440
definitions and how it happens are different okay so we're gonna talk about

526
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,080
testability and operability at an upcoming podcast go on let me go

527
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,160
through we have people looking in the window I only have a few things and I

528
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:02,640
can go very quickly I do think in 2020 we're gonna start seeing everyone

529
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:09,800
becoming sort of a compliance expert gross I hate it too but necessary I think

530
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:16,000
it'll be necessary the personal note I think I will start guitar lessons this

531
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,640
next year all right I have a huge hole mentioned over and over again and then

532
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:31,530
on the sports front I think the Niners will play but lose to the Ravens in the

533
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:37,330
NFC championships and not make the Super Bowl and this saddens me greatly and I

534
00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:41,690
hope I am wrong on that prediction on the the quick my sports front thank you

535
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,610
for those I don't really care about the Niners and really really who does

536
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:49,450
that's American football the one where you don't use your feet for our foreign

537
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:53,730
listeners I predict on the Sounders front the Sounders will make the playoffs

538
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:58,210
the 12 straight straight year but they will not win the MLS Cup they'll

539
00:52:58,210 --> 00:53:03,340
probably lose in the the conference championship the semi-final

540
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:08,060
conference championship but I do predict they will make it to the final of the

541
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:13,100
CCL the CONCACAF Champions League where they will lose to one of the Mexican

542
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:20,670
teams not the galaxy they're not in they didn't they didn't make the CCL yeah I

543
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:27,430
only know two football clubs and that's probably all I didn't prepare any

544
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:31,670
predictions I gave lots of feedback on Brent's anything else really quickly

545
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:35,470
here before we close up I predict I already gave you my conference

546
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:44,240
prediction I gave you that yeah I'm gonna oh here's one I have as long as

547
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,710
Brent's know me I've changed jobs every two years the end of year next year will

548
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:54,430
be almost two years of mine in my current job I will predict that one year

549
00:53:54,430 --> 00:54:00,840
from now I'll still be in this job and we'll have at least another year after

550
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,280
that I think it's gonna take me longer to work myself out of this role that's

551
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,040
good for you it is I suppose all right happy holidays happy 2019 thank you

552
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,880
everyone for listening once again I'm still Alan I'm Brent and we'll see you

553
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,960
later see you in the new year
