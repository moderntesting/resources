1
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:13,730
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,730
Happy.

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,730
You all right, Brett?

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,970
Yeah, not enough coffee for you to already start hitting on me.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,050
Well, you know how things go when you're having fun.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:25,970
I'm Alan, and that's Brent, as you can tell.

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,050
We're here for another episode of AB Testing.

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,050
Number 90.

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,050
Okay, so...

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,650
Hey, so what is the AB Podcast all about, Alan?

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,650
I...

12
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,650
It's...

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,650
I don't know.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:45,410
And to your financial report of political views, AB Testing is a podcast by Alan and Brent,

15
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,330
and we talk about making great software.

16
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:55,170
Sometimes it's about software testing, sometimes it's about data science and other fancy buzzwords.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,290
Software engineering, agile, leadership, most importantly.

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,130
Lately, this thing we've been talking about...

19
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,130
Shift left.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:06,370
...nonstop, shift into my pants.

21
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,920
Modern testing.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,520
And man, I got to tell you, it's weird.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
We've been talking about...

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,760
We talked about the principles for a couple episodes.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,480
Then we deep dove into the principles for a while.

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,880
And then we took questions that came up during those discussions for a while.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,340
And it's been a long time since we had a podcast where the topic wasn't specifically

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,940
modern testing, even though we always...

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,940
Will come up.

30
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,100
For sure.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,740
But it's a little weird, as I was driving here this morning, there's a weird thing that

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:53,710
happens if you don't live in the Northwest, in the tech center of Washington.

33
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,350
There's a vortex where...

34
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:00,230
Maybe it's a vortex, I'm not sure, but you can tell how close you are to Microsoft

35
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:06,160
Campus by how bad the driving is.

36
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,640
And there's a correlation, and maybe you can do the data science on this, it's expensive

37
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,960
cars driving poorly.

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,280
Oh my God, I must be near a Microsoft building.

39
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,380
Are you sure it's Microsoft?

40
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,800
I'm pretty damn sure.

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,930
Because I think it's the tech center.

42
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,250
It's not like there's a lot of other tech companies buried around here.

43
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,250
They are in the Northwest, but around the Microsoft Campus, it's Microsoft.

44
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,930
Oh, so yeah, if you come closer to the East side, yeah, it's definitely...

45
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,730
Yeah, as I get closer to the Microsoft headquarters...

46
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,130
There's Google on the East side as well.

47
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,690
But they're up in Kirkland, they're not here in this epicenter.

48
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,650
And they may drive poorly there too, but I can tell as I...

49
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,890
I'm fairly certain they do.

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,450
All right, well, I want you to go do the...

51
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:54,650
And then I would also...

52
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,410
Do the proofy proofy data science stuff on that.

53
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,450
Yeah, I will get right on that.

54
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,970
All right, so that's my hypothesis.

55
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:10,530
My hypothesis is that if I see an expensive car driving very, very badly, I'm near a Microsoft

56
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,130
building.

57
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:17,970
I think it's also going to be heavily correlated to your latitude and longitude at that moment

58
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,180
in time.

59
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,700
Because I think if you worked at or near Amazon and you had to drive there on a day-to-day

60
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,940
basis, you would find the same things.

61
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
Perhaps, perhaps.

62
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,260
Although that is also just because driving in Seattle blows.

63
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,860
Near someplace that had...

64
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,060
Well, at least if you work there, you have a reasonable public transportation route to

65
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,060
get there.

66
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,190
Yeah.

67
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,580
Okay, so anyway...

68
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,420
Which also blows.

69
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,740
For our next number, we'd like to play the soothing sounds of boss gags.

70
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,290
Okay, go ahead.

71
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,810
Okay, we have...

72
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,810
It's weird.

73
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:04,570
We have sort of an agenda on the board, but we're not going to do it right away.

74
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,370
Well, maybe not in that order.

75
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,090
Actually, in terms of soothing sounds, like really buzz?

76
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,830
I was trying to pick something that I didn't like in the 70s.

77
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,830
Oh, okay.

78
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,830
Fair enough.

79
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,830
It was sarcastic.

80
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,830
Yes, it was.

81
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,550
I'm like, why would you pick that?

82
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,550
There's so many better...

83
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,550
Okay.

84
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,630
I immediately started thinking of Miles Davis.

85
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,820
I like Miles Davis.

86
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,780
That's because he's awesome.

87
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:40,100
Well, really, he did all these relaxing, cooking, all these albums with this great band and

88
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,500
John Coltrane.

89
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,180
Those are the best.

90
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,180
People always go to the mainstream.

91
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,100
They go, oh, I'm into Miles Davis because they have Kinda Blue.

92
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,760
I go, fine.

93
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,640
Check out the better stuff.

94
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,040
Kinda Blue's good, to be clear.

95
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,120
But relax and cook in all, which I just said before, but that whole series of stuff.

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,520
Remember there, at that time, putting out an album, they'd put out like three a year,

97
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
four years sometimes.

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
That's impressive.

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,560
So these guys in different bands, all the time.

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,560
I saw it.

101
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
They were great players.

102
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
They could improvise.

103
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,160
Record companies were making most of the money from that.

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,120
Those recordings are so good.

105
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,220
Anyway...

106
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,110
How about Leon Redbone?

107
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,830
Never was much into Leon.

108
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,110
I introduced him to my...

109
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,270
I think there's really only a couple of songs.

110
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:39,210
I introduced him to my son the other day and he looked at me like, what is wrong with you?

111
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:43,610
Oh, my daughter and I had a weird moment that we don't speak of anymore, but we actually

112
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,140
found out that sometimes our musical tastes overlap.

113
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:54,420
I was listening to something and she goes, wait, I like that song.

114
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,380
I said, all right, let's just move on.

115
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,320
To be clear, she listens to a lot of stuff I don't like.

116
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
She's into K-pop.

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,970
I'll just leave it there.

118
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,970
What did I do wrong?

119
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:18,020
I was just like, oh, I have that on my playlist.

120
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,660
I could annoy Alan right now.

121
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,180
Oh, God.

122
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:31,660
Some of those songs is extremely fun to keep on your...

123
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,460
What is it?

124
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,540
K-pop band 21, I think, or something?

125
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
I don't know.

126
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,500
They have the song, I Am The Best.

127
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,980
That sounds like a Pokemon song.

128
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,980
Pokemon song.

129
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,980
Don't most of them...

130
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
Yeah, shucks.

131
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
Okay.

132
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,660
But any time my middle-aged son, or not my middle-aged, but my teenage son, middle son...

133
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,140
Fred's so old he has a middle-aged son.

134
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,260
No, I kind of combine middle and teenage inappropriately.

135
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,800
Wait, what did you do in a pro...

136
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
Never mind.

137
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,360
Any time he's misbehaving, I could throw that one up, or pretty much anything from Taylor

138
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,300
Swift immediately...

139
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,380
Don't be harsh and untate.

140
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,380
I'm not.

141
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,380
She's fantastic.

142
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,520
I find her music extremely useful.

143
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,420
Say what you will, that woman can write a pop song.

144
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,980
So on that front, it's actually interesting because my son, the same son, he's now at

145
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:52,300
a point where he's starting to express that he likes dad's music more than dad.

146
00:07:52,300 --> 00:08:00,180
So he'll find some obtuse band from the 80s or the 90s, and he'll go, yeah, this freaking

147
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,180
rocks.

148
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,840
I'm mostly into what used to be called alternative rock.

149
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,340
Our local radio station, The End, is mostly what I would listen to, although...

150
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,340
Are they still around?

151
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,340
They're still around.

152
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,620
I haven't listened to anything on the radio in so long.

153
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Anyway...

154
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:30,860
The radio station that I grew up with, which was KROQ in LA, they're now streaming on Radio.com,

155
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,260
and that's pretty much all I listen to now.

156
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,500
He'll listen to some songs that used to have a lot of play, and I'm like, who the hell

157
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
are you listening to?

158
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
He's like, dad, oh, this is...

159
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,310
What is it?

160
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,310
Social...

161
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,310
Distortion?

162
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,310
Yes.

163
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:54,140
And I'm like, oh, yeah, it is.

164
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:02,580
He's way into Foo Fighters, he's way into Green Day, he's over the top into Red Hot Chili Peppers.

165
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,620
Are those considered alternative?

166
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,620
I never paid attention.

167
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,620
Alternative rock.

168
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,620
All right, whatever.

169
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,180
I was done with Red Hot Chili Peppers about 10 years ago, and the fact that it's come

170
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,700
back as he's full on addicted to them, I know he's a crap out of me.

171
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,900
Give it away, give it away, give it away.

172
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,410
Now.

173
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,410
Give it away now.

174
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,330
All right, there was...

175
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:32,330
Oh, quickly, Weasel is heading to changing the subject, is that okay?

176
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,330
Just interrupt me.

177
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,780
Yeah, you know, it's funny, because I didn't pick up on the change, and I'm like...

178
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,780
I interpret...

179
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,300
Speaking of LA, I'll do a segue.

180
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,060
Speaking of LA, I'm heading to Anaheim next week.

181
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,300
I interpreted your statement as Weezer, which by the way, the Africa song is fantastic.

182
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,900
Oh, did you see...

183
00:09:51,900 --> 00:10:00,100
But everybody's seen, I mean, lots of play about Weezer covering Africa by Toto very,

184
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
very well.

185
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,260
Did I see the Toto hash pipe cover?

186
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,700
Did you know that Toto covered hash pipe?

187
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,260
No, but let me finish my freaking story.

188
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,820
Did you see it gets better?

189
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,860
Imagine what is better than Weezer covering Toto's Africa.

190
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
What could be better?

191
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,690
Imagine when Weird Al joins them on stage to play an accordion solo during the song.

192
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,690
I have not seen that.

193
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,250
That is worth checking out.

194
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,370
It's not just Weezer playing Africa.

195
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,890
It's Weezer playing Africa with Weird Al, not coming out to be Weird Al, not coming

196
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:35,300
out to do a parody, just playing a rockin' accordion solo.

197
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,580
Did he take over the keyboard solo part of that song?

198
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,460
It's a moment that I'm glad was captured on film.

199
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,660
Usually I hate it when I go to a concert and there's like 50,000 people, I guess I

200
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,660
don't go to concerts that big.

201
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,060
I go to concerts that are in very small places usually.

202
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,300
But when everybody's holding their camera up the whole damn show, their phone up the

203
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,740
whole damn show, it's like, just watch, man.

204
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,740
Use your eyes.

205
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
All right.

206
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,380
It's very easy to find on the internets.

207
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,820
Brand has already bookmarked that.

208
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,340
That's my homepage now.

209
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,730
So anyway, I'll be at Star West coming up here.

210
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,010
Kids and I are going down early, going to the Disneyland thing.

211
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm going to send them back.

212
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,010
Hopefully they make it home.

213
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,850
Then I'll do my tutorial.

214
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:21,850
I come back.

215
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,850
I'm back for a week.

216
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,310
I go down to Portland for PNSQC.

217
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,310
Really looking forward to that.

218
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,990
I kind of need to finish my presentation for that.

219
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,390
So go ahead and ask your question.

220
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,390
Star West?

221
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,390
Star West.

222
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,390
Is this because you had that prior commit?

223
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,390
Yes.

224
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,390
Okay.

225
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,390
Yeah, I'm just doing a tutorial, nothing else.

226
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,430
And then I'm flying back afterwards.

227
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,630
And then PNSQC, I am working on my presentation.

228
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,870
So for those of you that have seen my modern testing thing, which would be just those of

229
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,370
you at Test Bash, hello, everyone.

230
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,650
Welcome to the cast.

231
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,650
Yes.

232
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:04,530
I kind of ish some of the same stuff, but so much has changed.

233
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,890
So at Test Bash, if you remember, the one listener, one of the three that was there, if you remember.

234
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,130
You're talking about Brighton or Philly?

235
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,130
Brighton.

236
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,130
Brighton.

237
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,130
Philly was like a year before.

238
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,130
Everything was a twinkle in our eyes.

239
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:20,930
And I was working on Microsoft Teams.

240
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,960
Oh my God.

241
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,520
Is there a story that you can tell me off the air?

242
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,690
I don't think it's inappropriate to say on air.

243
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:41,070
So I'll just do it this way.

244
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:56,300
Teams, lowercase teams, some are being forced to be on capital T teams instead of Skype.

245
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:10,700
Honestly, I don't really care except for, you know, forcing people to do exactly the

246
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:16,220
same sort of crap they've been doing on a totally new interface.

247
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,420
But it's the best.

248
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,560
Defined by who?

249
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,560
I can give you a name.

250
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,340
I know the name that you would probably name.

251
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,570
And I just, so yesterday I loaded up Skype.

252
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,290
I needed to talk to one of my PM's.

253
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:42,050
Skype had the little green indicating, as you know, hey, my PM is there and he's available.

254
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,230
So I started typing, wrote a long ass thing because I knew he was in his office, not in

255
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,920
the meeting.

256
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:58,060
And I think it's absolutely rude when people go, are you there?

257
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,060
And then you respond yes.

258
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:10,750
And then you write a 15 minute diatribe and their attention is captured the entire time.

259
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,470
So here's a little tidbit I do on these things.

260
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:18,870
If I'm going to ping you with some long ass question, I'm going to type it up in notepad

261
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,190
first.

262
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,470
Then I'm going to say, hey, Alan, are you there?

263
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:25,990
And when you respond, I'm just going to copy and paste because I don't want to waste your

264
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,150
time.

265
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,280
Okay.

266
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,840
So I pinged, I wrote this long question, sent it.

267
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,560
Then I got a response.

268
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,150
Oh, this guy is exclusively on teams and cannot see your message.

269
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,430
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

270
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:55,870
Could you not have told me that before I spent five minutes typing this goddamn essay?

271
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,230
Can you just copy and paste it from notepad again to someplace else?

272
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,030
Turns out actually in the middle of me typing, it turns out this same guy was actually walking

273
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,110
to my office.

274
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,610
So literally like two minutes after I hit send, he was at my door.

275
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,960
And I'm like, not even two minutes, like the 10 seconds.

276
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,000
But I'm just like, this is dumb.

277
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,330
Why don't they?

278
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,930
What I love Alan is our Slack usage.

279
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,170
Slack is like teams.

280
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,570
It's another product that lets you collaborate and communicate across your team.

281
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,250
It's just so natural.

282
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,570
It's just such a natural part of our communication.

283
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:39,130
But I think Microsoft grew up embedded in email so much, it's hard for people to get

284
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:41,890
out of there and find another place to do it.

285
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,090
And what's weird about Skype is I have to do a Skype call later, which sucks

286
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:48,890
because I had to install Skype.

287
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,560
Sorry.

288
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,630
There is a web interface.

289
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,270
There was something, oh, I was telling a story about test, my presentation coming up.

290
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:03,110
There was a story, if you remember, back on our regular schedule program, I'm modern

291
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,910
testing talk.

292
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:12,110
If you remember at Brighton, I talked about modern testing, kind of how we got there,

293
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:17,110
how my journey through software made these things make sense.

294
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,270
I thought your deck was like Adventures of a Modern ...

295
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:26,310
And then we had just sort of finalized the principles.

296
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,510
I knew they'd be tweaked a little bit, and I think they maybe haven't been tweaked

297
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,510
since then.

298
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,750
They've actually lasted like seven months.

299
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,990
But I didn't go into them in depth at all.

300
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,630
I just showed them one by one, kind of walked through them and said, stay tuned,

301
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,270
listen to the podcast, learn more about them a lot.

302
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,950
I think what I want to do in Portland, what I'm planning to do in Portland, is actually

303
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,870
have a slide each on the principles and kind of talk about what they mean.

304
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,710
So it'll be the one minute version of the last eight episodes at that part.

305
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,670
So I'll take 10 minutes and talk through each of the principles and why I think they're

306
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,670
important.

307
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:09,050
And then it leads up to the potentially controversial number seven, which is interesting.

308
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,050
I'll bring it up there.

309
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,370
I love bringing it up in test crowds because it's like, but what's cool about number seven,

310
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:20,250
and I don't have it in front of me, but number seven is the one where the tail end says,

311
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:25,130
it may reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist.

312
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:31,600
And if a team is just starting on the modern testing journey, or they're not even there

313
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:39,120
yet, they're making software in a very predictable, traditional model, that principle is like,

314
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,880
these are, it's usually the reaction.

315
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,960
If I can quote the air quotes around that.

316
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,560
But once you start moving down the modern testing journey, you look at that and you go,

317
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,280
oh yeah, I could see how that makes sense.

318
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,120
That's been my experience in both my team and talking to people that have looked at

319
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
these things.

320
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,960
I think it's only controversial until it's not.

321
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,980
And the way it becomes not controversial is that you start to realize, you begin to

322
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,940
realize that, okay, I can see, yeah, I could see that.

323
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:21,800
So you and I talked offline in terms of one, we'll probably weave this into podcast

324
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,800
episodes.

325
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:33,440
But one of the things that I think is needed is sort of some tactical scenario discussions

326
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,200
around problems and how the scenarios weave together.

327
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,320
Because I think the other thing that we need to talk about on MT and come up with sort of

328
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:53,320
a cogent way of doing it is these principles do not operate alone.

329
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:04,200
And it's very similar when I go and talk about Agile and I go and talk about Lean, or even

330
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Kanban.

331
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,440
And now the sort of operational principles.

332
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,120
One of the common things about Agile, as you know, is it's principle oriented.

333
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:19,160
If it were rule oriented, then you start, it's just a matter of time before you have

334
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:25,850
an inability to adapt, which is the point of Agile.

335
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:32,080
And that's probably where, just thinking quickly, where a lot of the fragile approaches fail

336
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,280
is they become too prescriptive and rule-based.

337
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,000
They turn Agile into something it's not.

338
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,680
And another part of it is also simplification.

339
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:50,300
People at the very beginning, they will look at, what's an example, Lean I think has seven

340
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,690
principles.

341
00:19:52,690 --> 00:20:00,130
And until you practice, it's hard to keep all of the principles sort of in your head

342
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,370
and see how they sort of interact with each other.

343
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:10,050
The issue with the principles is that if you do one to the extreme and ignore the others,

344
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,330
it can absolutely take you into the weeds.

345
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:15,890
And it's another principle that balances that.

346
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,530
It's a check and balance system.

347
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,010
It wasn't intentional in the original, but as they evolved, and actually as we discussed

348
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,530
them, I'm sure I mentioned this a couple times during our previous discussions, but

349
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:32,850
I was pleasantly surprised on how well the principles did interact with each other and

350
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,250
support each other.

351
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,810
People need to practice the principles.

352
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:41,210
This is why I think the scenarios are critical, so that they see how you connect the dots between

353
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,210
them.

354
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,090
And I do think that as you connect the dots between them, I don't think, this is not

355
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,210
a belief.

356
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,250
I've lived this.

357
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,290
It becomes fairly easy for people to see how it works.

358
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,620
I think the issue is it's still kind of too new and they don't see how the dots

359
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,620
connect.

360
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,500
We're not being prescriptive.

361
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Of course not.

362
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
Yeah.

363
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,960
So I think, yeah, we have definitely plenty of future podcast fodder there.

364
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,250
Cool.

365
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,170
I have a couple things I wanted to...

366
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,770
One, sometimes Brent and I have conversations over Slack.

367
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:20,770
Not over Skype, that's nice.

368
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,370
Over Slack.

369
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,020
And it ends up being interesting enough.

370
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,780
Well, one, I'm too lazy to type it.

371
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,660
And then two, I think, we can just talk about that on the podcast, because that'd be a

372
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,500
fun one to share with the three.

373
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,880
And remembering back to our roots, the original...

374
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,240
The reason we have a podcast, it's not because we like each other, because that's not it.

375
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,240
No.

376
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,120
He used to have these test architect group meetings and Brent would crash.

377
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,920
He wasn't like a good tester or anything, but he'd want to hang out with the smart people.

378
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah, that's it.

379
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,120
But we would have these discussions and then I think it was Michael Hunter who said,

380
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,720
you guys got to record this into a podcast, because we just...

381
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,620
We're happy giving each other crap, respectfully.

382
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,100
I respectfully think you're full of crap, Brent.

383
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:13,620
I don't know about respectfully, but yeah, everything else in that sentence was accurate.

384
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,780
I'm mad at Twitter.

385
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,900
Okay, tell me about it.

386
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,660
I saw you change your name on Twitter.

387
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,820
My protest name is Twitter hates me.

388
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:26,010
Twitter doesn't like me?

389
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,010
What is it?

390
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,010
Would they go on?

391
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,010
It's something like that.

392
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:30,010
All right.

393
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,530
Really, are you really surprised?

394
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,530
No.

395
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,950
Can I finish my story?

396
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:36,950
It's an interesting story.

397
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,560
I don't know if it's a good story, but I'm going to tell it anyway.

398
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Twitter-ter.

399
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,280
Oh, because you can't have Twitter as part of your username.

400
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,150
So I put a hyphen in it.

401
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,800
Nice.

402
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,990
Doesn't like me.

403
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:52,990
Yes, yes.

404
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:58,350
I tried and also, Twitter also has a crummy password policy where your passwords can't

405
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,790
have spaces, but I'll save that for another rant.

406
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,350
Oh, nope, I didn't.

407
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:07,950
Anyway, as I've mentioned, maybe on here before, but there is a...

408
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:10,870
My current Twitter handle is Alan Page.

409
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,160
You're welcome to follow me or block me.

410
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:19,000
Many times I've gone to the Angry Weasel Twitter handle.

411
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,560
Twitter.com, like Angry Weasel, hoping that it would just show up as a 404 at some point,

412
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
but no it doesn't.

413
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:32,450
It's there from a person who tweeted once nine years ago.

414
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,450
That's it.

415
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,970
One tweet nine years ago.

416
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:41,870
So I read some stuff on the internet about how to...

417
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,870
What do you do?

418
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,390
How can you reclaim used accounts?

419
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,910
Some people have had some success just reporting it as an impersonation and explaining it

420
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,430
as not an impersonation.

421
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:58,890
I can prove this is associated with me and had success in getting unused Twitter handles

422
00:23:58,890 --> 00:23:59,890
from Twitter.

423
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,890
So I did that.

424
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,450
There's a crapload of Angry Weasel.

425
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,140
There's only one spelled correctly.

426
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,760
Loop back into the conversation here.

427
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:19,000
So yes, I can change the spelling of Angry Weasel and get another handle, but I wanted

428
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,360
the regular spelling one.

429
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,280
So anyway, Twitter told me to F off.

430
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,380
We don't do that.

431
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,860
And so that happened.

432
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,300
So then I thought, I wonder if modern testing is available.

433
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:39,780
And modern testing is also one tweet from 10 years ago and then, or maybe an account

434
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,780
but no tweets.

435
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,780
I think that one was one tweet from nine years ago as well.

436
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,260
And then I also checked for AB testing.

437
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,420
No, AB testing podcast.

438
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,730
One of those.

439
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,370
And it was created and it's never tweeted.

440
00:24:54,370 --> 00:25:07,150
So modern testing joined 2013 and you look at their, no, this dude is all about us.

441
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:12,450
No, I appreciate spelling.

442
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,610
They have the modern testing account.

443
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,060
There's no I in testing.

444
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,060
That sounds like a, oh, that sounds like a quote for a t-shirt.

445
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,220
There's no I in testing.

446
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,220
Oh wait, there is.

447
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Seven.

448
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,460
But not this one.

449
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,100
So anyway, that's my Twitter rant that, and Brandt doesn't care about reading, so he doesn't

450
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,780
notice that this letter is missing.

451
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:39,780
So my wish for our, none of the three who work at Twitter is that we could reclaim accounts

452
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,740
that haven't been used in a decade.

453
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,250
Yeah.

454
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,520
What did you means to similar, right?

455
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,720
You have to, you have to pay for your domain, right?

456
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,070
You have to pay to renew it.

457
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,350
Oh, right.

458
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,580
And since there's no, yeah, they cost money.

459
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:02,040
I wonder how long it'll take before Twitter has to do something on that front.

460
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:07,560
So it's not, they don't have to do anything, but at some point in time, you would imagine

461
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:18,330
that, that certain decoration for redundant handles, uh, becomes so fricking obtuse, it's

462
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,810
becomes harder to use.

463
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,810
Yup.

464
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,890
Okay.

465
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,330
Let's do, let's go, we'll go up that way.

466
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,290
So I have, uh, in my hand for those of you not on the video feed, Oh, you know what I

467
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:40,610
want to do by the way, in this all tangent episode, uh, we should just for fun do an

468
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:41,610
episode.

469
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:42,690
Why is your leg twitching like that, man?

470
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,690
You're freaking me out.

471
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:49,650
Listen, ADD guy, move forward.

472
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,170
I'm trying, but man, like the roof's shaking.

473
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,650
What was I gonna say?

474
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,650
We should periscope it.

475
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,730
We should periscope one of these.

476
00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:00,660
So like most of this stuff will get edited out that you don't even hear it, but we should

477
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,120
just live feed a podcast recording for the three.

478
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,740
Sure.

479
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,700
Not a tangent episode.

480
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,100
Oh, and, and, uh, I just wanted to point out, this is the first podcast recording I remember

481
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:19,250
in a while where branch has not been wearing his AB testing shirt.

482
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:21,050
I thought about putting it on today.

483
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:26,810
So you can go to cafepress.com, whack AB testing and pick up your own AB testing shirt.

484
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,770
But in the meantime, I have some questions for you that were thrown to me and I think

485
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,090
I have answers for them, but I'm going to check them.

486
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,090
These aren't mailbag.

487
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,090
I'm actually supposed to answer these at some point, but I'm just going to work through

488
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,330
you and see what you think of my answers.

489
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,590
Okay.

490
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,420
By me listening to your answers.

491
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,060
This is a good one.

492
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,820
I actually think that that model is one thing that makes our partnership work well.

493
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:59,950
You're very good at writing concise language and I am not.

494
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,990
I'm going to edit that as just says you are very good and I am not.

495
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,690
A couple of questions about AI, ML.

496
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,610
That's artificial intelligence and machine learning.

497
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,290
For those of you not into the, the name game.

498
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,250
Do you think AI and ML will replace the, replace the traditional tester?

499
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,960
As is a loaded question.

500
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,760
Cause I don't even know what the traditional tester is.

501
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
I do.

502
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,680
But does the question asker mean traditional?

503
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:35,420
I do think, I do think automation will replace the traditional tester and automation techniques

504
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,300
will include AI, ML.

505
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
Yep.

506
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
Yep.

507
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Pretty straightforward.

508
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,880
There's a couple of companies right now using, it's interesting.

509
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:51,820
There are companies like Testem and Mabel who use ML to improve automation and

510
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:58,500
actually make, I've always hated record playback, but they make some test generation tools that

511
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:04,460
look so deep at all the different ways that items can be selected that even if the, on

512
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,420
a webpage, that even if the item name or class or location changes, it can still figure

513
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,740
out what to do.

514
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,980
Which again, which is solving a problem that could be solved just by having an approach

515
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,050
that makes like adding data IDs to those things.

516
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,770
So just think of how the, how the market's moving.

517
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,690
I don't know how much you're paying attention to it, but I actually had a one-on-one with

518
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,970
one of my employees just this week.

519
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:38,490
And I actually think we're going to start to see the fall of the data scientist over

520
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:41,350
this next decade.

521
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:50,030
And primarily, so I was talking to an employee and this employee, there was a bit of AI I

522
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,760
wrote.

523
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
He picked it up.

524
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,000
Generalized it.

525
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,760
He doesn't under, he doesn't understand data science really, but he does understand how

526
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:08,760
to take an algorithm and turn it into code and pass it inputs and evaluate outputs.

527
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:17,190
And what I think is going to happen is number one, with computing the cloud, it kind of

528
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:27,280
raises, it kind of changes the definition of brute force in parallel.

529
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,480
So there are a lot of techniques that can be done brute force.

530
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,280
So when you have the cloud, you can do them really fast.

531
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:43,960
So old algorithms will come into play that just couldn't scale because you didn't have

532
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,480
enough hardware resources in your lab or didn't have beefy enough machines.

533
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,080
That kind of all just goes away.

534
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,520
It can scale as much as you're willing to pay for.

535
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:04,870
We're going to have AI techniques in APIs readily accessible to developers.

536
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,630
So you drifted off my original question a little bit talking about data science in

537
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,630
general.

538
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:20,960
No, but this, as these come up and as people solidify specific contexts, there is an old

539
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
tool.

540
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,760
So AI has been in the industry, in the test industry for a long time.

541
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:35,270
We've, there's a tool that I know Alan's familiar with that was, it's probably been

542
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,710
dead for 10 years now.

543
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,350
And Genesis, right.

544
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,750
And it used genetic AI to hunt through and find test cases.

545
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,670
And it was very effective at finding bugs.

546
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:53,430
What it sucked at is finding bugs that were important.

547
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,430
Yeah.

548
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,470
So what I've discovered so far, I spent a chunk of time.

549
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:01,270
In fact, I just wrote my, some of the three notes I've shared from a few of these on

550
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,990
the Slack channel, but I do a weekly newsletter for my team.

551
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,910
And I wrote up one this week on ML and AI.

552
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,070
And I just got a lot of screws on my mind because I was looking at these questions.

553
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:18,510
And what I'm realizing is while there's a, he, there's definitely a buzzword status push

554
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:25,420
for AI and ML in testing conferences are filled with talks about AI and ML tools, getting

555
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,260
massive funding.

556
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,700
They use AI and ML, but they're not doing things particularly interesting.

557
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,740
Like I mentioned the tools that I think it's really great.

558
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:42,140
If you don't have access or the ability, like when we talk about software development, it's

559
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,940
not an us and them, it's just a we.

560
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,940
That's the way I put it.

561
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:50,580
And these tools are designed for, I need to write a bunch of web, a UI automation for

562
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,740
a web page.

563
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,340
And I can't get the developers to change their code and add accessible IDs and they're not

564
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,340
writing automation.

565
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,020
We've got to get something put together here.

566
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,340
Those tools are excellent in that situation.

567
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,970
I just don't want to be in the situation where they excel.

568
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,050
Or I'm that last line of defense tester trying to write automation at the very end.

569
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:12,330
These tool, these, these AI solutions, if you're in that situation, if you have to write

570
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:19,480
a bunch of a web automation and you can't work with the dev team or, or you're unable

571
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,200
to or they're unwilling to work with you and you just have to get this done, these

572
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,800
tools will accelerate your ability to do that, but they're not solving the root problem.

573
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,440
That's what bugs me about them.

574
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,120
Not yet.

575
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,880
I think, but also in looking through what's out there in ML and AI, and there are some

576
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,400
tools that do some test generation based on examining the page, based on, based on learning

577
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,040
about the product.

578
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,040
But I still feel like everything that I've seen out there is scratching the surface of

579
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,920
what's possible for improving quality using AI and ML.

580
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,440
For example, oh, I just looked at this thing called sourced.

581
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,040
It's sourced with a D in curly brackets.

582
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:08,360
It's a static analysis tool, but like the things you've internally at Microsoft uses

583
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,360
an abstract syntax tree to break things down and figure out how things work together.

584
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:19,560
But it has models and does a bunch of ML analysis to try and figure out where bugs

585
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:24,760
may be in the code based on a bunch of heuristics, which is, which is again, a start.

586
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,600
If we could look at, if we could have ML and you might have this at your fancy data

587
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,040
science stuff that looks at customer usage patterns collected and then uses those to

588
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,560
figure out where risk areas and or what problems they need to be looked at by the

589
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,960
internal team using ML to help figure out pinpoint where things should be done.

590
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,360
Better test selection, which we've both done, are all great things.

591
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,680
I guess the point is, without me listing examples, there is a big push for AI and

592
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
ML and testing.

593
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:02,160
There's a lot of it out there, but I feel like it's just barely getting started of the capabilities

594
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,010
of what we could use those things for.

595
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:12,770
In that, I would say, and therein lies an opportunity.

596
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:22,620
The Alan, I'm sure you're tired of this question, but where do ideas come from?

597
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,540
Ideas come from other ideas, Brent.

598
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,120
So we've talked at the story like where air conditioning came from, right?

599
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Yeah.

600
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Did that turn on?

601
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,040
Did air conditioning get it?

602
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,400
Did it land on, ooh, what we need to build is air conditioning overnight?

603
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,960
No, of course not.

604
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,350
I will tell you that I know.

605
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,710
So for example, we have AI here at Microsoft.

606
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,470
So to the prior question, this customer usage data?

607
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,470
Yes.

608
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,470
Do I have it?

609
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:02,480
I have lots of it, tons of it.

610
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:10,600
What we still have work to do is connecting different data streams together and then coming

611
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:15,160
up along with an approach to context.

612
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:22,680
So we here in Azure, we have the ability to, when we see, so we can use AI to sort

613
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:29,890
of cluster common failures together.

614
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:37,820
We've had a similar thing in Windows for a long time where we get like call stack telemetry.

615
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:43,860
This is actually, no, we're clustering similar signals based off of multiple different failure

616
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,420
classes.

617
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:57,940
For example, hey, the network blipped, meaning it had a momentary loss of packets.

618
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:06,260
We now have the ability to sort of group a bunch of different signals together, then

619
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,940
do what's known as discrimination analysis and go, okay, which set of signals really

620
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,000
is important for this cluster?

621
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,720
And then go and pinpoint a root cause.

622
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,480
Now what we're doing right there is essentially, if you think about it, what we're doing

623
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:30,650
there is using AI to find system integration bugs.

624
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:42,080
Now because there's a lack of testers inside Microsoft, Dev's really interested in these

625
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,400
type of things because it helps them to scale.

626
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,280
No one inside Microsoft, to my knowledge, and I think it's also because there's a lack

627
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,680
of testers in here, is trying to really apply this towards a test context.

628
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Although I'm on the compute team, like the one thing I would be interested in doing

629
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,000
and I haven't done is go and talk to some of the UI folks and see, you know, what,

630
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,920
if anything, they're doing in this.

631
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,100
Because a lot of the times on the compute team, you can view it as sort of a system

632
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,940
integration bug almost all the time.

633
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,580
On the UI side, do you have another question?

634
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,740
Yeah, we've actually, interestingly, we've actually already answered the questions

635
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,810
that are coming up here.

636
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:34,530
So we've actually talked through the other questions in talking about this, but one,

637
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:38,410
just to get your thoughts, I had a little bit of rambling, but what are some other

638
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,770
ways you see AI and ML supporting testers?

639
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,130
And this is weird for me because when I see a tester, I think, I don't want to do that.

640
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:49,390
Supporting quality.

641
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,070
You want to frame it as pre-production quality?

642
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,390
I mean, there's a whole bunch of existing techniques.

643
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,090
It's essentially where do we move the needle?

644
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:13,300
Where I found AI is really effective is in scaling calendar time.

645
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:18,650
And so if I had known we were going to talk about this, I would have done a

646
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,410
particular research, but there's something that I'll share with others.

647
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:30,170
I did this a couple of months ago, and this is probably a deflection of your question.

648
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:36,170
I don't focus, as I think I just, I am not focused day to day on how to use AI,

649
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,890
ML to solve the test problem.

650
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:46,330
I'm focused on customer quality, which hopefully if you're a long enough time

651
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:52,370
listener to this podcast, you realize we view as a separate topic.

652
00:39:52,370 --> 00:40:03,060
But if you go to scholar.google.com and you do a search for test testers,

653
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:10,170
software testing, as well as AI and machine learning, you'll see that there are

654
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:15,650
a bunch of published articles already and that they're beginning to increase.

655
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:21,450
So what's happening right now is academia is definitely doing research in a bunch of

656
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:29,350
different places, and it's not going to be, it's still going to be a few years

657
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:35,910
before any of these things hit something that becomes really useful for the masses

658
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,150
or really productized.

659
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:44,100
But to me, this is absolutely on its way.

660
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:52,330
Test prioritization, that might be one place where it would be an obvious

661
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:59,680
relationship between testing and the user data.

662
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,080
So if you have test cases measured under code coverage, if you had,

663
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,080
if you did an experiment where some customers, you know,

664
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,680
interacted with an instrumented build, then you can start bridging the gap

665
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:21,610
between what are common sequences that customers go through and associate that to the test cases

666
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,440
that can validate that.

667
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,000
Going to a world of how we do continuous deployment, right?

668
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,100
Sure.

669
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,000
You could run all of your test cases in five minutes by leveraging a million dollars

670
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,400
worth of cloud compute resources, right?

671
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,760
Probably is not effective.

672
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:47,760
But you could also mitigate your risk by using historical data on both sides,

673
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:54,160
your test cases and your customer data to sort of prioritize what these cases are important.

674
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,760
And then, like a very simple AI technique would be to use AI to decide the stopping condition.

675
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,960
When is the risk minimized enough that you can just ship it now?

676
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Yeah.

677
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,690
Okay, cool.

678
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:08,590
All right.

679
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:10,990
A little more long-winded than I wanted, but I'll take it.

680
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,790
Oh, sorry.

681
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,790
Hey, we are...

682
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:17,890
One thing, this is definitely last but definitely not least,

683
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:21,990
one thing we haven't brought up here is, but worth bringing up now is,

684
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:27,790
we lost one of our heroes last month when Jerry Weinberg passed away.

685
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:32,290
I was looking through his list of books here and I realized,

686
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,470
I didn't realize that I had all of them.

687
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,170
I recommend Secrets of Consulting a lot.

688
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:45,370
It's a book about leadership, which is a good book about leadership.

689
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:47,970
I recommended a lot to people.

690
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,270
I forget who.

691
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:52,170
Someone on Twitter asked me the infamous,

692
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,830
how do you measure quality question?

693
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:59,080
And we started off with a little bit of,

694
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,780
well, what is quality and da-da-da-da-da.

695
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:09,280
And I recommended that he take a look at the quality software management series by Weinberg.

696
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,380
I think I might have recommended it started with book two, but maybe book one.

697
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:20,280
Anyway, because the book is 20 years old, maybe 25 years old,

698
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,780
I can't remember, he asked if it was still relevant.

699
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,980
I said, yeah, I think it is.

700
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,280
And I hadn't looked at it in a while.

701
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,480
I have it on my shelf at home.

702
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,380
And he got back with it a couple days.

703
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,980
He had already ordered it and got it.

704
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,580
He goes, oh my God, this is so good.

705
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,780
This is so relevant.

706
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,740
It's helping so much.

707
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,340
Yeah, it's really timeless work.

708
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:45,540
I reread Are Your Lights On probably every other year or so.

709
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,440
Just a good book to remind me how to frame problems

710
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,240
and to think about solving the real problem,

711
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,840
not the problem that appears on the surface,

712
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,740
but taking a step back and solving the real problem.

713
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,340
Well, I'll miss Jerry, but his written works live on, which is great.

714
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,240
He just gave a lot to the software community.

715
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,040
I wish I had never met him personally, have you?

716
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,280
No, I never did either.

717
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,720
But based on his writings, I don't know if I'm going out on the limb,

718
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:28,100
but I wonder if really Jerry was continuously the ultimate modern tester.

719
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,300
Could be, could be.

720
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,400
His approach on things, it was timeless

721
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,360
because he had done it with a set of principles that don't die.

722
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,210
And the guy could tell a story too.

723
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:53,860
Yeah, you know, RIP Jerry, you've had a lot of impact to us for certain.

724
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,620
And I'm sure he's well aware of.

725
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,560
He's changed probably millions of lives.

726
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,810
Yep.

727
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,010
Okay, man.

728
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,810
So I'll miss you Jerry.

729
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,910
Well, if we had our drinks here, we'd raise a drink to you,

730
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:10,710
but I'll do that tonight when I get home.

731
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:14,210
And in the meantime, we have finished another episode of A.B. testing.

732
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:18,540
So thanks for listening and we will talk to you next time.
