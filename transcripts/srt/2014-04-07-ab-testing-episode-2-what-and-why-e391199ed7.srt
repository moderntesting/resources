1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,640
Hey, I'm Alan.

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,780
And I'm Brent.

3
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:27,730
I held an event, hosted an event at Microsoft two days ago for about 35 senior quality and test people about leading change.

4
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,790
And Brent, you were at that event.

5
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,210
So what was your big takeaway from that?

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,130
Well, so first off, I thought that event was fantastic, Alan.

7
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,450
Thank you for putting it together.

8
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,690
Golf clap.

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:46,440
The second thing I would say that I walked away with, I was surprised at the audience.

10
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,770
Not the audience per se.

11
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,790
The audience was great.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,990
But I was surprised at how small the audience was.

13
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,750
That actually concerns me.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,390
You know, elaborate because I have all kinds of comments.

15
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,050
I don't know where to start.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:04,970
No.

17
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,550
So the way I see it is we've seen these similar events.

18
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,210
That Alan puts together on a monthly basis.

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,390
And we've seen times where the room is packed.

20
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:21,710
And then we see times where the room is packed with crickets.

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:32,760
This time around, I think it's one of the most important topics that to me doesn't seem as resonating with the populace at large.

22
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,780
I have another theory.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,720
You know, a lot of times when we pack the room, we get a great speaker to come in and people just come listen.

24
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:38,960
They don't have to.

25
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,120
They don't have to participate and get involved and, you know, put some skin in the game.

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,820
When we do an event like this, it's largely discussion based.

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,760
We get the people there who want to get something out of it.

28
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,820
We get the people that embrace learning, have a thirst for learning and want to get some new ideas.

29
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,600
And they understand, you know, one of the things that I believe in a lot, that ideas come from ideas, other ideas getting together.

30
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,920
And the people in that room understand that.

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,220
But not everybody in any community gets that.

32
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,940
If you look at, you know, Wikipedia, for example, is a great story.

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:17,140
You know, 1% and I'm not looking any of this crap up, but like 1% of the users actually contribute and everybody else kind of just consumes.

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:30,460
I think with a lot of educational or community opportunities in both in Microsoft and outside of Microsoft, there are people that want to actively participate and put some skin in the game.

35
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,460
Then there's a larger majority that just want to consume whatever is put out.

36
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,630
Yeah, no, I see that as well.

37
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,990
The topic.

38
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,410
For last for last week was leading change.

39
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,750
And how could the people in the room help to contribute that?

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,030
What problems they saw?

41
00:02:49,310 --> 00:03:01,370
One of the problems that I see is that there's far too few people in that room, given everyone is in a panic, maybe near panic around.

42
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,350
What does this mean?

43
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,610
What does this mean for me?

44
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,070
What does this mean for the team?

45
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,070
What does it mean for the company?

46
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,390
I think.

47
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:17,490
I think one of the things that will be helpful is for us to figure out, well, what's what's blocking?

48
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,290
What is the resistance to getting people to lead themselves?

49
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,110
A couple of comments there.

50
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,670
One is, you know, there's this huge catch 22, this this chicken and egg problem.

51
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:39,490
People, they need to get they need to get some more ideas and learn, but they're so busy dealing with the stuff they don't have a chance to learn about and deal with.

52
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,790
They can't actually ever get a chance to learn how to deal with it.

53
00:03:42,440 --> 00:04:08,960
I had a discussion just this last week, just two days ago with an individual in one of the teams who is all excited about going to the data science world and is actually considering leaving their team because they are in one of the we'll call it the execution entrenched.

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:29,380
They're considering leaving their team just to have the ability to explore this option, you know, as interesting because data is becoming so important and, you know, data science is obviously a direction that some testers will move in, but it reminds me, do you know what a data scientist is?

55
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,770
No, it's a statistician that lives in Silicon Valley.

56
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,650
I think there's a couple over in Amazon.

57
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,570
Yeah, but the idea is, yes.

58
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:56,990
I think as I think we talked about last time, a lot of testers of Microsoft and a lot of the test approach and quality approach of Microsoft is shifting from just executing a bunch of tests and looking at a test pass rate and going, oh, and to more of looking at real data from customers and making decisions based on that.

59
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:09,010
And both business intelligence, you know, how many users downloaded this thing and doing some building statistical models and making predictions based on what we know on a variety of data sources, which is kind of fun.

60
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,570
It's it's.

61
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:19,590
It's a total blast for for those of us who who are in the I'll say the ivory tower currently and get to play around in this playground.

62
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:23,750
Well, you know, it's funny, you know, Brent and I are both people who love to learn new things.

63
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,350
And I'm taking a statistical analysis and data inference course on Coursera.

64
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:35,630
And I was sitting at my desk the other night and I looked down at this notepad on my in front of me and there are some math equations written.

65
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,050
And, you know, I don't they looked like real math equations.

66
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,570
I can't.

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,130
I can't even remember what I was trying to figure out.

68
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,950
But I was it was it was just I thought, oh, my gosh, I'm what am I doing?

69
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,210
I'm learning math again.

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,360
So I just recently started up.

71
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,940
I'm pursuing my master's in analytics.

72
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:04,360
And one of the first things that I did when I got my first course is I scan through the book just to make sure I did not have to remember how to integrate.

73
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,800
All right.

74
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,240
Where are we going?

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,520
Let's get.

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,880
As you know, Brent and I also are known as.

77
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,620
ADD club.

78
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,080
And we're talking about leading change.

79
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,520
And I think there's it's you're right.

80
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,300
You need leaders lead.

81
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,580
Right.

82
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,660
They're not just it's not just a figurehead in charge.

83
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
You need to have ideas for getting people through change.

84
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,640
So the thing I'm thinking through.

85
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:41,740
So answering my own question around why others aren't showing up is I think, number one, they don't know what the value is and they don't know why.

86
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,700
Why it's valuable.

87
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:57,070
We I've seen a lot of messages lately around leaders standing up and saying, hey, this is what we're going to do and it's going to be awesome.

88
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,860
And there'll be unicorns and rainbows and free candy for everyone once we do this.

89
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:10,900
But the problem is, I think there's a lot of resistance culturally around going there.

90
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:18,040
And there's a lot of machinations in place, a lot of processes in place around how to get a good review.

91
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,800
People don't know why we're doing these changes.

92
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,280
They don't know how it's going to affect the review process.

93
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:37,420
There's cultural changes all the way up to, well, all three roles, dev, test and PM, all three roles in engineering, maybe I guess user user to user design.

94
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,600
The.

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,820
I think the key thing is that the leaders are explaining what they want.

96
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:53,260
They're not really explaining how we know we got there, that what what defines success.

97
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:02,200
And they're certainly not explaining why what we did before no longer works.

98
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,360
Right. And the why is super important.

99
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,880
We talked about the quality day we did a few weeks back in our last podcast.

100
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,420
But.

101
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:29,860
The key behind any sort of when you're making any sort of change, whether it's a small change or a big change, but especially with the big change, the better you can convince people of the why or show them why or show them why it's important and why change is needed and why this particular change is will be successful or is a good chance for successful.

102
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,080
But getting that why in place is critical.

103
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,950
If you, you know, there's a Lewis Carroll quote you use once in a while.

104
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,450
What is it?

105
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,770
The Lewis Carroll quote is.

106
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,540
If you don't know where you're going, then any road will get you there.

107
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,460
Perfect.

108
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,000
And that's I think a lot of changes is, you know, done that way.

109
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,140
And it's awful.

110
00:08:51,140 --> 00:09:00,970
So, you know, when I have a vision in mind, no, it's going to know it may change over time, but you need to understand why change is important.

111
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:09,310
And I think that's sort of the piece that's missing in a lot of the failed change management I've been a part of or seen over the years.

112
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,270
There's there's.

113
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,510
I'll I'll I'll I'll add to that, Alan.

114
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,790
I don't know who's the the quote for this.

115
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,530
Maybe it's Sun Tzu.

116
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:31,170
I'm not actually certain, but there is a there's a quote that says strategy without tactics is a dream and tactics without strategy is a nightmare.

117
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,470
Yeah, that is that is from the the art of war.

118
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,750
Right.

119
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,630
I believe so.

120
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,710
The the the point there or the way I interpret that is that you not only.

121
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:48,310
Need to know what to do, you need to know why and actually more poignant to what we're talking about.

122
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:56,260
If you only know what and not why, as the quote says, that's a nightmare as opposed to knowing why, but not the what.

123
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:08,220
An example I like to share a lot is about a doctor back in the 1850s, Ignaz Semmelweis, who was a maternal doctor.

124
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,220
And he discovered through.

125
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,990
Intuition based correlation that exploratory medicine.

126
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,240
Sure.

127
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:29,220
It wasn't it wasn't a scientific principle, but what he discovered is that every hospital he went to and he was often hired to be the chief doctor.

128
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,360
I don't know what their title is.

129
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,560
Master doctor.

130
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,460
Super Jedi doctor.

131
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:34,920
Jedi.

132
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,560
I love that.

133
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,360
Jedi doctor master.

134
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,700
He discovered that every time he instituted a policy.

135
00:10:41,840 --> 00:11:00,340
That forced his his surgeons to wash their hands once they did that at a sustainable pace, the mortality rate of of women who are pregnant went down to below one percent and he saw this over and over and over again and he tried to share it with the community.

136
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,960
The community asked him, well, why he didn't know why.

137
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,680
In addition to that, the community was indignant at that time.

138
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,740
What you're telling me to watch?

139
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,160
My hands like how rude is that?

140
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,740
It was sort of the perception at that time.

141
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:37,000
This this poor guy ended up dying in an insane asylum that knowing this knowledge and knowing that he was failing to get it dispersed around the community and knowing that that was killing pregnant women drove him crazy.

142
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:42,260
He ended up dying at in the mid 40s in in a insane asylum.

143
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,020
He knew what to do, but he didn't know why.

144
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,930
So carrying on what you're talking about, what would be an example that you see a lot around?

145
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,710
You said a failed child change management.

146
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:10,350
Probably the biggest one is, you know, teams and I've seen this both inside and outside of Microsoft teams struggle to transition to you can't see my air quotes that they struggle to transition to air quote agile lowercase a or uppercase a.

147
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,390
They go, oh, we're doing agile.

148
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:12,830
And.

149
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:26,130
And the people on the team that literally go from one step one day having a very predictable model where they're, you know, testing at the end and testing quality in and and then shipping that product the next day.

150
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:42,770
Now we're we're doing this agile thing and I guess we do this and that and they they have scrum and they have these things called sprints and they don't really know how long they are and and they feel like they have to estimate more and they're going great, but they don't know why they don't know what benefit they get from these changes.

151
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,870
Now, their reasoning in some cases literally is someone in our management chain heard of this thing and they want to try it.

152
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,310
I don't know what it does or how we're doing it, but we're going to figure it out.

153
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,410
And guess what?

154
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,630
They fail.

155
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:01,370
Ends up being a they end up creating worse software and they go, oh, and their conclusion is agile doesn't work.

156
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,530
Let's go back to what we know.

157
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,640
So what sort of failures have you seen?

158
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,230
You've heard me reference fragile before.

159
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,150
I'll leave it at that.

160
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:13,230
And scrum, but we do scrum, but we have.

161
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:14,250
Three month iterations.

162
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,490
I heard a team once said we're agile.

163
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,210
So you are.

164
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,810
I thought, really, you're agile.

165
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:23,170
Yeah, we have three month iterations and we do planning for a month and then coding for a month, then testing for a month.

166
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,310
But, uh, OK.

167
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:38,360
I actually a couple of years ago, a buddy came up and talked to me and he's he's been deeply entrenched in the Windows team for a long time.

168
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,360
And this was this was still back in the the Grant Georgians.

169
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:56,840
And he said, I don't understand why you are such a proponent for agile, what's the big deal about agile?

170
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,480
And then he said something that simultaneously shocked and amused me.

171
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,960
He said, Windows agile.

172
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,020
I said, what?

173
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,400
And he said, yes, we're just slow agile.

174
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,300
I remember.

175
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,820
Slagel.

176
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,520
What is that?

177
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,320
Slagel.

178
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,600
Slowjel.

179
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,080
Oh, I like slowjel.

180
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,140
Slowjel.

181
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,120
I like fragile better.

182
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,780
Trademarked, patented, whatever we claimed.

183
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:24,700
Yeah.

184
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,160
Done.

185
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,640
Interesting.

186
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,320
First off, I felt it was my my my role to indicate that he was wrong.

187
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,200
No, but I am very deeply interested in what led you to that conclusion.

188
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,440
And he said very quickly.

189
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,790
Oh, well, we're.

190
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,940
I don't want to be iterative.

191
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, that's and you know, that's not the first time I've heard that not, you know, people think and this is I don't want to, like, tell people they're dumb, but agile is much more than iteration.

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,060
I mean, and also the thing I've gone off on before is, you know, waterfall and agile are not a dichotomy.

193
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,420
And in fact, you know, a lot of people throw out agile and waterfall as like, oh, we're not agile.

194
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,180
You're waterfall.

195
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,820
And, you know, every team I've been on at Microsoft as waterfall.

196
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,740
Lee is.

197
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,500
They've been in the past.

198
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,340
They're really iterative.

199
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,840
You know, my very first project 20 years ago, Windows 95.

200
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:26,740
We had, I think we shipped on our 12th milestone and the milestones were anywhere from three to four months.

201
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,520
It was a long project, but it was it was iterative.

202
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,080
It was slow.

203
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:39,280
And, you know, we tested quality and like nobody's ever tested quality and before it was still a lot done at the end.

204
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,580
It wasn't it was, you know, waterfall is truly predictive and we weren't very predictive.

205
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,840
We didn't know when we're going to be done.

206
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:51,780
We had an idea when we wanted to ship and we, you know, of course, we didn't hit that date.

207
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,400
And I'm sure I don't remember how late we were, but it wasn't too late.

208
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,620
But we weren't done testing quality in until we shipped.

209
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:01,520
I want to I want to call you on a word you just use.

210
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,860
You said waterfall is predictive.

211
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,240
What do you think about that?

212
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,900
Well, what do you think about that?

213
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:15,580
I think if you do waterfall as and a lot of poor, poor Winston Royce is, he said in his paper.

214
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,640
He said, here's a way you can make software that's not very good.

215
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,140
And you should iterate on it a couple of times for it to work.

216
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,040
And somebody looked at that picture, went, that's how to make software.

217
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:38,580
Yeah, I so so, yeah, there was I don't remember the name, as Alan just mentioned, but I read that document and I find that so funny.

218
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:45,580
Someone the document that introduced waterfall to the world talks about these gated spaces.

219
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:59,240
It's a serial of processes in terms of how you take the software and phase quality in and the very last paragraph of that document, the guy essentially says, and this sucks.

220
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah, we should not do this.

221
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,080
Now, you talk about that doctor earlier.

222
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:16,340
If there is a reason for someone to go to die in an insane asylum, it's that guy, but to answer your question in the long way, say the asylum or in a cornfield in Kansas.

223
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,440
I.

224
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,540
I don't know, I don't know, the poor guy, but waterfall is very predictive.

225
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,480
In fact, you don't need to hire testers till the very end because you don't need them.

226
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:44,690
I want to be careful when you say, because there's also a number of folks in the data science world where predictive is about playing out what if scenarios, whereas really, I would say, perhaps a better word for what you're trying to get to is intuitive, where waterfall.

227
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,370
It does start.

228
00:17:46,370 --> 00:18:00,100
Start off with a series of predictions, and then they spend the next three years, in some cases, keeping their predictions on track, but never reevaluating them.

229
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:01,280
Right.

230
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,220
And that is and let's go ahead and move that forward.

231
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:12,560
If you merely iterate, if you, you know, and here's a better example of what I've seen is teams will have sprints.

232
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,480
They'll have four week sprints that are regular, but they plan.

233
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,560
Six sprints in advance or every sprint in advance.

234
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,040
Like, what are you doing that feature work?

235
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,760
I'm doing that feature work in sprint eight.

236
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,100
Like, that is sort of mixing, you know, sprinter fall, whatever.

237
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,900
I don't know what you want to call that, but they're iterating.

238
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,280
But it's not, you know, to me, I don't want to be like an agile, like, you know, this is not agile.

239
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,120
That's agile.

240
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,940
But so I'm going to stop using that word.

241
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,560
I will do that shortly.

242
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,900
What I want, what I think is a great way to make software is adaptive, where you can.

243
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,880
You're changing, you're adapting to the customer, you're adapting what the needs are.

244
00:18:49,880 --> 00:19:03,500
I think my favorite thing to my where planning went from, like, the most painful thing I ever did in software to where it's the part I look forward to the most is reprioritizing that backlog every at the beginning of every sprint.

245
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,420
I enjoy that.

246
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,080
It's fun.

247
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,880
I feel like I'm always working on the most important thing.

248
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:09,350
Yes.

249
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,850
Brent, just for those of you not watching the video feed, it doesn't exist.

250
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,810
Brent just smiled and pointed his.

251
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,030
Finger at me in a vigorous manner.

252
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:19,530
Yes.

253
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:24,450
Indicating that finally, Alan has said something super smart.

254
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,850
For those of us keeping track, this is three this year.

255
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,110
Is that calendar year or fiscal year?

256
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,590
Fiscal.

257
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,010
Okay.

258
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:34,760
The.

259
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:45,480
So one of the popular things that have been asked of me lately, and I've done this 10 times in the last three months, is I've gone into teams.

260
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,280
And.

261
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:54,900
Taught them how my team executes, which is it's a hybrid model of multiple different agile tools.

262
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,800
It's it's fairly successful.

263
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,940
But one of the first things that I start off with every time is I compare waterfall and agile.

264
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,650
And I say, here's a simple litmus test.

265
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,190
And waterfall is probably not the right right word, but it resonates with people.

266
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,450
So, Alan, I don't care.

267
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:14,450
I talk about waterfall.

268
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,490
Really, it's key goal.

269
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:29,170
If you look at the actions and the behaviors of what everyone is doing and aggregated up to a single question, the question that waterfall is constantly trying to ask is, is the plan on track?

270
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:37,520
They don't evaluate whether or not that first initiative predictive plan is really the right plan.

271
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,020
Eric Reeves talks about a build, measure, learn loop.

272
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,620
And often I'll draw on on the whiteboard.

273
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:46,580
Build.

274
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:59,830
Measure, learn, circle them and say, this is what waterfall does and draw an arrow from from build to measure and then an arrow from measure back to build and leave learn off on its own orphaned.

275
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:16,830
And one of the things that there are several instances, I'm not going to go into specifics today, but there are several instances where we know that these heavily entrenched waterfall organizations.

276
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,010
I'm not going to go into specifics today, but there are several instances where we know that things that are going on and that we are doing this on and on are two very different things.

277
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:17,890
And I'm not going to go into specifics today, but I think two key things.

278
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:29,970
examples at Microsoft would would beどう tanto usa isso , en el caso de que la Valerio del آn, por si alguno quien lo piensa, would be windows and and then office.

279
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,850
Office.

280
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,250
Although I definitely see office forget the changing, I Windows slowly changing estechn folkなんだ,woman slowly changing.

281
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:42,700
raining beds doubles there's examples where they knew six months in advance that this ah, key chains that they were about to release upon the world was hated by the world, but they didn't have the ability to learn and adapt and create a new direction and integrate into the system so you can be primarily implemented while starting to implement processes it sn Originalvisual beans leave office isъ

282
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:53,300
But they didn't have the ability to learn and adapt and create a new direction and integrate that into the process because their primary focus was on, is the plan on track?

283
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,940
And we have to keep the plan on track.

284
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,180
Agile is more about, is the plan correct?

285
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,490
I love the word that Alan just used, adaptive.

286
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:20,730
And one of the things that I've made it my personal mission, every time I hear someone say Agile is about iterations, I immediately stop and I won't let that conversation continue until they recognize that it's not about iteration.

287
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:25,630
The key thing is creating a common shared language.

288
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:34,420
If people aren't going to spend the time deeply understanding the what and the why, then creating a language that is unambiguous.

289
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,520
Unambiguous and constructs the right behavior is very helpful.

290
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,480
So iteration should be gone, adaptation should be in.

291
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:51,780
Well, and that ties back to, if you really get down to saying, here's why or what we're doing and why we're doing it.

292
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:56,520
If you get people to understand why, I'll ask a question, I know the answer to because I want you to answer it.

293
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,200
Why would a team want to use adaptive software engineering processes?

294
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,740
The business reason.

295
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,800
Or why teams would want to do this.

296
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:16,730
Is, quite honestly, the world operates much faster than the way we've been operating.

297
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,550
It's because, if nothing else, survival.

298
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:28,670
We need to have the ability to add value to customers at increased speed.

299
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:33,630
The primary reason why we need to do this is that the switching cost today.

300
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,170
The ability for a customer.

301
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:41,190
To go from one company's product to another company's product is almost instantaneous.

302
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:58,000
So if we aren't creating a continuous stream of value, then it's hard for folks to choose to stay on our platform, assets, product, whatever you want to refer to.

303
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,780
So the ultimate reason is speed equals money today.

304
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,090
It does.

305
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:05,070
And there's a couple.

306
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,530
Other things I've read about that recently.

307
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,850
I have no sources for these, so look them up yourself.

308
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:24,370
But, you know, 20 years ago, especially even longer ago, but even 20 years ago, the power of marketing to influence someone to buy a product was the most, of all the different influences, was the largest thing.

309
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,690
Actual marketing, commercials, sales, magazine ads, etc.

310
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,230
But today, it's influencers from the community.

311
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,590
It's customers influencing other customers.

312
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,170
People ask.

313
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:35,710
They're friends.

314
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,950
People go to social media sites to find out what apps they use.

315
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:45,950
And I can think probably a half a dozen times I've gone to Twitter and asked, hey, Tweeps, what's the best tool these days for blah?

316
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,670
And they tell me.

317
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,070
And I get, you know, that's the marketing.

318
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,290
So you need to react to customers quicker.

319
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,610
And if you go to that why thing, it's, you know, you can almost play five whys, a little root cause analysis.

320
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,910
You know, and no one buys our product.

321
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:00,450
Why?

322
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,270
Because they don't like it.

323
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,070
Why don't they like it?

324
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,470
Because we're making stuff they don't like.

325
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,130
Why don't they like it?

326
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:05,210
Why don't they like it?

327
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,430
Because they never get a chance to see it until three years after we planned it and put it in front of them.

328
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,530
And it's no longer relevant.

329
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:17,340
So in order to iterate, and I'm going to use iteration as a path here.

330
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,160
In order to iterate, actually, in order to respond to customers, you need to iterate quicker and adapt.

331
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,500
You can't just iterate.

332
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,860
Iterating, just looping in circles like a dog chasing its tail.

333
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,700
It's fun to watch, but not that exciting.

334
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,040
Maybe a very poor metaphor.

335
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,180
But the challenge is you.

336
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:41,140
You really need to listen and know when to listen and use the data, going back to data, wisely.

337
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:50,480
You know, there's people often, and there's, I don't just pick on Microsoft, but a lot of times companies think, well, we know what's best for the customer.

338
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,320
In fact, I was so annoyed by a product a couple years ago.

339
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,460
You know, there was a feature in a product that I didn't like.

340
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,700
And so I went to the product's forum and I posted.

341
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,540
And some other people said, yeah, we don't like that either.

342
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:11,400
And the response from the product team was, oh, we thought it would be cool or we thought it would be good if we did it this way.

343
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,080
I said, you don't get to make that choice.

344
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,880
You don't, as the product developer, you don't get to decide what customers like.

345
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,880
Customers get to decide what they like.

346
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,100
And you need to listen to them.

347
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:29,000
And often they'll fall back on, say, well, the forward quote, if we just listen to customers, they just want a faster horse.

348
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,140
You know, yes, you can innovate.

349
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,520
But, yes, you can listen to and you need to listen and react to those customers.

350
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,980
And you can't do that if you're purely predictive or purely iterative.

351
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,160
You need to be able to listen and adapt and change as needed.

352
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:54,720
The difference between your innovation story and I think the specific story that you're referring to is in terms of adding new value and exploring new markets, go ahead.

353
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,880
Experiment away.

354
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:04,840
However, when you deploy something, you should absolutely look at the engagement.

355
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:14,200
You should look at the engagement value of what you just deployed and determine whether or not it's enticing customers or upsetting them.

356
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:23,080
The product group coming to you and saying, we think customers should be delighted by this.

357
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,590
They're saying that to a customer.

358
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,240
No.

359
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,860
Henry Ford also said, we will do any color as long as it's black.

360
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,440
Right.

361
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,860
How long did that last?

362
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,490
I don't have my history book.

363
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:40,970
I don't know.

364
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:41,390
No.

365
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,250
We don't have all black cars today.

366
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,210
Right.

367
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:51,470
The differentiation, customization, and again, switching cost.

368
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:52,470
Right.

369
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,750
I know what Alan's referring to.

370
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:00,110
And I know there are hordes of competitors out there for that same paradigm.

371
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,550
The switching cost is so fast.

372
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:02,970
Fine.

373
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,190
You're not going to help me build quality from my own subject.

374
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,210
Point of view.

375
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,790
Then I'm going to go to the company who will.

376
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,450
I don't care about your intuition.

377
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:23,190
If you've got data that shows, Alan, our data is showing that the majority of people love this thing.

378
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,140
Right.

379
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:24,620
Fine.

380
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,600
That's a different story.

381
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:35,440
But if it's we and our elite group of think tank PMs have decided that this is what's best.

382
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:35,560
Right.

383
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,240
So one of my classes that I.

384
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:43,580
I am taking now is is on how to build information systems of the future.

385
00:28:43,580 --> 00:29:06,700
And one of the key pivots that I find fascinating is most companies and governments now are recognizing that pushing empowerment down and enabling a symbiotic relationship between people and the technology and society.

386
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:18,510
Whether it be a large, a small community or a larger community, by creating an efficient knowledge loop amongst all of those assets speeds things up.

387
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,610
It helps collaboration.

388
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,790
It helps profitability.

389
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,770
It helps market discovery.

390
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,210
It helps solidify your position in your current market.

391
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,860
There's two things that I'd share.

392
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,870
One of the there's a there's a key study in there where they talk about.

393
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:54,900
They talk about X-Box and they talk about a integration between X-Box and Comcast, and they talk about how this might have been a strategy against net neutrality.

394
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:05,220
And as I was reading them, like, holy crap, I was the QA guy for the X-Box during that time period.

395
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,600
I own the application for the Comcast interaction.

396
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,260
So it was kind of.

397
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,520
Freaky to see this whole textbook that has a case study around things.

398
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,000
My name's not mentioned in it, but around that scenario.

399
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,740
The other thing, though, is that I'm learning best practices from other companies.

400
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:36,240
Salesforce, as an example, has just I don't know when they did it, but there's a case study in there around Salesforce, how they are leveraging their customers to populate their backlog.

401
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,420
They have they have a public tool.

402
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:48,240
Where our customers could log in, say, we would like this and other customers can come in and vote up and down.

403
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,180
Yeah, we've had products.

404
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,380
Microsoft have done that through the connect site, which is, I think, a great way to do that.

405
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,180
I love that.

406
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,040
I love that.

407
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,520
Right after X-Box one came out, there was a community site emerged within a week with the same thing, feature requests and votes.

408
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,800
We didn't even sponsor that one.

409
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:08,700
I love finding ways to let, you know, go back to XP extreme programming.

410
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:14,640
And, you know, let's get that customer in the room with us, which works if your customer is the guy in payroll from upstairs.

411
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:24,840
But when your customer, when you have a million customers finding a way to aggregate their voice in a way that you can use to make product decisions and to help you adapt is fantastic.

412
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,840
This is one of the reasons why crowdsourcing is so key.

413
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:38,780
Like if you're just talking to the one guy upstairs, then you're really relying on his specific knowledge and more than likely his intuition.

414
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:52,230
On the way to go by leveraging the knowledge of the crowd, that's where you can get people to tell you for free, hey, here's a new market you should perhaps explore.

415
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,030
Yeah.

416
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,590
And it isn't until you look at numbers.

417
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,850
How do you know the one guy you talk to isn't the outlier?

418
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:02,130
Or when you talk to three people, how do you know that, you know, you get, you know, two of them say one thing.

419
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:02,890
One says another.

420
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:08,070
It's not a big enough sample to know if, well, are these two outliers?

421
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,410
Is that?

422
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:09,910
So you have to make a decision based on that.

423
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:17,510
You need to use some numbers, you know, based on the size of your product and market reach, et cetera, to help you make, to use that, those voices effectively.

424
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,150
Yeah, absolutely.

425
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:26,870
There's another example that I think is related to this that also came out of the book.

426
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,290
And part of my study is I had to look at key studies of companies.

427
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:38,870
And I just completed this yesterday and said, how, how does Britain, Britain's going to go all digital.

428
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:45,390
They have a huge report in 2009, and they're going to go all digital throughout everything.

429
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:50,290
And they're hugely excited about it because the, there's a lot of costs that they're going to reduce.

430
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,670
And there's a whole bunch of new public good services they're going to be able to provide.

431
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,490
And in addition to that, they're going to do an outreach out to rural.

432
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:07,650
One of the things that they have discovered is the first phase that the governments are doing is they're converting analog processes.

433
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:08,970
All those red tapes.

434
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:11,870
Paperwork stuff into digital format.

435
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:17,630
And then what they've realized is like, Hey, wait a minute, because we have all of this stuff digitally.

436
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,520
Now we could get rid of some of these analog processes.

437
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,520
We can get rid of departmental siloism.

438
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:36,540
For example, farmers in the UK, they used to have to file the same paperwork with each department that is relevant for their means.

439
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,220
So now they go to never talk to each other.

440
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,840
Because they don't share anything.

441
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,140
Right.

442
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:48,280
So now what the farmers do is they go one place and all that paperwork is distributed amongst anyone who's interested.

443
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:57,220
The another common principle and GE's gone to this is around, uh, they call it open procurement for the supply chain.

444
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,760
GE will have a site anyone can get on.

445
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,440
They say we need 8 million widgets.

446
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,470
And instead of having a dedicated supplier for producing.

447
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:14,420
That widget, all the possible suppliers come in.

448
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:20,660
They look at the requirements and say, okay, we need it within this tolerance and, and it needs to do this type of thing.

449
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:28,040
And they bid by making it an open market around bidders for their supply chain.

450
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,620
They've reduced their costs.

451
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,300
Ginormously.

452
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,480
Hey, so, um, how did we get here?

453
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,320
I don't know.

454
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,940
We were trying to explain why.

455
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:40,860
Well, I.

456
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,840
I think why is something we'll continue to explore, but let's go ahead and wrap it up for today.

457
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,840
And, uh, we'll come back in another two weeks and, uh, let you know what's new in the world of Brent and Allen.

458
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:51,500
All right.

459
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,400
Any final words, Brent?

460
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,340
No.

461
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,740
So, well, yes, then.

462
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:09,440
Hey guys, what I, if there's anything that you walk away with, please understand the outcome of what you're trying to do.

463
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,320
Don't just focus on the minute.

464
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,010
It means focus on the ends and tie those together.

465
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:22,990
That is how you're going to make sure as you execute on whatever you execute.

466
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:29,380
Hopefully you do it agilely that you're focusing on what is correct.

467
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:29,960
Yeah.

468
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,840
And even as a precursor to that, I would say that don't be passive in watching change go by.

469
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:42,100
Be a part of leading change in your own organization, because that's, that's where the fun is.

470
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:52,760
I think a lot of us can handle technical challenges, whatever, but handling people challenges and adaptive challenges and, and change management across an organization is something that I need.

471
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,140
I wish more people in testing and software would embrace and, and, and take on.

472
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:58,560
Amen.

473
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,380
All right.

474
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,100
We're out of here.

475
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,560
See ya.

476
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:01,020
Bye.
