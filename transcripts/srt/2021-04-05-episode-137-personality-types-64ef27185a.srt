00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,420
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,980
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:19,980
Happy April.

6
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:22,440
Whatever day you're, you're listening to this.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,020
It's April and I'm Alan and Brent's over there and this is the AB testing podcast.

8
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,780
Howdy, howdy, howdy.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:30,780
We are back again.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,580
We've just been doing this and doing this for over five years now.

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,300
We started actually, we started in April six years ago.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,370
We're coming up on our sixth anniversary together.

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,890
Did you get me a gift?

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,890
I did not.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,580
I didn't get you one either.

16
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,580
Yeah.

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,580
When, oh, April.

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,460
I think episode one, I believe was like mid April sometime in April.

19
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,540
I'm looking.

20
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,860
Of course you are.

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,540
It wouldn't be an AB testing podcast.

22
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,500
If there wasn't a little bit of typing from Brent in the background.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,540
Yeah, baby.

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,660
Clickety click, click, click.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,660
Interesting.

26
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,420
I just went to Spotify.

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,020
Something made me want to look at later or maybe you can look at now.

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,380
It's always showing up to episode 99 for AB testing.

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,140
Oh, that's interesting.

30
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,140
Sort oldest to newest.

31
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,140
Well yeah.

32
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,380
It says sometime in April 2014.

33
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,300
So it's actually seven years.

34
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,900
Oh, I missed a year.

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,580
I lost a year during COVID.

36
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,580
Yeah.

37
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,580
Well, here we go again.

38
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,580
Yeah.

39
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,580
I scrolled right down to it.

40
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,700
And actually, I don't know what Spotify you have.

41
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,500
Mine says April 3rd, 2014.

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,100
So literally tomorrow is our seven year anniversary.

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,380
Oh, I don't know what kind of crappy windows version of Spotify you have, but mine actually

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,060
gives dates.

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,100
Does the year show all the episodes?

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,060
Yes.

47
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,380
I just, yeah, all of them.

48
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,380
Oh, yeah.

49
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,380
Interesting.

50
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
I just saw episode one on your side.

51
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,220
So anyway, let's do a podcast, but yeah.

52
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:09,860
Why don't we kick it off with a rant and the rant can be why you were fricking late

53
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,420
to the recording.

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,820
Oh my God.

55
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,260
I don't know what it is.

56
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,460
Like people have to deal with people.

57
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:26,060
I'm going to paraphrase one of my favorite quotes from the, from the Pope, Pope John Paul.

58
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,570
He went asked, how's life?

59
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,370
He was known to say life is fantastic.

60
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,930
It's the people that keep screwing things up.

61
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:37,930
Right.

62
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,410
Again, it's a paraphrase from the hope.

63
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,770
So just before our podcast, I was in a meeting.

64
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,770
I pre-warned them.

65
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,380
I had a hard stop.

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,500
There was a couple of people on the meeting that are, that are kind of known for sort

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:03:02,420
of being able to verbally focus even in the presence of pending urgency.

68
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,900
And they kept on asking, Hey, one more question.

69
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,180
What guys, I have to go.

70
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:17,680
And I said at 306 when I finally looked at it and I said, all right guys, just, you

71
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,400
need to set up another meeting.

72
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
This is going to continue.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,660
And as I said, I have a hard stop of frigging 10 minutes ago.

74
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,660
Yeah.

75
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:34,520
I don't understand sort of the desperation to some degree, although I know I am a difficult

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,920
person right now to book meetings with.

77
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,720
I have far more people wanting to put meetings on my calendar than I have time to do.

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,200
And I recently along those lines, I recently had a one-on-one with an executive of mine

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,320
and the team.

80
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know if you've ever been in a team that did this, Alan.

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,360
Have you ever been in a place where they had like meeting free Fridays?

82
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,580
I have.

83
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,780
And usually they end up being meeting light Fridays.

84
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,780
Yeah.

85
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,420
So the thing is the whole company has to do it because otherwise like people from other

86
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,890
divisions or groups who don't have meeting free Friday will book your time.

87
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,090
That is not the problem I'm encountering.

88
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,770
The problem I'm encountering is because of the edict and everybody trying to satisfy

89
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,770
it.

90
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,130
Number one, it makes the individual contributors super happy.

91
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,790
So maybe at the end of the day, it, the right answer should be buck up buttercup.

92
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:48,590
But for managers, it's, it's sucky because what happens is you still have the same set

93
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,750
of meetings.

94
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:57,070
It's just now the only time you can actually get anything done is on Fridays on meeting

95
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,070
free Friday.

96
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,550
Right.

97
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,270
And so I was explained to my executive, I'm like, yeah, this is a blessing and a curse.

98
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:10,310
It's not working well for me because people are now angry that they can't get on my schedule

99
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,430
because there's one less day available to them.

100
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:20,430
And then I'm getting increasingly annoyed if, if I'm getting summoned into one of the

101
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,310
following two things, either is status meeting.

102
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:33,430
If you want to have these, have them, uh, just fricking leave me out or the worst.

103
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,590
And this is the one.

104
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:43,030
So I think I've shared with you before I'm, I do several presentations to executives, uh,

105
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,030
Guthrie.

106
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:50,600
Um, although I haven't done one in the Guthrie in a long time, I'm still part of the, the,

107
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,240
the leadership committee that is working through what we're messaging to Guthrie.

108
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Okay.

109
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,580
And the fricking pre status meetings in order to prep the deck for the frigging status

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,260
meeting is just death.

111
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:15,680
It's just like, just somebody figure out a way to hire a vendor to do this.

112
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,560
I don't want to be involved.

113
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,720
So one thing I've been a couple of things.

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,200
One I just, I plan to end all my meetings five minutes early for a half hour meetings

115
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,480
and 10 minutes early for our meetings.

116
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,000
Doesn't always work, but I do try and end them.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But one thing it's a lot different for me at unity than Microsoft is I have, I have

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,200
a lot of meetings, but I manage a lot of people and probably half of my meetings are one-on-ones,

119
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
maybe even a little bit more.

120
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,640
There's a lot of means on the calendar.

121
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,200
I feel like they're all very useful.

122
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,240
I don't have meetings that pissed me off.

123
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,640
There are no status meetings.

124
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,080
There are no prep for prep for prep meetings.

125
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
And I like that.

126
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Break, break, break.

127
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,390
Well, yeah, thanks.

128
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,630
Thanks for that helpful advice.

129
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,990
By the way, if you check out my five for Friday, which you haven't yet because you've been

130
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,670
in meetings all day, there is a link to a paper in there on, they did a bunch of research

131
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,990
across like 40 or 50 companies on meetings.

132
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:16,230
I think you might find some interesting insights in there.

133
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,790
It's paper called the future of meetings.

134
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,750
Oh, I saw a couple of links on this one.

135
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,750
Yeah.

136
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,750
Well, I just like things that are based on research.

137
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,790
Like, did you see, maybe we talked about this before, again, another one, maybe a month

138
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,790
ago.

139
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,270
I'm not going to mention it to you, but there was a discussion.

140
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,400
Sorry.

141
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:41,160
It was a blog post based on some research of looking at three different companies, GitLab,

142
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,120
Git buffer, and one other one.

143
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,960
What they found, I thought was actually very much aligned with what I've seen.

144
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,360
They saw that personal productivity is up, but teamwork is down.

145
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
And it's true.

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,500
People are cranking a lot of work out because they can.

147
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:04,660
As managers, we seem to have a few more meetings, but I don't know if you've run into this, but

148
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,120
there have been a few things that I knew if I just got the right four or five people

149
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
in a room with a whiteboard for half a day, we could just get it done.

150
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:20,680
And doing those things, not together, asynchronously just takes too long.

151
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm really beginning to notice that now as we're getting our time apart longer and

152
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:33,320
longer, that just getting a bunch of people to argue in a room for half a day gets a lot

153
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
of stuff done.

154
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Yeah.

155
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:42,380
But I think part of that is because getting people in a room gets them on the same page

156
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:54,160
and whether it's either explicitly or implicitly done, it has the effect of aligning the principles

157
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,740
like what we talked about before in terms of the principles around success.

158
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,260
How do we know if this is done?

159
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,140
And then that helps to focus the work towards the highest ROI towards those principles.

160
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,660
It definitely is alignment.

161
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,800
We just can't get, because sometimes alignment's easy.

162
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,860
Sometimes it takes extensive debate.

163
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,560
I said arguing earlier, but I meant debate, which I think is a good thing.

164
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:27,140
If your organization, your people can't debate each other, you are blocked from really doing

165
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,780
anything important.

166
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,890
The debate just works better for the harder things when you're all together.

167
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:34,890
That's all.

168
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,890
That's all.

169
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,570
So we have a topic that we can fit in easily in the rest of our time.

170
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,590
We can go really deep, but we'll go about 39 minutes deep.

171
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,130
And we hinted at this for the last two podcasts.

172
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,350
It's the personality type.

173
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,310
You and I, Brent and I have taken a whole bunch of different personality tests.

174
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,750
Some we like better than others.

175
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,110
They all have some value and some caveats.

176
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,090
I thought it would be good just to dive through a few of those and what they told us and

177
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:07,350
reflect a little bit whether we found them valuable or not.

178
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:16,510
So we should start with the classic, the MBTI, the Myers-Briggs type indicator.

179
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:24,690
And we have said many times that Brent and I both belong to the rarest of the 16 groups.

180
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,660
Is it the rarest?

181
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,660
So we're INTPs.

182
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Yes.

183
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,340
And that means we're introverts.

184
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,820
We use intuition.

185
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,820
What's T?

186
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
I forgot T.

187
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,360
I can give you the full, I'll give you the summation of the whole thing.

188
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,460
T is thinker.

189
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460
That's right.

190
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,760
So thinker versus a feeler, right?

191
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,600
Yeah, thinker versus feeler.

192
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,040
And the last one is J versus P and a scheduler versus perceiver.

193
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,760
And let me just stop me if I take longer than three minutes.

194
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,580
Timer set.

195
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:08,320
So Carl Jung was the one that actually invented this particular system.

196
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:17,400
For those who may or may not be aware, he was a follower, acolyte, disciple, believer, whatever,

197
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,040
a Freud.

198
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:28,080
And what Carl Jung analyzed, so we view it as psychotyping.

199
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,080
We think of it as psychotyping.

200
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:38,160
What the particular type of study Carl Jung did was judging how people made decisions.

201
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:45,200
That's how he, the whole four letters are all about the process of decision making.

202
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,840
So I'll go through a couple of examples.

203
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,060
For example, I versus E, everyone knows that's introvert versus extrovert.

204
00:11:53,060 --> 00:12:01,360
But what a lot of people wrongly view it as is essentially how you feel about people

205
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,800
or how shy you are or things of that nature.

206
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,040
In actuality, both Alan and I are introverts.

207
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,230
But I don't think anyone would call Alan or I shy.

208
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:26,950
The difference between introvert and extrovert is essentially what are the types of topics

209
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,310
they are interested in.

210
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:34,870
And an extrovert is interested in what's known as objects.

211
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,350
An extrovert is interested in subject.

212
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:45,800
So an example I will use is Alan, if I came out of the blue one day, here's a hypothetical

213
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
situation.

214
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,120
I come to you and say, imagine we are classmates.

215
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:02,500
And I said, Alan, what did you think of yesterday's math test?

216
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
How would you respond?

217
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,380
It was a test.

218
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,380
Okay.

219
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,380
So a tautology.

220
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,380
All right.

221
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:18,030
So why don't you do another more specific hypothetical response?

222
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,030
It was fun.

223
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:22,430
You can tell Brent didn't prep me with the stock answer.

224
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,430
I like math.

225
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,430
The test was fun.

226
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,430
Okay.

227
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,270
So that that answer is actually a little bit better.

228
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,270
Okay.

229
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,750
Because you said, I like math.

230
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,150
The test was fun.

231
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:40,070
An introvert will focus on they think when I said, how do you feel about yesterday's math

232
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,070
test?

233
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:47,630
They think an introvert will respond with sort of the subject at hand.

234
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,390
The math test is the high order bit.

235
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,390
Okay.

236
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:56,320
An extrovert will pivot around the word you.

237
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,000
What were your feeling?

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Oh, I was stressed.

239
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,240
Things along those lines where an introvert might say, man, question number five was a

240
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,700
pain in the butt, but I destroyed it.

241
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,860
Right.

242
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,940
That's what I mean when they talk about introverts care more about subjects and extroverts care

243
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,940
about my own.

244
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,660
And it's also where you get your energy from.

245
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,460
You know, I can give like a conference talk or a workshop or whatever.

246
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,980
And an extrovert afterwards is supercharged and wants to go do another one or run a

247
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,980
marathon.

248
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
I'm exhausted.

249
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,300
I'm going to have to go by myself and have a nap in a certain context.

250
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,580
And I think Alan, you've seen me do this before.

251
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:43,140
If I'm in a group of people and I am talking about something that I know a lot about, I

252
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,420
actually get jacked up because I love talking about the subject matter.

253
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Okay.

254
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:57,540
But you put me in a place where we got to share personal feelings, talk about, I don't

255
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,220
actually, you know what?

256
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,860
My biggest worst nightmare would be it would be, yeah, thanks.

257
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,220
I don't even know why I set the stage this way with Alan.

258
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:13,860
My biggest worst nightmare would be in a, would be something like a orchestrated thing.

259
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,060
Let's say you were media mediator.

260
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:24,420
I was the one on stage and there was an audience of a hundred people and the whole thing was

261
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,780
about praising Brent for random things.

262
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,780
Okay.

263
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:37,820
So a whole hour dedicated to just saying nice things to me about me.

264
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,350
That would drain the crap out of me.

265
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:52,070
Because whereas something where it was communicating faults about me, unfortunately internally,

266
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:55,590
I'm fairly certain I have massive self esteem issues.

267
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,590
I'd be a board.

268
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm like, yeah, sure.

269
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,590
Whatever.

270
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,590
Okay.

271
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,150
So you're well over three minutes.

272
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,150
All right.

273
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,910
I'm going to show, we talked a little bit about I versus E and the main thing there

274
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,430
is an introvert.

275
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,790
Doesn't mean you're a shut in.

276
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:16,230
Can you briefly talk about the other three dichotomies in the other three will actually

277
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,630
be simpler once now that I've kind of gone through that.

278
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:28,350
So I versus E is going to talk about what are the types of content that energize you.

279
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,190
Is it again, subjects versus objects.

280
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,830
And I try to go into that because it's hard to distinguish.

281
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:43,070
Next N versus S is how do you gather data on those particular things?

282
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,270
Ns read in between the lines.

283
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,910
It stands for intuition.

284
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,350
The user intuition.

285
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:53,350
S's stand for sensate and S's primarily don't read in between the lines.

286
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,310
The facts speak for themselves.

287
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:02,190
An example that I often give on this would be if I came into your room, Alan, let's say

288
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,340
I came to your office and did a hit and run.

289
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:09,340
And I said, Alan, Bob just filed 20 bucks.

290
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,860
And then I left.

291
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,860
Okay.

292
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:16,380
As an N you would go, why the hell did Brent say that?

293
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,660
Why did he feel it was important to me?

294
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,180
And S might just move on and say, okay.

295
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,620
I do think WTF branched quite a bit.

296
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,990
So that stands up.

297
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,990
Yeah.

298
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,300
And that's because you're an N because you're trying to figure out what the hell is Brent

299
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,300
saying?

300
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,780
What the hell is Brent doing?

301
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,420
S's again, the facts speak for themselves.

302
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,420
They don't read in between the lines.

303
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,260
N's kind of read in between the lines and leverage their intuition.

304
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,660
Whether these is right or wrong.

305
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,620
Now you gather the data.

306
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,980
T versus F is how do you make decisions?

307
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,060
T's will judge based off of a logical right versus wrong.

308
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,900
One plus one equals two is right.

309
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,220
One plus one equals three is wrong.

310
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:13,260
Whereas feelers judge the decisions on a more emotional basis.

311
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,540
Good versus bad.

312
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:23,900
And you can think of bad in a, again, almost a morality sense.

313
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:33,060
An example I might give there is if you're a Catholic and you are married and your spouse

314
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,660
is abusing you.

315
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,100
According to the Catholic tradition, getting divorced is bad.

316
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,970
It's immoral, but it might be the right thing to do.

317
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,970
Lastly, judge versus perceiver.

318
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:55,890
This is now that you've made a decision, what's the likelihood of you to stick with it?

319
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,610
And J's stick with their decisions.

320
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,330
Once a decision has been made, they're locked in.

321
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,410
P's are far more flexible.

322
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:14,170
And the way I describe this is if you imagine that a decision tree where if this

323
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,890
occurs, then I go this way, if that occurs, I go this way, et cetera.

324
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,810
J's and P's, if you remember back to computer science.

325
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:28,530
So imagine a binary search tree and J's are going down their binary search tree

326
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,890
to make a decision.

327
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:35,690
Once they've made a decision, the tree, the part of the tree that wasn't used

328
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,050
is destroyed.

329
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,320
It's gone because they don't need the tree anymore.

330
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:52,180
Whereas a P, they'll go down and they'll make a decision, but their tree is a prioritized

331
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:56,700
binary search tree and they never destroy their tree.

332
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:04,300
And when something new comes in, it actually adjusts the tree in a way that a new possible

333
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,580
decision could be made.

334
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,540
Cool.

335
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,700
Which had the perception that they're more spontaneous.

336
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,760
So as I mentioned at the beginning of this, we asked for the person on the types we want

337
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
to get to.

338
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
We're both INTPs.

339
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,760
Yep.

340
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Let me read you from my house.

341
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,200
I still have my copy of Working Together.

342
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
I never got that one.

343
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,920
The theme of the INTP is designing, not just in the artistic sense, but in the sense

344
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:33,040
of precise arrangement of all the elements necessary for objective understanding of that

345
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,160
part of the world that interests them.

346
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:41,040
While many INTPs are drawn to science and math, the designing can be in many other realms

347
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:45,680
and they usually turn out to be superb strategists in whatever endeavor they take on.

348
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,440
And then there's a whole chapter in here that very much describes the way I work in

349
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
many cases.

350
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,120
But what'd you think of that, Brent?

351
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:00,000
It absolutely describes me.

352
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,830
It's essentially a system designer.

353
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,070
I love to...

354
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,070
That's the thing I like to do.

355
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,470
I love...

356
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,630
We talk about systems thinking and the need for that.

357
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,990
And I love just systems within systems and understanding how they all fit together and

358
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,950
how the pieces...

359
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,950
And not just code, but how social systems work together and what you can change in culture

360
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,290
to change output of on the other end.

361
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,510
It's just fun for me.

362
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,070
It gives me energy.

363
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,430
Yeah.

364
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,230
It's me as well.

365
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,510
I'm very good at seeing how the system works.

366
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,710
So in preparation for this, I'm going to get your feedback on this, and we'll talk about

367
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,950
some of the other ones.

368
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:46,550
In preparation for this podcast, and there's your primer on Myers Briggs, but I watched

369
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,670
a movie I saw on HBO called Persona.

370
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:53,770
It's like Persona, the dark secrets of personality tests.

371
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,010
I thought, well, this will be interesting.

372
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,010
And I...

373
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:00,050
A little bit of hyperbole in the title.

374
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:07,260
I watched the movie and I agreed with the movie, but the movie wasn't really about the

375
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,260
title of the movie.

376
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Okay.

377
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,380
Oh, you're actually showing me that INTPs are not the rarest.

378
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,820
I read that once, but maybe I'm wrong.

379
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
Yeah.

380
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:18,820
And it's interesting.

381
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,660
The first time I took a test, I was an INTJ.

382
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:27,300
And I know why I am an INTP, but we will not go with now.

383
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,560
And I'll just hint it's...

384
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
Okay.

385
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,480
So now that you've distracted me, I don't even see INTP.

386
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
There it is in the middle there.

387
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Okay.

388
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,160
So that rare part, that's crap.

389
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,360
Don't ignore me.

390
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,480
Or ignore the Data Brent Show.

391
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,400
So what I was talking about, this movie, nothing wrong with the test itself.

392
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,400
And I think it helps you figure out what gives you energy and that gives you...

393
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
There's value in that.

394
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,480
There's also value in understanding that different things motivate different people, not everyone's

395
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
alike.

396
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,760
And we need to be reminded of that sometimes.

397
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,200
That's another good takeaway from Myers-Briggs.

398
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:07,800
This entire documentary special was all about was about companies who use personality tests,

399
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,280
either Myers-Briggs or variations of it.

400
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,240
It's a variation that's really just a rip off called the Big Five, I think.

401
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,720
But anyway, they use these to determine employment.

402
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,600
They only want to hire a certain type of person.

403
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Interesting.

404
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,360
Which I think is dumb in the first place.

405
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,080
But they managed to make this whole 90 minute documentary on how personality tests used as

406
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,720
a hiring mechanism is bad.

407
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,360
I knew that before I watched the movie, so I was a little disappointed.

408
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,520
I thought they'd have something a little bit more just even taking the test makes

409
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,560
you weird or something.

410
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
I don't know.

411
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
But no, this...

412
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,640
Yeah, you can use the results wrong.

413
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,320
And I've actually seen that a little bit.

414
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,600
I've seen a manager go, ooh, I need a perfect team is one where I get one each of all

415
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,960
those extreme types.

416
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,280
Which is no.

417
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,440
Yeah, no.

418
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,120
It's really just understanding what makes you click and understanding that what makes you

419
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,840
click doesn't make other people click.

420
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,700
That in a nutshell is what I have come to learn.

421
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:25,280
The most valuable thing about the Myers-Briggs and probably it allows you to introspect and

422
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,080
then sort of look at others once you have theirs.

423
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,520
I mean, it's not going to tell you how to interact.

424
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
It's good.

425
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,880
All it's going to do is help you to understand yourself and others a little bit more and

426
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,920
perhaps be a little bit more respectful of their point of view.

427
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,520
There's no right or wrong.

428
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,280
For me, Myers-Briggs helped in a lot of regards to sort of solidify.

429
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:55,160
No, they're looking at the world a different way, right?

430
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,880
It's like if I stood on the front of the house and you stood in the backyard.

431
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,680
Are you like clicking a pen while you talk?

432
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,960
And we tried to describe the house.

433
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,530
We're both right, but it's a different perspective.

434
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,530
Yeah.

435
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:18,420
And another one we had for that, I'm segueing away here and this one's kind of fun too.

436
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:25,450
Another one we did at Microsoft for a long time was the insights and there's four colors

437
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:30,980
and there's even kind of some colors in between.

438
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,220
So we both took this test and I have mine in front of me.

439
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,540
I took it on May 8th, 2010 and I have the wheel.

440
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:45,460
I'm trying to figure out how to read it, but I thought I was, I remember being blue

441
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,060
red, but I'm just blue.

442
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,220
Both of my little pie graphs are in the blue.

443
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,620
That surprises me.

444
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Yeah.

445
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:58,340
So I don't know quite how to read this, but there is, when you take this, they give you

446
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,780
a score and they also like write up a little computer generated thing.

447
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,780
Here we go.

448
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,300
So red was my second highest.

449
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:09,740
So here's the bar graph in my conscious persona.

450
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:16,750
Blue was 4.72 out of six and red was 3.36 out of six.

451
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,390
So I'm definitely more, I'm definitely more in the blue.

452
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,390
Yeah.

453
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,590
If you, I'm holding up mine.

454
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,590
Yeah.

455
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:28,790
And definitely you have, you have more, way more red than me.

456
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,270
You are definitely blurple.

457
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,270
Blurple?

458
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,270
Purple.

459
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,270
Oh yeah.

460
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,270
Blue, blue, purple.

461
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,950
So I'm bluer than you.

462
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:39,470
The other thing to keep in mind is this thing.

463
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,470
I don't know if you have that.

464
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,470
Yeah, I do.

465
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,830
I have the exact same book.

466
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,620
I hold yours up.

467
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,620
Okay.

468
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,980
So one thing that's unique and it looks like you're similar, the fact that the two lines

469
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,140
are similar in this.

470
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,780
So for everyone listening, we're holding up a, we're each holding up a sort of a little

471
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:04,860
video and there's a circle that kind of shows you, to what degree you're each of the four

472
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,980
colors.

473
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,380
And they do an evaluation around to what degree you're those four colors when you're

474
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,020
conscious as well as what they call less conscious or under stress.

475
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,820
And for me and what it looked like for Alan, we're essentially the same person no matter

476
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,820
what.

477
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,860
No, you're definitely redder than me, but what I want to read for you and maybe you have

478
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,260
some of this highlighted as well.

479
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,020
They, they give you a little print out that describes you after this test.

480
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,540
And I highlighted the parts.

481
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:38,140
This is like my owner's manual, but I'm going to read a couple to you, see what you think.

482
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,620
And some lines up exactly with INTP.

483
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,780
He can be a great designer of systems, which he prefers to leave others to build.

484
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,340
And that's absolutely true.

485
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
Here's the highlighted line.

486
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,180
His aim is to fit all the pieces of the jigsaw together into a complete picture.

487
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,600
But for Alan, the jigsaw keeps expanding with the discovery of every new piece.

488
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,880
And that is so 100% freaking true.

489
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,940
That's what I do every day.

490
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,060
Every day I put pieces in and the, and the puzzle gets bigger.

491
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,500
So I thought that was interesting.

492
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,420
Even today, I'm going to read you a few more and you can grab a couple of yours.

493
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,840
His interest lies in seeing possibilities beyond what is already present and known by

494
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,960
using his insight, ingenuity and intellect.

495
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,780
That's the strategist in me.

496
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:28,800
He is intensely curious and is always seeking to find coherence and endless amounts of data.

497
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,380
Uh-huh.

498
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:33,580
On decision making with a love of problem solving.

499
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:38,290
And I, I have, I, I absolutely do love it.

500
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,410
With a love of problem solving, he can be very perceptive.

501
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:46,760
There's my P and has a highly developed capacity for inner reflection.

502
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,240
Let me show you just from the key strengths quickly gets to the root of a problem.

503
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,160
Good situational analysis, couple more.

504
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,540
And they, I think they're, they're pretty much aligned with things that I, I think I'm

505
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
good at myself.

506
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,860
I help avoid mistakes.

507
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,260
Some of my value to the team is to help avoid mistakes.

508
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,700
I won't read the rest or they're all, I could just go through them all and try to

509
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,500
see if one was more better than the rest.

510
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,820
I have one more circled on communication.

511
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,660
This is my favorite one.

512
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,580
There's this thing that says when communicating with Alan, do not, and it has things like

513
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,940
dwell on trivia, which is why I hate you so much, Brent.

514
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:28,140
Uh, but one of them is do not get too close or touch him, which I think is the whole,

515
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,470
which I think is hilarious.

516
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:39,320
The next time we do a podcast in person, it's going to be big hug time, Alan.

517
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,080
Have you seen that?

518
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,280
Um, uh, yeah, no, nevermind.

519
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,440
There's not going to happen.

520
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,200
Anyway, so this is called insights.

521
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,080
Uh, the company's still around that does this.

522
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,840
Some may have done this, but what about what's real quick?

523
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,000
Cause I have two more I want to get through today.

524
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,880
Uh, what have been your takeaways on insights?

525
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:05,600
Um, so first and foremost, I'll tell you, uh, insights and Myers Briggs are

526
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,280
fundamentally the same thing.

527
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:12,520
The, the color wheel is, um, is it just the letters?

528
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,040
It's I and T I and T is the only thing that they use.

529
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,420
That's, that's why there's a lot of similarity between, uh, these things.

530
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,900
Now, I don't know if you're aware, but with Myers Briggs, even though they

531
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,500
frame it as I and T it's actually a scaler it's to what, if you're mostly

532
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,700
I they're just going to call you.

533
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:38,190
I used to have a whole, I couldn't find it in my pile of stuff.

534
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:42,990
I had a whole big packet and it showed me where I was on a scale on those.

535
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,530
But I've, I've, I've since lost it.

536
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,860
So, uh, I'll read just a couple of mine, uh, and I'll pick them at random and

537
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,220
hopefully none of them are too terribly embarrassing.

538
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,320
Uh, a capacity for cool emotional detachment makes Brent a good decision

539
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,900
maker because he thinks clearly under pressure.

540
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,340
He is a realist who sees things as, as they are and is prepared

541
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,300
to accept them as such.

542
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,660
He focuses on truth, accuracy, and productivity.

543
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,540
Brent skill at taking a long, a very broad long range view of things

544
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:23,460
contributes to his reputation as something of a visionary.

545
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,060
He's logical and analytical and ingenious thinker.

546
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,700
Uh, I hate the edge of their long range planner and good at anything

547
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,580
that requires rapid reasoning.

548
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,860
More he's logical.

549
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,700
He dislikes being criticized by others as, oh yeah, this is one of, I probably

550
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,180
should not have read, but I'll finish it.

551
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,100
He likes, he dislikes being criticized by others as he is already heavily

552
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,140
burdened by his inner voice of self judgment.

553
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,980
And that's so true.

554
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,220
And I, like I try to suppress that, but I will say to you and the three

555
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:06,500
that is no one can criticize me better than me.

556
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,300
I've gotten feedback in the past.

557
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,820
Why does Ellen Besh you on the podcast all the time?

558
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,580
I'm like, it's really no big deal.

559
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,140
He has gotten nowhere close to the bashing I do late at night

560
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,740
when I'm trying to sleep politically aware.

561
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,540
Brent is normally comfortable with his decisions, even in the face of

562
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:27,660
possible conflict with others and more senior positions and oh my

563
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,740
God, is that true?

564
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:37,820
I will go, I have gone to senior executives and gone briefly go, is

565
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,740
this a CLM?

566
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,150
Yeah, probably is.

567
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:42,670
Am I going to adjust?

568
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,830
No.

569
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:48,950
Thankfully I'm currently under the executive that knows and values

570
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:54,830
this, a strength, a forward looking quick thinker, enjoys a challenge,

571
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:59,750
effective implement, implementer will readily accept responsibility.

572
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:06,310
A couple of weaknesses can be seen as Kurt and abrasive takes on too

573
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,790
much responsibility.

574
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,590
Yeah, that one kills me.

575
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,310
That last one.

576
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:10,630
Right.

577
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,870
That's enough of, yeah.

578
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,510
So similar to Myers Briggs, it lets you know what your preferences are.

579
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:20,270
It's a little, you know, it's a nice horoscope, but valid.

580
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,990
Again, the big takeaway there is people have to bring different

581
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:27,520
strengths to the table and it's good.

582
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,280
Just understand that.

583
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,160
So speaking of strengths, we're going to talk about two more, which are different,

584
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,040
not based on INTP.

585
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:39,480
They're sort of based on different strengths.

586
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,240
Like that's a bad name for it.

587
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,840
We're talking about strength finders first, which is a thing

588
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,320
Brent introduced me to.

589
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,080
And it's, um, uh, there's a book called strengths finders 2.0.

590
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,120
I think it's the last one.

591
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:55,440
And we both took the test from the book and it, it tells you some things you're

592
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,560
good at and it's pretty good, but here's the difference here is despite us being

593
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:08,600
very similar in what motivates us are our buyers Briggs or our, or our insights.

594
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,840
I don't, I think we maybe have one overlapping thing in our top five

595
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,000
themes and strengths finders.

596
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,480
I don't quite remember.

597
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,840
Do you have yours in front of you?

598
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,280
I yeah, I'm sharing it on the screen right now.

599
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,720
I have it.

600
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,040
Yeah.

601
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,440
Okay.

602
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,680
I don't have yours anymore.

603
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,520
Mine are in front of me here.

604
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,080
So my, I'll do Brent's first Brent's top five themes are, are those it?

605
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:34,640
What was your highlighted ideation, relater, restorative,

606
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,440
individualization, analytical.

607
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,400
And I don't recall what those are.

608
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,880
Maybe if you have a chance to just walk through those briefly, the

609
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:49,560
moment we'll do that, but mine are strategic learner, achiever are one

610
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:58,450
overlap analytical and intellectual strategic learner, analytical and

611
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,890
achievers over analytical and intellectual at the bottom.

612
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:01,850
Okay.

613
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:07,800
So maybe we'll do yours and let me just talk as briefly so I can model,

614
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,480
but briefly sounds like to Brent.

615
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,800
What was the bottle?

616
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,680
What was the last one?

617
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
Intellect, intellectual.

618
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Oh, okay.

619
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,560
So I'm just going to read like the top sentence.

620
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,480
So you know what these mean.

621
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,160
So strategic is my top one.

622
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,920
People who are especially talented in the strategic theme, create

623
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,640
alternative ways to proceed faced with any given scenario.

624
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,120
They can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.

625
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,520
Now you see some of my INTP bleeding into that, but the way I apply it

626
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,890
here is I have a knack I've developing a better and better knack for figuring

627
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:45,330
out the best way to get something done and, and, and to adapt that as needed.

628
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,210
Learner.

629
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,010
I've talked about my passion for learning many, many times.

630
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:54,210
Uh, people who are especially talented in the learner theme have a great desire

631
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,690
to learn and want to continuously improve in particular, the process of

632
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,690
learning rather than the outcome excites them, and that's true as well.

633
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:07,330
For achiever people who are especially talented in the achiever theme have

634
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:09,810
a great deal of stamina and work hard.

635
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,890
They take great satisfaction in being busy and productive.

636
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:16,250
And yes, I like to be by myself because I'm an introvert and

637
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,450
crank out a crap ton of work.

638
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:21,690
Analytical again, our one overlap people who are especially talented in

639
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,890
the antil, analytical, analytical theme search for reasons and causes.

640
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,290
This is not your whole job, right?

641
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,090
They have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect the situation.

642
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,970
There's that systems thinking again.

643
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,250
And finally, for me, my fifth one was Intellection.

644
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,170
People who are especially talented in the Intellection theme are

645
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:44,810
characterized by their intellectual activity.

646
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,410
They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussion.

647
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:53,410
And I actually, I don't recall how many of the different strengths there are,

648
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,930
make up this thing gives you your top five.

649
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:56,730
Thirty-four.

650
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:57,650
Thirty-four.

651
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,850
Those are my top five.

652
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,170
So can you read the one sentence about each of yours?

653
00:37:01,170 --> 00:37:03,370
So cause I don't think anybody would know what they mean by the title.

654
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,450
Yeah.

655
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,250
So, uh, I'll just go through all 10 really quickly.

656
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,130
Strategic.

657
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,730
Sorry, on yours, strategic.

658
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:19,840
Uh, strategic, given a goal, they are just phenomenal at finding the path to it.

659
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,320
You can't put a roadblock in front of a strategic.

660
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:23,960
Okay.

661
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,120
That's correct.

662
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,760
Learner love learning.

663
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,880
They don't care if they ever use it.

664
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,520
They just love learning.

665
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,560
Achievers love to get shit done.

666
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,280
The way I describe achievers is they cannot stand a, a to-do list that doesn't

667
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,520
have the check mark in the box.

668
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,960
Uh, the, like my favorite thing is all eerily true.

669
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,920
Achievers, their biggest nightmare is being idle.

670
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,120
They can't, they cannot stand it.

671
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,480
They do not like being idle, uh, analytical in summation.

672
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:03,560
They are just fantastic at answering the question why.

673
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,310
And they just do it over and over again.

674
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,110
They understand why.

675
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:08,830
Okay.

676
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:15,750
And then Intellection is, is functionally the equivalent of learner, except they enjoy

677
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,750
the process of thinking about stuff.

678
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:23,270
Intellection is, is like, that's what I said.

679
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,030
They like thinking.

680
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:24,390
Okay.

681
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:27,310
Now my strengths, number one, ideation.

682
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:34,110
Ideation is, uh, you could also think of it as out of the box thinker.

683
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:41,820
They can see how concepts, what you do with strategic, I do with ideas.

684
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,900
I can connect the dots between ideas and get there and go, Oh, that's connected

685
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:52,340
to this and that connected to that, that, and that, and that, for example, uh, I

686
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,500
think I shared this before.

687
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,500
I once solved the BVT problem by scheduling an office move.

688
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:02,500
Uh, and that's, that's because I understood that the BVTs were actually

689
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,380
broken eventually because someone was demoralized because they weren't in, in

690
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,780
that office that made them happy or felt appreciated.

691
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:16,180
A relater is someone good at talking with people in a one-on-one basis.

692
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:22,380
They're also well-known for being driven towards partnerships.

693
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,780
They really like collaborative partnerships.

694
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,980
A restorative is similar to Achiever.

695
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,100
Achievers love to get shit done.

696
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,720
A restorative loves to, uh, fix broken shit.

697
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,040
So I don't have a problem being idle.

698
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,280
If there's nothing broken to fix, I'm good.

699
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,040
I'm happy.

700
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,240
But you, you, you take a particular set of problems and frame it as a problem to solve.

701
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,920
Um, I'm on it and nothing frustrates me more than a problem that doesn't stay fixed.

702
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,280
An individualizer, uh, actually it's funny cause an individualizer is essentially

703
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,840
someone who understands the unique strengths of unique individuals.

704
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:18,280
So these type of tests in general will speak a lot more to someone like me than,

705
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:23,200
uh, to someone who doesn't have individualization in their strength list.

706
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,800
Uh, they're, they're very meaningful to me and then analytical we already covered.

707
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,400
Yeah.

708
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,640
And probably worth re mentioning.

709
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,080
And again, actually I'll just ask you, what do you use this for?

710
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,960
You take this test, tell us who you're good at.

711
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,440
You go, yep, I'm good at those things.

712
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,440
Oh, the thing I love about the strength finders test versus the other ones

713
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,440
is that these are talents.

714
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:54,200
They're not psychotypes and because they're talents, they can be turned into

715
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,520
or away from just sort of personality characteristics and be turned into

716
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,440
something that you can control, use, grow and learn.

717
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,440
Yeah.

718
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,880
So then to build on that and to segue when I did strengths finders, what it

719
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,360
did for me was it underscored what I was good at and liked doing, but if

720
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,000
other things came up, those were things I needed to either partner with

721
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,440
somebody else with or delegate in order to get those done.

722
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,880
It helped me figure out like these are the things I do other stuff.

723
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,680
Maybe I should, I'm not going to do as well.

724
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,040
I should work with somebody to do those if needed.

725
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,920
And then as I mentioned a couple of times ago, and we'll talk about the last one.

726
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,040
And we're actually don't know Brent's results on this one.

727
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,200
We're going to talk about it live here.

728
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,320
Pat Lencione, one of my favorite authors, author of five is functions of a team.

729
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,560
A big fan of the Myers-Briggs type indicator talks about it in a few of

730
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,240
his books recently came up with the something similar in leadership traits.

731
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,680
Leadership talents called the working genius.

732
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,280
I took this test and it basically, there are six kinds of working genius,

733
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,840
discernment, galvanizing, wonder, tenacity, enablement, and invention.

734
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,360
And there's probably two of these you're really good at.

735
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,480
It says two you can do if needed and two are a struggle for you.

736
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,320
I was actually surprised with one of my working frustrations, those bottom two,

737
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,480
but my top two are, and I'll talk about what these are.

738
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,360
Maybe we'll go into all the rest are discernment and galvanize.

739
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,800
These are really leadership traits, not really the talents like in StrengthsFinders.

740
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:32,480
So what this means is in discernment, I am good at and enjoy using intuition

741
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,160
and instincts to evaluate and assess ideas or plans, which you've been listening

742
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,000
to the rest of the podcast.

743
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,680
We're pretty much saying the same thing again.

744
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,230
And galvanizing is, and this is something I've begun to enjoy, especially

745
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:50,830
maybe over the last five years of my careers, I've been managing larger and larger

746
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:55,590
teams galvanizing is you are good at and enjoy rallying people and inspiring

747
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:58,230
them to take action around a project task or idea.

748
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,950
But then again, you could take that all the way back to test architect group

749
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:03,550
and Q tech and some of the communities that are ran at Microsoft.

750
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,430
I like figuring out how to bring people together to get crap done.

751
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,950
I won't go into the rest cause I want to hear, um, on yours,

752
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:17,390
your two working geniuses are different than mine.

753
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:21,030
Uh, I thought discernment was one of yours.

754
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,430
Uh, actually, no, I sorry, bad eyes.

755
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:25,750
Uh, discernment was one of mine.

756
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:31,740
So we shared discernment, which again, is, is that, is that INTP trait, but go on.

757
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,540
So I was just looking at it.

758
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,700
It's discernment is the gift of intuitively and instinctively, right?

759
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:44,700
That's reeking of an end right there, uh, from Myers breaks evaluating

760
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,300
ideas and situations.

761
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,260
Yeah.

762
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,540
And that is absolutely something that I am, I'm good at and people come to me.

763
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,980
They, they, well, actually, if you think about here at Microsoft, Alan, when, um,

764
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:04,420
when we well, before it happened, sort of began to predict the demise of, of test.

765
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:04,940
Right.

766
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,300
Um, we, we, we've paid attention to what the system looks like.

767
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,500
Yeah.

768
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,300
I afterwards, I had a bunch of people coming to me, uh, and saying, wow,

769
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,060
you were really press prescient as if, you know, it was a superpower and I

770
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,980
had ESP or some crap like that.

771
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:29,080
And no, it was essentially saw how, how the wind was blowing, saw all the

772
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,720
different motivational factors.

773
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,040
And for me, it was like, Oh yeah, this is not only going to happen.

774
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,720
It's going to happen pretty quick, but invention.

775
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:43,650
You are good at and enjoy creating original and novel ideas and solutions.

776
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:43,890
Right.

777
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,210
That's where you and I are different and it resonates straight with, but the

778
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:52,010
closest thing in the lines with is what the strength finders said, my number one

779
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,010
is right.

780
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:56,490
And just to talk on that for a second, and I totally agree.

781
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,930
That's in my bottom section.

782
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,610
I am not an inventor.

783
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:04,610
I'm a really, really good adapter, which is why I love learning.

784
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:08,290
I want to take other people's ideas and figure out how to make them work in

785
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,410
the scenario I'm in, but new stuff.

786
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,450
That's not my thing.

787
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:12,370
Yeah.

788
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:15,730
I'm trying to wonder your so wonder.

789
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,130
So galvanizing was in your top.

790
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,470
So I'm guessing, do we share wonder in the middle ones?

791
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,830
Yeah.

792
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:29,670
Wonders in the middle and wonder is, uh, being, you're capable of and don't

793
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,870
mind pondering the possibility of greater potential and opportunity given situation.

794
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:36,430
I, I like that.

795
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:43,430
Um, I, it isn't, doesn't give me the same joy that discernment and galvanizing

796
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:44,430
do so that makes sense.

797
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:45,840
Yeah.

798
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:51,480
And then tenacity given that you have achieved in your top five, I'm

799
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:54,800
for surprise tenacity is tenacity in your middle.

800
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,000
Yeah.

801
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,280
Tenacity is in my middle.

802
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,120
Oh, okay.

803
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:57,560
All right.

804
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,800
Then that makes more sense.

805
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,920
Enablement and tenacity are my bottom two.

806
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,120
And it's what's funny enablements in my bottom two as well.

807
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,400
I have enablement and the aforementioned invention.

808
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:12,460
Yeah.

809
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:16,940
The closest I come to sort of driving that energy is, is in

810
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,780
my partnership relationships.

811
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,940
Like it's let's do this together.

812
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,300
Right.

813
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,260
Then my excitement is, is genuine.

814
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:33,320
I'm not the world's best at, at, you know, sitting back and, and just

815
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,440
blatantly encouraging, which is how I interpret by providing others with

816
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,360
encouragement and assistance for product.

817
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,440
So assistance I do all the time, but yeah, it says I don't derive energy from it.

818
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,400
No, it's, it's, it is often a drain when someone comes and asks me for assistance.

819
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,240
I I'll just submit upfront.

820
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:54,480
The first thing is like, God damn it.

821
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,920
Here's another person coming and stealing my time and making it harder

822
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,000
for me to get shit done.

823
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,360
Yeah.

824
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,720
And the idea behind this one specifically, the one I mentioned, I

825
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,800
took sort of, uh, inherently from strength finders is, is Lenchoni says,

826
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,920
these things are hard for you to be better off if you found a way to delegate

827
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,320
or partner with someone else to get them done, because you don't,

828
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,680
they don't make you happy.

829
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,400
So what his, uh, working genius categories helps you figure out like,

830
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,880
what are the things you enjoy?

831
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,680
What can you do?

832
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,720
What are you not like doing?

833
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,960
And they're fairly accurate.

834
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,320
It doesn't, it doesn't define you.

835
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:36,350
It's really just to help you figure out what sorts of things maybe you

836
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,710
want to balance other people.

837
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,510
It's like, if I have two people on my team, we're having a hard time working

838
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:45,630
together, I may, maybe I could look at these and figure out that may give me,

839
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,180
give me some insights why I don't know, but I like him.

840
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:55,610
I, I, again, there's probably a dozen more different sort of personality

841
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:57,170
or what are you good at tests?

842
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:03,690
Uh, I did take my surprisingly, I took my what house are you and Harry Potter test?

843
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:08,290
And, uh, I'm was a little surprised and probably not surprised to our listeners,

844
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:09,610
but I am a Slytherin.

845
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,440
So that happened.

846
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,650
Uh, that, that humors me.

847
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:23,570
I forget which one it is.

848
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,490
I'm the blue one.

849
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,630
Oh, did you, did you take that one?

850
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:30,310
I did a blue.

851
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:31,550
What's the blue house?

852
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:32,870
So a Gryffindor.

853
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,990
No, um, not Gryffindor.

854
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,430
You're probably a Hufflepuff or a Ravenclaw.

855
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,480
You're probably a Ravenclaw.

856
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:46,520
Uh, what's Harry or not Harry Harry Potter.

857
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:47,720
It's Ravenclaw.

858
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:48,910
Yeah.

859
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:49,830
Yeah.

860
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:50,070
Yeah.

861
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,870
And these, these are basically the nerds of Harry Potter.

862
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:55,850
Yeah.

863
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:03,280
For some reason, I'm more of a kind of jerk than a, uh, than a nerd.

864
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:05,580
Slytherin.

865
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,370
Can I find, what is this website?

866
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:09,250
Harry Potter.

867
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,850
I don't clear Slytherin.

868
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:17,770
Cause I actually read it once and it's, I mean, it's not just the

869
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,090
house of evil bastards.

870
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:19,690
I know it is.

871
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,050
No, plenty of good people came from the house of Slytherin.

872
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,050
But anyway, we would love your questions if you've taken some of these and have

873
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:31,530
some feedback, but there's little insight into our thoughts on these.

874
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:37,320
Uh, what makes us tick and click and curious to hear what you have to say about it.

875
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:38,720
It was fun talking through them.

876
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,920
I was excited to see your, uh, to finally compare our working genius results.

877
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:43,640
Okay.

878
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,240
Here you go, Alan.

879
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,440
Actually, it makes sense.

880
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:48,040
I just went to the web.

881
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:52,080
The number number one and number two for the house of Slytherin

882
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,280
resourcefulness and determination.

883
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:54,600
Yeah.

884
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:54,960
Yeah.

885
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:55,240
Yeah.

886
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:55,640
Okay.

887
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:56,480
Yeah.

888
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,520
There you go.

889
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,240
Not a bad thing.

890
00:49:58,880 --> 00:49:59,160
No.

891
00:49:59,320 --> 00:49:59,800
All right.

892
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,640
Let's call it a day.

893
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,280
I'll edit this tomorrow.

894
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:10,400
If you're on one of the three dot slack.com, you can listen to this tomorrow or wait.

895
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,080
Can you actually listen to something tomorrow ever?

896
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,680
No, you can listen to this today for you.

897
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,920
Whatever today's Friday.

898
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,080
I'm going to post this podcast edited, uh, on Saturday.

899
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,240
I got stuck a little time loop there and then it'll go live to the

900
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:27,240
rest of the world on Monday.

901
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,040
You can catch them.

902
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,000
Brent, it was fun hanging out.

903
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,680
Uh, have a good weekend.

904
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:33,200
You do the same.

905
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,120
And the three have a good weekend as well.

906
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,120
We'll see you next time.

907
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:36,920
Bye bye.

908
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,520
On AB testing podcast.

909
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,440
Bye.
