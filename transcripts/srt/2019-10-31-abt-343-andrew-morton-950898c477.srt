00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,510
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,250
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,930
Welcome to episode one of the AB Testing 343 podcast, a new podcast from AB Testing, where

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,490
we take one of our three listeners and we ask them three questions. And today I'm joined

6
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:43,070
by the testing chef, Andrew Morton. Andrew, say hello to everybody.

7
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,750
Hello everybody.

8
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:51,150
Thanks for being the guinea pig on this inaugural episode. Glad to have you here and give our

9
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,350
listeners and myself a chance to get to know you and your work a little bit better.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,430
Yeah, I'm very much looking forward to it.

11
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:06,400
So before we start, maybe there's a pre-question. I know we're going to dive a lot into what

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,700
you do, but tell us a little bit about the work you're doing.

13
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,340
So for anyone who doesn't know, I work at the Ministry of Testing. I am their Dev Boss.

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,920
So I essentially do their development for them on the website. That's at www.ministryoftesting.com.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,800
Please feel free to go and check it out. Obviously, there's a few good things on there. Alan's

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,520
made a couple of appearances and we'll be having his own course on there soon about modern

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,300
testing. So one of the advantages of being staff at Ministry of Testing is I'm going

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,260
to get to see that before it goes live. So looking forward to checking that one out

19
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,490
as well.

20
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,570
Yeah, we run Ruby on Rails. I've always been a bit of a Rubyist at heart since I

21
00:01:52,570 --> 00:02:03,140
started really picking up coding, doing web UI automation a few years ago. So now I'm

22
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,140
a tester-turned-developer, which will also come up later as to why.

23
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,980
Super neat. Yeah, I'm just going to pause and say I'm really excited about that modern

24
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:17,900
testing course coming out. And I hope everyone gets a Dojo membership and checks it out.

25
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:26,220
All right, let's get into a question, a real question. You were someone, so when I first

26
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,620
spoke about modern testing principles at Test Bash Brighton, you may have been in the audience.

27
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,630
In fact, because I had a few people and you may have said, thanks for putting a name to something

28
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,990
I've kind of already been doing. And I've heard that many, many times throughout the years.

29
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,510
And like I said, you could have been one of the people that told me that because I know now

30
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:53,870
that you were living at least some of the principles before they were codified.

31
00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:00,300
So I'm curious, as someone who has been moving towards those principles before

32
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,620
they were before Brett and I stated them and made a proclamation,

33
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,820
which ones were you living already? And which, if any, came as a revelation?

34
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,500
So probably worth just going back a little bit in my history before I started with an

35
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,980
initiative testing. I was working a company there beforehand and was one of the testing team there.

36
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:32,900
And what I was finding was we obviously were moving to try and get developers

37
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,260
testing better, getting more robust unit tests, testing in the correct places,

38
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,060
rather than just passing it all over to the testing to a new automation.

39
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,980
So that kind of part of the idea, the shifting left type thinking.

40
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:55,010
We were doing the job there. And then it occurred to me at one point that

41
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,750
I don't know how much of this was in my own head, but I always had the thought that it's all

42
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,510
fine me being a tester trying to teach developers how to test. But it kind of occurred to me that

43
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,870
they probably will listen to me more if I was a developer showing them how to test instead.

44
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,980
So if I was actually practicing what I preached and living it. So I made the move there to move

45
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:28,640
from testing role specifically to a development role. And that was a to basically build how I felt

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:37,620
software should be built, which is your developer there will test stuff. And we'll talk through

47
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,500
requirements. We'll make sure that our code is tested as much as we possibly can ourselves.

48
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,260
And I always try to not fall into the trap that annoyed me when I used to be a tester of

49
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,100
how could you even give this to over to testing when it clearly has never been done.

50
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,420
So I was always not only testing through code, but I was still using my testing and

51
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,710
exploratory testing skills to try and do stuff before, you know, before it got passed to other

52
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:16,980
eyes. And obviously, the main reason for doing that is that we believe that or the company

53
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:23,360
that believes and I certainly agreed with them that the faster feedback would be what would

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,660
improve the business. So that that part of the principle number one, our priority is improving the

55
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:38,510
business, we believe the business would be improved by developers testing better. And by testing better,

56
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:46,980
we get faster feedback, we'd be able to react to changes quicker, and be able to put good

57
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,380
quality software that our customers value in front of them as quickly as possible.

58
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,620
What about a revelation? Did you have any revelations when you saw the principles?

59
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,980
The main one that came as a bit of a revelation to me, and it will sound odd because it makes perfect

60
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:12,820
sense, is the, it's obviously Brent's favorite phrase of data science. It's the idea of, yes,

61
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:21,140
we should use, you know, we need to capture stuff for our customers to get the feedback to know what

62
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:29,220
they're going to value. But it was never kind of, I never kind of realized that that could be scientific.

63
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,670
It is always kind of expected to go through a product donut to do stuff. It never kind of

64
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:40,270
occurred to me that, well, if you've got questions, you know, you're, as a developer, you kind of got

65
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:46,220
control of the system. So you can put things in there to get those answers. So that was one of

66
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,250
the things that just never occurred to me. It makes perfect sense as soon as you say it.

67
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,570
I wish we could say that about all of the principles. As listeners know, some are a little bit more

68
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:05,250
controversial, but I like to hear they make sense. Well, it's one of the interesting things because

69
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,530
my view of principle seven and the reason why I'm seeing no longer a tester

70
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:18,530
as a role, although I still identify as a tester rather than a developer, is because

71
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm not sure that the testing role as it was being performed was needed and I was giving better value

72
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,800
by being able to develop. So, and that is the right revelation with that one.

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,200
You can let me know later, but I'm pretty happy with the way I explained that in the upcoming

74
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,760
modern testing course. And I did not make this podcast as a way to plug that course. I'm just

75
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,490
excited about it. When you get to a point where you may not need dedicated testers on the team,

76
00:07:52,290 --> 00:08:00,510
it won't be anything less than completely obvious. Like in your case, I'll be more

77
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,270
effective if I'm a developer. It's inefficient to have me focused just on testing. That's what

78
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:12,770
happens in, if you're executing on the principles and that's what principle seven means. It means

79
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,490
if you get to a point where you realize you don't need to have dedicated testers on the team,

80
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:25,420
it's not a bad thing. It's just an evolution that may or may not happen.

81
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,550
Well, a funny story that I like to tell people is that obviously at Ministry of Testing,

82
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:38,030
we have probably the highest ratio of testers to developers or anyone because if you think about

83
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,350
it, a lot of our staff came from testing backgrounds. On the flip side, we also have

84
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,910
no testers, at least certainly not anyone whose job it is to come in day-to-day and test software

85
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,300
in the sense you think about of a testing role. Whereas obviously I'm testing as part of

86
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,540
development. Our CEO Richard does a lot of user testing for confirmation of what I built is

87
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:11,340
actually what he asked for. So he does that. So yeah, it's just morally iconic in some ways.

88
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:19,500
But on the other hand, that's not unfair because we're living that principle of testing needs to

89
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:25,580
be done as soon as possible by the person best place to do it, not by farming out to a role just because.

90
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:35,440
Yes, a million percent agree. My role is currently a director of program management

91
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,920
and I still do a lot of testing. I do a lot of test coaching. Your story reminded me

92
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:52,980
vaguely. It's a stand up for a feature being ready to be released and I took one of my many

93
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,980
questions out of my quiver and I asked the team what's the worst. This is the way I was doing

94
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,700
testing. I said, so let's say we release tomorrow. What's the worst? What are the worst things that

95
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:11,280
could happen? And they did a nice job brainstorming and too nice of a job because 15 minutes later

96
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,840
they had brainstormed a bullet list of things on the board and had assigned them to people to go

97
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,800
investigate, which I think is a good thing. I was a little disappointed they haven't thought of

98
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:28,910
those things earlier, but often it's the way we can scale testing across our team and teach the

99
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,430
team the test is just ask questions about testing and it's not like they're unable to do it. You

100
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:42,190
need to plant some seeds and get people thinking a little broader about how they're making their

101
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:49,070
software. Yeah. So you're at the Ministry of Test, which is fascinating and very, very cool.

102
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:56,290
How do you apply modern testing principles in your current role? So as I say, one of the

103
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:03,920
way, basically how I like to work is test driven development. Start with, so I very much building

104
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,960
testing from the start by having a hypothesis or trying to codify in a test how I want something to

105
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,140
work and then running a test, having it fail, failing in the production side code and then

106
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:24,620
refactoring as necessary. So TDD does seem to me to fall quite nicely into the modern testing

107
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:33,220
principles from that perspective. Coming back to that data thing, we have a lot of things in there

108
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,380
that we try to capture from the pages being visited, what lessons people are viewing.

109
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:51,220
And the interesting problem with data is how do we get data that is useful without getting data that

110
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:59,020
is not private, but not stuff that people want to share. So we have to think very carefully about

111
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:06,460
what data we capture and when. So that we're not trying to just pull in everything that's either

112
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,700
A, not useful and B, that people don't want to tell us about, but also having stuff that we can

113
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,940
then act upon to improve the site so that the testers who use Ministry of Testing get more out

114
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:29,140
of it. Any others? I think it's fair to say that because as I mentioned earlier, a lot of us come

115
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,860
from testing backgrounds, so we quite often have conversations around things of how we can improve.

116
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,940
We've all been in jobs where you have retrospectives and then nothing would happen as an example.

117
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,460
So we make sure that we action stuff that we say we're going to action. So that's all kind of

118
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,060
around principle four. So we do care about the quality culture. We want to make it better.

119
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,780
We listen to feedback from users, testers, and ourselves and try and implement it. And not only

120
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:07,620
when we try to implement it, make sure we fed back on whether it's worked or not. So constantly

121
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:13,790
experimenting, constantly trying to improve. I can't see you, but I'm smiling. That's fantastic.

122
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,990
I've probably already asked three questions, but two official questions. Let me ask one more.

123
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:28,900
How did you discover the A.B. testing podcast? I came into it, I think it must have been about

124
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:38,930
the early 20s. I know that I'd discovered it after it had been going for a bit. And I went back to

125
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,410
episode one and listened all the way through. But then it was still early enough where that was

126
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,330
actually not completely not insane thing to do, but not a difficult thing to do.

127
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,090
Yeah, that's a brave endeavor. We tell most people...

128
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,610
Yeah, that's right. We're doing it now, certainly.

129
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,570
Now that's the famous traditional versus modern testing manager conversation.

130
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,940
Yeah, which was good fun.

131
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,260
Someone brought that up on the Slack group this week. And I thought, Brent was so convincing

132
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,380
because he had did that job for a long time. I thought I totally lost and had the wrong points,

133
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,780
but he played me right where we want. We played each other right where we wanted each other.

134
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,580
So it was a lot of fun. Maybe we'll do it again.

135
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:32,020
Yeah, it was all very good. There was one of those early episodes that I did particularly

136
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,460
like, because when I first joined the Slack group, they asked, what was your favorite episode and

137
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,020
why? And I definitely had an answer. Unfortunately, that answer was about four years ago. So

138
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,020
I can't remember what I gave. But certainly if I was going to answer it now,

139
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:51,940
one of my favorite episodes was the one that you did with... Well, it's actually a pair of episodes.

140
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,140
So it was the one around Slany and Webdriver and then the follow up with Hugs.

141
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,260
Yes. Yeah. It was really cool. He reached out on Twitter and asked if he could be on the podcast,

142
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,980
said, heck yeah, let's do this. And it was fun. A lot of good fun. Yeah.

143
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,840
It's one of those classic conversations where you end up going, yeah, we agree on that.

144
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,440
We agree on that. We agree on that. And it turns out the Slack disagreement was

145
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:23,010
not really that massive in the end. Right. And the main point there, and people should really

146
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:29,090
go back and listen to that. But he tried to, it was a good, he tried to draw us in by asking,

147
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,410
so should Selenium stop using selectors? Because that's my gripe because people use some really

148
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:42,260
convoluted code to try and manipulate a webpage by doing these wild selectors. And of course,

149
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:48,830
we said no, because we have millions of Selenium tests that need selectors. He can't go break them

150
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:56,910
all. And he kind of agreed that things that I didn't like were ugly. So he built a heap,

151
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,350
he finally grew into a bit of a monster. And I think in his soul, he realizes that a little bit.

152
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,940
Yeah, I can slightly laugh at it because being in the position that I'm in,

153
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:15,680
I pretty much get to create the selectors. I am in the thing. So I was doing automation and testing

154
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,560
course earlier this week, again, with Richard and Mark, who are also MOT people. I'm not entirely

155
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,240
certain why they sent me on that course, but my boss wants me to do it. That's what I did.

156
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,480
Anyway, but in there, one of the things they say is like, you know, if you're having troubles,

157
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,220
talk to developers, get stuff changed, or even better, learn to do it.

158
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,060
That's great advice.

159
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,460
And I'm lucky enough in that not only can I do it, I literally have control over it,

160
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:50,300
being the developer. So I hopefully, fairly certain, think about my code base. I don't have any horrible

161
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,300
selectors in there at the moment. But I have known some stuff in the past where

162
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:02,110
only thing I could do was something, either rather whole BX path or that is the exception.

163
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:10,110
Yes. Yes, I understand. All right. Well, that's kind of all there is to it.

164
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:18,270
Be about a 20 minute podcast. I am so happy to have you as the first one. I will do an episode zero.

165
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,950
By the time you hear this as a listener, there'll be an episode one. So maybe I shouldn't have said

166
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,510
that, but there'll be episodes coming out of this where we talk to a lot of different listeners

167
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,950
and practitioners of modern testing and kind of get an idea of how they operate in their worlds.

168
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,830
Chance to plug anything. Anything else you want to plug? Anything other than the cool stuff you're

169
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,150
doing in the ministry of testing? Unfortunately, outside of the cool stuff I do at ministry of

170
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:54,750
testing, I'm rather boring, but I am at Testing Chef on Twitter. I'm also there on the ministry

171
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,550
of testing Slack channel and the testers.chat slappers. So if anyone wants, oh, and of course,

172
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:05,150
I am on the, one of the three Slack channels as well for the other three listeners, but

173
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:08,830
most of those three know where to get hold of me. I was with two of them the other day.

174
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,910
That's all the picture. That's fantastic.

175
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,870
So I might have attested.

176
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,630
Cool. Well, but yeah, that's pretty much it. Talk to me. I'm perfectly happy to talk testing

177
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:22,590
whenever. So yeah, thanks for doing what you do. I'm, Brent and I are both huge fans of

178
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,230
ministry of test. It's awesome to have you there and awesome to have you on this podcast.

179
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,830
So yes, thank you very much. We'll cross paths again soon. I'm sure.

180
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,100
Yeah, I hope so. Thank you very much.
