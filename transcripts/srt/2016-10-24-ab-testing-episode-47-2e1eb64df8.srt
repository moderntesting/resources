1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,800
Hey everybody, howdy. Hey, I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we are here for episode 47.

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,440
47 counting down to 50. That should be this year.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,280
I know. So what should we do for our, this is a question for our listeners. What should

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,140
we do for our 50th episode? Meaning? Like anything special?

5
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:33,820
Tequila. We could actually bring in the tequila and before you suggest Naked, Brent and I

6
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:38,180
are actually naked for this podcast. And most of them prior.

7
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,300
Yeah, most of them. Most of them. Not the one with Steve.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,500
No, no. Speedos for that one. Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,100
There's a problem with recording a podcast at eight o'clock in the morning.

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,100
You don't have enough time to get sufficient caffeine.

11
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,220
I know. And I was up late. I was up a little late last night trying to get a couple

12
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:00,580
things done. So guess what, Brent? What? I bought myself a new car.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,900
Congratulations. What'd you get? It's a red car. It's got these cool falcon wing

14
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,780
doors. The back doors kind of open out and up. They're pretty cool. Up and out.

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,700
What makes it a falcon wing versus say an I don't know that that's what Tesla

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,860
calls the back doors. You got yourself a Tesla.

17
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,220
I got myself an electric car. Nice. So you already had an electric car.

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,580
No, I had a hybrid car. Oh, I still have the hybrid car.

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,060
I got rid of the we had an Audi Q7, which I hated. OK. Now there's another

20
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,780
story. That was your other. There's a story I didn't plan on telling.

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,100
So I got a Prius like I can't remember how many years ago, 2006, maybe 10 years

22
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,860
ago, and I like it. I it was perfect for me.

23
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,940
I had just enough tech to keep me excited. And my wife got this Audi Q7,

24
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,100
treated her Audi wagon and she liked it for a while.

25
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,700
She said, I don't like this car anymore. We're trading.

26
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,060
And like a good husband, I said, OK, yes, ma'am.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,420
So I drove the Q7 for a while. I didn't like it.

28
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,500
Just a little too big for me. I don't like really big cars.

29
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,220
Some people like driving around these big old monster trucks like Brent has or

30
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,940
these big old Ford exhibitionist.

31
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,420
Alan's Prius could fit in the back of my car.

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,380
So I don't really like big cars.

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,940
So the thing I love about the Model X is it's a smaller car,

34
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,740
yet it still has third row seating and it feels so much bigger inside.

35
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,540
They really did a really nice job with the cabin.

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,060
And then there's all the cool like tech, like this massive like iPad pro sized

37
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,560
screen, which is totally distracting, which has a web browser,

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,760
which you should not use while driving.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,620
No, the it's OK.

40
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,540
The sites I wanted to go to get your mind out of there.

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,700
Like our VSTS site and our product site won't load on the browser.

42
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,100
So I haven't figured out how to hack in there and send some different user

43
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,770
agent strings, but I'll get into that.

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,530
Is it already ready for the

45
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,120
the self driving?

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,440
Yeah, I have it. I have I have auto drive.

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,800
I haven't used it yet. I'm too afraid.

48
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,720
And you're really only supposed to use it on the highway.

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,240
And I haven't really driven it much on the highway.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,560
I just I just kind of drive to work and back with it.

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,460
But we're taking a road trip this winter, which you really want to use

52
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,060
the the auto drive, whatever it's called.

53
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,340
That's not called auto drive.

54
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,500
It's called something else.

55
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,980
Anyway, I'm just thinking on snowy and icy roads driving in the winter.

56
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,700
That's the best time to use it, right?

57
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,620
Absolutely. Lying.

58
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,820
Absolutely.

59
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,620
We better get in 50 before the end of the year.

60
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,620
Otherwise this can happen.

61
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,900
So I'm really enjoying it.

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,580
It's of course, it has that that massive Tesla acceleration, but it's fun to drive.

63
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,660
The kids like it.

64
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,860
My daughter, who's 10, said, Dad, can I have this car?

65
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,700
I said, yes, I'm going to give it to you when you're 30.

66
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,540
I

67
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,110
that's nice of your daughter already thinking six years ahead.

68
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,610
Yeah. Anyway, yeah.

69
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,650
Tesla is something that I will never, ever, ever own.

70
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,010
Because you like your internal combustion engine.

71
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,010
Do you want to burn some gas, some fossil fuels?

72
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,610
Someone needs to know for me in particular, it's it's the price tag.

73
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,220
So I go, hmm, I could get that

74
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,220
or I could retire a year earlier.

75
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,340
Yep. And I was thinking, I was thinking we could not get that

76
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,680
or I can work one more year.

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,040
So exact same train of thought.

78
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,680
It's like any time you make a big purchase, I kind of go, well,

79
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,560
I'll probably have to work till I'm a little older anyway, so it's fine.

80
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,020
I'll get bored if I don't work.

81
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,980
Yeah. You got your you still got college to worry about.

82
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,460
Have you got that handled?

83
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,620
I we are saving frantically for college.

84
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,820
We got the college savings plan going.

85
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,540
Unless my wife is on the we're on the total financial track here.

86
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,500
My wife is of the mind of wherever our kids want to go to school,

87
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,980
we will pay for it.

88
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,060
And I'm thinking, so well, it's too financially.

89
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:10,900
My money picture is going, no, if they want to go to an Ivy League school,

90
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,530
they better get at least a partial scholarship.

91
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:18,330
And then if you read which Malcolm Gladwell book is that I think it outliers.

92
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,090
When tells the stories of these kids, like these super straight

93
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,050
day students go to the and these are awesome students get scholarships,

94
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,130
go to these fantastic colleges.

95
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,500
And then they because they've been used to being in the top of the class

96
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,420
their whole life, but they're with a hundred other students

97
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,060
have been in the top of the class their whole life.

98
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,700
They end up being in the bottom half of the class.

99
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,620
They get disillusioned and drop out.

100
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,740
The best way to succeed and get so much this

101
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,500
involves in the Daniel Pink's work around motivation is you want to go

102
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,940
to the best school where you can be in the top part of the class.

103
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,610
You want to go.

104
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,340
Actually, this is for everybody.

105
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,700
You want to put yourself in an environment where you are

106
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,760
constantly what's known as the flow,

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,880
where the challenge level is just out of your reach.

108
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,200
And then as you improve your skill

109
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,120
that brings that challenge back into what you're capable of,

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,400
that there's a new challenge.

111
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,080
If you go just way outside, it is absolutely demoralizing.

112
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,120
I've seen this happen to so many people.

113
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,200
And you don't want to be the very top either,

114
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,680
but you don't want to be the very bottom.

115
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,840
There's there's psychological things that affect both parts of that.

116
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,200
Yeah. But also this ties into the Heffetz work,

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,720
which talks about something similar to I can't pronounce the guys

118
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,080
that wrote the flow wrote flow.

119
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,680
I can't either. But somebody will start with a C.

120
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,600
Yeah. Shmoop. Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
As far as I'm going to go.

122
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,240
But he talks about like I'll try to draw with my hands, but I can't help it.

123
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,840
But if you are complacent, your productivity and your growth is

124
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,560
minimal to nil.

125
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,320
If you are in completely over your head and overwhelmed.

126
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,880
Same thing.

127
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,080
So there's a simmering point where you're challenged

128
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,280
just enough to be uncomfortable.

129
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,600
And that's where productivity and growth come from uncomfortable,

130
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,440
but still have a sense of you need to be a little.

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,280
If I work a little harder, I can get there is a simmering point.

132
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,640
And this is true both for like in university.

133
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,240
We're talking about as well as on the job.

134
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,520
You want to keep your employees at that simmering point.

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,080
You don't want them to be complacent.

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,880
You don't want them to be overwhelmed.

137
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,560
But there's a point in between need to find for everyone

138
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,200
where you get the maximum productivity and growth. Yep.

139
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,660
Well, that actually evolved into a better conversation.

140
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,740
It did. So anyway, all from Tesla.

141
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,300
Saving lots of money for college.

142
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,460
It's all about the we have the nice car now.

143
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,940
It should last for a while.

144
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,540
We're actually on the waiting list for the Model 3, which is the cheaper version.

145
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,060
She was like like thirty thousand dollars.

146
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,300
Probably. But then if you want tires, it's 60.

147
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,760
That's a. So we're in a mark.

148
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,680
So my wife's minivan is now over 100000.

149
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,440
I haven't had a car reach 100000 miles in a long time.

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,640
Well, our priest has like one hundred and forty right now.

151
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,320
But she's she's complacent and I'm just waiting for that one big ticket item

152
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,760
where I'm like, OK, that's it. Done. Done.

153
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,310
Yeah, I don't know if electric cars going to be her thing, though.

154
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,230
All right. Anyway, I dig it. It's fun.

155
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,310
It's got the manly acceleration.

156
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,030
It's got all the tech and stuff.

157
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,110
So it's fun car drive. Cool. Cool.

158
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,150
Shall we get on with the show? Yeah.

159
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,980
Let's let's do it.

160
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh, never mind.

161
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,860
Not getting on, not getting on with the show.

162
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,700
One big thing for me, which is odd,

163
00:08:51,760 --> 00:09:00,890
is I now have an adult aged offspring and man.

164
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,130
Did they just contact you from like? No, no, no.

165
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,050
My oldest turned 18 just last week.

166
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,820
Wow. I can't imagine.

167
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,780
That transition is just odd.

168
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,060
Like one one thing. Hot mail makes sense, right?

169
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,460
But hot mail exactly at midnight,

170
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,540
sent him a message saying he's been kicked out of the family,

171
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,060
which, by the way, is a weird message.

172
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,900
But I understand why it was saying that.

173
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,380
They were saying the hot mail family feature he was kicked out

174
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,490
because now that he's 18, Dad's Dad's rules

175
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,730
don't matter as far as hot mail is concerned.

176
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,090
Oh, he can sign up for his own mailing list.

177
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,490
Yep. All right. Whatever.

178
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,230
And who uses hot mail anymore?

179
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,390
Besides your family. What do you use?

180
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,670
Are you Gmail? I have my own domain.

181
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,390
Oh, right. So now I've been telling my kids, like, look,

182
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,390
until you're 18, you're off of Gmail

183
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,630
because I know what that company does.

184
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,230
I'm not going to be morally responsible for you.

185
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,470
Screw it up.

186
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,870
So I'm six years away from having an 18 year old,

187
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,790
but counting down the days because that's when the second one turns 18

188
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,670
and it changed the locks and they're done.

189
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,110
Yeah. Changed the locks.

190
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,830
Start charging storage fees. Absolutely.

191
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,630
I tell the kids that I think I'm joking.

192
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,830
Six, seven more years. I told my parents this

193
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,600
a couple of weeks ago.

194
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,600
I said, yeah, if if Alex is still at home

195
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,140
and not going to school a year from now,

196
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,090
if he's at home and going to school, say, if he goes to UW,

197
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,470
then then that's a different thing.

198
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,510
But if he's at home and not going to school,

199
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,190
yeah, I'm charging him rent.

200
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah, my parents gave me a bill when I turned 18.

201
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,370
Did they? Seriously?

202
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,970
A joke one. But yeah, my dad said I figured out what it cost.

203
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,850
Here's what you owe us. Yeah.

204
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,890
All right. Let's get back to the podcast.

205
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,090
Oh, really? You think it's time? Yeah.

206
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:21,570
Hey, everybody, it's Al.

207
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,410
And Brett, episode 47, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

208
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:32,050
So we spent the last three episodes talking a lot about data.

209
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,530
A ton. A ton.

210
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,450
So let's talk about something else.

211
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,770
Let's let's turn this conversation back on me

212
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,970
because that's what's really important here, right?

213
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,010
Yes, it's all about.

214
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,450
I mean, you are the A. I am the A in A.B.

215
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,090
testing. So I want to talk a little bit about what's going on

216
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,490
with me and my team at Microsoft.

217
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:57,530
We are getting ready to be known at some point around the world.

218
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,130
In fact, maybe by the time of our next podcast,

219
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,450
I have to look at the calendar.

220
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:04,940
I can actually speak of our name.

221
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,980
OK. So but in the meantime, that means we're getting ready.

222
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,780
I thought it was Microsoft Juicy for Business.

223
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,860
It is Juicy Microsoft Juicy for Business Enterprise Edition.

224
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,420
It's been a fun transition.

225
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,820
This is actually a lot of things I've wanted to do on the team for a long time.

226
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,820
Now that we're about to, quote, ship

227
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,040
and become much easier in some ways difficult than this, but much, much easier.

228
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,600
So I want to go through those and talk about those a little bit

229
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,640
and then also talk about what it means to air quote ship

230
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,600
in a world where you're shipping a service or an app.

231
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,500
Maybe I'll tackle that first, because there's been a cultural

232
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,660
maybe mind shift sort of thing.

233
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,100
And maybe you've gone through this, Brent, where

234
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,100
we have a bunch of people on the team.

235
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,220
The team is a large part of the team has grown up, grown up,

236
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,540
but, you know, live their business life, shipping, shrink, rack products.

237
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,020
We're well beyond the days of going down to Egghead to buy something.

238
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,130
Some of the kids, some of the older listeners may remember Egghead Software,

239
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,850
but it's really easy for people to think of shipping as this.

240
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,090
Think of Office app.

241
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:19,270
It ships and then you have to taper down like the bugs we take

242
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,110
and have stabilization, then you get to the ship date and it ships.

243
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,470
And then you wait and see what happens.

244
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,830
Right. Very, very old school.

245
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,750
I think verbally they get that we're going to ship.

246
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,670
We're going to announce.

247
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,190
We're going to ship.

248
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,150
We're going to announce a couple of days later and then a couple of days

249
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,700
later, we're going to ship again.

250
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Let me ask you a question.

251
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,560
Yeah. Ask a question. The you said that your developer team,

252
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,740
most of their experience with ship rack products.

253
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,420
And as you were saying that I was thinking through

254
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,060
the last time I was on a product like that

255
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,620
and oh and or the last time I purchased a product like that.

256
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,140
And don't even think of it as so.

257
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,060
Ancient. But it's a it's a cultural transformation where it's not just

258
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,340
developers, it's everybody.

259
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,620
Dev PM management.

260
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,940
They have this and they know logically that we ship

261
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,540
and we ship like eight times a week now across because we have a bunch

262
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,380
of microservices as well as a web front end.

263
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,540
So we're shipping like eight times a week across these things to 10.

264
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,660
So we're shipping all the time and that's not going to stop.

265
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,630
So what's interesting is the transition of I mean, they get it like we're

266
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,670
going to ship and then we're going to ship again later.

267
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,110
But they haven't internalized it yet.

268
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,870
They don't really get the muscle memories not there.

269
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,230
Their muscle memory is still from the old days.

270
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,830
So there's been a couple of things that have been interesting

271
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,950
and I should have written them down so I get them in some sort of sensible order.

272
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,350
Or if I was a really good podcast editor, I'd splice them into the right order.

273
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,830
But none of that's going to happen.

274
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,830
So I'm going to speak randomly about some of the things that I'm doing,

275
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,910
which I feel like are getting us in the right direction.

276
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,830
And then Brent will tell me how I'm completely wrong.

277
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:04,630
And then we'll discuss and then move on to the next one.

278
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,510
Okay.

279
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,270
That's the plan.

280
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:11,790
So one mindset shift in shipping a product is,

281
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,430
Brent, you've been around the block.

282
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,510
You remember shipping your products.

283
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:15,870
Yep.

284
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:23,540
And one of the things is, is you talk about raising the bar of bugs that you'll take.

285
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,180
Don't laugh.

286
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:25,940
Let me finish.

287
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,140
Yep.

288
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:26,820
Let me finish.

289
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:31,620
There's this mindset of, well, that bugs too, that bugs too minor for the risk.

290
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,220
We're not going to take that fix.

291
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,540
It's too risky.

292
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,940
So we got to cut down.

293
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,780
We can't take, we can't, you got to cut down what bugs were taking.

294
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,940
We're taking fewer and fewer bugs.

295
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,860
We got to, where does convergence come?

296
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:52,360
So my line there after a brief amount of thought is we're going to raise a bar.

297
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,480
But the bar we raise, I mean, we're going to, cause we're going to be

298
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,720
shipping all the time, if we were to raise that bar so high before our quote,

299
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,920
ship date, our announced date, uh, what would happen after that?

300
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,520
This flurry of getting out of bars up, you have to lower it at some point

301
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,720
to let everything else in.

302
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,240
I don't want that flurry of crap coming in all at once.

303
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,190
I'll get back to the flurry of crap later.

304
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,970
So the bar of what we take doesn't change.

305
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,250
We take everything.

306
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,590
The bar, I'll get back to that in a minute, what that checklist is, but the

307
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:32,190
bar that changes is the bar of what you have to do before that code is checked in.

308
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,470
And this has given me a lever to pull that hasn't, uh, I haven't made

309
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,310
traction on until now before to check in.

310
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,790
As long as your manager signed off, you're good.

311
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,550
Check it in.

312
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,550
Woo hoo.

313
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,390
And we had in the Kia and we had instability.

314
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,510
Um, oh, shocker instability in our branch and some didn't work.

315
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,990
What?

316
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,630
Some developers, of course, better than others at getting the right, doing the

317
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,230
right due diligence before, but some people would then get in some bad code

318
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,750
and screwed up for everyone else.

319
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,020
So now that I'm re I can raise the bar of what goes in, what has to happen

320
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,140
before code is checked in.

321
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,860
So you may remember, uh, a thing at Microsoft called ask mode.

322
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,060
Yes.

323
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,460
Well, you have to ask to check things in.

324
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:25,140
And so I got a question from, this is give people what they want versus what

325
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,740
they need versus what they want.

326
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,060
Yep.

327
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,990
So I had our GPM and our VP come to me and say, when are we going into ask mode?

328
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,870
We need to go into ask mode and lock things down.

329
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,940
I thought, huh?

330
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:40,470
Yeah, I guess we should go.

331
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,310
Uh, thinking, thinking, thinking.

332
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,510
I have a plan picture, the light bulb over my head.

333
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,190
Ding.

334
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:49,440
So we're in, uh, ask mode now.

335
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,160
Yeah.

336
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,960
Immediately.

337
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,180
So, but we're going to ask mode, which ask mode means that, uh, one of the

338
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,540
PM's not the GPM, one of the PM's that he trusts and I sit together twice a day.

339
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,300
And we reviewed, we review things people want to check in and we either

340
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,500
accept them or reject them.

341
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,580
And I get to be in charge of determining what goes into the product.

342
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,540
And also through this reject things saying, no, you can't check this

343
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:16,860
in without writing tests for it or no, please test this across all

344
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,220
browsers before it goes in.

345
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,140
So all the things they should have been doing before, if they're not

346
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,500
doing, I can just reject them.

347
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,700
You are now the PO for the product.

348
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,380
And you're doing this, what's done is the acceptance review.

349
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,140
I'm the release engineer, acceptance review, or in the agile world, the PO.

350
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,700
Product owner.

351
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:34,980
Yeah.

352
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,340
Yeah.

353
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,420
So this is working.

354
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,780
So what I'm like, and I can do through that is continue to raise that

355
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,260
bar of what goes in and then stuff goes in better.

356
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,900
And then something I stole from, uh, Chuck Rossi, his release engineer at Facebook.

357
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,900
He has this idea of plenty of writing on the internet about this, about

358
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,020
developer karma, and I know that on my devs listen to the podcast so I can

359
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,140
talk about this is we took 300 changes last week.

360
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,140
Congrats.

361
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,380
Um, which is fine.

362
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,780
I'm happy taking 300, 500, a thousand.

363
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,580
It'll get less as the bar goes up.

364
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,780
They'll have to do more work.

365
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,460
The, that number will drop down.

366
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,540
They also get, keep in mind, most of these are bug fixes.

367
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,060
So I doubt, I think 300 will be our peak.

368
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,740
Usually it'll be much far, far fewer, but there were one, two, three,

369
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,460
four changes that we took out of those 300 that caused a product regression.

370
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,760
Cause they didn't do the proper testing and I signed off anyway.

371
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,560
I didn't recognize it.

372
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,240
Okay.

373
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,080
So Chuck Rossi does this thing called developer karma where in his case,

374
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
it's a four star system.

375
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,800
Everybody starts with four stars and you lose half a star.

376
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
If you screw something up like that.

377
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:42,920
Okay.

378
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,800
So I'm going to, I will give the exact numbers, but I'm going to use a 10

379
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,040
point scale and people are going to start somewhere in the upper middle

380
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,360
half of that and they'll lose or occasionally gain points that they're

381
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,840
super awesome, like, like imagine, like I, I made this small change, but I

382
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,440
noticed the unit tests were all screwed up.

383
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,240
So I wrote another 50 to cover any further aggressions in this entire file.

384
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,600
I might give them a point of developer karma.

385
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,520
And then when things get really risky, I want to look at the change,

386
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,880
the risk of the change match that with your developer karma and go, no,

387
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,880
you're going to need to do more here or I can trust you.

388
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,760
Yes, this is fine.

389
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,220
Brent's rolling his eyes a little bit.

390
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,580
Well, so I like, I like the, I definitely like the gamification aspect of, of this.

391
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:37,380
I'm curious around the, the finger pointy or the rest of the risks aspect.

392
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,220
So one of the things, and that's a good point and two things to keep in mind.

393
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,500
One is I haven't done anything with this list yet.

394
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,500
And two is this won't be a list I ever share.

395
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,580
And I won't say, no, you can't check this in because your karma is too low,

396
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,300
but it will give me, as I'm looking in the PO role, looking at these changes coming

397
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,340
in, I might go, well, Fred has had a history of, of regressions.

398
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,900
This is high risk and I don't feel like I've had the right people code review

399
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,180
this. Let me push this back and get a little bit more information.

400
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,020
I'm going to make his bar a little higher and hopefully make him a little bit

401
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,340
through that, teach him a little bit more careful about his check-ins.

402
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:15,860
Yep.

403
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,420
So, but I'm never going to share that list and stack rank them.

404
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
Uh, ever.

405
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,420
Uh, I may bring the knowledge of those, not the list, but the knowledge of what

406
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,580
I've learned to a people review.

407
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,140
Gotcha.

408
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,750
I think that's a given, but, but overall I want to teach the, uh, devs at the bar,

409
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,140
they have to the developers, the bar, they have to meet to check in code.

410
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,060
It's going to go way up over time.

411
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,570
So once we become announced, I want to do two things.

412
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,790
Uh, and I'm all over the board here, but it will make sense.

413
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,830
One is that bar will be high enough.

414
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:53,470
Like everything that goes in is well-tested and, or behind a feature flag.

415
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,440
And for people not familiar with feature flag, that means that this feature

416
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,840
is fully checked in, but there's no way for you to use it.

417
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,600
Developers and dog food users can turn it on.

418
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,640
And we have a flooding system where you can turn those things on for

419
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,080
a select set of users.

420
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,440
You can gather data about how that's working with a select set of users

421
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,900
and get that information and Brent staring at his phone.

422
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,870
Just turning off random.

423
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,430
All right.

424
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,430
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

425
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,110
Anyway, uh, things behind feature flags, uh, should go in and it should

426
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,110
not affect the rest of the product.

427
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,790
And so I forgot where I was.

428
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:33,100
No, the nice thing with feature flags as well is that if, if, um, you, do you

429
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:39,790
release it and an undiscovered regression down that code path, it's relatively

430
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,590
easy to say, okay, turn this off.

431
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,150
Yeah.

432
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,550
Right.

433
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:48,160
The, um, the thing I like about what you just described, and actually

434
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:55,270
when I am, when I'm in the role of a, of a PO, a biggest, the biggest,

435
00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:02,820
um, principle I get across is essentially, look, you guys can check in.

436
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,840
Whatever you want, but the main build must always be RTM.

437
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:10,860
Right.

438
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,980
We, you can check in whatever you want, but we have to be able to ship it at

439
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,740
any time you guys don't get to control the ship date.

440
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,540
Like my favorite teams is where I get engineering out of the business

441
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,380
of influence, the ship, the ship day.

442
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,660
That should be a business team only decision.

443
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,020
But the only way to do that is to make sure that that mean build, that

444
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,180
mean tree is always ship a bull.

445
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,590
So let me tell you another story about what we're doing and what's changing.

446
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:40,950
Yep.

447
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:48,060
So right now we are the canonical example of mini waterfall.

448
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:52,500
So let me, let me describe what I mean by that.

449
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,140
So we have our services are pretty good, but our front end is the most

450
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,580
error prone part of our product.

451
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:02,700
Uh, user facing more, at least more noticeable, more visible problems

452
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,180
and also the largest.

453
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,380
So what we do now we've done up to this point is once a week we take our

454
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,380
develop branch, which is where all this churn was going on uncontrolled.

455
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:20,160
And we take a snapshot of it to a pre-production branch and we test it

456
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,120
and dog food it there for half a week, a week or so.

457
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,640
And then release that rinse, lather repeat.

458
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,440
What I wanted to do originally when I described this, I just wanted to go

459
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,640
just get, I don't like that pre-production branch.

460
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,480
I wanted our develop branch to be high enough quality.

461
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,560
We could just take it to production.

462
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,040
Uh, and have it be less of a moving target.

463
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,080
That scared the crap out of people said, no, we need our pre-production branch.

464
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,960
We have to, where do, where do we bake things?

465
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,180
So, uh, the compromise I made is that this whole continuous deployment

466
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:03,180
thing is such a long haul to, to get people to ship it is, but I feel like now

467
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:07,740
I'm on the path there because I wanted to jump like skip a step, but mentally

468
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,300
and psychologically they weren't ready to lose the safety net of pre-production.

469
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,620
So, uh, I backed off a little bit and said, okay, we're going to keep doing.

470
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,300
So no, actually I put it this way.

471
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,460
I said, never, never mind.

472
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,560
I miss print on my part.

473
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,040
Of course we'll continue to have a pre-production branch.

474
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,160
We will continue to snap that and test that.

475
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,160
Uh, but the quality of our developer and should increase over time.

476
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,040
Well, over time doing what we're doing.

477
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,360
And what I expect to happen is, is I will do that.

478
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,280
We will take a snap, but turns, but already seeing advances there and one

479
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,320
week of this, but I imagine another few weeks to a month at the most and

480
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,880
our develop branch will be of better quality than our pre-production

481
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,000
branch ever was.

482
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,120
And once we get to the point where develop is that good, I might just say,

483
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,840
Oh, you know what?

484
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,560
Gosh, this is actually good enough to ship.

485
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,400
Let's go ahead and, and also because we have rings of deployment, let's go

486
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,440
ahead and take what's in develop and we're just going to ship that to, uh,

487
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,280
our first ring of deployment and see how things go.

488
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,120
And we'll look at data.

489
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,240
We'll look at bug reports and then we'll, and we'll just roll things out

490
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,760
through rings and see how things go and roll back as we need to.

491
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,430
So that, so that will happen.

492
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,830
I think you'll still have the, the, the safety net discussion then.

493
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,070
I think the safety net is what we call a ring zero.

494
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,480
Yeah.

495
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,000
No, no, I completely agree.

496
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,960
Of course you know that, um, this isn't a technical problem anymore.

497
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,600
This is, no, no, no, no, there are technical problems getting the rings,

498
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,560
right, and getting deployment.

499
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,440
And there is one technical part of the problem, but then get to next, but

500
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,280
you're right, it's getting people used to the mindset of that or shipping

501
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,340
and things like the bar we're moving is what has to be done before it goes

502
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,700
in, that's part of it, the bar that, uh, we don't need that safety net.

503
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,960
If we're using rings of deployment, which are also new as some of these

504
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,200
people have worked on web products before, but they haven't, for some reason,

505
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,720
they didn't do rings of deployment.

506
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,120
They flipped a switch and it went to the world.

507
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:08,880
There aren't, there aren't many teams that I'm aware of it at Microsoft,

508
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,560
even today that are doing deployment rings.

509
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,480
So it is my responsibility.

510
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,240
And there are testers in the world that say testers go out of

511
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,440
the QA business, you shouldn't be making the business decisions on when to ship,

512
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,660
but I make the business decision on when to ship.

513
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,540
It's my, it's my call from a quality perspective.

514
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,120
And so I make that call.

515
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,940
Uh, I am scared to death.

516
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,180
Now, when we are shipping to a hundred people, 500 people,

517
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,280
a thousand people flip the switch.

518
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:35,980
I'm okay.

519
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,680
Right now we have 10,000 daily active users and without rings of deployment,

520
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,760
you want me to flip that switch and we're going to, we should be at

521
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,480
a hundred thousand and probably up over a million in the next few months.

522
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,280
And do I want to flip that switch for all of them at once?

523
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,080
My blood pressure goes up just thinking about it.

524
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,640
Yeah.

525
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,400
No, you, you will, you will definitely need that to mitigate risk for sure.

526
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,640
I was thinking through your other problem and I think the way I might

527
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:13,770
try to approach that would be to, uh, Hey guys,

528
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,090
here's my numbers on the dev branch.

529
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,610
Here's my numbers on the pre prod branch.

530
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,230
Um, here's the number.

531
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,470
Does it go dev pre prod then prod?

532
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:25,750
Yep.

533
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,270
Okay.

534
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:32,770
So here's the, the regressions that have this have been escaped.

535
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,550
In other words, found in production.

536
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:42,830
Um, here's the cost of the, of the pre prod and try to weave a

537
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:50,870
story that says pre prod is or try to leave weave the analytics such

538
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,070
that any brain dead monkey looking at this would say there is no ROI for pre

539
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,060
prod, but then present it to your dev team and just simply say, all right,

540
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,530
guys, here's a bunch of numbers.

541
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,930
We're doing really effectively on this.

542
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:13,840
Now what do what changes do we do to ship faster and try to, try to set

543
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,040
the stage so that your, your dev managers are the ones that go, we

544
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,360
don't need pre prod anymore.

545
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:21,620
Yeah.

546
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:22,810
Right.

547
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,130
It'll be fun to get there.

548
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:30,800
I I'm excited about, cause there's a few people that one by one, they kind of get

549
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,280
it and there's an excitement that comes like, Oh, I call a cow.

550
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,360
I've had people come to me.

551
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,040
This is the biggest compliment I've ever gotten at Microsoft.

552
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,800
I had one of our Ems come to me and says, I feel like we're

553
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,400
shipping like 21st century software, which is rare at Microsoft.

554
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,120
Yeah.

555
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,680
Now, when I first experienced, um, continuous deployment, particularly in

556
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,400
the Kanban model, like where, where each of my guys could be shipping.

557
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,680
If you have a large enough team, at least one of your guys is, is

558
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,840
quote unquote shipping something every day.

559
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:03,640
Right.

560
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:14,280
Um, when I realized how much risk was mitigated by being able to ship

561
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,320
small things that continuously integrate.

562
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,800
I would rather ship 20 times a day than once a week.

563
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,440
Yes.

564
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Absolutely.

565
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,070
Uh, I remember that moment like yesterday.

566
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm like, this is what this does.

567
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:30,660
Yeah.

568
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,660
And there's, it's funny.

569
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,940
There's one developer on the team, one, a manager, one of my peer

570
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,660
managers who has been, yeah, I want to get to CD.

571
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,780
I want to get to CD.

572
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,060
And then I gave him my original plan.

573
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:46,070
Uh, and he goes, uh, this is a little scary.

574
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,350
The team isn't going to buy onto this.

575
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,590
So even he was a little hesitant and he was right.

576
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,910
This is a, uh, definitely a case where boiled frog seems to be done.

577
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,270
But I have a, I feel like I have a good plan in place.

578
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:56,750
It's coming along.

579
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,190
Couple of other things I wanted to talk about.

580
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:58,670
Okay.

581
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,070
One is our developers write two different kinds of tests.

582
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,030
We have, um, some unit tests.

583
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,030
Which, uh, running against a headless browser currently Phantom JS, but,

584
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,550
um, I think we're going to switch to headless Chrome here shortly.

585
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:14,750
Once it's officially available, those tests are great because they, they

586
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,630
run super fast and they can, they find a lot of functional regressions,

587
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,550
even in the web front end.

588
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:24,760
But knowing that we can't find many issues through those unit tests, we

589
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,480
also write some almost UI tests.

590
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,400
You know, my, you know, my, uh, opinion on UI tests, but there's

591
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,520
so many, there's selenium tests, which I know many people who've had very

592
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,760
good success writing non flaky selenium tests, ours are not non flaky.

593
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,960
There are, but they're not super flaky.

594
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,600
They're slightly flaky selenium tests.

595
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,410
And that's what we have pretty much right now for testing behavioral

596
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,690
and functional correctness.

597
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,250
So there's a couple, some EMs come to me and say, okay, after we ship again,

598
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,650
after the ship bait, we want to double down on writing a lot more scenario

599
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,920
tests and my answer to them.

600
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,890
So my strategy here is sort of three pronged or one prong with three curves.

601
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:07,330
I don't know.

602
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,120
But at that level, you, I tested, you know, you saw my blog posts on not

603
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,120
you didn't, but you did.

604
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,880
Uh, you, the listeners eat it on gooey schmooly.

605
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,200
I really leery of UI tests.

606
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,880
And again, selenium tests work sort of at the object models.

607
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
They're a little bit more reliable, but they're very difficult to get correct,

608
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,240
but not impossible.

609
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,760
So I would rather, uh, and I have one of the people on my team working

610
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:38,570
on making sure that the scenario tests we have are just rock solid, not flaky.

611
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:41,170
And also teaching the dev team how to write those tests.

612
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,890
Certainly possible that's going to happen.

613
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,210
But I think as far as writing those scenario level tests, that's the

614
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,810
third thing I want to do.

615
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,490
So the bottom thing I want to do is yeah, sure.

616
00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:50,490
We need more of these.

617
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,210
We call them scenario tests, these selenium tests, these end to end tests.

618
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:53,650
Sure.

619
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,130
We need a few more of those covers, some gaps, and they need to be rock solid.

620
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,450
That's the third level.

621
00:32:57,450 --> 00:32:59,090
But I wouldn't second level.

622
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,250
I wouldn't double down on that is bottom.

623
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,010
That is number three and the stack rank number two.

624
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:11,170
Moving up is because I believe in that tight dev, what we'll call

625
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,450
the inner loop at Microsoft.

626
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,290
I want more unit tests, uh, great safety net against regression.

627
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,850
Uh, you just sure you can't find everything there, but we'd need a lot

628
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:26,690
more of those only mainly because they run super fast and they're.

629
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,570
Generally super reliable.

630
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:33,130
We've in fact, I can't think of a case in the last year where we've had a unit

631
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:39,880
test fail that wasn't due to, uh, uh, faulty code, like the tests aren't flaky.

632
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,800
So, so I want to, if we're going to double down, it's there, but I don't

633
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,720
want to double down there either.

634
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,840
What I want to do, this goes back to what we're talking about three episodes ago.

635
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,080
I said, no, I want you guys.

636
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,360
We have a lot of, now we have a lot of BI telemetry in the product.

637
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
We can tell what users are doing.

638
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,800
So what I want you to do now is use telemetry to tell me whether

639
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,280
things are passing or failing.

640
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,560
And then we're going to write selenium tests that don't, this is taken

641
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,000
strictly from Brent that don't try and be the Oracle, which is very,

642
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,320
very hard to do just exercise the product and use the telemetry to figure

643
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,440
out whether things pass or failed.

644
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:14,720
Yes.

645
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,840
And when we get some of that in place, now I have even more confidence to

646
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,920
roll through rings and look for failures.

647
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:21,960
So they get there.

648
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,680
They're on board with that suite.

649
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,840
So that's going to happen.

650
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,480
It will happen very slowly, but I'm pushing down like this emphasis

651
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,000
on these end to end tests.

652
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,720
I think putting more emphasis on the right, like diagnostic telemetry,

653
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,160
and then the unit tests for that inner loop.

654
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,800
And this is our test for some, for some frosting on top.

655
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:46,320
Let me give you a, uh, a potential rallying cry.

656
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,160
We we've, we've talked about rallying cries.

657
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,320
We've talked about this in the past.

658
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,400
Oh God, take a shot.

659
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:53,800
Damn it.

660
00:34:55,300 --> 00:35:06,720
Um, um, rallying cries are critical to, to, or not critical, but extremely

661
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:14,400
helpful in solving these in these, um, non-technical, but appear to be technical,

662
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,800
but are actually people problem problems.

663
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,960
Weinberg comes back again.

664
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,120
It's always a people problem.

665
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,520
Yes.

666
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,960
Here's what I would suggest to you, right?

667
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,960
We have these deployment rings.

668
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,680
We have these feature on off switches.

669
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:47,160
I would suggest that what you want, say in six months time is a system that automatically

670
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:54,160
turns offer on features based off the telemetry being reported.

671
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,360
I like that.

672
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,880
We'll get to that, but yeah, automatic stuff.

673
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,440
So right now, another part of this change is I make the column with it a ship.

674
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,760
Yep.

675
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,200
But when I make that call, I go to our SRE, our system reliability engineering team, I

676
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
say, okay, go ahead and flip the switch.

677
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,160
And they, they actually do the deployment of the deployment and watch for their

678
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,760
monitoring dashboards and figure out when to roll back.

679
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:18,320
Yeah.

680
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
They actually do the deployment and watching a monitoring.

681
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,320
So they're my automation right now.

682
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,200
They are.

683
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:28,680
But what I'm saying is if you use that as a rallying cry and say auto on off,

684
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,430
then, um, so what, what you're at right now is where the DevOps, where the DevOps

685
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:43,270
will progress next is, uh, if you let it go this way, six, nine months from now,

686
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,750
that team's going to be flooded by a crappy TSG docs.

687
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,350
They already are.

688
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,870
And I don't remember what TSG stand.

689
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:54,750
Troubleshooting guide.

690
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,190
Right.

691
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,950
For our three listeners.

692
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:00,310
Um, so they're going to be flooded by that.

693
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:09,080
And, uh, you run the risk of your developers, um, focused on now bugs and

694
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:16,620
features, viewing, uh, instrumentation as a second class citizen and, and

695
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,300
basically saying, Hey, I wrote that TSG jock.

696
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,140
It's now DevOps problem.

697
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:26,990
I did this whole idea of it's not my job.

698
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,910
Um, unfortunately never dies.

699
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:40,610
Um, but if you can begin the path of saying, Hey, we need to have this telemetry.

700
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:47,450
You guys need to be accountable for making sure the telemetry is such that

701
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:54,610
it is being used to correctly turn off or on features as it goes through

702
00:37:54,610 --> 00:38:00,650
these deployment rings, then these DevOps guys are just looking for this new,

703
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,090
what just got turned on or off signal.

704
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,120
Yeah.

705
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,280
Definitely want to get there.

706
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,280
Great rallying cry.

707
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
And we have actually a good set of, uh, behags on my team about

708
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,600
getting some of these things done.

709
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,280
Behags.

710
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,200
The behags are the big hairy audacious goals.

711
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,640
What book is that from?

712
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,060
That's from, uh, God, uh, I forget which book it's from a book.

713
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,780
I read like 10 years ago.

714
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,220
Okay.

715
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,420
Sounds cool.

716
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,820
Anyway, definitely want to get there, but it's fun because a lot of these things

717
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,860
I've wanted to do for a long time, but the, the circle back to the beginning of

718
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,540
this conversation is the process of becoming a public app and quote, shipping,

719
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:41,700
whatever that means, uh, has allowed me to finally get over the edge on

720
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,700
many of these things.

721
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:48,020
It's like now people see the reason or I have a way to roll these things out.

722
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:52,100
One last thing to talk about is, uh, a lot of this from some from a doc.

723
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,460
I wrote on our branching strategy.

724
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:00,220
People asked me in the traditional Microsoft world, what you do is you

725
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,660
would create getting close to shipping.

726
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:07,200
You create a release branch and then everybody would party on the old branch

727
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,400
and then you try and merge them back together after your release.

728
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,640
Hatred.

729
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,800
What that would mean in a product like this is we would quote ship and

730
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,440
we would never ship again or not for months.

731
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,920
We'll try to get everything to merge back correctly.

732
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,360
Right.

733
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,000
So again, I said right off the bat, we ship out of develop.

734
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,970
And so what do we do with our, what about the, our stuff?

735
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:31,610
That's not going into our V one launch.

736
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,450
I said, well, if it's behind a flag, check it in.

737
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,650
If we really don't want it till later, uh, maybe it's a, for whatever

738
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,290
reason, uh, do it in your branch.

739
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:45,110
They go, well, how do I merge it?

740
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:52,750
I teach them how to use get, so what I sat is another interesting thing here.

741
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:56,670
I've, I've, you know, I've worked in windows-ish products for a lot of my

742
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,950
career, so I'm, and I'm sort of a command line guy.

743
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,950
My first automation ever was lots and lots of batch files.

744
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:06,910
I've had to give multiple tutorials on the team on how to use the get command

745
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,870
line because they use like visual studio.

746
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,550
And my role with get is never trust the GUI tools.

747
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,950
Just use the command line.

748
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:21,190
There is a couple of good tools on top of get that are fantastic.

749
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,950
I don't trust.

750
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:22,990
Yeah.

751
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:29,110
The command line, at least on get, so I'm usually a GUI guy, but when it comes,

752
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:37,200
when it comes to source control management, um, I'm definitely a command

753
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:44,240
line guy right now cause I need to be sure that I'm doing exactly what I think

754
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:51,640
I'm doing and, uh, a lot of the GUI tools on particular get for me, it's confusing.

755
00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,100
I just want to make sure that they are, have a merge plan and pattern that

756
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,500
will help them be successful in a branch.

757
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,810
And one of the things that I worry about and they rightfully worry about is, well,

758
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,410
how long do I keep the stuff in a branch?

759
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,090
And I don't like long, long running branches, although with the right plan, you

760
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,010
can keep things merged and in sync with the develop branch, so you're not.

761
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,050
So when you have to merge back, it shouldn't be a problem.

762
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:27,530
Those things are possible, but again, feature flags for merge to develop

763
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,570
frequently behind a flag, get your code in there.

764
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,770
If you're worried about things diverging too much, but get it behind a flag.

765
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,920
But you're going through is risk retraining, right?

766
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,440
The people above you know the rules for managing risk.

767
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,360
And they're like, this is to the right.

768
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,400
It, the concepts of ask mode and, well, I call it ask mode.

769
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,680
It's just, it's just release management.

770
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,390
No, but it's asked mode, right?

771
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:01,350
I wouldn't be surprised if you, if someone above you recently has talked

772
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,430
about bug jail or any of these bug jail hasn't come up.

773
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:08,350
In fact, one thing that's come from this is I should talk about one of the

774
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:12,390
thing is we have still, I believe in the popcorn, popper theory of shipping

775
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,070
software mostly.

776
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,390
So the popcorn, popper theory is you've made popcorn before.

777
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:21,230
And whether it's the microwave or Jiffy pop, same metaphor works.

778
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,070
The popcorn is popping like crazy.

779
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
Where it's work coming in, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, bugs coming in.

780
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,320
We're going to fix those right away.

781
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,680
Pop a pop and the end, it starts popping slower pop pop pop.

782
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,640
And there's a fine line between getting the most popped kernels

783
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,040
and burning your popcorn.

784
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:38,640
Yep.

785
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,600
That's when you ship.

786
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,280
So we have an income.

787
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,440
We're still popping, not super hard popping a reasonable amount, but we're,

788
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,840
but our fixed rate is higher than our incoming rate.

789
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,640
And it's all good.

790
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,880
But one thing has come from this is for a long time.

791
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,400
I've been trying to get to, I was close a little while back and then things

792
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,640
went off the rails of, of how many old bugs we have.

793
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:07,800
And right now we are almost on top of keeping our, basically our bugs older

794
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,120
than three days at zero.

795
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,640
We have like 15 right now.

796
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,920
Good.

797
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,760
So my goal and the book again, buy off on this as we get that to zero, we keep it

798
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,040
to zero and the line I'm using to explain it is if as long as fixed

799
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,400
rate exceeds accepted rate, that indicates, so the number of bugs are fixing

800
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,200
is more than the number we're coming in.

801
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,360
That indicates that we can take on more feature work.

802
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,640
Yes.

803
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:45,090
No, I, I would, I wouldn't approach it that way, but that's fine.

804
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,320
The way I approach it is bugs take precedence and when the bugs are dead,

805
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,400
yeah, then you use your available resources, potato potato works.

806
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,280
Right.

807
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,650
Um, it's been great though.

808
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,010
The point is that getting to this point and trying to working with their definition

809
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,170
of shipping versus my definition of shipping, uh, we've been able to get that

810
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,850
number close to zero and, and with the goal of getting it to zero.

811
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:08,770
So I feel good about that.

812
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:15,440
And once, and then with the added dynamic of we're shipping all the time after that

813
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,880
they understand the importance of keeping that at zero.

814
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:19,360
Yes.

815
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,440
You were talking about deployment models.

816
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,400
Have you, did you ever go and look up?

817
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
It's all public domain knowledge.

818
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:33,320
Uh, the safe version of the deployment model.

819
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:37,880
I read through that a long time ago, maybe a year, a year and a half ago,

820
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,520
but I don't remember it.

821
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:44,620
In a nutshell, version three, oh, a safe there's now a four.

822
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,940
Oh, so I, I haven't reviewed the four content.

823
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,580
And then they make big changes as they learn new things and learn better strategies.

824
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:01,590
There's essentially three branches, maybe four, four, we'll go with four that there's

825
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:04,350
the, the private dev branch on their machine.

826
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:06,910
Then there's the official dev branch.

827
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,430
Then there's the integration branch.

828
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:12,030
And then there is the RTM branch.

829
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,120
Okay.

830
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:20,300
So devs continuously taking it from their, their personal machine branch and

831
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,480
integrating into the dev branch man.

832
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,960
In the safe model, um, you have two weeks sprints and then you have a

833
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:36,090
system integration team, um, two weeks sprints, the dev team, uh, then demos

834
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,370
at the end of that sprint.

835
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:41,210
Uh, this is easily adaptable to more of a Kanban model.

836
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:47,110
I'm just communicating it from a scrum model every two weeks, dev then

837
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,710
demos, what they are checking into the dev branch.

838
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:52,590
Okay.

839
00:45:53,190 --> 00:46:01,840
The system integration team, their job is to, um, the weeks where the dev team

840
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,520
isn't demoing the system integration team is demoing the off weeks.

841
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,130
So dev's going every two weeks.

842
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:13,010
So then it would be dev demo system, demo, dev, demo system, demo.

843
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:13,570
You follow?

844
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,290
I get it.

845
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:14,530
Okay.

846
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:21,810
The system integration team is then accepting these check-ins.

847
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,860
These change lists and they will take a change list at a time, integrate it

848
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:34,440
into their integration and determine whether or not that gets rejected

849
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,320
or moves up to the RTM branch.

850
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:42,050
Anything that gets rejected, the integration branch gets reset to the

851
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,530
current version of the RTM branch.

852
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,080
And then the next change list is incorporated and quickly tested.

853
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:56,320
So then what ends up happening in this case is your RTM branch is always RTM.

854
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:04,560
And, um, this integration team, their purpose in life is to

855
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,030
reject as fast as possible.

856
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,820
So they're highly focused on proving that this didn't integrate correctly,

857
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,800
but as fast as possible.

858
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,800
So you don't see much like you were talking about with these scenario tests.

859
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:28,880
You see these scenario tests, um, uh, trying to be lean, uh, highly focused,

860
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,320
enabling this, this code to filter through.

861
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:39,900
Um, you don't want to be overly pentak or pedantic on, on, um, blocking

862
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,820
regressions, because then you just turn into a waterfall team with this.

863
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,140
Yeah.

864
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:46,920
This is, I get how it works.

865
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,460
It seems a little waterfalling.

866
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:56,860
Um, but I get, I get how it's not and how it maybe is.

867
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:03,280
There's a lot more structure in up on the safe documentation in terms of how to,

868
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,120
how to assure that this doesn't become a waterfolly process.

869
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:17,600
Um, the role of this branch is primarily to, um, enforce Dev's

870
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,400
behavior of what you expect from the lower branches.

871
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,040
Okay.

872
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:21,840
I get it.

873
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,840
I'm going to read through it because I have a plan now that I like, but I'm

874
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,080
always looking at adjustments as needed.

875
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:36,960
This model, along with the idea of a feature keys, I think is a, is a

876
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,720
good way of blocking risk.

877
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:41,140
All right.

878
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,260
So this is a nice segue.

879
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:45,340
So we talked about everything from the Dev side, release engineering.

880
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,540
We haven't talked about, uh, a little bit through the PM role in this.

881
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:50,380
I want to jump to that.

882
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:57,200
And then, and to kick that off, we'll do that from the mailbag.

883
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:06,870
So on the Slack channel, one of the three dot slack.com.

884
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:07,870
Yes.

885
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,830
Let us know if you're not a member, let us know.

886
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,910
And, and we'll add you to it.

887
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,430
There's a lot of great content, a lot of great questions

888
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:16,670
that don't appear on the air.

889
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,310
We have a new member on the Slack channel, Marcus, welcome Marcus.

890
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:30,620
And he asks, I'm working with a team that is totally on board with going to a more

891
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:36,150
sustainable quality models, such as unified engineering, though the PMs are more

892
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,990
conventional and want to know how much longer it will take for features.

893
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:45,310
If devs are testing and prioritizing bugs over feature dev, they really want to

894
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:50,380
be able to plan a soft launch and set expectations with leadership and are

895
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:59,320
unfamiliar with continuous delivery and no shut down, uh, polished phase at the end.

896
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:04,310
Do you have any experience advice on how to tackle this?

897
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,120
I think we've probably both been through this.

898
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,240
I'm still in it now.

899
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,520
RPMs on my team still very much live in the must plan.

900
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,560
Let's look at capacity and we'll plan for that.

901
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,960
And they try and put in, and they do a reasonable job.

902
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,640
They put in test work as part of the monthly backlog as along with the dev work.

903
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,390
There's a couple of things wrong with that.

904
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,080
And I'll let you have probably a lot better ideas here, but what's the

905
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:34,120
quote predicting things as hard, especially about the future?

906
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:34,960
Yes.

907
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:41,520
So I think test estimates tend to be just as inaccurate as dev estimates.

908
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,160
But unfortunately what happens if, uh, what I've seen is you, when the

909
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,080
dev estimates go haywire, they just go, okay, we're not going to get the test work.

910
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,610
Not always in some cases.

911
00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:00,080
So, um, the challenge in that transition to me is going from.

912
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:03,040
So by the way, that was actually one thing that's interesting, right?

913
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,240
Cause the PMs are saying, how much longer is it going to take to produce

914
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,360
these features if dev owns the testing?

915
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:10,400
Right.

916
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,840
They, um, in the prior world, right?

917
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:18,320
If tests on into testing, it's all, um, right.

918
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,640
You're just shifting who's doing the work.

919
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:20,880
Right.

920
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,840
The same works happening.

921
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,560
The same works happening, right?

922
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,720
But now PM has this view it's going to take longer.

923
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:33,320
And I think that's interesting because, um, it almost articulates a belief

924
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,840
that I believe PMs have had.

925
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:36,760
I don't need tests to ship.

926
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:45,510
So now what what's happened is this, this hot path to ship has been eliminated

927
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:48,750
from, from PMs repertoire.

928
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,350
It's no longer in their toolbox.

929
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:51,810
Yeah.

930
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:54,580
My, all that's true.

931
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,060
Right.

932
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:00,780
And I don't know if you're going to, uh, to answer the question or try and answer

933
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:05,130
it, I don't think without actually doing any of the testing or any of the

934
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,690
development, I don't think you're going to know how much longer it takes.

935
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,010
This is why we do iterations and learn from them.

936
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,970
So pick a chunk of work that you think can fit into a two week iteration, you

937
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:18,770
know, stack rank, because it gets done in order and which includes things

938
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:23,970
being test complete and see how long it takes, see what your, what your

939
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:29,690
throughput is for if things are to be completely developed and done.

940
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,580
The completely agree.

941
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:33,220
Right.

942
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:39,360
Um, the, the, the first thing is to measure the, in Kanban, the, the thing

943
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:46,300
I really like about Kanban is essentially once work starts in two weeks, once

944
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:51,460
work starts in between now and two weeks from now, that work will be completed.

945
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:56,430
That's that is a commitment that my team has made, but with PM engagement,

946
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,710
they are often more concerned with.

947
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,230
Well, right.

948
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:05,470
But I want to know when this item that's 10, two weeks iterations from

949
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,630
now is going to be done because I need to set commitments.

950
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:17,140
With operating the, this is another one of those paradigm shift changes where

951
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:24,820
people are, um, used to setting and resetting expectations on a six month

952
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:37,130
cadence and what I found is once I get, can get them to trust my model, that

953
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:42,570
the, the way I'm going to execute differently and realize that they can

954
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:49,180
trust that that cadence, um, then PMs will turn over and find out that this

955
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,620
model is actually more valuable to them.

956
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:57,680
The challenge with their model is they want to set expectations for six months

957
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:04,140
from now, but in one month from now, when we realize that there's this P two

958
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:09,930
thing that we now have to do, um, because of the learnings of what we just

959
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:17,250
shipped, their model doesn't account for really changing these downstream

960
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:18,930
it expectations.

961
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:25,530
It really creates the world where you're trying to compress features into

962
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,610
a much tighter timeline than you should.

963
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:33,050
Um, so another shift that happens.

964
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:40,900
That's been interesting for me to observe is, uh, the traditional PM is, you

965
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,780
know, they want to own the feature and the schedule and be, and then the

966
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,220
coordination and all these things.

967
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,420
There's much less of that to do in the new world.

968
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:56,930
I just turned the corner now where, um, uh, our PMs, what I tell our PMs is you

969
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:00,270
can make sure you understand what the features are based on cut, not what you

970
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,830
think is cool or not with the VP.

971
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:07,820
Thanks, but customer, you know, feedback, and then groom and re prioritize

972
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:10,980
that backlog we can't, there's no way we can predict what we're going to do

973
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:16,020
three months from now, but if that, you know, you basically can figure out our

974
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,540
throughput and you can figure out, uh, the prioritize backlog and get an idea

975
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:25,570
of when things will show up, but we need to, part of the shift is getting

976
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,610
out of the habit of thinking you actually know what you're going to be

977
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:29,690
doing three months from now.

978
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:36,250
The challenges is a lot of these PMs have been making promises, right?

979
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,930
And that's the thing that you got to, what they view is a commitment, a PM

980
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:47,050
who owns delivering to your team feature requirements, um, who doesn't own

981
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:53,440
the schedule can actually be more harmful, but you have to get rid of that.

982
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:58,080
If you want to get out of the waterfall world, what I mean by more harmful

983
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,080
is, okay, now I just deliver feature requirements.

984
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,320
I have no accountability to the schedule.

985
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,760
Therefore that's your problem.

986
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,480
Figure it out.

987
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:07,910
Right.

988
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:14,590
Which is not, you want them invested in the overall team success, not just be

989
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:18,830
the guy on the Hill, um, making demands.

990
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,110
Yeah.

991
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:25,490
Going back to say for the thing I found that works best for me in terms

992
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:33,440
of getting them aboard on the journey is, uh, what's known as WSJF weighted

993
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:40,200
shortest job first, and I basically say, Hey, we can adjust my schedule every

994
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,960
week, once a week, we can adjust it.

995
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,840
Um, but only on the work that my team hasn't started.

996
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,210
So if they started it, that's going to go to completion in terms of the next

997
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,330
stuff that's up, you can change that.

998
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:56,290
How you feel with one condition.

999
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:01,410
I want to make sure that we are in agreement that this next set of list

1000
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:09,240
is the highest ROI, which means business value that we predict over the estimated

1001
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,400
cost, right?

1002
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,200
So they bring, they bring the business value equation.

1003
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,520
There's a way to objectify this.

1004
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,880
I bring in the cost equation.

1005
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,800
We have a discussion and then we, um, we iterate and we try to do

1006
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,960
this on a weekly basis.

1007
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:25,520
Cool.

1008
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,120
Yeah.

1009
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,880
So I'll loop back to the question real quick.

1010
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,580
Uh, we're actually talking about the question.

1011
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,660
One blunt way to answer the question is going back to what you said is the same

1012
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,100
amount of work done by different people.

1013
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:40,920
So how much longer we'll take a ship it on one hand, it should take exactly

1014
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,320
as long because the same work is happening.

1015
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:48,600
On the other hand, it could take longer if developers are learning how to test.

1016
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:53,400
But on the other hand, the game of, of what I call bug ping pong where the

1017
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,600
developer says, here's my code test says, here's a bug developers says, here's a fix

1018
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:01,040
test that didn't work that ping pong game is very inefficient.

1019
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,640
And if you get rid of that, it should take less time to ship.

1020
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,420
So the, so it's all boils down to iterate, learn and repeat.

1021
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:17,130
I think in the long run, it's faster, but as things come up, as people learn

1022
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:21,450
things, there may be some time in the first few, uh, sprints where it takes longer.

1023
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:24,690
In the first few sprints, it will, it will take longer.

1024
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:30,370
Uh, the best advice I have in this particular situation, uh, particularly

1025
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:35,770
if you're going to go with a unified engineering model is essentially give

1026
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,570
many, I blogged about this.

1027
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:39,090
Maybe we, I could dig that up.

1028
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,810
You give the dev team a 75, 25% rule.

1029
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:49,690
You give the test team at 25, another 75, 25% rule.

1030
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:56,500
And then you give, uh, the, the new leadership teams in this unified

1031
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:02,780
engineering model, a timeline where you expect both the dev and test to,

1032
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:05,820
to come to a 50 50.

1033
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,700
Now, what the hell am I talking about?

1034
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:08,700
Dev.

1035
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,340
I wonder that every time we talk.

1036
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:17,500
Dev, your job is going to be 75% dev, 25% learning how to improve

1037
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,940
your testing from the get go test.

1038
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:30,480
Your job is going to be teaching dev how to do testing and 25% how to do coding.

1039
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:37,560
And the trick for a manager in, in this aspect is to figure out an aggressive,

1040
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:44,440
but achievable flow going back to a book ending our topic, such that these guys

1041
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,680
merge their skill set and their knowledge into one amorphous unified engineering

1042
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:59,850
blob, they both need to teach the other side how to grow and become a unified team.

1043
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:00,770
Perfect.

1044
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,730
I hope that answer is good, Marcus.

1045
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:04,730
Yes.

1046
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:05,530
All right.

1047
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,360
I'm still Alan.

1048
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,640
And I am Brent.

1049
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,560
We'll see you next time for episode 48.

1050
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,200
Bye guys.
