1
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,460
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,460
Hello.

3
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,180
Hey, we are back for the Jack Bauer version of A-B testing.

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,460
Jack Bauer, 24?

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,460
We're gonna do this for 24 hours?

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,860
Episode 24.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,700
Oh, I get it.

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,380
We're gonna do it for slightly less than one hour

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,180
because we're not as hip and cool

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,540
and as awesome as Jack Bauer.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,460
No, but I'm fairly certain we could do a 24 hour session.

12
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,620
Not that I want to.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:44,620
No, the days of me staying up for 24 hours are all done.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,140
Why does Jack Bauer never sneak a catnap in there

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,580
or a bathroom break?

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,180
He's got 24 hours, man.

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,020
He's pumped on adrenaline the entire day.

18
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,620
He's a rock star.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,660
But you're up all night.

20
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,060
Reminds me of a situation just last night.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,540
This doesn't work very well for the podcast,

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,020
but let me show you a picture.

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,540
Oh my God, don't show me that picture.

24
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,380
No.

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,220
Oh wait, there's a picture.

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,480
So this is my younger son.

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,440
He's fallen asleep at the computer desk

28
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,520
sitting in the chair.

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,270
I have never seen him do this before.

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,390
And last night we signed up.

31
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,550
We signed him up for the Khan Academy

32
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,750
introduction to a JavaScript program.

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,430
All right, so I was gonna ask you.

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,550
It's cranking out some code.

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,550
Yeah, it's like, oh my God, I totally remember those days.

36
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,550
Yeah, just code till you can't sleep.

37
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,270
All right, dad walked out.

38
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,110
Do we mean today?

39
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:48,110
Do we set our world record for the quickest time

40
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,990
to hit a tangent in a podcast?

41
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,740
We've done it before the podcast has started,

42
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,660
so I don't know.

43
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,860
All right, we do our best.

44
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,500
Hey, so do we introduce ourselves?

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,980
I'm Brent.

46
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,280
I'm not, because I'm Alan.

47
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,260
And we're here for episode 24 as you figured out.

48
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,900
And shall we get started with our list?

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,020
Yeah, so have you done anything interesting?

50
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,820
Those last couple weeks?

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,060
No, I sat around.

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,420
Hey, I just, not just just, but just,

53
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,620
just got back from Canada.

54
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:26,460
I left on Sunday up to Vancouver, BC.

55
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,860
Sat in a long line at the border,

56
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,300
got to our hotel, took the whole family up.

57
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,060
How was the border crossing though?

58
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,900
It's not too bad.

59
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,620
It was about 40 minutes going across,

60
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,300
but it was the end of the weekend.

61
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,260
Maybe 20 minutes coming back, not too bad.

62
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,140
I haven't been to Canada in like 10 years.

63
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,700
I like Vancouver.

64
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,540
It's nice.

65
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,420
We had Monday off.

66
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,260
What did we do?

67
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,180
We sat by the pool and did nothing, I think.

68
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,620
I took a little bit of time to tweak some presentations

69
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,620
because on Tuesday, I gave a three and a half hour tutorial

70
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,220
covering a variety of topics

71
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,660
around building your testing toolbox.

72
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,780
And then went out and had dinner with the fam.

73
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,720
And then Wednesday was exhaust Alan day

74
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
and a keynote at 8.30 in the morning.

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,120
Had to get there at 7.30 for a little sound check.

76
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,480
That the keynote went really well.

77
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,720
I had a good time.

78
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
I think the points really resonated

79
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,200
and it hit a lot of the concerns or the gripes people had.

80
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,160
Or it could just be that Canadian audiences

81
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,520
are just very, very polite.

82
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,600
I'm not sure.

83
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,200
They're known for being polite.

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,460
Yeah, but it was a good time.

85
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,600
I really enjoyed that talk.

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,120
And then had a little bit of a rest

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
while I quickly tweaked my slides from my

88
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,440
inside the mind of the 21st century customer talk,

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,960
which was really just a deep dive

90
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,080
into a couple of the things that I talked about

91
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,560
in the keynote in the afternoon.

92
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,860
And weirdly and oddly and probably disturbingly,

93
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:55,880
there were some people who went to all three of those talks.

94
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,720
Like at some point I get sick of myself.

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm not sure why you would,

96
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,640
I have people come up to me and say,

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
hey, I'm sorry, I didn't,

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,960
I really enjoyed your tutorial and keynote.

99
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,080
I'm sorry, I didn't go to your other session.

100
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,900
I said, if you would have went,

101
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,160
everyone was there that I saw already twice.

102
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,640
I was a little creeped out about, so that's cool.

103
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,440
And then if that wasn't enough.

104
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,160
I guess it's an important lesson to mix up your content.

105
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,000
I suppose, I suppose.

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,480
Yeah, something new to the people.

107
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah, hindsight's 20-20.

108
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,400
I had a little bit more time

109
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,200
and then I was part of the Lightning Strikes the Keynotes

110
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,760
where I gave a Lightning talk, five minutes,

111
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,560
which I put together.

112
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,960
Lightning talks started at 4.15.

113
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,160
I have my slides completed at four o'clock

114
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,880
because I started them at 3.48.

115
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,620
Made it quickly, made a top 10 list of-

116
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,220
You didn't publish your Lightning talk.

117
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,580
No, because they were silly.

118
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,440
I did, people tried to be, I had no offense to them.

119
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,820
Some people were very serious in their,

120
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,060
trying to get a real message across in five minutes.

121
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,460
After having given a tutorial, a keynote,

122
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,900
and a track session all within 24 hours,

123
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,540
I decided that I would do something a little lighthearted,

124
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,020
did a top 10 list of things I heard at Star

125
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,820
and just had some fun.

126
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,260
Had some good things in there too.

127
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,460
What was number one?

128
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,860
Number one, is test dead.

129
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,960
Okay, what was number two?

130
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,300
How far down we had to go to get to something

131
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,300
that we haven't heard before?

132
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,660
A lot of things we had heard before,

133
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,980
but reiterated some of the talks I had seen,

134
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,500
some of the conversations I had seen,

135
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,180
plus a few fun ones thrown in there.

136
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,100
Not important, don't wanna dwell on it.

137
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,340
So went out for dinner again with the family

138
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,540
and that was Wednesday night.

139
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,720
And we got up Thursday morning,

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,780
had yet another awesome brunch at the hotel

141
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,940
and drove back and dropped me off at work,

142
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,350
around two-ish, and tried to get caught up on the day job,

143
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,290
which I've, I just started this job and I think.

144
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,530
Wait, let's not go into that one.

145
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,570
I'm not done with Star Canada.

146
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,410
Well, we can bounce back.

147
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,090
We can play a little ping pong.

148
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,610
I spent the morning and I went through your slide decks.

149
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,310
Brandt, my post editor.

150
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,280
Sure.

151
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,780
Well, we had the...

152
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,880
Let me just tell you, for those of you

153
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,720
that are not watching the video feed,

154
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Brandt has notes written down that he's taken

155
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,800
while reviewing my slide decks post-presentation.

156
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,560
For now, he will grill me on some questions

157
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,120
on why I used a non-serifed font

158
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,040
on slide 33 of my keynote.

159
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,720
No, I thought serif was an excellent choice for slide 33.

160
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
All right, excellent.

161
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,960
First and foremost, I'll say your slides were gorgeous.

162
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,360
I make beautiful slides.

163
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Yeah, my absolute favorite were the ones where you were,

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,920
you didn't have the text in your notes,

165
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,840
but based on how you and I have talked about on AB,

166
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,160
it was very clear the message,

167
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,440
and the one where you had the picture of the Avengers

168
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,440
and the champions of quality, followed by the last defense,

169
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,720
followed by the janitors.

170
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,700
I'm like, I could talk to these slides.

171
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,540
I have no idea.

172
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,380
Right, the whole line there is like,

173
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,740
we are the champions of quality.

174
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,860
We're the last line of defense.

175
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,300
Do you know who else is the last line of defense?

176
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,500
These guys with shovels and buckets.

177
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,650
I didn't understand, you had one slide

178
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,250
that had Bieber on it, and I'm like,

179
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,210
I don't understand the Bieber reference here.

180
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,100
Well, let me tell you, Justin Bieber is Canadian.

181
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,460
Oh, that wasn't the point.

182
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,900
The point is, is that whole slide,

183
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,660
I had two slides just trying to emphasize,

184
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,020
not just how, we've talked here about how much has changed

185
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,740
in the way we develop software since I wrote that book.

186
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,300
It's been dramatic, but that's happened for,

187
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,220
it hasn't happened because of fate.

188
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,060
The world has changed massively

189
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,260
in those last seven years.

190
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,500
The iPhone came out in 2007.

191
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,100
Netflix announced streaming in 2007.

192
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:57,220
Israel, I started writing the book in January 2007,

193
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,300
Justin Bieber was not around.

194
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,660
It was a world without Bieber.

195
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,980
It was also a world where Blackberry was relevant,

196
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,100
and I made this crack, and on that slide also

197
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,700
is the Blackberry, and I said Blackberry was relevant,

198
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,530
and it got a lot of laughs, and then I felt bad

199
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,050
because I found out later there was someone

200
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,610
there giving a talk from Blackberry.

201
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:19,690
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

202
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,530
I'm such a shithead.

203
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,830
Hey, you know what?

204
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,510
The other thing too, like on test is dead.

205
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,620
It reminds me, there's one of my mentees

206
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,980
that I've been helping with in the last couple of months

207
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:45,740
has had an issue where they are in

208
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,660
sort of a real data science team,

209
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,940
not one of these things that you see in Windows.

210
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,540
Not one of the ones with air quotes.

211
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,060
Right. Right, okay.

212
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,820
But they're doing mostly data engineering work right now,

213
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,140
and that's not their talent,

214
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,020
and it looks like they might be on route

215
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,420
to not receiving a positive review message.

216
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,360
Well, let's just do it without.

217
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,040
And so I've been working through,

218
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,120
and the question around is test dead?

219
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,560
This is what triggered this thought,

220
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,800
and then looking at your slides

221
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,960
and knowing sort of what your message was.

222
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,980
It's one of those things where test is not dead,

223
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,860
testing is not dead,

224
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,760
but I firmly believe testers are dead.

225
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,720
Well, somebody whose role is entirely that,

226
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,360
and there will be people,

227
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,800
I'll leave out names because they'll get all huffy,

228
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,160
but there will be people who will vehemently

229
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,480
disagree with us, but I think they're wrong.

230
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,800
It's a probabilistic discussion, right?

231
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,340
Cobalt is not dead.

232
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,020
True, true. But it is.

233
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,980
Well, did you catch, one of the things I'm really,

234
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,620
I'm gonna blog, the next thing I'm gonna blog about is,

235
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,060
it's one section of my slides where,

236
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,020
I'll see if I can walk through it.

237
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,420
There are people, and for a long time,

238
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,980
I believe this too, software was made by

239
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,700
this sort of triad of people.

240
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
They were mostly, they were developers and testers

241
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,580
and some sort of PM, whether that's project manager,

242
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,820
program manager, whatever.

243
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Those three groups make software.

244
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,700
And they are exclusive, like you do this,

245
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,900
you do this, you do this.

246
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,860
What else would you need?

247
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,900
But more and more we realize,

248
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,620
especially as there are no titles,

249
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,080
it makes it easier to see, or not no titles,

250
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,040
a single title, is that there are a dozen,

251
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,200
or two dozen, or 50 things,

252
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,920
50 skills you need to make great software.

253
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,360
So that's actually where I have the pie charts

254
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,440
of showing dev stuff, PM stuff, test stuff

255
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,600
for the remainder.

256
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,640
And that's not really not true.

257
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
What's really true is this pie chart

258
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,160
that shows 20 different things

259
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,320
of things that go into making software.

260
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
And part of those are tester skills.

261
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,680
But if you're gonna say,

262
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,640
if you need to have a software tester,

263
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,280
you're also gonna have a,

264
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,040
you're gonna have specialists all over the place

265
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,000
and as you know we believe in specializing generalists,

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
generalizing specialists.

267
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,680
I think tester skills absolutely will be needed

268
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,620
forever and ever and ever and ever.

269
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,200
But that may not be what you're called

270
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,040
or what you would do all the time.

271
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,280
No, the thing is when someone comes up to me

272
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,260
and they ask, is test dead?

273
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,820
Generally I've noticed that what they're really doing

274
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,360
is they're saying, hey, is my career screwed?

275
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
And unlike what you do in our approach

276
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
when these type of things,

277
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,280
what you said in your slides,

278
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,680
I agree, because you said testing is not dead.

279
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,780
But the thing I want these people to understand,

280
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,850
if listening to Ellen's message

281
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,010
leads you to have hope that you don't have to do

282
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,110
a career change or consider it, you're wrong.

283
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,150
Well, when I talked about the pyramid,

284
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,570
which was also in my last,

285
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,550
this is something I brought up in our-

286
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,510
You understand my point there?

287
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,430
Yeah, I do, I do, I do.

288
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,650
And I'm going somewhere with this,

289
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,150
just ticking along the way to get there as usual.

290
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,230
When I interviewed for my current job,

291
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,430
which we'll talk about a little bit, maybe later,

292
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,710
I came up with this idea of this pyramid

293
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,470
of kind of where quality comes from.

294
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,350
And then it's kind of resonated with me.

295
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,990
And so I drew a picture of it and put it in my keynote.

296
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,830
People came up to me and said,

297
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,390
that picture resonates, can I use that?

298
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,870
And it's not perfect yet, I want to work on it.

299
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,900
But there's these levels of culture

300
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,880
and functional quality and moving up to the top

301
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,940
where you have non-functional requirements

302
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,580
and then customer connection,

303
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,740
the abilities explored to our testing,

304
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,100
things are a little bit more customer connected at the top.

305
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,440
And I talked about the role testers will play in,

306
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,550
actually the role testers will play in that pyramid.

307
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,310
And at the bottom, it's functional testing,

308
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,170
it's advisement and code review

309
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,110
and making sure helping developers,

310
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,910
implementers, I should say, implementers,

311
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,910
write better tests.

312
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,150
I agree that when people here is tested,

313
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,910
they worry about their career.

314
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,950
And I think if you're a great critical thinker

315
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,150
and a great systems thinker,

316
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:06,240
you have long-term employment in software.

317
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,000
There are testers I know

318
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,500
who just write functional tests all day.

319
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,360
Those people perhaps,

320
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,900
if they don't want to be an implementer, a developer,

321
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,980
they want that to be their job,

322
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,620
they perhaps have something to worry about.

323
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,460
Because I don't believe that will exist.

324
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,460
I don't think it's perhaps at...

325
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,420
I'm being nice.

326
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
I know, I know.

327
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,900
The thing is even,

328
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,540
and I agree with the world that you're weaving,

329
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,020
but even in that world,

330
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,250
there's not going to be room

331
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,800
for all the people that were at Star Canada.

332
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
It's the cream of the crop

333
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,640
are gonna be the ones that hold

334
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,200
those pure testing positions.

335
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,560
If you love functional testing,

336
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,020
then you better be the world's best functional tester.

337
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,660
And I literally mean the world's best functional tester

338
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,180
if you want to keep that job.

339
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,240
In my head, I pictured a title on LinkedIn,

340
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,090
Functional Test Coaching Consultant.

341
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,170
Yeah.

342
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,480
But who are you consulting?

343
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,760
Right, that's the challenge.

344
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,680
I don't know.

345
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,280
So anyway...

346
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,640
It's not like we don't have

347
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
enough testing consultants today.

348
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,760
Right, I know.

349
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,160
And enough...

350
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,500
Wait, we don't have enough good ones.

351
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,240
All right, so anyway,

352
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,720
I thought the message was received pretty well.

353
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,080
People got that,

354
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,600
oh look, test is changing.

355
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
In fact, even when I was done,

356
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,120
and I picked on Lee during the keynote, Lee Copeland,

357
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,840
and Joe Ville, it was fun.

358
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,680
Lee's a good guy.

359
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,500
I know, he's fun.

360
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,760
I made a comment about when I said

361
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,240
Microsoft didn't have any testers,

362
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,960
so I started talking about no testers,

363
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,680
and I'm saying this at a test conference,

364
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,240
and I said, Lee, you know why I'm saying this?

365
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,500
Seven or eight years ago, when this book came out,

366
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,360
I really wanted you to give me a keynote,

367
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,620
but no, you waited until I wrote a blog post

368
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,980
saying that the book was out of date,

369
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,740
and then you said I should give a keynote

370
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,700
and talk about it.

371
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
So to get back to you,

372
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,740
I'm gonna come back to your test conference

373
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,020
and tell you that we don't even have any testers.

374
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,940
What do you think about that, Copeland?

375
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,340
What did you say?

376
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,180
He laughed.

377
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,020
What else is he...

378
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,300
But even afterwards, when I gave the message,

379
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,860
and people, everyone I talked to afterwards,

380
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,700
they got it.

381
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,900
They got that test is changing.

382
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,340
And Lee came up afterwards and said,

383
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,580
and acknowledged the Whitaker is test ed talk

384
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,820
from four or five years ago and said,

385
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,220
but what's really important there

386
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,220
is that testing as we know it, dead.

387
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,700
It's changing.

388
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,780
And people get that.

389
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,620
That's cool.

390
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,700
So I don't know what that means,

391
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,600
or I don't know enough about the jobs all these people do.

392
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,740
I think about half the people there

393
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,660
are sort of in that test development role.

394
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,440
Half of them are in that exploratory test,

395
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,420
functional test role.

396
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,420
I think I don't have a statistically significant sample.

397
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,980
The test discipline,

398
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,760
whether or not it's dead,

399
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,960
it is much better to default than it is dead.

400
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,320
That horse that we're beating is not only dead,

401
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,480
it's decomposing and smelling up the room.

402
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,320
I know we have a lot of people who actively listen to us.

403
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,300
No, we don't.

404
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,730
We used to, but then we started talking like this.

405
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,650
They still listen because it's a teaser.

406
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,550
They hope that we'll get to something interesting

407
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,370
any second now.

408
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,850
Eventually they're gonna say something really cool.

409
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:32,810
Come on, come on.

410
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,270
And then that outro music starts and they go,

411
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,450
man, maybe next time.

412
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,570
So there's a bunch of things that I wrote notes on.

413
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,490
I'm not gonna torture you on all of them.

414
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,330
Oh, thank God.

415
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,770
I had written down,

416
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,050
you had one slide around let's play a game.

417
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,370
And then I'm like, what the hell is this?

418
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,210
War games.

419
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,730
I got one through the other slides and I'm like,

420
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,650
oh, okay, this is fun.

421
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,730
And I got every single one wrong.

422
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,610
As did, I did it in the room.

423
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,930
Actually I did that, say I've done that three times now.

424
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,210
I got to get rid of those slides.

425
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:12,210
I stole those slides from our experimentation platform team,

426
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,730
who the leader of when we had one.

427
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,290
We still have one.

428
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,130
Just our buddy doesn't lead it anymore.

429
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,170
Anyway, I stole those slides.

430
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,370
I used them in a keynote at Star East

431
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,890
when I talked about years ago,

432
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,250
talking about customer data.

433
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,450
Back in the days when it wasn't telemetry

434
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,490
like you and I used today,

435
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,810
it was all about Squibbon Watson and some other things.

436
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,570
Send a smiley, send a frown, et cetera.

437
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:40,650
And in a room, that keynote was about four or 500 people

438
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,690
and I got, I stumped all but three

439
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,080
with those three questions.

440
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,920
So.

441
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,300
How many time do you get them to consider?

442
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,500
I give them 10 seconds, so.

443
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,740
Sure, that's enough time.

444
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,940
That's plenty of time.

445
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,620
And again, not looking at the slides,

446
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,420
the whole idea is showing them an A-B test

447
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,500
and letting them take a guess

448
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,020
at which one they think is better.

449
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,860
And then we show them what the data showed.

450
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,860
And the whole idea is between these three A-B test samples,

451
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,100
we can show them that as much,

452
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,500
as great of intuition as you think you have,

453
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,580
you are not the customer using customer data.

454
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,940
Much better way to see what's a better choice.

455
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,100
And it's much faster.

456
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,300
There was one where you said that

457
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,380
one result was 64% better.

458
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,220
Yeah.

459
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,300
Right, that 64% better.

460
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,380
It doesn't take much work to equate it

461
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,300
to actual dollar signs.

462
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Sure.

463
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,860
And one thing to keep in mind

464
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,740
that before going too deep,

465
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,060
and you know this, is we're really lucky at Microsoft

466
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,500
and because of our size is that we can get

467
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,700
a significant sample size

468
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,260
in order to make these choices very quickly.

469
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:54,070
Whereas some other companies may not.

470
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,190
Yeah, there was one comment you made

471
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,750
around the sample size.

472
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,480
And one thing I think a lot of people don't realize

473
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,280
is that depending on the data set,

474
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,160
you don't need that large of a sample.

475
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,480
The point is to be careful.

476
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,800
And that, what you're talking about

477
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:18,760
is taking from a post I found from someone on the internet

478
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,520
who had done, he had done AA testing,

479
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,440
because he was lazy.

480
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,840
He used the A-B testing tool

481
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,880
to just test the one version of his email

482
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,760
and was able to get statistically significant

483
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,000
according to the calculators online,

484
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,530
differences between the two emails.

485
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,410
But when he looked at it a little bit closer

486
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,850
it was his sample sizes just weren't big enough.

487
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,410
When you have a small sample size, then you-

488
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,690
Your confidence level's low.

489
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,130
You have to publish it along

490
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,410
with your confidence intervals.

491
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,450
Absolutely.

492
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,570
And that's what's missing a lot

493
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,490
actually the tools they use,

494
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,770
I forget whether we used Google's tools or someone else's,

495
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,250
but those confidence levels are critical.

496
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,530
And they never, we're used to a world

497
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,530
where they don't publish those confidence levels

498
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,490
along with likelihoods.

499
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:06,810
We see that in elections every year, right?

500
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,850
Well, we see, no, if you pay attention,

501
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,130
almost every poll I see says,

502
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:16,650
hey, there's a 52% chance that so-and-so is gonna win,

503
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,170
plus or minus 17%.

504
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,450
I'm like, okay.

505
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,810
All right, what else did you wanna ask me about

506
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,570
before we go on to something more interesting?

507
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:31,000
So I'm done with this one.

508
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,480
So you've now got your new job?

509
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,720
I do and so-

510
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,520
You sent me a mail saying that you were all jacked up.

511
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,360
Yeah, there's-

512
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,200
It was a kick-ass job?

513
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,880
Yeah, it's going well.

514
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,240
And I only feel bad that I had my first full week

515
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,840
on the job and then I took three and a half days

516
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,480
to go to Canada to this conference,

517
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,400
planned in advance, and lots going on, very busy,

518
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,520
nice high-pressure stuff.

519
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,560
As I mentioned before in the blog cast,

520
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,120
the blog cast podcast,

521
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,560
this is the first time I've ever worked for a manager

522
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,120
I didn't know before.

523
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,680
And he's funny, he's funnier than crap,

524
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,920
but he's pretty intense.

525
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,040
So I gotta figure him out.

526
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,240
It's gonna be an interesting time.

527
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
Okay, I can help you with that.

528
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,920
That's all I can say.

529
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,320
We'll help, next time we go to lunch,

530
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,400
we'll help you psychoanalyze your boss.

531
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,840
Oh, I love, yeah, I'm psychoanalyzing him already,

532
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,040
but he's pretty good, he's pretty perceptive.

533
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,820
Lots of stories that I probably shouldn't share here yet

534
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,540
until I get to know my team better.

535
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,300
I got a spare strength book in my office

536
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,980
you can take and get him to take.

537
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,820
All right.

538
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,820
If you want.

539
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,380
Yeah, I think going to,

540
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,940
strengths would be interesting with him.

541
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,580
I could probably predict him,

542
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,220
but as far as insights go,

543
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,310
he's the reddest manager I've ever worked for.

544
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,470
That's good and bad.

545
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:51,400
And I'm not even sure if there's another color in his spectrum.

546
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
Oh, interesting.

547
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,810
He could have a little blue down there somewhere.

548
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,410
Well, you hired you.

549
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,610
Yeah, I don't know.

550
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,210
Yeah, I don't know.

551
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,250
So lots going on there,

552
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,370
probably a lot I shouldn't talk about yet

553
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,490
with an unannounced product,

554
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,610
but I'm getting some good high pressure work,

555
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,730
good visibility.

556
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,770
Well, why don't you talk about the type of work

557
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,160
you're doing?

558
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,720
As I've mentioned before,

559
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,320
for people who missed the last podcast,

560
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,520
I'm on a team of about 70 developers.

561
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm the only, I'm the quality guy.

562
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,720
Doesn't mean I do all the testing.

563
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,960
It means I, for one,

564
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,520
kind of look at the testing that's going on

565
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,640
and help and audit and coach and correct.

566
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,280
And right now our developers have what I'll call

567
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,360
a reasonable set of tests,

568
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,760
but not a very good one.

569
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
I'm working on helping them improve that.

570
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,040
In fact, I have a meeting later today to go over that.

571
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,760
One of the things we're going to fix is right now

572
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,160
they have a set of,

573
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,840
and this is just mindset things.

574
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,320
Because I look at quality pretty holistically

575
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,480
all the way up like the pyramid I talked about.

576
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,720
And they have this set of tests that run at Check-In

577
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,080
for CI and then to make sure we promote one,

578
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,920
a build from our sort of,

579
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,880
we have two versions of our website.

580
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,480
One is not two versions,

581
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,240
but we have sort of a staging one

582
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,530
and then the production one.

583
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,530
Things kind of bake in staging

584
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,930
and then once a day we promote those two,

585
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,250
our regular one that more of the audience is.

586
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:16,570
It's unreleased, so production isn't actually production.

587
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,850
Hackers out there, you can't find this site.

588
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,650
Absolutely, absolutely not.

589
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,720
Anyway, they call this whole thing the quality pipeline.

590
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,360
I think that's overstating things a little bit.

591
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,880
Let's find the new word for this over time.

592
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,160
Right now, we have a review today

593
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,920
and a lot of the metrics that were prepared for this

594
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,000
are around test case counts per area,

595
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,240
but you and I know are really.

596
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,790
Oh.

597
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,630
The leaves.

598
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,790
The low hanging fruit is ready to be plucked from the tree.

599
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,970
I look forward to the day where I,

600
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,330
there's like a good couple of years

601
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,170
where I hear that statistic.

602
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,410
Well, and it's all over,

603
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,850
and again, the reason is of course,

604
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,770
the educated listeners of this podcast

605
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,650
know that all test cases are not created equal,

606
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,170
area sizes are different.

607
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,530
I'm gonna ask you, actually, I have some ideas for this,

608
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,210
but we're gonna move away from test case counts

609
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,730
because it's not a good way to measure anything.

610
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,810
It may as well count Arm Harris as a measure of quality.

611
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,690
So, what would you count instead?

612
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,960
If you wanted to, and again, maybe count nothing,

613
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,720
but what's a good way for you would use,

614
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,920
and I'll give you my answer in a second,

615
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,880
to show status of sort of this pipeline

616
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,720
of test quality and product quality

617
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,520
going through, at least as measured by unit

618
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,720
and developer tests.

619
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,600
You're adding constraints to the problem,

620
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,200
but I'm gonna ignore those for the second.

621
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,440
Of course you are.

622
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,360
The first thing that I would do facing that,

623
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,420
and it's actually very similar to what I'm doing here,

624
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,250
is establish what's the goal we're trying to achieve.

625
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,530
Right, and the term that I've been using here

626
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,870
is operational velocity.

627
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,630
I know what that means.

628
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,760
So, you're a system guy.

629
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,760
What we're trying to do is get production-ready code

630
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,950
in the hands of the customer as fast as possible.

631
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,590
Yeah, and you've heard me mention before

632
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,230
that for a long time I've considered my job

633
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,790
to make that build, measure, learn loop faster,

634
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,430
and that's what I think you're saying.

635
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,430
It is.

636
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,550
All right, so go on.

637
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,390
But one of the challenges.

638
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,790
I just wanted to pat myself on the back

639
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,350
that I actually acknowledge to our listeners

640
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,430
that we actually agree on something before you continue.

641
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,910
Yes.

642
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,590
I think I saw each of your slide decks

643
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:49,950
had a reference to that.

644
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,790
I know.

645
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,390
I referenced that in my third presentation.

646
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,550
Sorry, I duplicate one slide.

647
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,790
I think that was the only one I duplicated

648
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,670
in every presentation.

649
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,810
Okay.

650
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,610
And I think it's critical.

651
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,690
Now, the situation in your case,

652
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,890
because if we wanna do production-quality code,

653
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,470
the first thing that I get people to realize

654
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:19,500
is there are multiple cases where it is faster

655
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,540
to achieve that goal of production-quality code

656
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,310
in the hands of the customer

657
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:30,310
by reducing what you test in a preventative fashion

658
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,470
and enhancing your telemetry

659
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,470
and optimizing for being able to react fast.

660
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,530
So think of it even smaller than sort of a QFE class bug.

661
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,200
The things that we want to prevent

662
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,600
are obviously catastrophe-level bugs,

663
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,280
but most people, you'll discover

664
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,050
that that's actually a smaller subset.

665
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,260
I am now of the opinion,

666
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,180
if you don't know, let it go through.

667
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,660
But instrument the crap out of that

668
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,420
and be fully prepared that if the results of it

669
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,100
are falling on the wrong side,

670
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,420
your team has to be able to react to it

671
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,850
and fix it within 24 hours.

672
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,690
24 is a long time.

673
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,790
Okay, so most of the teams I've been talking to,

674
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:27,470
they go, 24, we can't do it shorter than seven days.

675
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,950
So I agree with you.

676
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,110
It depends on your content.

677
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,950
All right.

678
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,040
But that KPI,

679
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,920
and what you're talking about, your pyramid, right?

680
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
So the first thing that I would do is I would say,

681
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,030
okay, now, how do I define production quality code

682
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,630
in the hands of the customer?

683
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:51,770
I need someone to play the role of the customer.

684
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,690
Like in your situation, it's a V1.

685
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,330
I don't know if you can do this,

686
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,850
but the first thing that I would do

687
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:59,130
is I would engage with MSIT

688
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:04,130
and find a way to flight this within the company itself.

689
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,390
That will happen shortly.

690
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,750
Bolster up, then create a KPI that says,

691
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:22,000
number one, what is our cycle time?

692
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,450
How long does it take, so when somebody has an idea,

693
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:30,130
to get it to the point of production quality code,

694
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,690
including if we have a testing pipeline,

695
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,530
or if we have to react to bugs to get it there,

696
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:39,930
that timer doesn't stop until we go,

697
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,090
yes, it's now production quality,

698
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,970
it's making the customer happy.

699
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,110
We wanna know what that cycle time is.

700
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,310
We then will also wanna know the throughput

701
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:54,030
of getting new releases out.

702
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,910
Because we don't wanna create a,

703
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,150
we don't wanna over-entrench around this preventative model

704
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,990
and realize that the consequence

705
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,080
is that we're only creating a new release every two months.

706
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,920
Because that makes the build, measure, learn loop too slow.

707
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,920
Way too slow.

708
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,120
So it's really a first thing is really around

709
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,280
establishing those two or three key KPIs.

710
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,280
There's one that I'm forgetting right now,

711
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,670
but what they're called are tension metrics.

712
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,550
Where you, for example, if we had a thing of saying,

713
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,950
hey, we need to get deployments out

714
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,790
as fast as possible, right?

715
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,110
Well, more than likely, given most engineering teams,

716
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,750
they'll achieve that, they can get a new deployment

717
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,190
out every 15 minutes.

718
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,030
It's gonna be crap-tastic.

719
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,110
We have to have something that counter-bounces

720
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:46,210
that says, nope, we're gonna measure the time it takes

721
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:48,800
to make it non-crap-tastic.

722
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,540
And the magical third one, I wrote a deck on this,

723
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,060
I can send it later.

724
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,820
But by creating these tension metrics

725
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,820
such that the only way to make all of these things go good

726
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,370
is to change your behavior and measure

727
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,650
where you should optimize.

728
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,540
Pre-production, post-production.

729
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:16,910
Winding back to, so let's say we don't have

730
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,370
a post-production model, right?

731
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,130
Again, I can't emphasize enough.

732
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:26,290
If you don't have a production model,

733
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,410
it is my opinion that that is the first thing

734
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,610
you need to fix.

735
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:32,650
It is way more valuable than building up

736
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,570
another unit test suite.

737
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,700
Can you describe a little bit more what you mean

738
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,460
by post-production model?

739
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,540
You need to have your efforts validated

740
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,560
by as close to real-world usage as you can.

741
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,400
Okay.

742
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,600
Right, this is along the lines of what we were talking about

743
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,640
from your deck before.

744
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,480
Sure.

745
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,280
You gotta get rid of this champions of quality.

746
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,840
No, the customer is the champion of the quality.

747
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,560
And we're clueless.

748
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,120
So the model I used to say in a prior team

749
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,680
that was very effective is we don't,

750
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,840
it was a team motto.

751
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,640
We don't know what we're doing.

752
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,680
Right, it's intent, we know how to find out

753
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,360
but its intent was to block any sort of assumption.

754
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,360
Assumptions, particularly when you're in the data space,

755
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,900
are critically dangerous.

756
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:33,060
So you have to suppress intuition on conclusions.

757
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,620
You can have an intuition around hypothesis to generate

758
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,940
and those are extremely valuable

759
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,140
but you have to suppress intuition on conclusions.

760
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,020
Did I get it in the weeds?

761
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,860
What was your point?

762
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,700
Yeah, you're, you're.

763
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,100
I am weed-tastic.

764
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,260
I'm gonna get out my weed eater in a second.

765
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,060
You asked me a question.

766
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,180
So we were talking about post-production model

767
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,780
what that looked like and that was the customers.

768
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,700
You have to get to the point where the,

769
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,420
you have a signal generated from the customer.

770
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,300
Here, my team, I'm calling it the

771
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
outside in perception of quality.

772
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,260
A story.

773
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,220
We measure, in my current team,

774
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:15,590
we measure downtime events.

775
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,670
We have a contract.

776
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,070
So my team is Azure Compute.

777
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,930
We're a VM in the cloud service.

778
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:25,430
And when anyone signs up, we have a contract

779
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,950
around our service level agreement.

780
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,980
How much we will accidentally knock your VM offline.

781
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,660
And all of our competitors had the same thing.

782
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:40,490
Now, we had a big incident the other day

783
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,200
where a customer was claiming that they were out

784
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,060
for nine days and we measured it

785
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,000
and we could only find 20 minutes.

786
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,440
Now, one of the, the, the junior level guys

787
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,280
that I was interacting with was just like,

788
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,880
we're right and wanted to go fight the customer.

789
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,000
And I'm like, hold on.

790
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,540
Like, this is why you're not on the call.

791
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,160
And number two, I want you to step back and think about it.

792
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,000
Let's assume that the customer is right.

793
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,960
What possibly could be going on

794
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,670
such that they are perceiving that they're out,

795
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,960
that's different from what we're measuring, right?

796
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,250
When I talk about customer quality, it's,

797
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,780
we're trying to snap to creating a signal

798
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,740
that aligns with the actual customer's perception

799
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,580
of what's occurring.

800
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,820
That's all in the matters.

801
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,540
And so we came up with an algorithm.

802
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,580
We haven't executed it yet.

803
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,740
We're still looking for where the data is.

804
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,460
But I firmly believe as an example,

805
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,580
like Azure Compute is multiple different services.

806
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,940
We own the VM infrastructure, but the VM infrastructure,

807
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,880
it's just the VM infrastructure

808
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,220
and the networking infrastructure

809
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,500
and the storage infrastructure,

810
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,620
you need all of these to have a successful

811
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,420
cloud computing experience.

812
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,220
And they're all different teams.

813
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,420
The my junior guy that I was talking about

814
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,560
is on the compute side.

815
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,920
And I'm like, here's a hypothesis.

816
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,880
If the network was out during that time,

817
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,680
is it possible that the customer would perceive

818
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,480
that his system is down,

819
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,360
but we would still have the data that says

820
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,080
that the VM was up.

821
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,690
He's like, well, yeah, actually it would.

822
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,770
Okay, what if AED was down, the Azure Active Directory?

823
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,020
Network working.

824
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:44,540
But the thing that manages identity,

825
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,720
person can't log in.

826
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,560
What about that?

827
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Would they view it as potentially their VM was down?

828
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,380
Well, actually, yes.

829
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,220
Okay.

830
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,460
Guys, you were talking in my head,

831
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,900
I'm brainstorming through ideas.

832
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,020
Well, there's a bunch of different ways

833
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,900
networking could be down or logging could be down

834
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,300
or the IP address could have changed

835
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,620
and they're accessing it,

836
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,000
all kinds of stuff could go on.

837
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,400
Right.

838
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,460
The path that I'm on right now,

839
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:11,390
I engage with our portal team.

840
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:15,630
And so the customer only has a few ways

841
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,110
that they can interact with our service.

842
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,790
They can go through our portal,

843
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,270
or once they've created a VM,

844
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,070
they can just do a direct login.

845
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,310
Okay.

846
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,360
Starting with the portal team.

847
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,280
What I want to look at,

848
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,570
the only, there's a common behavior.

849
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,700
If the customer views that the VM is down,

850
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:39,340
what we've noticed is that they go do what's a CIR.

851
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,740
They log into the portal,

852
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,900
they find the VM,

853
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,820
they look at something,

854
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,100
we don't know exactly what,

855
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,880
but we have a whole bunch of smart guesses.

856
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,660
And then the only tool that we give the customer,

857
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,540
if they can't connect to their VM,

858
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:57,580
is to go to the portal and click the reboot VM button.

859
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,400
Now, the thing I want to do is go,

860
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,680
all right, let's look at all the customers

861
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,040
that hit that button in the last two months.

862
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,500
Now I want to look at the sequence of 10 things

863
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:16,660
they did in that session before they hit that reboot button.

864
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,340
And I want to aggregate those actions,

865
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,520
regardless of the order,

866
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,900
I want to aggregate those things

867
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,340
and I want to know what are the most common things

868
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:28,230
that they do just before hitting the reboot button.

869
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:30,630
With the hopes that that's going to give me a clue

870
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,830
of what are they looking at to come to the conclusion

871
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,370
that their VM is offline.

872
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,540
What do they see?

873
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,940
And with the idea that that's going to give me

874
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,820
a new signal to operationalize through the data set

875
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:49,980
and make my measurement of the subjective point of view

876
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,330
of the customer significantly more accurate.

877
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,650
I think I actually did finish,

878
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:56,650
I've forgotten it again,

879
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,430
but I think I managed to ask you.

880
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,450
Yeah, I think so.

881
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:02,410
So pre-production.

882
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,170
Yeah, my answer, look,

883
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:07,990
to cut to the chase here on my side is yes,

884
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,370
I think the goal is to increase throughput,

885
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:15,370
how often can we get quality code to our production site.

886
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,530
And part of that, it is a balance between,

887
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,760
I do think there is some learning and some growth to do

888
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,400
on getting developers to write quality code

889
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,180
and get that up to the site.

890
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,920
So even our, I believe even our sort of staging server

891
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,260
can be higher quality all the time.

892
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,740
So I do want to put some emphasis on having good tests

893
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,940
in there, pre-prod in there, but you're right.

894
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,120
You do need to balance that with what,

895
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,760
having real people use it,

896
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,360
whether they're exploratory testers right now

897
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,880
or customers eventually being able to get that data.

898
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,360
And I want to loop this back to,

899
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,560
I don't know if you caught this in my track session

900
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,880
when I talked about 21st century customer

901
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,320
and it was really, the short story is,

902
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,800
you need a balance of qualitative and quantitative data.

903
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,200
And at the very end, one of the things

904
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,120
I sort of drove home is that in the old days,

905
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,360
we kind of, we had the ship criteria checklist.

906
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,640
We go through, these are all things ready to ship.

907
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,920
Best thing is getting your product ready to ship.

908
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,000
But what's really important today

909
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,920
is not that just your product is ready,

910
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,040
but that your product is ready to be used

911
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,000
and in your allies get that data

912
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,760
and your team is ready to get that data.

913
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,080
So it's more than just the product itself, high quality.

914
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,600
You have to have the ability to deploy

915
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,400
and analyze and update quickly to your customers.

916
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,500
There was another quote that you said somewhere.

917
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,720
I don't remember exactly how you said it,

918
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,880
but I think one of the key differences between the,

919
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,780
honestly between the world we left and the world today,

920
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,520
it is significantly more important

921
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,400
that you're building the correct product

922
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,810
than to make sure that your product's correct.

923
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,470
Yeah.

924
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,910
And correct in this case is.

925
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,510
Correct for the customers.

926
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:09,870
And a quote I use all the time is it's,

927
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,710
in fact I tweeted this, but I said it

928
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,710
in my talk down on a slide,

929
00:39:12,710 --> 00:39:17,840
but it is perfectly possible to use good engineering.

930
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,680
I could use XP, maybe not, but bad example.

931
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,920
I could use some pretty good engineering practices

932
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,200
to make really good functionally correct software

933
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,880
that nobody wants to use.

934
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,720
Yes.

935
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,500
And this is one of the reasons why I try to get people

936
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,640
to not overbalance about preventative.

937
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,000
But the thing is,

938
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
it really doesn't matter what you start with.

939
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,440
As long as you are measuring those KPIs at the end,

940
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,350
and you have a learning loop

941
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:51,640
that you can measure where to do next.

942
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,440
You need to start with a baseline

943
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,820
and then determine, hey, you know what?

944
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:00,120
Looks like we're overdoing it on the preventative side,

945
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:05,500
and we need to push towards the optimizing morph reaction.

946
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,900
The last thing I'll say on this particular topic,

947
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,700
I doubt it.

948
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,840
And let's show something else.

949
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,930
It is critical that your team has the idea

950
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:24,050
and the muscle that every build is RTM-able.

951
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:31,000
There's a team that I walked through about six months ago

952
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,080
on how to scale up Agile.

953
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,360
And I said, look, if you wanna make your life

954
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,130
way less complicated, what you need to do

955
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:48,100
is decouple engineering from the business decision

956
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:49,980
from shipping.

957
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,040
And you make it very clear.

958
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,220
The business guys, it's 100% our call.

959
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:00,300
We could ship any build we want to at any time.

960
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,820
Engineering gets no vote.

961
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,080
What ends up happening when that happens,

962
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,620
engineering's like, holy crap,

963
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,860
we gotta make this RTM-able all the time.

964
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,430
Yeah, there's a story I can't tell you for our listeners.

965
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,230
Sorry, I'll catch you up again, I promise later,

966
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,430
but remind me to tell you after we're done.

967
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:20,230
Shh, it's a secret, secret stuff.

968
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:23,470
Hey, I'm gonna skip your thing.

969
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:24,310
Okay.

970
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:26,110
Because the clock says I have to.

971
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,950
So.

972
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,150
Fair enough.

973
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,390
Carl, what is that sound?

974
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,070
Do you hear that?

975
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:36,130
Mailbag!

976
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,090
So one of the things that we have today

977
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:43,030
is Alan has forgotten the mic stands.

978
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,870
And it's interesting because he did sort of

979
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,590
a little singing lounge thing with the mailbag that time.

980
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,710
That was actually cool.

981
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:53,510
I think next time you do it, you should take off the.

982
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,870
And I should stand up and do a little crooner pose.

983
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:58,590
Yeah, can you do a mailbag like Elvis?

984
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,940
No.

985
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,980
Well, practice that, next time.

986
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,500
I can do mailbag only like Alan.

987
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:04,540
All right, fair enough.

988
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,920
Hey, so what's the mailbag, Alan?

989
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,460
I wanted to quickly give a shout out

990
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,980
to Nicholas Straw on LinkedIn,

991
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,340
who gave Brent and I a shout out

992
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:17,340
for introducing him to Conway's Law.

993
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:21,100
As mentioned in episode something, I don't know,

994
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,840
a few episodes ago.

995
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,600
But anyway, thanks Nicholas for listening

996
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:30,080
and for mentioning us on LinkedIn, very cool.

997
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,920
And then.

998
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,520
And I love the fact that he mentions

999
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,160
that he's one of the three.

1000
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,000
He is.

1001
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,600
There are at least five people that are one of the three.

1002
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,640
The one of the three brand is slowly building.

1003
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,920
Yeah, you know what, we should get,

1004
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,530
oh, you know what, we need to make T-shirts.

1005
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,650
Like AB testing on one side and the back

1006
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,250
that says one of the three.

1007
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:51,050
Yeah, absolutely.

1008
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:51,890
All right.

1009
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:56,950
And go into production very soon, as soon as I remember.

1010
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,590
So the other one is, I'll tie this into a quick story

1011
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:06,270
from my past through Star Canada into the mailbag item.

1012
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,590
So once upon a time when I was in engineering excellence,

1013
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,950
I used to travel the country in the world

1014
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:12,990
teaching courses to people, Microsoft people.

1015
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,510
And I visited just a hilarious,

1016
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,030
a really fun group of testers

1017
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,030
at Microsoft's former office now in Long Island.

1018
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:24,070
Okay.

1019
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,870
I had gone out to speak at a conference in New York

1020
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,790
and said, hey, well, I'm there in New York City.

1021
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:29,110
I said, well, I'm there, I'll take the train out

1022
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,550
to Long Island and I'll teach these guys a course.

1023
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,390
So I didn't.

1024
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,990
I didn't even know we had a sub in Long Island.

1025
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,910
We did, that's where forefront was.

1026
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:36,910
Oh, okay.

1027
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,830
And anyway, I had a great time, fun guys.

1028
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:42,670
And then one of the guys, Mark, was at Star Canada.

1029
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,510
No!

1030
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:44,510
But another guy I met out there,

1031
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:48,550
Nathan, who left Microsoft a while back posted,

1032
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,430
and you'll dig this.

1033
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,150
On the board, I just wrote,

1034
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,920
we should talk about monolithic test systems,

1035
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,360
but he said, another great episode.

1036
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,920
He's also one of the three.

1037
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,000
I left Microsoft four years ago.

1038
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,960
I remember that the Windows org,

1039
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,480
I was gonna say redactive, but what the heck?

1040
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,240
Windows org was pushing this tool called WTT

1041
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,440
across the entire division.

1042
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,520
In the context of this podcast central org theme,

1043
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,240
how does WTT fit into the discussion?

1044
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,400
Is it still being pushed as the way automation

1045
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,760
needs to be run in the org,

1046
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,560
or has it finally been dismantled?

1047
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,880
Are other orgs continuing this longtime trend

1048
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,880
of monolithic division-wide automation systems?

1049
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,200
Actually, a very good question.

1050
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,840
And do you want me to go on and answer?

1051
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,760
Do you wanna jump in first?

1052
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,640
21, do you wanna take this?

1053
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,280
It's actually interesting.

1054
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,530
It's actually interesting.

1055
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:44,410
Otherwise, we wouldn't cover it here

1056
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,410
on the riveting A-B testing podcast.

1057
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,730
Yeah, I know, I use, I overuse interesting.

1058
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,890
It is an interesting adjective to me.

1059
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,060
I have come to refer to that particular tool

1060
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,900
as part of the Windows Test Framework,

1061
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,550
otherwise known as WTF. WTF.

1062
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,520
And I am very happy to say

1063
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,220
that the idea of really bad, stupid,

1064
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,620
monolithic test systems that don't solve the problem

1065
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,580
that they're created for and create an additional burden

1066
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:30,580
on the testers who have to use it seems to be gone.

1067
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:35,710
Oh, man, going away.

1068
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,590
There are people that will hold onto those things.

1069
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:42,590
But monolithic test system is still around, right?

1070
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,510
And it is growing, but it is now in a different context.

1071
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:55,430
The things I've seen coming out of the VS guys,

1072
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:59,270
the things I've seen coming in from open source.

1073
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:05,940
What I find is what's happening is people are choosing

1074
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:12,270
systems now instead of the systems being chosen for them.

1075
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:17,990
And as these systems are actually gaining customer following,

1076
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,190
the required amount of flexibility,

1077
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:22,310
the required amount of simplification,

1078
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,950
the required amount of awesomeness for this type of thing

1079
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:33,070
is actually causing convergence versus a forced convergence.

1080
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:38,710
So I would say monolithic stuff is still alive and well.

1081
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,910
It's just the command and control aspect.

1082
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,230
It's alive and well in a positive fashion.

1083
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:47,390
I'm gonna add one more twist.

1084
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,910
All that's true.

1085
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:51,670
And we actively went out, my last group,

1086
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:53,470
which was part of the operating systems group,

1087
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,350
which is largely made up of Windows,

1088
00:46:55,350 --> 00:46:58,350
we actively fought and avoided using WTT

1089
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,550
for many of those reasons.

1090
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,650
Did I ever tell you this story?

1091
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,890
I was on a team, but so when WTT was first being constructed,

1092
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,490
very small team, okay?

1093
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,450
The architect did something very clever

1094
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:12,090
and I liked his political strategy.

1095
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,650
What he would do is he would go around to executives

1096
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:16,930
and he would socialize what they're going to do.

1097
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:19,650
And the executives would be bought in.

1098
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:21,490
Oh, this is fantastic.

1099
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:26,330
Great, I need you to contribute resources so I can build it.

1100
00:47:26,330 --> 00:47:27,290
Okay?

1101
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:30,350
Now, so I reported to an executive at that time.

1102
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,180
He came to me.

1103
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,140
I went and talked to the architect.

1104
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,740
I have a used car salesman filter.

1105
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,420
It doesn't work on me.

1106
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,860
Okay, that's great that it's shiny and polishy

1107
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,580
and it'll clean Windows as well.

1108
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,020
But these are the things I care about.

1109
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,720
Tell me how it will do about that.

1110
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:54,140
Now, at that time, I owned a kernel mode driver

1111
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,780
and one of the biggest things,

1112
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,380
in other words, I was on a system

1113
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,020
where if my devs did the wrong thing,

1114
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:03,140
it would cause a blue screen.

1115
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,840
And WTT at that time wasn't resilient to that.

1116
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:12,940
I'm like, okay, so I crashed the machine.

1117
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,480
Where's the log stored?

1118
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,760
Oh, it's on the machine.

1119
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,920
Yeah, but I was on the storage team.

1120
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,680
I'm like, I just took out storage.

1121
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,740
So are you saying that I just lost the steps

1122
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,960
that caused this blue screen?

1123
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,560
He's like, yeah, I think so.

1124
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,790
Okay, how do I work around that?

1125
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,670
Oh, well, you have to wait a year.

1126
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:41,780
Okay, now my VP, he was getting pressure

1127
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,810
from his chain of command on doing this.

1128
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:47,610
And I said, okay, here's the deal.

1129
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,930
He wanted me to go into it in some fashion.

1130
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,560
I said, here's the deal.

1131
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,620
I will pay for a vendor

1132
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,420
and I will send that vendor over to WTT.

1133
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,780
Okay, and a vendor cost me 6,000 a week.

1134
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,780
He was expensive, but he did all of the database design

1135
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,800
for that system, okay?

1136
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:15,870
And my condition, if I do this, I don't have to use it.

1137
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:16,710
Okay.

1138
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:21,850
All right, so what I was saying

1139
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:24,690
before you told your story is I've forgotten.

1140
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:27,930
Oh, I think everything you said about it earlier is true.

1141
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:30,090
I think people are moving towards other tools

1142
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,410
and stuff's not being force fed.

1143
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:34,650
One other twist that I've noticed is

1144
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,090
because in a lot of these monolithic test tools

1145
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,210
are now sort of owned, or at least the running of them

1146
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:45,170
is owned by the implementers, the developers,

1147
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:47,330
as they own more and more functional testing,

1148
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,930
they're not standing up for some of the things

1149
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,170
we accepted perhaps too long as testers.

1150
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,930
They're saying, I'm not gonna use this.

1151
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,130
It kind of sucks.

1152
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:01,090
This is way too heavy weight for what we need to do.

1153
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,130
And again, if all you're trying to do is prevent every bug

1154
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,050
and find every bug before,

1155
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,490
and we talked about that balance earlier,

1156
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:11,690
they're really geared towards let's run

1157
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,430
hundreds of millions of tests that take weeks and weeks,

1158
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,250
and customers will still find bugs because-

1159
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,450
We don't have the time for that.

1160
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,850
I know, I know, I know.

1161
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,730
One of the most critical things,

1162
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,670
and I didn't see it called out on your deck,

1163
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:26,850
but in terms of the 21st century customer,

1164
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:30,810
I call this out every time I do a similar deck.

1165
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,160
There's a business imperative today

1166
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,480
that didn't exist 10 years ago.

1167
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:42,340
And that is for all of these things, test tools,

1168
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:47,790
your team's product, my team's product,

1169
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:53,460
the switching cost is so cheap.

1170
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,500
Because the customers are just different.

1171
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,340
Customers are different.

1172
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,460
I don't have to take your crap.

1173
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,700
There's 10 more versions of you out on the web,

1174
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,180
and I can go with one of them.

1175
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,940
And it is so easy for me to just try all 11 of them.

1176
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,940
I just saw a tweet from somebody I know

1177
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,300
those last couple days, it says,

1178
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,800
hey Uber, your app's buggy, so I'm switching to Lyft.

1179
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,340
Nothing about the quality of the service.

1180
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,300
The fact that the app's sucked,

1181
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,580
they're gonna use somebody else's taxi service.

1182
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,980
Yeah, and it, like that.

1183
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,290
Yeah, it's like, oh.

1184
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:27,650
Everybody's like, hey, try the free trial.

1185
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:30,370
It takes you three seconds to create an account,

1186
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:32,570
log in, try the free trial, make a decision,

1187
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:33,790
and go to the next one.

1188
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:34,630
Exactly.

1189
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:41,120
That on-prem mentality where once we're locked in,

1190
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:42,360
it's gone.

1191
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,680
Customers are fickle.

1192
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,520
Yeah.

1193
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,840
All right, Brent, the clock tells me

1194
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,480
that it's time for you to shut the hell up.

1195
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,800
I'm shutting up.

1196
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,320
Except for this part.

1197
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,660
Except for the part where I say,

1198
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,610
I'm not, I am, I am, who am I, I'm Allen.

1199
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:01,160
And I am Brent.

1200
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,400
Thanks once again for listening to episode 24,

1201
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,240
and we'll be back with you soon.

1202
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:11,320
From the offices of a floor 24 in Lincoln Center

1203
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,160
next time, right?

1204
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,000
Maybe.

1205
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,840
Okay.

1206
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,680
Maybe.

1207
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,520
All right.

1208
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,360
All right, thank you.

1209
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:17,200
Later everybody.

1210
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,040
Bye.
