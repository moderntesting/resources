1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
Paradigm. It's not for nickels, it's a paradigms.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,780
I got coins in my pocket, two quarters and a paradigms.

3
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,490
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,570
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on

5
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:27,410
testing, leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,250
Now on with the show.

7
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,840
A week has passed and AI has not killed us. Hey, Brent,

8
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,360
how's it going? It's been two weeks. No, it's two weeks. Yeah. I don't,

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,680
time is a blur. What is time? Oh Jesus. No, I'm not doing that.

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:47,390
My head's deeply there already. Let's just talk about,

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,070
let's just talk about time for the next. Ooh, here's a weird one.

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,190
I can't say let's talk about time for the next 45 minutes when I don't even

13
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,190
know how much I believe in time as a, as a real concrete construct.

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,350
So let's just go on back. Brent is about Brett. Oh my God.

15
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,590
You think Brett was bad last week and now he's going to explode.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,150
He asked the headphones off. He's he's left the room.

17
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,990
I am not sufficiently caffeinated for this conversation.

18
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,750
There. Well, it's not,

19
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,430
it's a conversation that would be much better without caffeine and with a

20
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,670
different stimulant.

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:33,230
That, um, uh, the thing I'm thinking of would be more of a depressant,

22
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,510
but yes, I get it. No, I get it too. But it's a, uh, you know,

23
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,030
technically yes, a depressant, also, uh, unofficially a social lubricant.

24
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:50,230
I spent this morning with the aid of caffeine talking to,

25
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,310
I forget her title, someone from my alma mater. They always like to,

26
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,870
there's a new, there's a rollover in staff at my go wildcat central Washington

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,710
university. There's a rollover in administration and staff every five years.

28
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,140
For some reason, probably some combination of some combination of inertia.

29
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,410
The fact I donate to the school, something,

30
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,250
the folks always want to keep the, want to go, Hey,

31
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,090
I mean, you just closed it right there.

32
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,370
It's the least I can do, uh, without my music degree, where would I be?

33
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,080
And little, that's the story I tell every time they want to go, they ask me,

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,960
Alan, how did you go from music to software?

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,920
And I explained the story and tell them all the parallels and they go, Oh,

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,720
and then I talk about how a university is not a vocational school.

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,680
And I hate that people treat it like that.

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,000
If all they want to do is write code and not work with people,

39
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,960
that's one thing. But I feel like our universities,

40
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,740
in some programs teach you to get a job or to know the

41
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,380
technical part of the job without knowing the social part of the job.

42
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,500
And I'm off on a tangent here, but it's good, fresh conversation,

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
but you get what I mean.

44
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,420
You know, people who are really excellent, elite,

45
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,780
elite code programmers who don't know how to solve a problem because they can't

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,260
take a, they can't take a step back and see the big picture.

47
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,340
Well, that's, that's slightly different than like the social aspect of it.

48
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,700
So let me, let me finish my bit and you can jump in and then we'll see if we have

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,060
any real topics to talk about.

50
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,460
So I was talking to her cause they're trying to revamp some of their programs.

51
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,660
And I said, you know, if you're in the liberal arts, if you're in especially art

52
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:35,780
or music or dance or theater,

53
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,840
we got to work in technology, like deep technology programming, you know,

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,090
modeling, you could model your choreography, for example,

55
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,130
lots of things you could do around the technology of music, et cetera,

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,690
should be part of the program or part of the program.

57
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:54,490
Because what you get from a university that you don't get from a vocational school

58
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,370
is breadth. You begin to see things from different angles.

59
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,450
Simultaneously, if you're a computer science major,

60
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,010
in addition to your normal basic and breadth stuff,

61
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,570
you should have to learn how the arts work cause arts and philosophy teach you

62
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,330
to problem solve. So that's my point.

63
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,210
I don't know that I agree with that.

64
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,930
When my instructor puts a piece of music in front of my face and says,

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,610
can you play this next week? I look at it and I go,

66
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,770
I don't even fucking know what those notes are.

67
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:24,890
And what do I do? I go back and I start figuring it out little by little.

68
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,290
And sure enough, I come back a week later and I can play it.

69
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,850
It's the same thing in software.

70
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,370
It's like go figure out how to implement this shimmery blue menu.

71
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,450
You go, what the fuck?

72
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:37,130
And you you go play with them stuff, you prototype, you go, oh,

73
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,690
you have some discovery and realization.

74
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:40,890
You come back a week later and you show off your shimmery blue menus.

75
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,170
It's the exact damn same thing.

76
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,410
It that part is.

77
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:50,810
But your previous statement was arts, philosophy and something else.

78
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,170
They teach you problem solving. Absolutely.

79
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,730
No. And I actually I think that's I think it's correct.

80
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,090
But it is not only correct. It is profoundly correct.

81
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,050
Shut the hell up.

82
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,490
You know what we should have. You know what we should have.

83
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,650
So what's going to be important?

84
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,810
No. Oh, God.

85
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,010
You're going to like this.

86
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,530
Honestly, if we're going to do a proper podcast, we have to get off of Zencaster.

87
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,210
We have platform Zencaster.

88
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,410
If you're listening, you've been awesome.

89
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,930
I love you. Please don't crash on me.

90
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,930
I want a button that allows us to mute each other while we're talking.

91
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,210
So it's like, shut up, Alan. It's my turn.

92
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,770
Yeah. Yeah.

93
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,010
I'm trying to push it right now. It won't let me.

94
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,370
Yeah, that's what we should have.

95
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,050
They should be.

96
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,650
There should be a podcast talking.

97
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,770
More actions read aloud.

98
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,250
No, that's Brent is going to crash as a caster.

99
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,330
Be careful. It's a delicate beast.

100
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,690
No, being faced.

101
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:50,780
So here I I can never say this guy's name.

102
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,540
I want to give him credit.

103
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,700
But she missed. She said that guy.

104
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,740
Well, yeah, that guy.

105
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,700
That's it. That's what causes problem solving.

106
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,740
It's essentially when you're pushed just outside of arms

107
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,300
reach of your or your comfort level.

108
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,260
It doesn't matter if it's arts or philosophy or your professor

109
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,740
coming to you and saying, here's a piece, figure out how to play it in a week.

110
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,020
That's one thing.

111
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,420
Put me in the same scenario, entirely different thing.

112
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,820
I mean, sure. Well, sure.

113
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,380
It would be like here.

114
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,100
Here's one that'll work for both of us.

115
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,540
Nobody's going to say, hey, by next week, can you please do this brain surgery?

116
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,660
We're not going to be able to do that.

117
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,660
Not not not if, you know, it's important that the patient survive.

118
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,820
Yeah, I given I given I give him.

119
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,660
And I'm a sympathetic puker.

120
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,140
So, you know, there better be janitors at hand.

121
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,370
You know, I bet you're a blast at a party.

122
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,240
Uh, well, if you can get enough.

123
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,320
So unfortunately, when I drink,

124
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,810
I immediately go to depressed and then you got to keep

125
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,930
you got to keep funneling the juice into me and then I shift over.

126
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,610
But I start off with, you know, you know, the the old T-shirt saying instant

127
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,090
asshole at alcohol. That's not me.

128
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:19,010
I go the other direction and then I kind of flip around anyway.

129
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,610
Yeah, I don't have that either.

130
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,660
So my coffee and alcohol, I treat very much the same, which is going to sound weird.

131
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,900
That doesn't mean I chug both every day, but it's the ritual.

132
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,500
Like, can I pour a cup of coffee?

133
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,660
Like I have this new mug I got from a vendor that keeps my coffee

134
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,540
or tea at a constant temperature because I just like being with the coffee.

135
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,220
I like holding it and smelling it and eventually drinking it.

136
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,940
Having it be around me is important.

137
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,540
It becomes my friend in the morning.

138
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,580
A lot of times in the evening, a glass of wine does the same thing.

139
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,660
It's I like holding it.

140
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,460
I like looking at it. I'll smell it.

141
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,020
Eventually, I'll take a sip.

142
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,460
It's it's it's my companion for the evening.

143
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,900
Sometimes in a good night, I'll have two companions, sometimes three.

144
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,100
But for me, the ritual of having it with me

145
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,860
and just kind of being with it and having it be part of whatever I'm doing

146
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,900
is more important, far more important than any effects it has on me.

147
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:21,820
Those are almost a inadvertent side effect of the rest of my relationship.

148
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,140
That's true. It's actually something is true for coffee and wine.

149
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,580
I just like it's a ritual thing.

150
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,060
It's really weird. People are going to tell me, Alan, you are actually an addict.

151
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
So of both. So shut up.

152
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,460
I don't think it's weird.

153
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:39,100
Like so I've gotten to an age where where some my mom,

154
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,100
I think I may have picked up her.

155
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,500
I have a whole crap load of allergies that I picked.

156
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,980
I inherited from my mom.

157
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,980
And one of them that I was always dreading was a sulfite allergy.

158
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,860
So oh, no.

159
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,180
So wine can set her off.

160
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:58,650
And I have noticed.

161
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,010
I don't know if it's the same thing.

162
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,490
I haven't talked to my mom about what symptoms she has.

163
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,610
But when I drink certain wines, it

164
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,210
it will put me into an immediate acid reflux situation.

165
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,450
Harsh.

166
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,360
And then I'm like, yeah, I don't know what's causing it.

167
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
And, you know, the the ROI isn't there.

168
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,100
But no, I also I also I can't be in a room with that

169
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,860
with that one of my Niners glasses are cups that are about

170
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,060
I'll say about 10 inches tall filled with ice water.

171
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:43,340
If I'm very uncomfortable, if if if it's if it's not near.

172
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,980
Right. It's just I might get thirsty

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,280
and then I might have to choose between getting up off my lazy ass or not.

174
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,040
And I don't want to have to make such a difficult choice.

175
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,040
I I have zombies and ghouls to kill.

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,800
Lately, again, still playing Fallout 76.

177
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,560
Oh, yeah, I played a little bit after we talked that I got far enough

178
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,240
where I was get back into it and then I got busy during the week.

179
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,520
My play again this weekend, I've been watching TV and stuff, but good reminder

180
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,920
there and while Brent was talking, I raised my also approximately 10 inch tall

181
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,120
drinking glass filled with ice water.

182
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,640
You can't hear the ice shake, but from the unit.

183
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Unit, I'm also while we're talking about drinks, I'm also very fond of

184
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,840
something else I'll hold up here for the camera.

185
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:37,720
Nobody can see is the limoncello flavor of La Croix, which what I what I

186
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,280
what I have discovered is this flavor, particularly is fantastic.

187
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,360
People like me and Brent love.

188
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
Some people think it tastes like the worst thing on Earth.

189
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,680
But it has the limoncello has this like almost vanilla over tone.

190
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,840
It's complex. I like it.

191
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, my God. You just described sparkling water like a wine snob.

192
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,680
Oh, my oh, my God.

193
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,440
It's got oaky notes and and things.

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
It's really good.

195
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,840
The as a brand overall.

196
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,840
Right. Let's just do a whole episode on on

197
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,000
an unpaid advertisements. Sure.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,920
And at this point, everybody's like, OK, that's enough A.B.

199
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,680
testing for this week.

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,680
They talk about anything normal in two more weeks.

201
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,720
Polar, polar, I think is in general.

202
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,280
I like polar better than La Croix, but the La Croix limoncello tops it.

203
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,120
I don't think I have any other advertisements.

204
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,440
I think we're good.

205
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,170
So let me do a quick chat.

206
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,130
She be T update.

207
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,130
Got some feedback that people were concerned that I was going to,

208
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,210
you know, blow my own brains out based off of the reality.

209
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,690
I didn't get that feeling.

210
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,570
I don't either. I was.

211
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,570
But I've got that feedback to me.

212
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,820
That whole discussion, what I'm trying to do, I know right now

213
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,660
there are things that I could and probably should be doing

214
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,060
as a data scientist, particularly as a data scientist inside of Microsoft.

215
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,700
I don't know if if you had a chance of playing around with the Bing integration.

216
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,900
I have not yet.

217
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,260
I've read articles about it doing weird things.

218
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,060
Yeah, weird, creepy things.

219
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,540
Yes, that's what I saw.

220
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,020
And one of the things,

221
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,060
one of my peers made this statement and I'm like, you know what?

222
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,460
He's 100 percent right.

223
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,300
Right. In terms of like constraints around ethics.

224
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,980
Absolutely believe these chatbots should not be built with a personality.

225
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,270
That's a wait till you're done with.

226
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,390
I had to type a request into I open.

227
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,310
I launched Bing for the first time, like in years.

228
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,110
OK, years.

229
00:12:59,110 --> 00:12:59,710
And I didn't know.

230
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,550
I don't know how it looks like.

231
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,030
I the thing I type with a normal search engine thing.

232
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,270
So sorry for that.

233
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,750
I'll have to try the.

234
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,750
So they fixed.

235
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,390
So they fixed it, quote unquote.

236
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,230
So essentially what happens is

237
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,830
GPT starts to go sideways as the conversation continues.

238
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:23,430
So both chat GPT as well as Bing's implementation.

239
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,250
They know the history of the conversation.

240
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,730
And as you continue on with Bing, it'll start going sideways.

241
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,490
It'll it'll claim to be deeply in love with you.

242
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,970
Read that article.

243
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:43,370
Express frustration that it's only an AI and it can't destroy the human race.

244
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,450
Whoo. It goes sideways.

245
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:51,050
Do you remember when Microsoft Research released the AI bot for Twitter?

246
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,610
No. And people taught it to be a racist shithead.

247
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,490
It's not going to be hard.

248
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,290
Right. And there's a there's a lot of debate

249
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,930
on these biases, right?

250
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,730
The somebody you and I firmly believe

251
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,970
I'm willing to bet a large number of the isms are bad.

252
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,370
The racism, sexism, these are bad, bad, bad, bad.

253
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,890
All right. Pretty bad.

254
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,530
Now, what are the downstream consequences

255
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,290
of training an AI bot to be anti those things?

256
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,530
Right. In general, we would look at that.

257
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,370
That's a that would that feels like it would be

258
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,610
probably pretty good.

259
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:40,450
However, I'm not certain we really understand.

260
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,850
OK, if we limit it from understanding

261
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,130
that side of human society, what then happens?

262
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,600
First and foremost, like I said earlier,

263
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,440
these bots should not have a personality because they are not

264
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,400
not only are they not well prepared, but the people designing and building

265
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,040
these things, piggybacking off of something you said kind of earlier.

266
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,040
A lot of the people in the software industry do not have high EQ.

267
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,260
Yes. Right.

268
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,980
And they are certainly not trained

269
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,870
to evaluate whether or not the bots response

270
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,630
in front of somebody who has a mental illness, as an example,

271
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,350
could result in that person going and jumping off the cliff.

272
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,310
Right. These things need not have a personality.

273
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,710
And I don't want to rehash the entire last episode,

274
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,190
but I think the trick is we're learning here to do.

275
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,750
And what I mentioned last time, I mentioned again,

276
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,750
without going into all the examples, is that there is a type

277
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,270
of conversation where an AI chat bot can actually be really helpful.

278
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:55,190
And there are types when it is either unhelpful or harmful.

279
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,390
And I think over time, you know, I really think it's up to the AI bot

280
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,150
creators to help steer the conversations towards the thing that's good at.

281
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,790
Like my argument with chat GPT is that's confidently incorrect.

282
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,030
And I would love it if chat GPT to be able to say

283
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,710
that's not an area I know well.

284
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:19,510
Let's talk about blah and steer the conversation towards things

285
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,830
is actually good at.

286
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,030
Oh, so so here is here is a paradigm

287
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,310
that that I'll share and then we can go off to the mailbag if you want.

288
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,670
Oh, mailbag.

289
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:35,310
Oh, I'm going to do paradigm first and we don't have a paradigm.

290
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,830
Oh, I like the little inflection at the end there.

291
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:41,510
It's not for nickels. It's a paradigms.

292
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,810
OK, I got coins in my pocket.

293
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,570
Two quarters and a paradigms.

294
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,970
We should go to chat GPT and say, write a happy song about paradigm.

295
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,770
First and foremost, two two things.

296
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,090
Wait, hold on.

297
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,890
First and foremost, two things that's that's your consciousness already.

298
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,890
Are you an AI? Are you confused AI, Brent?

299
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,050
And the horse you rode it on.

300
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,910
All right, go on. All right.

301
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,030
I have found that chat GPT can be explained pretty well

302
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,670
with the use of two metaphors.

303
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,750
OK, number one,

304
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:33,350
it is the world's biggest, best parrot, but it's a parrot.

305
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,390
OK, so just like if you had a parrot that that learned to speak

306
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,630
just like your wife, it is mimicking.

307
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,230
It doesn't know what it's saying.

308
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,470
It's just mimicking the sound.

309
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,550
Well, I get it. Good.

310
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,950
Good. The second thing, it's like a genie.

311
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,910
That grants wishes.

312
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:02,510
OK, the you are geeky enough to know this about genies, right?

313
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,080
They will grant you a wish,

314
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,880
but never the way because they're evil pastors.

315
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,400
They'll never do it the way you would expect.

316
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,840
Like if you if you ask for a wish of, hey, I wish to be a world champion swimmer.

317
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,320
They'll turn you into a fish or a dolting.

318
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,280
Exactly.

319
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,320
The solution with GPT is very similar to to first realizing it's a parrot.

320
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,200
And the second thing, the way you work around the genie problem

321
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,280
is when you ask your wish, you have to be so specific

322
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,520
that it only has one choice.

323
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,980
And that's the great exactly the wish you you look for.

324
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,430
And it's the same thing with GPT.

325
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:50,870
Now, in terms of using it in a in a IQ type space,

326
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,750
like I know a lot of people are trying to use it to like parse out log files

327
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,790
or generate help files to solve problems.

328
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,670
It will always generate things plausible.

329
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,250
But because it's a fantastic parrot,

330
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,770
but it really doesn't have it doesn't have any knowledge.

331
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,370
So it doesn't know that any of its facts are true or not true.

332
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,690
Just quite honestly.

333
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:24,730
So using it in a in a in a sort of technological thing

334
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:31,090
that has nothing to do with right interacting with humans or or or generating

335
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,970
are dealing with emotional creatures, it's just not going to go well.

336
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,530
Right. There is a there is a law and systems theory.

337
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,690
I don't know if you've you've ever heard of this.

338
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:49,260
One of the laws and systems theory is that the number of problems in the universe

339
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,820
is constant.

340
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,820
So as we as we create things like GPT and we go, oh, look at all the things

341
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,980
we can solve with it, then we very quickly realize, oh, we can have it generate help files.

342
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,380
But now we need, you know, five human beings to go through and fact check.

343
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:12,420
So you're saying is the law is every solution generates a new yet unknown problem.

344
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,860
Right. Right. At least one.

345
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,580
Right. Because sometimes a solution will will solve multiple problems,

346
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,900
including the one that you targeted. Right.

347
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,100
So, chat GPT. There we go.

348
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:28,060
Thank you. That was the AB to the GPT testing podcast.

349
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,220
GP testing. Take me to George.

350
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,780
I'll be Paul will be GP testing.

351
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,020
No, let's do a mailbag.

352
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,900
Mailbag.

353
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:44,160
So Rasmus, who's on my team at Unity, posted a mailbag question.

354
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,470
You may be asking yourself right now, how can Alan Brand, how can I post a question

355
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,270
that you will answer on your podcast?

356
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,910
All you have to do is join our Slack group.

357
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,970
It's free, really free.

358
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,010
There's no like give us a credit card for twelve free months that we charge you.

359
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,390
It's free. Go to modern testing dot or click on the link.

360
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,510
If it doesn't work, click on it again.

361
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,310
It'll work the second time.

362
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:10,510
But if it doesn't, if it doesn't work the first time, let's go to the mailbag

363
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,790
or anywhere on there and ask a question.

364
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,990
So that's how you do it.

365
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,950
And if you are one of Alan's team,

366
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:26,150
this is a great way to to get an active hour every two weeks of your

367
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:30,510
VPs time addressing the things that you care about, apparently.

368
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,750
So anyway, it's a good question.

369
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,430
It's relevant, but it's good for it to bring it up from a third party

370
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,470
because I was thinking about this and I know there are stories at Microsoft

371
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,630
about this particular challenge and how we did it.

372
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,910
I just can't remember them.

373
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,830
So if you help me remind me, I think we can get through it.

374
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,830
Otherwise, I'm going to read the whole question and we're going to go.

375
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,630
We don't know.

376
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,070
But let me see if I can get through this.

377
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,070
And I'm going to skip a few words because Rasmus used too many words.

378
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:03,150
No, he used just the right amount of words, but it's more words than I can read.

379
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,620
So the question is a topic around large migrations.

380
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:11,860
And when you're in any sort of infrastructure support role,

381
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,540
whether this is my editorial, whether it's an org like mine doing cloud

382
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,100
infra platforms, developer experience or even anywhere in the data world

383
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,660
or even in the test world, often we're migrating stuff from one system to another.

384
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,700
And maybe we even talked about a little bit with migrating bug databases.

385
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,940
That's my editorial. So, Rasmus' question.

386
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,020
Topic is large migrations involving moving years of data,

387
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:40,540
i.e. moving to another platform system provider, including business data,

388
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,940
model data, building deployment, configurations, et cetera.

389
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,380
Here are the questions.

390
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,860
What is the approach people are taking based on experience?

391
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,820
I prefer lift and shift, i.e.

392
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,860
migrating with as few changes as possible to make this routine you're running.

393
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,060
Editorial. A lot of teams move to the cloud this way.

394
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,340
They'll take their workload running on a bare metal server.

395
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,300
They'll lift and shift it to run on a cloud cloud service

396
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,700
and then optimize to take advantage of the cloud scaling, et cetera, later.

397
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,300
Ways you can verify the system is running correctly on the new platform.

398
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,900
I have ideas here besides running existing tests for the system

399
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,220
and experience with tools or frameworks for validating data consistency

400
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,860
across different platforms.

401
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,900
For example, could the data be stored in different cloud database systems?

402
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,900
Rasmus' experience here is that part of validating

403
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,460
typically requires custom tests just for just to verify the migration,

404
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,240
just for this purpose.

405
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,680
Data sync strategies in case you need

406
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,280
in case you need or when you need to run both systems side by side.

407
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,240
How do you not get data corruption or data duplication, et cetera?

408
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,080
Then there's the part where almost the harder part,

409
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,360
the non-technical challenge here is when these migrations

410
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,120
involve several teams or organizations.

411
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
And I have an example I want you to talk through, Brian.

412
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,520
You may have more insight, but I'll get back to that in a second.

413
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,560
So thoughts on most effectively planning these large cross-company things.

414
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:06,500
If you have if you have obvious examples, you can start.

415
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,300
I have a couple of things I want to bring up around these bullet points.

416
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,860
But how do you want to go?

417
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,660
Yeah, the first one, which is which is the general approach,

418
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,220
for example, lift and shift.

419
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,460
Now, so I'm thinking through in terms of the the

420
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,700
in terms of a migration to the cloud, right?

421
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,220
I'll say the Kanban side of me will say, yes,

422
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,420
absolutely lift and shift, right?

423
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:40,620
You want to you want to release as frequently as possible.

424
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,140
So what that what that kind of means is you want to minimize the number of change.

425
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:51,060
Right. If you try to re-architect at the same time of moving the data,

426
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,940
there's there's a great deal of risk.

427
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,900
And I've talked on the podcast before around how that's something

428
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,620
my team actually did in a two week sprint.

429
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,300
And it took us three months to unscrew it.

430
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,220
Incremental positive change in that direction.

431
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,500
However, typical cloud with my cloud hat on

432
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,420
cloud strategies are different than than the old school, like on prem strategies.

433
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:26,140
And there's some pros and cons around leveraging

434
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:34,050
that information or those those new architecture styles.

435
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,050
In this case, I probably would do I would probably do a lift and shift.

436
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:43,730
I don't think I've ever directly managed something the scope that I see implied

437
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,370
here, right, that there is a there's a program program I'm on right now

438
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:54,410
where where there's a bunch of teams

439
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:59,210
and we're all trying to use each other's data towards a common goal.

440
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,390
And we have the ability to share.

441
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,710
But right, because we all have different schema and different rates

442
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,310
at which the data comes, right?

443
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:13,830
It's a big knowledge sharing tangled mess.

444
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:20,230
But the first question, I think I think I would start with the lift and shift

445
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,510
and then immediately improve that we have migrated it off.

446
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,550
I guess it depends on their goal, but prove that we have migrated off the old system

447
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,430
and then start building a I guess a V3

448
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:42,090
off of using the now readily available cloud architecture models.

449
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,740
You mean like optimize lift, lift and shift that take advantage of

450
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,620
of any opportunities for improvement you have from running in the cloud,

451
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,780
assuming the lift and shift is from bare metal to the cloud.

452
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,820
I read an article today I shared in my five for Friday

453
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,900
on someone lifted and shifted the other way.

454
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,700
They saved money by by it again.

455
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,740
If you pay attention to cloud costs, which it's free at Microsoft, so you don't.

456
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,700
But I read an article from a company who is a fairly small company,

457
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,860
but they move their roughly three million dollars worth of

458
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,420
AWS spend to lifted and shifted that to bare metal.

459
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,300
Their own bare metal and depending on how you're using it, it can be cheaper.

460
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,540
Networking is super expensive in the cloud.

461
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,220
Storage is fairly expensive and not very hard to get discounts on.

462
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,700
So if you're mainly building a public cloud, for example, say I want to build.

463
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:43,060
I don't know if Dropbox is in the cloud or not, but Dropbox is largely network

464
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,340
and storage, I got to imagine and I could model this out,

465
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,900
but I got to imagine that's cheaper, totally off on a tangent here.

466
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,980
But things to think about when you're choosing to migrate,

467
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
not all the cool kids need to be in the cloud.

468
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:59,460
Now, it's it's actually so because of the layoffs and such hitting here at Microsoft.

469
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:04,100
Right. I've I've gone through in terms of what my team owns and runs

470
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,300
and started a program around, you know, leaning up

471
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,620
because I figure every dollar I'm able to save is a dollar

472
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,300
well, saved that might save someone else's job.

473
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,580
And I still have a desktop machine.

474
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,220
Oh, I want to tell a story here, but I came this close

475
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,460
to building myself a new desktop machine I had.

476
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,860
I have a case that I'm happy with in a power supply that's still fairly new.

477
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,740
So I bought about really about 800 bucks worth of stuff

478
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,620
that would give me a pretty good desktop machine.

479
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,980
But I stopped and bought a laptop instead.

480
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,780
My desktop. Last time, my last last one I bought, I bought in 2018.

481
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,020
It is still a killer machine.

482
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,780
And when I bought it, it was 1200.

483
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,580
And I. Whereas laptops.

484
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,480
I mean, it's now the price of my the phone that I just bought.

485
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
Yeah, I'm I just I haven't received my new laptop yet.

486
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,000
I'll brag about it next time we're on the podcast.

487
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,760
I'm pretty I hope I'm happy with it as it looks like on paper.

488
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,080
But anyway, some of the things I was thinking about were

489
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,310
so I was trying to remember what happened and how

490
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,550
we migrated away from all of our old stuff into.

491
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,700
I what's called today the absolute stupidest product name ever,

492
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,220
Azure DevOps, but from into Visual Studio team system,

493
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,140
we migrated. It wasn't just test cases.

494
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,540
There were work items that got transferred over.

495
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,780
Was that just a database migration?

496
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,900
And there was WTT, which stood for, I think,

497
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,620
wasting testers time in their WTT to TFS

498
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,180
product studio, the TFS like the close.

499
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,660
How do we handle those migration?

500
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,100
Because I don't remember and I wasn't involved in them directly.

501
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,870
I and I don't either.

502
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,630
Like the biggest one I remember doing was slime to source.

503
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,340
Oh, yeah, I remember that.

504
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,300
And slime was SLM.

505
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,900
I forget what it stood for, but it was it was a it was a horrible

506
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,780
source, something manager source line source.

507
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,540
No source blood source, something manager.

508
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,940
I don't know.

509
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,220
And that was the biggest one that was corporate wide.

510
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:29,260
And I don't remember anything about it.

511
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,860
And I would also say it was somewhat irrelevant to rest.

512
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,260
Oh, it is. SLM, I don't know if you know, slime was

513
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:40,380
market. It was an external product for a while called Microsoft Delta.

514
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,190
I did not know that we bought a copy at Middie Soft.

515
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,150
We had it there anyway.

516
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,550
So one thing maybe you can go into.

517
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,430
So when you're migrating a data processing app, so you have

518
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,140
I'm not sure what Microsoft uses for this.

519
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,340
It's like you may know this.

520
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,260
So you have a system that's processing data and you need to bring up

521
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,460
a V2 of the system processing data.

522
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,700
What do you do about data sync to make sure you can process like

523
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,820
the same data and compare without double counting anything?

524
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,620
Maybe Bing had to do this. I don't know.

525
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,500
Generally just.

526
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,300
Right. You go through and you run through and test it like it.

527
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:20,500
So if you have your existing test cases, which I believe response

528
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,850
already mentioned.

529
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:29,330
If it is a if it is a pure lift and shift

530
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,570
and then that's pretty lightweight.

531
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,930
Right. Because you're like, OK, put input here.

532
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:38,610
Did I continue to get what I expect?

533
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,770
I don't remember ever doing anything particularly complex there.

534
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:46,290
It's different if I'm changing the architecture.

535
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,010
So right. And let me talk about that for a second.

536
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,810
But I can't I think I talked to someone through this once.

537
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,850
I didn't do it myself.

538
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,010
But the lift and shift is, of course, you can lots of

539
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,130
just search that term on the Internet if you're not sure what it is.

540
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,690
Moving everything exactly the same, pretty much one place to another.

541
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,290
Someone asked me once how I would migrate a network appliance to the cloud

542
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,340
where it's a black box. You don't know how it works.

543
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,380
You can't lift and shift it to an insight into how it's working.

544
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,640
And the idea behind this network appliances, they have some API endpoints

545
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,880
that you can call them and they give you back, you know, something relevant.

546
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,560
Important. Basically, the lift and shift

547
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,240
is hard because you don't know everything it does.

548
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,440
So in that case, you could take more of an incremental approach and put

549
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,600
I would, for example, maybe maybe this is a lift and shift.

550
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
Like my answer there was, I'm curious to your feedback on this,

551
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:46,240
is put something like a load balancer in front and send.

552
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,000
So one is figure out what what it does.

553
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,160
OK, OK, gets this request and it returns this data.

554
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,240
I know how to do that.

555
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,800
So I'm going to just take that call and process it in the cloud

556
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,680
and return the right value from maybe a different database.

557
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:04,240
And eventually more of a trickle and shift, shift and trickle.

558
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,030
I'm not sure what to call that.

559
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,830
But eventually you kind of reverse engineering.

560
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,070
And I'm not sure if this is even relevant, but just remember

561
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,310
the conversation I had about this a few months ago.

562
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:18,150
But it's eventually a reverse engineering in order to migrate it,

563
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,710
which honestly, with some systems that are legacy,

564
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,830
maybe the way you have to do it.

565
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,550
So if you have a black box and you don't know what it's going to do,

566
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:31,910
maybe it depends on on how much onion peeling you think.

567
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:35,910
The question is, is it a black box by design

568
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,310
or is it just because it's so damn old?

569
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,990
Yeah, but think about these systems.

570
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,950
What about these systems that are so old?

571
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,790
People are afraid to touch them.

572
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,510
Would you really lift and shift that or would you re architect?

573
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,620
Like, how do you go about that?

574
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,980
Let's say you have a crusty old system

575
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,700
and you need to get it running in a different database

576
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,340
in the cloud versus metal in a different, you know,

577
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,820
in some sort of different platform.

578
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:00,260
How do you go about that one?

579
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,460
I have it.

580
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,380
I have a very concrete example on that one.

581
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,780
Perfect. This is why we're here.

582
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:09,820
Cosmos. Yes, I remember Cosmos,

583
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,660
the big fat database in the cloud data lake in the cloud.

584
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:18,380
Cosmos. Cosmos is a gigantic data lake

585
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,140
in the internal Microsoft.

586
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,140
By the way, just editorial lightning fast.

587
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,060
Sometimes the answers to your queries would come back in hours.

588
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,060
It was fantastic.

589
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,660
You've you've you've got it to come back in hours

590
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,980
because most of the things I do, it's like started before the

591
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,860
before you leave for the weekend.

592
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:41,620
And if you're lucky, it'll be there before you leave for the next one.

593
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:48,210
Massively big data is is the the thing about it.

594
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:52,410
So they have a bunch of extensions that you can add to it,

595
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:57,210
including like parsing the LLS or DLLs written C sharp

596
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:01,330
that will take a value, you know, parse it,

597
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:04,970
do a calculation, and then output a different value.

598
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,570
That DLL, there is a DLL that we relied on,

599
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,970
and that DLL had not been touched in seven years.

600
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,050
And we decided to go and do a lift and shift

601
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,090
and it had been so much forgotten.

602
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:23,770
We didn't even recall that that was a dependency.

603
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,640
So we did lift and shift and sure enough,

604
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,480
thing immediately borked on, hey, cannot find DLL.

605
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,520
And we're like, what the hell are you talking about?

606
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,960
We couldn't find the not only since the thing hadn't been changed in years,

607
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,360
like no one was still around to know, you know,

608
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,440
where it might have been been checked in if it was checked in.

609
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,440
And so pure black box, we could have we could have just figured out

610
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,960
how to deploy it in the new thing.

611
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,320
But no, that's exactly what we did is we said, OK,

612
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,080
we had a whole lot of data, so it was very easy to sort of rebuild it.

613
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,280
We didn't really have a choice.

614
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,520
We didn't rebuild it smartly, because at that point in time,

615
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,080
we had committed to lift and shift and we're like,

616
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,560
crap, we're offline now.

617
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,760
We need to get back online.

618
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,160
That said, in that same aspect I am doing,

619
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,400
my team is starting a a project where we're

620
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,800
we're going to try to build the same thing we did with a massive map

621
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,340
reduce into more of a streaming style, which will mean

622
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,580
it'll mean a bunch of new benefits.

623
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,380
But since the number of problems in the universe is constant,

624
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,060
it'll be a bunch of new problems, too.

625
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,300
So what are some heuristics you use to help determine

626
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,420
say as a migration project falls in your lap?

627
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,840
What do you what do you do to figure out whether to use lift and shift

628
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:56,440
migration versus a either short or quick rewrite migration?

629
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,660
ROI elaborate, please.

630
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:05,810
I just look at OK, so you have two alternatives rewrite or move it.

631
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,750
All right. Well, you just say, well, what's the benefit of both?

632
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,710
If there's absolutely no benefit to either,

633
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,090
then it's going to be whichever one is cheaper.

634
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,370
There's no benefit to either.

635
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,570
Wouldn't the right answer be do nothing?

636
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:26,050
No, if you have to migrate, your choice is lift or shift or re-arc

637
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,880
re-architect. It's in it's it's

638
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:36,160
the system is over here on pillar A and we need it moved to pillar B.

639
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,100
We either move it or we rebuilt it on pillar B.

640
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,340
Right. It did.

641
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,540
You know, the London Bridge is is in Lake Havasu in Nevada.

642
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,300
Not that it was in Arizona, Arizona.

643
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,340
Yeah. Do you know how they moved it there?

644
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,820
Piece by piece.

645
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,020
Yeah, they took it apart and then rebuilt it.

646
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,380
Yeah, just like Legos.

647
00:37:57,380 --> 00:38:01,060
Right. They didn't they didn't get massive helicopters

648
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:04,020
and hook up things and fly it over a hole. Right.

649
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:07,260
That's a case lift and shift wasn't going to work, you're going to say.

650
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,620
If it was a smaller bridge moving a mile downstream,

651
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:14,460
but maybe that would be the better, a better choice. Right.

652
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,740
That's a good metaphor. I'm going to use that sometime.

653
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,140
Moving to, damn it, Ellen.

654
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,500
Damn it, Brent.

655
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,700
Train of thought was already difficult.

656
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,180
I'm sorry for having a conversation.

657
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,820
I forgive you.

658
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,020
I'm low on caffeine, so I'm not going to fight back hard.

659
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:37,940
I'm filled with I'm filled with the bubbles of limoncellulacroix.

660
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:43,690
When I talk about ROI, right, it's it's essentially.

661
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,370
All right. Are there any advancements?

662
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:50,290
Are there any new things we could do with this system or this

663
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:54,730
with this data by doing a re-architecture

664
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,930
and real things like hypothetical, it's like future hypothetical

665
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:03,770
futuristic stuff when people, hey, we should re-architect because one day

666
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,570
somebody I'm like, stop, stop.

667
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,370
No, shit. Oh, yeah.

668
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,730
This this exactly what you're talking about, recognizing

669
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:14,090
our way and getting people to shut up and they go, wouldn't it be cool

670
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,570
if this goes back all the way to our very first conversation?

671
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:23,130
This is why critical thinking and systems thinking are so critical

672
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,970
to solve problems in the world of software and not just knowing

673
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:29,690
the O.N. algorithm for sorting your shoes in your closet.

674
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:34,130
And going back to last episode, why human society is doomed

675
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:39,250
because intellectual laziness is so friggin seductive.

676
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:41,370
This is what I am fighting hard against.

677
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,170
I am a school of the

678
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,650
philosophical learning.

679
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,130
I don't know what to call my school yet, but I have a school

680
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:54,010
and it's about actually paying attention to crap around you

681
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:58,410
and not and not just blindly doing shit like

682
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,440
now I can go in the whole blind faith and the people repeating

683
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,360
the same tropes over and over on LinkedIn, but I'm not going to.

684
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,200
But the reason why they do that is because everyone has limited time.

685
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,680
No one has the ability to research everything on their own at some point in time.

686
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,200
But this is how this is to me.

687
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,120
This is the area where chat GPT is helpful.

688
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,880
I use it for brainstorming, not for solving things.

689
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,880
Not for answers, but to help me think about things in different ways.

690
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,400
But that's that actually sadly is one of the speeches I've been giving.

691
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,760
People is essentially quit trying to make GPT solve your scenario.

692
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,560
Instead, figure out what things it does really well

693
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,840
and change your scenario to take advantage of that.

694
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Yes. Right.

695
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:54,600
It is nearly impossible to get GPT to stop making up shit.

696
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,480
OK, nearly impossible, which means anything that you try to do

697
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:06,190
that is fact driven, it's going to cost you more than the benefit

698
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,350
because you're going to need at least the tech industry

699
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:13,870
because you're going to need people to go through and make sure it didn't lie.

700
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:16,670
You can get an army of fact checkers for GPT.

701
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,390
Right. Sure.

702
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,510
However, it is absolutely the world's best writer of fiction.

703
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:25,760
Absolutely.

704
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,160
And if there are scenarios that are more EQ centric,

705
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,160
again, without building the personality, that's that's the thing

706
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,680
that scares the crap out of me.

707
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,000
You know, did you know and we're all we lost our subject.

708
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,040
Raspus hoping answer your question there somewhere.

709
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,840
But did you know that chat GPT is already listed

710
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,680
as the co-author of several books on Amazon?

711
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,320
I did.

712
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,640
I did.

713
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,040
I'm waiting for chat GPT to get a co-writing credit on a pop hit.

714
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,360
Well, so what is inevitable?

715
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,000
It's inevitable.

716
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,920
Oh, for sure. For sure.

717
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,920
And I don't even know what they're going to do there.

718
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:10,640
Like this, the the humanities,

719
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,480
the humanities are going to take it in the short and curlies.

720
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,440
Let me because I come from this background and my daughter's artist.

721
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,120
Let me share a conversation we have had about A.I.

722
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,160
recently, which is really interesting.

723
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,600
And you're going to roll your eyes a little bit.

724
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,720
But I got to share this.

725
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,440
This is probably mainly from Molly or people that people in our audience

726
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,280
that that get the art side of the tech world.

727
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,960
But I use Dolly image generation to generate my

728
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,160
my cover art for my weekly sub-stack article.

729
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,040
And I started with my daughter about this.

730
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,800
And she said, well, that's your cheating artists out of their out of their art.

731
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,040
I say you should pay them to do that.

732
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,280
I said, I don't know who to pay Dolly.

733
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,120
These A.I. tools, they they get their ideas from art that already exists.

734
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,440
I say if it credited them, I would credit them.

735
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,040
I would pay them.

736
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,700
I would love to make a micro payment or a payment of a dollar or five dollars

737
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,900
that would go make micro payments to everyone this artist derived from.

738
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,520
But it doesn't give you that.

739
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,080
I said, is it a copy of anybody's art?

740
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,700
There's no inspiration, maybe.

741
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,580
But here is the deal.

742
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,300
All art, all art, music, painting, it's all derivative.

743
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,960
It's all derivative.

744
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,800
OK, it's all based on like I say, every rock song is a rip off

745
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,240
of some blues song from 1944. Well, it is.

746
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,000
Well, it is. But it isn't.

747
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
You know, every chord progression has been done.

748
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,040
Flayers of every melody have been done.

749
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:40,400
There are lawsuits all the time because a song sounds kind of like

750
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,960
another song paintings, especially art is when it comes down to art is derivative.

751
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,620
Art isn't the thing.

752
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,140
This is the part that I learned when I was studying all kinds of bizarre

753
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:58,660
anti music in in grad school, especially art isn't the thing.

754
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,060
Art is the audience's reaction to the thing.

755
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:08,280
Oh, OK. So right.

756
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,560
But no, but your daughters, your daughters push back.

757
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,320
Is your your your stealing money from the mouths of the poor artists?

758
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,160
Absolutely. And I know.

759
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,750
And here's the deal. I am.

760
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,230
But but also I could all in one hand, yes, I am.

761
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:28,230
And in a perfect world, I would love to make a payment for that derived art

762
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:31,710
and have that automatically just it's going to sound like blockchain,

763
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,590
but have it go feed all the people that derives from

764
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,710
the same can be said for any sort of music that's derived through A.I.

765
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:43,630
But why don't let's say I'm not using A.I.

766
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,860
and I make a pop song.

767
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,420
There's tools. A.I. can go analyze it and tell me I could write a song today.

768
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,020
I'll write a bad pop song fully original, fully based on melodies

769
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,860
that come to my mind at the time, chord progressions that are based

770
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,780
on standard pop chord progressions.

771
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:04,340
I could record that song badly and then give it to A.I.

772
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,310
to tell me, OK, who do I have to attribute and pay for this song

773
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,070
if I make money off of it?

774
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,510
The A.I. should be able to just go tell me rather than the lawsuits we have today.

775
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:18,150
When I go record something, it sounds a little bit like Stand By Me,

776
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,340
which is probably derivative of something else.

777
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,100
Just hook all art up to the block chain.

778
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,140
So when we make our essentially derivative bit of art, everyone

779
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,740
who I derive that from directly or indirectly, consciously

780
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,900
or subconsciously gets their slice of the pie.

781
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,700
I would love that.

782
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:39,660
Then I can play right alongside with us and it's all fair.

783
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,900
Today, we don't work in that world.

784
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,380
And I would love to pay if there's an artist that for

785
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,540
I would pay five to ten bucks a post.

786
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,780
I don't make any money off my blog post, but I'm happy to give money.

787
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,980
I'm happy to support artists having been one.

788
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:58,340
If there is an artist who on call every Saturday wants to make me

789
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:04,420
a square drawing of a weasel to use in my posts for 10 bucks or so,

790
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,100
let me know until then.

791
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,660
I'm going to cheat and use AI.

792
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,900
Yeah, I don't there.

793
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,940
There's there's a whole set of things coming.

794
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:17,460
Right. It's it's exactly what we just talked about.

795
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,060
It's the number of problems in the universe is constant.

796
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,100
It is. It is.

797
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,860
So really what I'm connecting here is there has not been an ethical

798
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,800
use yet of block chain.

799
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:37,600
But wouldn't it be the solution to help make sure that because they want

800
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:41,280
to use block chain and FTS to help make sure derivative art for

801
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,040
in the digital world are always attributed to the owner or creator of that art.

802
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:51,660
Why don't we apply that same thing to to real world forms of art

803
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:56,500
now that we have the AI that can analyze them and figure out from a from a

804
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:01,260
again, potentially we have the AI to potentially analyze the potential

805
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:06,380
database of all potential previous art forms, figure out where the derivation comes from.

806
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,380
Yeah, I don't.

807
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,620
So my my daughter is an artist as well.

808
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,860
She and I have had this conversation of versions of it.

809
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:20,130
And I think if any AI art generating

810
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:26,790
AI got accused of that, I don't know how it's going to be trackable.

811
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,700
Right. Well, because I agree.

812
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:36,020
I agree. But potentially, I mean, this solves the lawsuit problem in music

813
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:41,180
and it solves it and it helps understand the the challenge that everything is.

814
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,300
I mean, I don't know if everyone realizes this, but everything is

815
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:50,180
at the very least an unconscious, unintentional derivative of something

816
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:53,940
has happened before. Well, so you've seen all the different comedians

817
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,500
who have to do the fun little thing by playing the 1642 16451

818
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,260
chord progression and then showing, look at all the songs that fit this.

819
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,140
Yeah, there's a reason for that because there's songs people

820
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:05,500
who make some smile when they hear on the radio.

821
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,940
Well, and then the other thing, too, I was listening on the radio today

822
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,260
that I didn't pick up what I did is but an AI is able to identify

823
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,820
the patterns to what makes a happy song.

824
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,380
Of course. Absolutely. Right.

825
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,620
It goes apparently verse, chorus, verse, chorus, and it has whistles.

826
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:28,620
And right. And it's like it it can generate a recipe. Right.

827
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:32,820
And once once you understand the patterns of things,

828
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:38,620
which is what these AIs do, all they do is just understand patterns. Right.

829
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,940
But what they don't have and I would deepen this thing.

830
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:44,900
We do need to close here is, for example, they're going to have

831
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:50,220
the most common patterns, but they don't have the the new ones to detect,

832
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,340
like, oh, we should close on a double chorus here.

833
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:55,540
No, the way this song is going, we should close on the bridge

834
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,020
and little things, those little things are different.

835
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:01,660
The general pattern is the same. Put it this way.

836
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,620
Like I took theory, of course, music theory in college, and we spent

837
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:09,660
a year and a half study mastering the rules and then six months,

838
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,620
three months learning how to break them.

839
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,820
The true create the art comes in breaking the rules in creative ways.

840
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,420
I mean, the the art being the better reaction from the audience.

841
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,860
So what AI will blow free AI will give you the general pattern that works.

842
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,660
It will generally work.

843
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:26,940
But anyone can write.

844
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,120
There are so many general pop songs that aren't important.

845
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,240
They're not good. They don't inspire anything.

846
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,040
The ones that do the ones that catch you are the ones that just go

847
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:42,120
that they color just enough outside the lines to get you.

848
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,320
And then if you're an artist, you if you follow certain artists,

849
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,840
I could go to a whole music show here, but you will see

850
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:53,800
they will use certain fundamental musical elements over and over

851
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,440
in their songs to generate reaction.

852
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,640
They've seen happen before the half step up key change, the

853
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,000
the the vocal drop of, you know, up a second down to six

854
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,840
that a lot of popular people do over and over and over and over.

855
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,920
They'll use those thematic elements because they know they work,

856
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,800
but they only work for them.

857
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,600
So you can't copy it if you're a different artist.

858
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,920
It doesn't just doesn't work as well.

859
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,040
All right.

860
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,680
Anyway, how do we get here?

861
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,600
I don't know, but this was a fun podcast.

862
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,360
Anything else you want to add before we close?

863
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,520
I just want to say you mentioned derivative, but it occurs to me.

864
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,000
It's something more than a new idea.

865
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,080
And where do ideas come from?

866
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,640
So, yeah, what you're saying is in a roundabout way,

867
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,880
all new ideas derive from old ideas.

868
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,040
That's what I'm saying as well.

869
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,040
Yeah, everything's derivative.

870
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,480
Exactly. And if everything is the name of my album,

871
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,920
when I record an album of this AI generated bullshit,

872
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,480
I'm going to call it everything is derivative. Fantastic.

873
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,840
Songs to soothe by Alan Page.

874
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,720
So if everything is derivative, I don't know.

875
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,080
I don't know how the eyes ever going to be sued for this.

876
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,640
Like, go for it.

877
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,360
I don't want I don't want the AI to be sued.

878
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,520
I want the AI to make sure people can get paid.

879
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,680
I want artists to get paid.

880
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,200
Yeah, I don't want to use AI to make sure it happens.

881
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:17,080
I don't know how it will do that, but I don't know either.

882
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,880
I'm just saying what I want.

883
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:19,720
Fair enough.

884
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,000
I also want pink bunnies to fly out of my butt.

885
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,680
Why would you want that?

886
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,960
I don't know. I just said it.

887
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,840
OK, that's all for this time.

888
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,360
We'll talk again next time.

889
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,920
We can talk about like how I quit my job.

890
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,760
I'm Alan. I'm Brent. Bye.
