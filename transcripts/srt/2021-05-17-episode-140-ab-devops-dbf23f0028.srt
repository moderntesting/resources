00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,460
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,820
Now, on with the show.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,780
Hey everybody, welcome to the AB Testing Podcast.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,660
I'm Alan.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,940
I'm Brent.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:30,380
And it is a beautiful sunny Friday afternoon here in the Pacific Northwest.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,660
Push an 80 today, I think, right?

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,780
Oh, shit.

11
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,780
That's Fahrenheit.

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,810
Yeah, I know.

13
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:44,010
It's, it's, uh, I've been having trouble sleeping lately because my, it's been too hot in the

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,010
bedroom.

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,580
Title of your sex tape.

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,700
Uh, yeah, it's completely, uh, yeah.

17
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:54,900
Dog and I took a hike to poo poo point yesterday.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,900
Um, what?

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,900
Poo poo point.

20
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm not familiar with it.

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,020
Is this some place in your neck of the woods?

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,020
It is.

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,700
Uh, if you ever driven by Issaquah or the Kwa, as the kids call it, you ever see the, uh,

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,860
the parachuters floating around?

25
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,990
No.

26
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,990
South of I-90.

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,710
There's a hill they just, they just run and jump off of.

28
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,710
Oh, really?

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,810
Yeah.

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,810
So it's pretty cool.

31
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,810
Good little hike.

32
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,650
That's, that's why it's called poo poo point.

33
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,650
No, I know.

34
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,050
And then I don't know if you saw, there was someone during the pandemic, someone bicycle

35
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,250
for the fun of it.

36
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:32,690
They decided they were going to bicycle from poo poo point in Issaquah to PP Creek in like

37
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,010
Iowa.

38
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,850
Just cause they thought it was funny.

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,970
I I, I, uh, I appreciate that humor.

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,290
Yeah, but it was good.

41
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,050
So on one side is they take off and you can see the lake and all the way toward it.

42
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,770
And then just, you kind of cut down.

43
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,130
There's another clearing on the other side where you can see all the way to Mount Rainier.

44
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,130
So that's pretty cool.

45
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,930
But anyway, we did that.

46
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,930
Yeah.

47
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,850
Anything else big and cool going on in your world?

48
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:12,520
I, uh, as of last week, I am a proud dad of a graduated, um, student.

49
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,400
My eldest is, is done with his bachelor's.

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:26,240
He, he double majored in psychology as well as creative writing, uh, forced him to take

51
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,440
the bachelor of science version of psychology.

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,680
So it was heavily math driven by the way.

53
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Yeah.

54
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,200
Have your kids, your kids gone up to college yet?

55
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,800
Uh, my oldest is in running start.

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,280
So he's, he's basically college.

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Yeah.

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,720
So one of the deals I made with, with, uh, my kids.

59
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,240
So we have, what's the Washington get?

60
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
What's this?

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,680
That the wacky number, that's like a five oh two eight seven program.

62
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,480
I don't, I don't remember where you can pre sort of buy credits for college.

63
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
Yeah.

64
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,080
The Washington one is kind of weird and sucky.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,600
We actually invest ours in New York's program, but you can use the money anywhere.

66
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,510
Oh, I I'm, I've been very happy with the Washington one, but I honestly didn't, I

67
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:15,270
haven't done much of a cross compare to determine if my decision was something I should regret.

68
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,470
Anyway, one of the things I've told, told both of my boys that are in college is essentially

69
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,870
I have the money put away to pay for your degree, but there's a condition.

70
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,710
You can pick any major you want, any major you want, but it has to be a bachelor of science.

71
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,710
Okay.

72
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,710
I'm out of your family.

73
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,870
I have, I have bachelor of, I know my master's is, is masters in music, but as my bachelor,

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,430
it's a bachelor of arts and music education.

75
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,620
Yep.

76
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,300
And a bachelor and a bachelor of music and music composition.

77
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,860
I double majored as well.

78
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,300
My son started off, he got applied, he got into the psych program.

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:02,620
He's done exceptionally well there, but he has a real passion for, for, for creative writing.

80
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,260
And one day he called me up.

81
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,700
He's like, dad, I'm just telling you, transparently, I found a loophole in your strategy and I've

82
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,980
already executed on it.

83
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,700
And I said, okay, what's this loophole?

84
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:19,220
He's like, you said, you said I have to graduate with a BS.

85
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,300
And I'm like, yeah, that's right.

86
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,540
He's like, okay, well I'm double majoring in my creative writing degree is going to be

87
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,540
a BA.

88
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,580
And I said, son, good for you.

89
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,100
Like, like,

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
Very cool.

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,620
I am always big fan of people getting a degree in the humanities.

92
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,690
Good for him.

93
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,690
Well, he's winning.

94
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,290
He got, he got two degrees in the humanities.

95
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,530
I do think psychology counts, even though it is a BS.

96
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,970
The thing I, I was trying to balance him out with and he's, he generally tends towards

97
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,690
the humanities, but I wanted to balance them out with because there's a large degree of

98
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,890
humanity majors.

99
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,010
In my view, you can't really make a living with.

100
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,890
Well, and again, if you want me on that soapbox, you don't go to a university as a vocational

101
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,890
school.

102
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:15,250
If you want to go to school to get a job, go to a vocational school, go to a university

103
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,570
to learn critical thinking and how to learn.

104
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,530
Of course, there are going to be some skills that are going to help you land a job, but

105
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:29,370
I think you are better suited and more adaptable to different kinds of work with a humanities

106
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,370
degree.

107
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,170
As long as you have the supporting other education to get, it's so hard to get a job out of

108
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:40,230
college, but I, I do not believe that a university is a vocational school.

109
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:48,290
So I do not buy this argument of what are you going to do with a creative writing degree?

110
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,690
And maybe, maybe he writes 75 novels.

111
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,850
Who knows?

112
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,850
Uh, who knows?

113
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,850
Who knows?

114
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,810
Um, and I don't want to waste the whole podcast because many things have stuff to talk about.

115
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:06,200
What are we, I'm going to edit all the things, many of the things you just said, I, I, unlike

116
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,240
the other topics we're going to get to many of the things you just said, I disagree with,

117
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
but okay.

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,360
Well, yeah, it just means that you're wrong.

119
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,880
So let's get on with the podcast and cause I'm very passionate about this and it's because

120
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
I'm right.

121
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,520
So anyway, uh, are you ready?

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,520
Can we go on?

123
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,880
Can we, can we hit topic numero uno?

124
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Yes.

125
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,960
Topic numero uno.

126
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:37,640
This week I spoke at testing festival, a large online test conference and I didn't really

127
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
speak.

128
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,120
I spoke at it, but what I did is a couple things I want to talk to you about and share

129
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
with our listeners.

130
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,160
Cause it's all about modern testing.

131
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,160
I did two things back to back.

132
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,680
First thing was I gave a talk, but I gave the talk last week.

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,200
No, I gave it to my dog last week.

134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,720
I recorded it.

135
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,120
I was going to put the link in my, the it's on YouTube and I was going to put the link

136
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,220
in my five for Friday, but it's still unlisted and I didn't want to undermine any plans.

137
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,900
The testing festival folks had for a larger unveiling of the talks.

138
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,940
My talk is on YouTube and I'll share it at some point, but the talk was all about principle

139
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,180
number, which way, uh, shoot, which one's about a quality culture?

140
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,180
I almost said five, but five is about customer data.

141
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,940
It's like four, right?

142
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,220
Remember when we used to have memorized?

143
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
So bad.

144
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,220
So bad.

145
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,220
I shouldn't look that up.

146
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
Yeah.

147
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,460
I'm pretty certain that we have all of the controversial ones memorized.

148
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,460
We do.

149
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,260
We know the ones people complain about, but here's the thing, Alan, and I'll do it for

150
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,500
you right now.

151
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,060
The way you can answer this question is simply by going to modern testing.org.

152
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,760
Yes.

153
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,880
And at modern testing.org, which is the one that talks about a quality culture?

154
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,640
Oh, you did it.

155
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Nice job.

156
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Number four.

157
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Yeah.

158
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,280
That's because I'm right yet again.

159
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:15,320
Uh, I gave a talk on leading a quality culture and introducing the quality culture guide.

160
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,120
And it's just a, just a 25 minute talk.

161
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,840
I gave a little bit of an intro on how it came about.

162
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't go through the whole thing.

163
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,120
I talked about the low level and the high level of the transition guide talked about

164
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,280
why I don't like maturity models.

165
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,480
I think it's a pretty good talk primarily because I was able to edit it a little bit

166
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,680
before I submitted it to take out the crummy parts.

167
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
And that worked out very well.

168
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,160
So that was the talk I gave.

169
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,000
And we had someone join our slack after that talk and say, Oh yeah, I've been, I've been

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,640
looking for a, what we always hear.

171
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,120
I've been looking for a name for what we've been doing and it was cool.

172
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
Uh, welcome.

173
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Welcome to our community.

174
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,360
So anyway, that talk, uh, nothing new here.

175
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,720
It's really me going over the quality culture transition guide and with some intro to prep,

176
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,160
like how it came about and why I think it's important for the audience there in hindsight,

177
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,520
as I got to know them during the panel discussion, maybe just reminding them that quality is a

178
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,740
lot more than testing, which you and I get, and I think our regular listeners get, but

179
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:33,220
man, I'm never, I don't have a lack of surprise on how others forget or live in a different

180
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,220
world than we do.

181
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,620
I always wonder about the size of the bubble we live in.

182
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Yeah.

183
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:44,620
It's interesting to do sort of checks like, so one question, I think you began the answer

184
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,580
to it is so they obviously you recorded it.

185
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,980
They obviously had some sort of, I'm guessing a scheduled time where, or somebody clicked

186
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,610
the button and played it back.

187
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,010
How was sort of feedback or interaction?

188
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,010
Did that happen?

189
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:06,930
So it, so good segue and you didn't plan it to be, but so the way it worked out was

190
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,930
I did a panel discussion with, uh, Alan Richardson, Alan number one, or Scottish Alan, depending

191
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:18,730
how you want to refer to him and, uh, dot Graham, Dorothy Graham and Paul Gerard both

192
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,890
facilitated and took part in the panel afterwards.

193
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:29,680
And we took some questions there and somewhere about the quality culture, but a lot were fun

194
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,720
because I got to disagree with the other panelists and that's always a good time for me.

195
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,640
Uh, well, it was fun.

196
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
Go ahead, go ahead.

197
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Ask questions.

198
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
I'm gonna tell you all the fun I had.

199
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,240
Did you have, cause here's what I'm imagining.

200
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm imagining you got to do an encore to the modern test manager versus traditional test

201
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
manager.

202
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Wasn't that bad?

203
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,920
Like you were over the top well-rehearsed excellent.

204
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,440
So there was no encore.

205
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,800
So it wasn't like that.

206
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Okay.

207
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,040
They pushed my, some of the questions just teed up things we've been talking about.

208
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,040
For example, there was a question around will ML replace testing?

209
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,960
And I got to roll my eyes, but also get on my little soapbox about how the, the new

210
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,560
record and playback automated testing tools have changed my mind about the value of recording

211
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,560
playback.

212
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,240
And I actually think that it's a better way to do your UI automation than actually writing

213
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,400
crap.

214
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,000
And so I got to, I got to go on that whole set.

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Wait, wait, wait.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,680
So that one, that one based off of how you said it last time, it's because of the

217
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
ML.

218
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,840
Absolutely.

219
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,160
It's not, it's not, it's yeah.

220
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:57,240
Every, every single year, some every day, someone's worried about the robots taking away their jobs.

221
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,360
I remember listening to the radio 10 years ago and Amazon's warehouse is going to have

222
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,900
some robots, which they do that automate some of their picking for shipping and people were

223
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
freaking out.

224
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,060
Oh, people are going to lose their jobs.

225
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,620
Now there's always more stuff to do.

226
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,020
So let's automate the boring stuff.

227
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,860
So that was one, but another one was, but someone brought up the whole testing as information

228
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,330
providers.

229
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:32,310
And I marched right up to the top of my soapbox and went off for a little bit on exactly

230
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,650
what you think I would go off on.

231
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,410
And then there was a reply and the best part was on the reply, Alan Richardson said, I

232
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:42,890
think you're digging yourself deeper into your hole, not me to them.

233
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,130
It was good.

234
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:50,890
Was with that group, it was a very respectful debate because those are all those people

235
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,890
get it.

236
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,250
They, they see different points of view.

237
00:12:53,250 --> 00:13:00,050
They don't dig in their heels and talk about epistemology or social sciences and how I'm

238
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,490
wrong because I haven't studied the right books.

239
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,770
It was actually a respectful debate around what we see and people bending in the right

240
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,650
places to understand different contexts.

241
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:18,890
So it was actually really cool, but I got to dissent and bring in my new view or my our

242
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,610
view of modern testing within that panel discussion, which was a ton of fun.

243
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:27,690
I am looking forward to that.

244
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,210
Yeah, I don't know if they, if they, hopefully they recorded that and they're going to

245
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,250
share that part too.

246
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,130
Well, you said it was up on YouTube.

247
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,410
No, my, my 25 minute talk is on YouTube.

248
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:40,890
I do not know if they recorded the panel discussion.

249
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,050
Hopefully they did.

250
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,400
That's where all the, that's the money.

251
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,400
I know.

252
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,240
I know one wants to hear you babble on again about the same recorded it from my end.

253
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Like I'm just going to press record on what I could have done.

254
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,720
Yeah, there were, it was fun.

255
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,760
It was your typical questions.

256
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:04,120
And I wish I still had them in front of me, but maybe I should dig out a copy.

257
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,640
They're on some site somewhere and you and I can do another round of traditional

258
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,600
test manager versus modern test manager answering the questions.

259
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,960
And this time I get to play the traditional.

260
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:15,410
All right.

261
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,610
But I did a pretty good job being traditional.

262
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:23,890
And I can't remember who brought this up or where it came up, but I'm still

263
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:31,490
surprised how many people really, really, really hate the test automation

264
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,410
pyramid because it's upside down and backwards.

265
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,010
No.

266
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,890
And, and again, I brought up my point and actually, and if people don't like it,

267
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,770
cause I get why they don't like it.

268
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,980
And mostly it's because you can't always make your tests fit that model.

269
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,260
But again, my insight that I came up with, I'm not sure, I'm sure I'm not the

270
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,060
first one, but it really made sense to me when I realized the testing pyramid

271
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:02,300
reflects the number of tests you have when your application is well-designed.

272
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,620
Often you're writing more and more UI automation tests when your application

273
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,060
is designed because you have to test the logic in the UI.

274
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,100
Right.

275
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,540
Right.

276
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,880
It's essentially they're designing the tests for the world where you don't

277
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
need the tests in some regards.

278
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,920
I talked about also, I can't remember in which context, but I just brought up

279
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,950
monitoring a lot and customer data, which nobody looks at.

280
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:37,750
Well, I shouldn't say nobody.

281
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,510
There's a whole, it was just people on the other side of the bubble.

282
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,150
So that leads, and that'll be fun.

283
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,510
If there is a, like, if there is a recording of that.

284
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,140
Panel, I will, I will definitely share it.

285
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:58,390
You said who was on the panel, you, Dorothy Graham and Alan Richardson and Paul.

286
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,470
Dorothy Graham.

287
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,430
Yeah, it's interesting.

288
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,510
You should have brought up the ISTQB.

289
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,150
ISTQB came up.

290
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,790
There was a question, are certifications important?

291
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,590
And of course she was involved very early on in that.

292
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:20,230
And I, so I was wanting to be respectful, but everyone had their say and they, and I

293
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,910
wasn't going to say anything, but then Paul called on me and said, what do you

294
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,430
think about this?

295
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,870
I said, look, I have no certifications.

296
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,670
I think the courses behind the certifications, this is my, actually my

297
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,960
true feeling, but I was able to phrase it in a way that I think went over well.

298
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,320
I said, but the courses are not about teaching testing.

299
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,320
They've become a way to teach people to pass a test and get, and get people a

300
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,720
certification that may or not be worth anything.

301
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,960
And it feels like the primary outcome of the certification is not better testers.

302
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,280
It's about making money for ISTQB.

303
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,320
The value to me is not worth, not worth what you get out of it.

304
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,360
And Dorothy acknowledged that they turned into a moneymaking, I'll say scam here.

305
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,560
I wouldn't say it for out of respect.

306
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,480
I wouldn't say that there, but it turned, it's turned into a moneymaking scam.

307
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,840
Like you were, I mean, you remember when I asked you ISTQB questions on the,

308
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,560
yes, they're ridiculous and they're dumb and they don't, they're just stupid.

309
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,640
And I'm all for testing.

310
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,360
And if, and if you're trying to hire some junior tester and, and you think if you

311
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,080
get a certification, you'll think they'll be better, that's all great.

312
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,320
But to charge you what they do for that is it's just ridiculous.

313
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
It's just ridiculous.

314
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,800
It's a total industry scam.

315
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,260
And

316
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,820
Alan.

317
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,620
Well, now what happened?

318
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,300
Yeah.

319
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,060
No, I was just thinking through.

320
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,060
Oh my God.

321
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,820
Uh, how do, how do I say this?

322
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,220
We're on air cogently.

323
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:03,010
You know, you know why we are seeing basically modern testing ghosts.

324
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,010
We see it growing, but we see it grow so slowly.

325
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,010
It's because of big test.

326
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:14,250
Big test is actually suppressing the new ideas.

327
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,960
I'm trying to construct a new, I hear you're looking at me like, I know, I know.

328
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,920
This is the dumbest thing.

329
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:28,990
People can, there's the thing we will never do a modern testing certification.

330
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,590
There's a great course you can take if you are a ministry of testing pro member.

331
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,980
So do that, but I'm never going to never going to be a certification.

332
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,220
It's all about just helping people navigate as their world is changing.

333
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,990
And more and more, when I give these talks, even if people in that other

334
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,710
world, their world is changing and more and more, we're finding people who have

335
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,430
our, their world's already changed and we'll help navigate the downside too.

336
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:04,920
The, the more we can help people be informed or prepared when the world

337
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,750
does, when their world does change, uh, the better I that's what I forgot

338
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,830
to say something.

339
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,280
Yeah.

340
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,040
We're old.

341
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,400
That happens all the time.

342
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,720
It's even better.

343
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,800
The next test bash home, 24 hours of test talks is coming up in June and I'm

344
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,600
doing an ask me anything on the future of automation.

345
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm going to fuck that shit up.

346
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,240
I can show you the future of automation.

347
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,240
I am going to shake the world.

348
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
So you want to get into test automation.

349
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
Do you now?

350
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you?

351
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,480
No, look, I look, all right.

352
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,480
Here's how we get.

353
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:55,880
All right.

354
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,720
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm now thinking through.

355
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,880
Brett is now the wheels.

356
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,680
I can, I can smell coming through zoom.

357
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,480
We need, we need a test automation certification.

358
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,200
No, there are, we need a test automation certification.

359
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,560
We like a modern testing test automation certification because test

360
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,840
automation certifications exist and they suck.

361
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,920
No, no, we're going to provide one.

362
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,560
Okay.

363
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,000
And all you need to do to do this, number one, we'll create, I don't know,

364
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,840
create a video.

365
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,100
Okay.

366
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:36,780
It's like a five minute video show, showing how to download the dominant tools

367
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,580
and how to set it up to do click and record.

368
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:48,730
And then, then at the end of it, it's a test to, can you accurately

369
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,690
repeat back to, to our certification program, the, the URL where you

370
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:59,050
download the tool and if you can, you've passed the modern testing

371
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,370
automation certification.

372
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,050
All right.

373
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,560
No, no.

374
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,500
Hey, uh, I don't know.

375
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:07,820
Yeah.

376
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,420
I love that.

377
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:08,940
That's happening.

378
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,220
Let's do a quick hold the cow twice in a row.

379
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,060
Last time.

380
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,260
I don't know if you've heard, I couldn't find my original mail bag sound.

381
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,620
I didn't make a brand new one.

382
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,300
And so I had a little fun with that and I don't know if it's on my other computer.

383
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,940
No, I got a new Mac long story.

384
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,460
Anyway, got to find my mail bag sound.

385
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,700
It is mail bag time mail bag.

386
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:33,900
All right.

387
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,340
And, uh, this is from, uh, our friend global warming, Andreas warm.

388
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:42,380
Uh, he says, so BDD.

389
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,940
Right.

390
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,540
Is that anything you think about or are you more data driven needle moving?

391
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,300
And BDD might be something teams are using to get results, but that

392
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,460
doesn't really affect you.

393
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,900
Question mark.

394
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,760
So really he's saying, guys, what are your opinions on B D D?

395
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,590
Which is of course Brent's.

396
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,160
I can't think of anything clever on Brent driven development

397
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,600
or B a V your driven development.

398
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,600
So have you done BDD Brent?

399
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,400
Uh, I have tried doing BDD.

400
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,440
I, I, I find TDD easier.

401
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,640
The, the problem with BDD is, is the construct, right?

402
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,770
The given went then is, is very, it's a very clean thing, but it's not natural.

403
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,190
There you go.

404
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,150
Okay.

405
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,710
Let me give you a different opinion.

406
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,430
Okay.

407
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,870
Cause I actually find it both valuable and dumb depending on how you use it.

408
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:43,350
And here's the deal.

409
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,600
BDD is excellent.

410
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,840
And to me, 99% of the value comes from thinking about the

411
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,680
behavior of your software and the outcomes you want from it before you

412
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,440
begin to write it or your, or your feature or whatever you're creating.

413
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,000
Yes.

414
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:00,480
Given.

415
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:00,640
Yeah.

416
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,760
And so that part super valuable.

417
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,320
The automation part just feeds into what I call the industry

418
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,560
fatuation with end to end testing.

419
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,280
And there are tools, of course, all the gherkin tools that you

420
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
automate all this stuff.

421
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,320
I don't care if you automate it.

422
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,240
I got the most value at a BDD when we just defined the behaviors up front and

423
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,680
made sure we did that as part of our requirements gathering or planning.

424
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,760
Planning that requirements gathering and skip the automated stuff.

425
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,280
Didn't care.

426
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,800
So we'd automate anyway, but I wouldn't worry about automating

427
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,640
those given to end then tests, but getting the team to agree and

428
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,080
elaborate on those behaviors ahead of time as part of planning.

429
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
Massively valuable.

430
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,560
It helped people focus on not over-developing or undeveloping.

431
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,080
They focused on exactly what the thing had to do, help them figure out.

432
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,480
It just so much alignment came from that.

433
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:06,320
If you think of BDD as essentially a breakdown, this is how I view it.

434
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,420
The BDD, the things that you're creating ultimately are, they're very aligned

435
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:18,340
with user stories, but on a very focused behavioral basis.

436
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,290
Yeah.

437
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,210
I agree with you.

438
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,330
Thinking through it is absolutely valuable.

439
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,810
I don't know.

440
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:29,290
To me, it, in terms of turning it into a unit test, it feels a

441
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,250
bit overhead ish.

442
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,460
Yeah.

443
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:32,820
Okay.

444
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,700
I mean, you for different reasons, but it doesn't turn into a unit test, turns

445
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,420
into some, some flavor of end to end or integration acceptance test.

446
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,780
And I'm all for automating acceptance tests.

447
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:50,620
I think if the, if the focus of BDD is on the behavior, so I don't like

448
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,460
behavior driven development, I just like, I don't care about the, well, it

449
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,700
is behavior driven development, even if I only think about the behavior, I don't

450
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,220
automate it.

451
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,340
It's someone decided, Oh, and we can automate this stuff too.

452
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,690
And people get focused on the automation and that's not where the value is.

453
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:10,370
It could help, but it's not where the value is for me.

454
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,250
Yeah.

455
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:17,050
In terms of both BDD or TDD, like the biggest value of that is to drive

456
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:24,490
a thoughtful process that, that forces you to number one, get, get your

457
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,090
tests done upfront.

458
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:34,010
Uh, number two, which is the biggest value, which is to design your classes.

459
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,970
Better in some regards.

460
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,930
I don't really care if people go with BDD or TDD.

461
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:44,410
People, if you, whatever technique you want to make sure that you think about

462
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,570
what little bit of ready aim fire versus ready fire aim, think a little bit

463
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,690
about what you're trying to accomplish before you race off to the compiler.

464
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:53,330
That's all.

465
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,240
Yeah.

466
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:55,760
Yeah.

467
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,680
And then in part of global global vermin's, uh, question was, is that anything

468
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,320
you think about or are you more data-driven and needle moving and what, how

469
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:14,000
did you interpret the or cause to me it's both.

470
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,760
Yeah.

471
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,560
I, I, those aren't, those aren't, yeah.

472
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:21,480
I, I kind of ignored that cause I didn't, I didn't think about it that much, but

473
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,680
we are more data-driven and I'm always moving that needle.

474
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:31,590
What I do is I, I, my role, actually I'm managing so many damn people and I don't

475
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,350
even get to do much coaching anymore, but, uh, showing it as an option.

476
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,860
If people do planning, because one of the things I do a lot and now I've

477
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,140
delegated most of that is helping teams understand how to do better planning.

478
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,900
Because we believe our engineers should own their own project management.

479
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,220
So part of helping them think about how to do their estimates and

480
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,060
planning is frequently I'll walk through what BDD is and I'll give them

481
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,620
my same speech, the values and the behavior, not in the automation, and

482
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,740
they can use it if they want.

483
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,740
Right.

484
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,180
It's, um, completely agree.

485
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,580
I do think, again, the value proposition in my mind is, is you think through it.

486
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,180
I, I'm still connecting the dots to the data-driven and needle move.

487
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,380
To me, having a good design of your architecture is needle moving.

488
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,210
It, it, it, because I've experienced it over and over again.

489
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,570
It's, it's, um, replating architecture because you did something screwed

490
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,290
up in the first place is hard.

491
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,610
So any, anything that gives you a tool that helps you to go, like

492
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,650
you've said it before, devs are lazy, right?

493
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,930
Anything that says, okay, how can I design this way?

494
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,090
So I don't have, I have to do less work later.

495
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,050
Hey, Brett, you know what the sound is?

496
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,400
No.

497
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,560
That's us beating the dead horse.

498
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,400
So I have one other topic, which is open ended and maybe fun.

499
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,480
Okay.

500
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:07,080
Let's talk about DevOps.

501
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,320
Okay.

502
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,660
What the hell is DevOps?

503
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,540
So first of all, uh, let me get into the three ways that DevOps first,

504
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,780
which we've talked about before on here.

505
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,700
So there's the three ways that DevOps, a gene came up with.

506
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,380
The first way is all about flow and systems thinking that's modern testing.

507
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,710
The second way is to amplify the feedback loops, a little bit of modern testing.

508
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,910
And the third way is build a culture of continual experimentation and learning.

509
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,430
Also modern testing.

510
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:47,200
So on one hand, lots of parallels between the, what we think about

511
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,880
modern testing and three ways of DevOps.

512
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,350
But I noticed some interesting parallels this week in, I saw an article come out

513
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:59,870
and, and I can't even remember what it was, but I realized something and I tweeted

514
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,230
it and it was one of those things where I tweeted, people said, uh, yeah, Alan,

515
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:10,890
you just noticed some things now, which is that, well, Brett, what is DevOps?

516
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:17,810
Well, the way you described it DevOps honestly is nothing more than CICD.

517
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,410
And then I'm thinking through that.

518
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:24,810
You were around in the old days of, and we had this definitely in the early

519
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:30,610
2000s at Microsoft where we built some services and we chucked them over the

520
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:33,530
wall for operations to deploy and maintain.

521
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,250
So, so where did DevOps come from?

522
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:41,450
And that's essentially this brand new concept where Dev owns the

523
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,970
operation of the crap that they built.

524
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:44,330
Yeah.

525
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:44,770
Right.

526
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,410
So DevOps was originally introduced.

527
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:53,050
Well, it's introduced as a culture where the wall between developer

528
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,250
and operations is non-existent.

529
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:55,810
Right.

530
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,930
In many ways, like my view is it enables a, you build it, you run it culture.

531
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,510
All good.

532
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:10,570
But what I've seen more and more, which scares me is people will have a team

533
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,130
will have a DevOps person or a DevOps team.

534
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:19,250
And what that DevOps team does is the operational stuff we saw people do 20

535
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,690
years ago at Microsoft, they're an operations team, they're calling them

536
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:27,010
DevOps and it scares me because it it's backward.

537
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,130
And if we look at what DevOps does, you know what it does?

538
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:36,210
It accelerates the achievement of shippable quality, accelerate, we're

539
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,050
talking about feedback loops and amplifying feedback loops and

540
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,450
cultural experimentation as DevOps.

541
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,690
That's also modern testing.

542
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,450
Uh, it, I don't know.

543
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:52,930
I mean, accelerating the achievement of shippable quality, that's a big umbrella.

544
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,210
Right.

545
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,570
It's it's, there's a lot of things, right?

546
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,690
But what I'm saying is two things.

547
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,450
One is your DevOps team does not exist to do your operations for

548
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,610
you or to do your DevOps for you.

549
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,570
Well, no.

550
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,130
So the problem is, is that they probably do.

551
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:09,930
The bullet prop.

552
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,370
Well, I know the problem is you have a DevOps team, but I think DevOps has,

553
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,050
it's become the fancy name for an infrastructure team.

554
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:23,370
You often, especially like the scale of unity, we need a team that can do

555
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,650
the high level management of our cloud platform, our CI CD systems, uh, to

556
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,410
make sure everyone, make sure we have some consistency available in what

557
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:35,290
CI pipelines you use, how you get your code deployed.

558
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,530
We don't want everyone to have to invent their own stuff, but

559
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:41,890
definitely it's the you build it, you run it culture.

560
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:54,100
I think like a team, a team called the DevOps team, in my view, their job should

561
00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:02,930
be not to operate the, the code, the devs servicing, but their job, but much

562
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,210
like what we talked about with modern testing, their job is to construct,

563
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,650
maintain and encourage the DevOps culture.

564
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,290
Right.

565
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,850
Well, what I'm seeing, not just in the three ways being similar to the

566
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,730
principles or the intent we have with the principles, I'm seeing a lot more

567
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:26,170
parallels between, and again, I think having a DevOps team can be a little

568
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,850
bit of a, little bit of a smell, depending on what they actually do.

569
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:37,170
But we talk about teams not needing a dedicated QA person in modern testing.

570
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:46,370
I think like the way my team's function is we have high functioning teams with

571
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:53,130
deploying dozens of times a day and with very, very little interaction or even

572
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,890
questions from my team, they're basically function there.

573
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,090
They don't need our help.

574
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,970
They're, they're running everything on their own.

575
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,330
Some teams need a little bit more handholding and they'll all get there, but

576
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:08,280
they don't need a dedicated, and again, we wouldn't embed someone

577
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:12,280
on their team, like with a tester, but they don't need dedicated DevOps help.

578
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,840
They haven't figured out they actually have adopted the culture completely.

579
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:21,560
So my team exists to help people get to that culture of DevOps and

580
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,200
get to that culture of quality.

581
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:23,840
Okay.

582
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,720
Lots of paral, I've been thinking about this, lots of parallels.

583
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:33,600
So I don't think AB DevOps has the right sound.

584
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,120
So we'll stick with AB testing.

585
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,240
Yeah.

586
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,960
C like we go ABC DevOps.

587
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,240
We, Oh, what if we brought someone with a letter C onto the podcast?

588
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,080
Uh, I, I've told you before, we should just rename to AB checking.

589
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Yes.

590
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,680
Cause that's important.

591
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,280
Then, then you have your ABCD.

592
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
I took a little dig in my testing festival talk.

593
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,840
Once it's out, you'll see it.

594
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,080
I talk about loud voices and stuff.

595
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,640
You talk about loud voices in testing, throwing out models because

596
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,440
well, yeah, actually, uh, Steve Rowe.

597
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,910
And I think he talked, I think one of the times it's been a long time.

598
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,230
We should bring him back.

599
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,750
What's he doing now?

600
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:25,310
We should have him back on and find out checking in with Steve.

601
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:33,150
But he, he talked about how, uh, one of those loud voices was just

602
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:36,390
riddled with lot logical fallacies.

603
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,270
Oh, yeah.

604
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,310
I know, I know exactly.

605
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,790
Yes.

606
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,040
I just ignore, I mean, I try to ignore it, but it's fun to pick at it too.

607
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,280
The nice thing, the nice thing about the three, right?

608
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,760
Uh, I don't know if you paid attention to the thread on the Slack channel, but

609
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,440
I was getting, I was getting geared up.

610
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:01,920
Um, uh, to, to like this, this whole language debate on testing versus checking.

611
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,080
It's dumb and it just needs to go away.

612
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,360
And I was getting all riled up and go, okay, how do I help make this go away?

613
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,320
But the three men, this is one of the things I really love about our community.

614
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,200
The three was just like, look, Brent, you're not seeing all the data.

615
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,680
We see it better than you in some regards.

616
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,400
And I agree.

617
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:33,760
And they are actually living in a increasingly shrinking bottle bubble from 1998.

618
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,680
Yeah.

619
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,960
They basic, basically they didn't say this explicitly, but they said, look,

620
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,200
our time is not as better spent helping people move to the future.

621
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,720
Not like the past is killing themselves all by themselves.

622
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:52,190
They don't need our help agreed.

623
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:53,110
That's it.

624
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,620
All right.

625
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,820
Now a real important thing.

626
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,060
So you went to the testing testing festival.

627
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,220
I've been meaning to ask why is it not called the testable?

628
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,340
I was not involved in the creation of it.

629
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,340
Oh, all right.

630
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:08,940
Fair enough.

631
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,940
It should be, I'm thinking it should be.

632
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,300
So I wanted to, um, I wasn't quite done with DevOps.

633
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:14,820
Yeah.

634
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,820
Please go back to it.

635
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,700
It'll get like the one thing too, that I'll also say it's interesting

636
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,740
that you're like, Hey, Brett, sudden insight.

637
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,020
Hey, modern testing is very similar to DevOps.

638
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,820
Yeah.

639
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,420
Um, good.

640
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:29,020
Alan.

641
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,580
Good.

642
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,420
Good boy.

643
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,500
I'm so glad.

644
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,230
Like I'm, I'm with them on Alan really.

645
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,350
Okay.

646
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:36,950
Sure.

647
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:44,920
But do you realize, like, I don't, I don't know DevOps DevOps number

648
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,480
one, it's not deployed very well.

649
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,800
It's also number two.

650
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,320
It's also another thing on its way to, to die.

651
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,160
Right.

652
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,780
As I mentioned, uh, when trying to find on the web, like there was, there

653
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,060
were all sorts of star ops things.

654
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:09,260
And right now one of them is AI ops and even AI ops is, is on its way out.

655
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:09,980
Yeah.

656
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,540
I think all of these things ops are, I mean, DevOps to me, there's also

657
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,140
fun test ops or DevSecOps or DevTestOps.

658
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,780
Uh, to me, they're all DevOps because DevOps is all about getting rid of the

659
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,820
walls because they are bottlenecks.

660
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,180
And in modern testing, we don't like bottlenecks.

661
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:29,660
And one thing I like to point out, Brent, is I know you're nodding your head on.

662
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,660
Yeah, these are the same, but remember the podcast is not for you.

663
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,140
It's for the three people that listen to it.

664
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,890
And they may, and they may nod their heads too, but I want to go

665
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,850
ahead and plant the seed anyway.

666
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,450
Is, is that the rationalization you're going to use?

667
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,170
All right.

668
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:47,490
Yeah.

669
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,650
Here's my question.

670
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,170
All right.

671
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:57,200
Can you automate DevOps or is it, or is it, or do you do manual DevOps or automated DevOps?

672
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,350
Um, there's obviously a trap there somewhere.

673
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,070
Because real DevOps can't be done.

674
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,150
Can't be automated.

675
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,860
I'm just making up stuff.

676
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,600
You're not doing DevOps.

677
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,960
Oh, you're doing, I don't know.

678
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,560
Oh yeah.

679
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,460
I'm trying to make up something Dev dumbass.

680
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,180
I don't, I don't know.

681
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,140
I get what you're going.

682
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:28,540
Yeah.

683
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,060
Let's have a, no, that's that it's not DevOps.

684
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:36,090
That's that is modern testing, right?

685
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,570
I'm actually looking through, I just happened to come into a page and says,

686
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,610
what's the difference between DevOps and Agile?

687
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:53,640
And unfortunately the webpage I'm on, uh, is not saying frigging nothing.

688
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,500
So, uh, this came up once I was in a conversation, I can't remember what

689
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,380
form it was on, it may have been Reddit.

690
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,740
Uh, I can't, it must've been about one of my articles or something, but

691
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,820
someone was saying that, well, we're moving on from Agile.

692
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,700
I said, what we're moving on from Agile.

693
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:11,940
Yeah.

694
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,980
Agile is old news.

695
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,340
Now we're doing DevOps.

696
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:21,520
I thought, what the, it's the same thing.

697
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,270
Um, it's not, it's not.

698
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,870
And I just glanced through it and I understand what they're saying.

699
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:39,190
Agile is a set of, um, practices geared around the process.

700
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,620
Okay.

701
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,860
DevOps is, is actually much more of a technical practice.

702
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:49,740
No, it's, it's, it's on, is there is principles around delivering

703
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,620
frequent customer value and DevOps with that one in mind, DevOps is

704
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,940
an implementation strategy.

705
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,420
DevOps enables.

706
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:58,260
Yeah.

707
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,220
It's, but they're, you don't move from one to the other is my point.

708
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:07,540
But you, you also like the thing I'm reading right now,

709
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,460
so let me ask you this.

710
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,620
Can you be agile with a separate ops team?

711
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,340
Uh, not in my definition, but mine neither.

712
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,260
Uh, but a lot of the agile, if you have, wait, wait, wait, wait,

713
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:24,620
checking stuff over the wall at any, a lot of people, a lot of people still today

714
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,140
view scrum as agile, well, they're stupid.

715
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:27,980
Right.

716
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,180
And, and in a scrum model, absolutely.

717
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,300
You can chuck things over.

718
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:32,540
Yeah.

719
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,340
That, that just angers me and, and the, there's too much ritual around scrum.

720
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,900
I let teams do it if they want, because I don't, yeah, whatever.

721
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,760
But, and again, actually scrum can be very good, but too many teams turn it

722
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,000
into mini waterfall and it drives me freaking crazy.

723
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,720
So anyway, go on.

724
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:59,910
Now, I was just saying, like agile, uh, I was actually writing up a, I've been

725
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:04,910
asked to do this and I've been revisiting the Galazzo deck.

726
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:05,670
Right.

727
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,390
Oh yeah.

728
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,870
That yeah.

729
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:12,190
The, the famous Galazzo deck, the famous Brent's too lazy to actually get

730
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,550
off his butt and publish it.

731
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:18,870
Like he keeps promising year over year over year over year.

732
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,110
Well, maybe after the pandemic's over, it can be presented at modern testing

733
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:27,870
conference, maybe, maybe the app would happy to do that by that time.

734
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,710
And that certainly would be enough motivation.

735
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,350
Why hasn't there been an online modern testing conference yet?

736
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,980
Uh, same reason, same reason as usual.

737
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,500
Sounds like work.

738
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,420
Oh yeah.

739
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:41,620
Yeah.

740
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:51,640
Like to me, uh, an agile practice is, is one that achieves three goals simultaneously.

741
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:58,910
It adds confirmed value, reduces calendar time and reduces engineering time.

742
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:04,000
That that's sort of anything that does that in my mind.

743
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,080
Uh, does it reduce calendar time calendar time is a constant.

744
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,070
Calendar time to delivery.

745
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,350
This is cycle time.

746
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:13,860
Okay.

747
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,080
Let's say you and I are working on the same thing and we can continuously, the

748
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:23,400
two of us working together, we can continuously put it up, push out this

749
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,790
widget in a day, can we bring that down sooner to a half a day or, and, or can

750
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:35,300
we figure out a way to say that we don't need both of us on it calendar time?

751
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,620
How is I get the, how's that different from the third thing you said though?

752
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:40,570
Oh, engineering time.

753
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:43,850
The biggest difference between engineering time and calendar time.

754
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,050
That one's easy and you should know this.

755
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,530
That's, that's the delay time.

756
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,090
That's the time where the, where the work is sitting and doing nothing.

757
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:56,370
It's not moving forward.

758
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:57,330
It's sit idle.

759
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:58,450
It's the equivalent.

760
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:00,490
Two part of the same thing.

761
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,830
No, no.

762
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,870
Like you and I may have delay in our widget delivery.

763
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,230
I'm I'm all I, and I get what you're talking about, but can't it

764
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,790
all be about just tightening feedback loops?

765
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:15,230
Uh, I don't know how you brought feedback loops in here, but calendar

766
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,310
time, think of it this way.

767
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:18,550
Let's say you are working on two projects.

768
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:19,610
Yeah.

769
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,330
Okay.

770
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,590
You can't, uh, you are working on two coding projects.

771
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:24,830
Right.

772
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,190
It is fizz.

773
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:31,150
You are physically enabled to work, but both of us at the same time.

774
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:31,950
Okay.

775
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:39,290
So when you stop working on one, that is adding a delay in the calendar

776
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,890
time for that one, because it's going to go out later.

777
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:44,750
All right.

778
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:45,470
Okay.

779
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:52,270
So, so, uh, if you think about it in terms theory of constraints, one of the, uh, one

780
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:57,630
of the key things in addition to bottlenecks, they, they advertise is you, you

781
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:59,950
analyze in your root cause.

782
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,550
Uh, this is actually right.

783
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,670
Here's his book is the best way of thinking of this.

784
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:04,830
That's what I've been visualized.

785
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,750
No time you've been talking.

786
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,950
You, you go when you look at his discussion around whip.

787
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:10,910
Yep.

788
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:19,190
Discovering transparency and rooting out the sources of delay in your system

789
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:24,950
speeds up your ability to produce widgets in a faster calendar time

790
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,990
without impacting engineering time.

791
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,380
Okay.

792
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:28,900
I get it.

793
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,700
One's about optimizing the optimizing two different parts of the system.

794
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:34,860
Yes.

795
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,160
Okay.

796
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:39,520
And I just look at them all collectively as optimize the whole damn system.

797
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:41,660
Well, that's important.

798
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,540
That's important.

799
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:42,900
All right.

800
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:43,620
Okay.

801
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,060
I get it.

802
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:44,580
I get it.

803
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:44,980
I get it.

804
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,100
And I think, uh, again, uh, ran it some plug is always good here.

805
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,400
So yeah.

806
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:51,860
All right.

807
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,180
DevOps, agile, parallels, whatever, and a mailbag.

808
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,700
I think we did well this time.

809
00:44:59,340 --> 00:44:59,540
Yeah.

810
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:01,660
So next, next Friday you're getting shot number two, right?

811
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,940
I am.

812
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:03,900
Yeah.

813
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:04,940
Yeah.

814
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:12,660
This potentially this time in one week, I will be in the fetal position

815
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,980
someplace in the Pacific Northwest.

816
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,820
Savi.

817
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:19,660
So my timing on mine is really bad.

818
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,060
I talked, I was laughing with my team about this.

819
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,140
So my second, so we have the, we have a four day weekend, eight at unity.

820
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:30,340
Uh, anytime there's a three day weekend, like from Memorial day, they go ahead

821
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,940
and give us the previous Friday off and make it a four day weekend.

822
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:37,940
So they actually just gave us some more Fridays off this summer, which is great.

823
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,060
We're taking, getting some extra time off, but this four day weekend at the end of

824
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:46,380
it on the Tuesday afterwards, I get my second shot, have the four day weekend

825
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:52,140
and then miss a day probably after that almost as you know, almost everybody

826
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:54,820
feels like crap after the second shot.

827
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,540
But the good news is it's like a flu without the congestion and mo for

828
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:03,140
most people, most people get that and most people, it goes away within a day,

829
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,340
but we'll see what happens.

830
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,820
And yours is when Memorial, June 1st.

831
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,620
Okay.

832
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,360
So I should be good to go by Friday.

833
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,600
We'll learn about my, uh, two weeks.

834
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:15,840
Yeah.

835
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:16,080
Yeah.

836
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,080
We'll learn about mine and recovered.

837
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:18,680
Yep.

838
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:19,240
All right.

839
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,600
We should call it a day, man.

840
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,520
All righty.

841
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:23,360
All right.

842
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,080
Thanks everyone.

843
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,720
We'll see you next time on AB DevOps.

844
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:28,840
Checking.

845
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,560
Yeah, that one.

846
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:31,040
See ya.
