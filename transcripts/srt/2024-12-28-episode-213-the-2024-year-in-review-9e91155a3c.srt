00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,340
It's been another year of a B testing podcast. This is our our

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,480
Ultimate is if penultimate is next to last is ultimate the last this is the last show of 2024

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
Yeah, we reflect on the year and

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,420
Talk about you know stuff. I don't know. What do we do here? How's it going? It's going

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:00,030
Fantastic, how about you? It's it's going really really well, I think a whole lot of crap going on

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,750
Dog is crying behind me. She's gonna show up on the podcast this week. We got a lot to talk about

11
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,050
We got new stuff old stuff

12
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,390
Reflective stuff. We had a pretty fun year in the podcast which reflect on in a second, but yeah episode 213

13
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,710
Can you believe I mean what a frickin waste of time it is for us to get together

14
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:25,790
Every couple weeks and this podcast put it once twice. We do it 213 times over a little over 10 years

15
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,590
What are we doing? Yeah, what is that? I?

16
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,810
Don't know don't I've five five weeks over ten years five working weeks

17
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,230
Oh something like I don't know plus it's been it's been a long time

18
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,110
213 episodes

19
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,670
Sometimes they're good and the rest of the time it's like

20
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:52,340
Two people talking over beer even though it is actually we're ever late start today. It's 10 a.m. Yeah

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,380
No, well, normally we're recording much later. Yeah

22
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,620
We did yeah, we've been all over the place so

23
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:09,130
Anything else new and exciting to share before we get into all of our normal stuff I'll share it during

24
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,620
Yeah

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,460
Yeah, all right, okay what we like to do in last episode of the year is kind of reflect on the year

26
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,780
Talk about some of the highlights lowlights if we had them, but you know

27
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,500
Talk about some of our predictions last year. We didn't have very many

28
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,660
And we but we'll talk about those and then what do we think is gonna happen in?

29
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,060
2025 when the world falls apart

30
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,240
so I'm gonna walk through our Spotify wrapped for the ABI testing podcast and

31
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,190
I think the Spotify wrapped is

32
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,770
complete bunk because my I know my wrapped for my

33
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:59,000
Song to listen to was not right. I don't think it was right. But well my mine was totally right

34
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,130
Are you still listening to acoustic alchemy all the time? Nope

35
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
What was your top? What was your top artist?

36
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,950
My top artist was the yeah. Yeah. Yes

37
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,490
Very interesting. Very interesting. Yep

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,530
my top song

39
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:21,920
Was float on by the AAS. No float on it's interesting because

40
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,910
None of my top songs were from the AAS, but my top song was float on by modest mouse

41
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,150
Well, interesting and my second top song was ain't no rest for the wicked by cage the elephant

42
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,990
And it's interesting to me

43
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,440
That

44
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
both of those songs kind of

45
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,500
Express a similar emotion

46
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,810
Which was very relevant to me in 2024, but we're not at that section

47
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,970
It doesn't matter how good I feel or how bad I feel I always listen to

48
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,130
like my my jam is

49
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,860
just

50
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,540
People who singer songwriters who hate themselves?

51
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,880
Okay, there's a lot of those what's it? What's the current example? So I

52
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,920
I

53
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,240
Gotta think of one

54
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,920
Because my top artist isn't one they have some happy songs too, but they kind of fell

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,920
You know how Spotify very often of tangent already it will

56
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,320
Like some songs. Let's do go. Hey you like those songs you like this. That's alright

57
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,160
I'll listen to that for a while and I got I fell down a huge

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,400
Apparently a huge Casey Musgraves hole because Casey Musgraves should have my top artists, but I think that's wrong

59
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,120
I don't think I don't think it was that much

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know. I don't even know who that is. But if you know who like Elliott Smith

61
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,250
If you want to hear so yeah, yeah, Elliott Smith from the 90s

62
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,570
That that's that's the stuff I listen to all day or even even Sean Mullins

63
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,930
He had a little hit for a minute there in a while

64
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:13,290
But the singer songwriters who sing songs about you know, dogs dying things like that old deal are those from the same genre

65
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,560
No, Casey Musgraves kind of considered country or country pop and

66
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,320
Elliott Smith does more of I guess just call him indie folk or indie pop and and I would say that Sean Mullins is indie folk

67
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,360
But anyway before we go into somebody's gonna go. Oh, that's not indie. This is indie and shut up

68
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,920
I don't give a fuck. Let's talk about our podcast. So apparently we grew our listeners by 66% and

69
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,780
That means we went but if we went from three to four, I don't know. I still think we have three

70
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,260
No, we went from three to three. So so I'm gonna ignore that one

71
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,180
So 66% I'm assuming it's 66 repeated

72
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,800
Yeah, so that means we we went from three to three by increasing by two. All right

73
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,180
83% of our listeners something

74
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:14,190
Discovered our podcast this year. So but the numbers don't reflect that that doesn't make any sense

75
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,100
Your fans have a clear favorite

76
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
And I don't know why

77
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,380
but which

78
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:30,420
episode 202 the return I care what we even talked about that episode but that had for some reason

79
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
according to Spotify wrapped

80
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,040
999% more streams than our average episode

81
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,280
So I don't get I didn't look to see what the numbers were this stuff. Oh, I

82
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,600
Don't remember what we talked about. It's at the return of Jason Arbin. Maybe he pumped it up or something. I bet it was

83
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,530
Transcript hey Spotify has a transcript

84
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:06,550
So I don't think Jason was in this one, but we like the title is

85
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,410
organizational change which means

86
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,330
And we did a mailbag so maybe whoever we mail bagged for

87
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:22,330
Forwarded it on worth checking out worth checking out the wrapped itself is horrible this year because

88
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,570
There's no deep stats. It's all just top level stuff. Our top streaming country was the US. Yeah, right

89
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:39,410
Dumb things like 61% of our audience also watched a video on to modify this year. So here's the fun part

90
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:43,430
We are a top 10 podcast for

91
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,940
1000 listeners. Oh

92
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:55,920
How about that? Oh, okay. People have not updated there something. We're a top five. So we're a big fish in

93
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,080
We are a top five show for

94
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,640
851 fans what this is showing me is that the average A B testing listener does not listen to podcasts that often

95
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,700
We are we are the number one show for

96
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,420
353 fans

97
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,220
353 of the three listen to only one podcast. That's the A B testing podcast

98
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:30,500
Okay. Yeah, it's kind of these feel like weird stats. They they are super weird this year not happy

99
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,200
I'm done with those. I'm closing. I'm closing the wrapped window, but I shared it last year wanted to share it again

100
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,300
So that is our that's our episode for this week. Thank you all very much. No

101
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:47,040
I do want to look one of these windows. I have some notes from last year. I want to talk about

102
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,930
Oh

103
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:56,610
Before we do that what I mean, this is an easy answer. What was your what was your favorite A B testing podcast of?

104
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,210
of

105
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,730
It

106
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,050
I'll surprise you because I know what I'm supposed to say, which is my number two

107
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,740
My number one you're my number two

108
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,630
Yeah, and you're my number one

109
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:28,760
The episode with Dagna was oh she's a delight. Yeah that that was

110
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
2000 or not 2000

111
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,080
208

112
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,960
Where we walked through her book a lot of the times like when we get people on there. They're mostly on

113
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:49,150
Make we go. Okay, can we can we help this person hawk their wares and still have an interesting conversation?

114
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:54,070
Right and it's clear from their point of view hawking their wares is the primary

115
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,690
pivot with Dagna

116
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,740
Yeah, that was a that was a big part of it but her book I have it is

117
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,520
really good that conversation was

118
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,380
fantastic and

119
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,900
Very well, yeah, mine's actually ups. I have a copy also. It's really good

120
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,820
Yeah, and I feel like I walked while you're looking around for that doesn't matter it doesn't work for a podcast

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,800
Yeah, I felt like I mean I felt like I was getting coaching from her during the podcast you as do I

122
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,500
As as do I or did I okay?

123
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,440
I like that one a lot and I would be remiss if I did not say that are

124
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,480
the not just because it was our 200th episode but that we

125
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,180
we I

126
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:51,500
through the power of manipulation of statistics made sure that our 10 year anniversary our 200th episode and

127
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,820
our

128
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,900
Brent Brent just you know, if you only looked as good as I told to give us a little bobblehead that we got

129
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,500
Here's mine. But we managed to get our

130
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,040
200th podcast our our 10 year anniversary and our

131
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,180
1000th member of the slack community all on the exact same day

132
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,990
Did I manipulate things a little bit to make that work I did do we do we

133
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,550
Crush in like three podcast recordings in a week to make sure we could get there

134
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:28,270
Do we record at night at that night? Yes, we did all those things we but we made it happen

135
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:35,350
We made it happen because we wanted the stars to align we did we made or or did we?

136
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:43,140
Or is it like all the science fiction movies where you have this like all the moons on?

137
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,900
Planet zen bar are gonna align exactly at midnight at this time and we have to make sure we get there in time or else

138
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,990
The you know the catastrophic moment occurs. So yeah, that's the AB testing podcast

139
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,430
What other podcasts is listen to this year?

140
00:11:58,670 --> 00:11:59,730
Oh

141
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,960
I just wanted the list off number 200 was my number two and then I also want to call out

142
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Like literally all the ones with Jason were in

143
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:17,760
Positions, you know three to and whatever because I don't remember how we we did at least two with him

144
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,200
We did I think we did those were great discussions. Those are great discussions. He's a good guy. Hey Jason

145
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,800
What other podcasts do you listen to anything?

146
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,960
I I

147
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
Recently have followed suit with Alan

148
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
Yeah and got rid of

149
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,320
Xfinity

150
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,770
And so I don't know which things on on YouTube

151
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:53,010
I would count as podcast or not because they do podcasts on YouTube. I'm like, I'm like, I'm so confused

152
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:58,530
Listen to podcasts. I got a pot like it like the the one and only one I did this year

153
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,050
Was we started out at the beginning of the year was 60 songs that explained the 90s, which was a

154
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,450
fun

155
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,890
little podcast where he felt where he goes way beyond 60 songs, but

156
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:19,670
He talks about particular songs. Oh, yeah. I remember this talk. It was it was like

157
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,890
Musical anthropology. I greatly enjoyed that that podcast

158
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,990
Yeah, I should check that out. So yeah, I listened to too many podcasts. I'm gonna start weeding them out

159
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,550
But the new one I started listening to this year

160
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,910
I don't listen to every episode because they do two episodes a week and every episode is an hour and a half long

161
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:45,990
But but there's actually only 30 minutes of each episode of really good stuff is pivot podcast by Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway

162
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,150
They have some good

163
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:54,990
Good moderate sometimes sometimes absolutely not moderate opinions on you know, you know Kara Swisher she used to be

164
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,870
Major tech writer. She was like working with Walt Mossberg back in the day on and I read her book this year, too

165
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:09,070
Which is really good and Scott Galloway is just an asshole, but he's fun to listen to but anyway listen to that a lot this year

166
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,250
That's a political podcast

167
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,830
political tech comment, whatever is new because

168
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,690
Galloway is a professor somewhere doesn't matter

169
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,410
Filthy rich and

170
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:30,170
Kara Swisher is a tech writer, but super smart. It's like super super smart. I like them both a lot

171
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,090
So they're fun to listen to I like their rapport back and forth

172
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:40,130
They're like a really imagine if you and I were smart and we had really deep discussions about anything

173
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:44,930
That's them, but we're not capable of that. So we're like if they're the pros we are

174
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:52,890
Single a made not even single a ball. What are you before single a I don't know my sports that were little league

175
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,850
Junior high little league. All right. So listen to that one

176
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,890
Um, I don't think I thought I listened to fewer trivia podcasts because they're running out of time

177
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,070
And so just weren't warning as good. I was on a few trivia podcasts this year

178
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:10,170
Were you didn't announce them anywhere? But I did I one was a head-to-head one on

179
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,250
The throwback trivia was called a throwback trivia podcast. They do like

180
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:18,970
They do random questions from in 12 categories across

181
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:24,790
You know six decades like you get you pick a category and they roll a die and you get like it's okay

182
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,970
60s music and anyway, I I won the episode I was on

183
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,410
That was fun

184
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,570
I was on another podcast called

185
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,550
How did you get on the podcast? I support them on patreon so they they invite all their

186
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,110
In the same with trivial warfare, which is are probably the best podcast out there. They do a really good

187
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,550
They have really good commentary

188
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:56,520
Sometimes a little they're a little too proud of themselves that I like them and I was on that one one

189
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:03,120
So my team lost I had a really smart person with me and I drug them down and we lost on that one

190
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,660
So, yeah, I did that

191
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Traveled a little bit. I don't know

192
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,880
What do you last year you had some good YouTube recommendations for me and one that stuck with me was Josh Wiseman

193
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,440
I still watch Josh Wiseman his videos really great cooking videos

194
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:30,060
Just really well done well produced a lot of fun to watch but what do you what even watching on the tube of use?

195
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,550
I have been mostly watching so

196
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,430
Ice-cream sandwich is

197
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,950
Okay, it's all one word ice cream sandwich

198
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:49,340
It's an it's an animator who kind of tells little stories and they're I'm using af as the kids would say

199
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,210
Still watch Josh. So watch Guga

200
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,990
Zach Friedman is another guy I'm watching a lot

201
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,910
It's it's old news for you

202
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,230
but

203
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,990
Last year got my daughter a 3d printer and it's the first time we've had a 3d printer and

204
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,010
in

205
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,390
Do you know the the thing?

206
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,130
Or the models known as grid finity. No, okay

207
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:31,390
very popular set of models for 3d printing and those were invented and then

208
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,570
open source licensed by Zach Freeman

209
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,450
And then whatever random Oh

210
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,130
My son's gotten me into I think it's called monster factory

211
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,810
Mon

212
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:57,030
It it's not great. Um, but it's fun what they do

213
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,570
Their whole shtick is they play game. They play games that have a character editor and

214
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,480
then they go in with the character editor and

215
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,270
they make it as

216
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,240
Ugly as they possibly can the character

217
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,760
And this is interesting and then they play the game and they invent sort of a backstory with with the character

218
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,080
It amuses my son and spending time with my son is important to me

219
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,300
Yeah, how about you I should look but I

220
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,720
Probably nothing new in my subscriptions on the tube

221
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
I got like everybody else I get pulled into the YouTube shorts all the time and they were

222
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,160
I do watch

223
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,300
Let me see what's in my subscription list, um, here's a good one

224
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:59,260
I watched this to be called five guys FC, which is this just these 20 something year olds in England playing in this

225
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,780
Six aside soccer league and they film it. It's kind of funny and there I don't know why I watch it

226
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,580
But now I watch it every time the ever sees it's funny Josh Wiseman

227
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,890
I

228
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,510
Watched I might have mentioned it before the only new one here is

229
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,210
Rick Beato who I probably mentioned him last year. He's a former musician producer

230
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,890
he does a lot of

231
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:30,950
Breaking apart songs and talking about why they work along with some interviews of musicians. He knows everybody

232
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,110
But he does a really good show on

233
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:41,510
On kind of how music how pop music is made and why stuff works and he'll listen to you

234
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,250
I love he'll listen to you like the Spotify top ten

235
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:49,110
Kind of cold and I'll play along with it and go. Oh, oh and I think it was

236
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,350
It was a Sabrina Carpenter song. He said he stopped it goes. Oh my god

237
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:59,150
That could be the first top ten pop song in the last ten years that has a key change

238
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,160
So little things and he goes, oh you're probably right. It's been a while. It's been a while

239
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,260
He has a serious. I don't think he does anymore

240
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,540
He used to do a series called what makes this song great

241
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,460
You know take some hit song from the last 20 or 30 years and he just break it down completely everything from the

242
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,540
everything from the music and lyrics and chords to the production to the

243
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,460
Just you know everything so really really interesting to see the production behind how the song was repaved. So that's another one

244
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,290
Anywho, I have a couple more I can share cuz sure you and

245
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,310
Then we then we need to talk about the year coming up. Sure

246
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,080
or

247
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Okay

248
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,960
One the only political based one I have in here is by lady

249
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
shoe on head

250
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,280
As you know, I am neither left or right

251
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,280
She is left

252
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:09,790
But will throw shit at anyone and is funny

253
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,790
Like crap in my humble opinion

254
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,740
the nerd Forge

255
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,100
These are two Norwegian people who just make random shit

256
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,980
Like they did it. I did it. They did a

257
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,400
gigantic

258
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
reprint of Harry Potter

259
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,530
Where?

260
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:40,610
Literally, the book was like three feet tall and they just combined all of the books and reprinted them and they and they walked through

261
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,100
How they they'd leather bound it and how they

262
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:53,460
Prep the leather and how they formed the stitching and I'm like, okay, that's fascinating. I already mentions that Friedman

263
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
Musically, I have two in here

264
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,220
a

265
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:03,660
Davy 504 who's just a fantastic bassist who who

266
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,610
who's

267
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,470
When you have a comedic pair the guy

268
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:15,000
That's sort of the silent one that always straight man straight man

269
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,560
He's he's he's got the he's kind of got a straight man attitude, which is funny

270
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,880
and then the charismatic voice which is a

271
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,960
opera

272
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
an opera singer who does

273
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,130
sort of reaction videos around

274
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,030
Music videos across a span of

275
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,190
Genres what's that one called?

276
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,750
charismatic voice

277
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,910
The charismatic is fine. Go ahead and finish. I'll tell you about some of these. Oh, I have seen her

278
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,220
Here's my view on that. Mmm

279
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:02,740
I don't you know, there's a bunch of these out there. There's a whole genre on YouTube of I'm gonna I

280
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,700
Never heard this song before I'm gonna listen to it for the first time

281
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,860
And I think it's all I think it's largely staged

282
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,150
It's largely there. It's largely entertainment

283
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,030
You know and some of the stuff they point some of the stuff she points out even as complete BS

284
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:27,310
Some of it's actually interesting but but the entertainment factor top-notch the factual factor me

285
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,340
Again it's entertaining

286
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,900
It's interesting. Yes, it's entertaining

287
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,140
but yeah, but anyway, and she has a crap ton of

288
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:48,220
Views and listen to it's about entertainment. Not here is here is the state of the world in

289
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,260
As I go off and this could be about anything about YouTube videos or you know politics whatever

290
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,690
The entertainment factor has far outweighed the need for things to be accurate. Oh

291
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,350
Oh

292
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:11,230
Yeah, and and that and that's that's what I think about the curious man. That's where well, I don't know

293
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:15,550
I mean, oh, I'm not saying I'm not saying it's as bad as politics. What I'm saying is

294
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:19,150
entertainment getting getting views getting clicks and

295
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,270
Even even the meat in the media does this across both sides and down the middle

296
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,430
The goal is to get clicks and reads because they're trying to make money. It's not about being accurate

297
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:37,050
News week especially is horrible at sensationalist headlines, but they're all over the internet. They do these they they

298
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,740
purposely either ignore facts or

299
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:48,260
Change facts in order to get more views and clicks. That's what's happening with with what's your face the charismatic voice

300
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:54,220
That's what happens in what you and not just political but all over the place. He's saying that's what's happening with her

301
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,480
Oh because she's she's wrong some of the times

302
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:04,520
She's trying to be entertaining and she's very entertaining, but she's also you said you hadn't seen her. Oh, I have seen her

303
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:10,320
Oh, okay. No, I have seen her. Okay. I had to bring her up. Yep. I've seen her talk about stuff

304
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,960
She's a lot very entertaining, but not always accurate. That's my that's my take

305
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:15,890
Okay

306
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,500
All right. There's there is

307
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:26,420
Anyway, okay. Great. So speaking of lies moralize and lies disguised as statistics

308
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:33,460
What are some of the things we should talk a little bit about what are some of the things you think are gonna happen in

309
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:40,380
In the world will get more specific on the A B testing podcast. What things are gonna happen in the world in 2025?

310
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,520
well

311
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:50,090
We kind of skipped over reflection on 20 for let me pause that was there more reflection on 24

312
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,950
Well, let's do that. I'm sorry. Let's do that. Well, I'm gonna edit this. Let's go back on 24

313
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:01,470
24 was a big year. We talked about the podcast in 24, but not much else

314
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:06,150
Right in the only the only big thing

315
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:13,500
For 2024 so it's finally closed

316
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,730
Alan's known about this for a year and a half. We've we've not talked about it

317
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:29,440
And I'm not gonna I don't want this to be a downer episode

318
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,340
but on December 11th, I

319
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,130
Have completed my divorce

320
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,540
And

321
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,620
accordingly

322
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,860
2024

323
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,380
Kind of sucked

324
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,020
So

325
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,400
Yeah, so I

326
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,980
I'm not gonna go into a whole lot of detail on the suck a tube there not in this episode anyway

327
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,740
the completions gotta feel

328
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
something

329
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,140
It feels

330
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,000
Yeah, I keep reminding myself repeatedly

331
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,530
That every time a door closes a new one opens

332
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,090
Yes, right. Um

333
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,410
Right, it's it is easy

334
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,890
to

335
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:33,540
To think about the future and if you're in the wrong frame of mind

336
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,970
Go quite apocalyptic

337
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,450
Pretty quickly

338
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,310
So that's

339
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,270
That's the the number one thing

340
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:57,300
I'm focusing on not going apocalyptic but realizing that in battling against it

341
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,720
Yeah, yeah, I can see that it was a lot long long path

342
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:08,180
Well, and on that lovely note, but yeah, yeah

343
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:14,020
I don't know what to say. You don't say congratulations, but it's a it's definitely a milestone. I'm not sure what to say about it

344
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,960
It is what it is. I don't think I think the listeners were afraid you're in divorce me, but

345
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,220
No, no, no, no, that's that's not 20 24

346
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:31,100
That's a 2025 thing yeah, we'll get there we'll figure who gets fired first

347
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:39,780
Ha anything else from 20 I gotta think in my 24 I did the the Wonderland trail again

348
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,860
I did I tell you this on the podcast that I attempted to do another section of the the PCT for much

349
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,540
I have to die

350
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,500
Steven's past to so call me past and my water filter broke and it was just too hot for me to try and

351
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,940
Fake it through there. So ended up bailing a little early, but I'll go back and finish that sometime you should have a I

352
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:07,130
Don't know what you're using is your water filter, but they're small. I mean you should have a backup

353
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,850
Yeah, I think

354
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,850
so as a

355
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:18,490
Nobody's the van of hikers and listeners for this overlap. I use a one called the Sawyer squeeze which works out really well

356
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,650
I don't know why mine just decided to puke

357
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,770
But they're not that much but they also make a Sawyer squeeze mini which is even smaller and lighter

358
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:31,850
But they kind of suck because the the flow is so awful, but it's so it's like a couple ounces

359
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:35,330
It would be it would make sense to just carry an extra one

360
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:41,250
Just in case like the odds of your especially if you're using it every day the odds of your water filter dying are pretty low

361
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,250
But having the the lighter weight one

362
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:48,690
Kind of just sticking in the bottom of a bag somewhere just in case would would have would have been super helpful

363
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,400
What do you do for fire?

364
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,640
The fires aren't allowed most of the places I go. So I have a oh, I see I have a little a little stove

365
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,320
I've a little called a pocket rocket and it's teeny

366
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,880
I don't have here but it's just all it is

367
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,640
It's just a little screw thing and a couple little it's hardly anything to it weighs like an ounce

368
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,960
and you screw that on top of the fuel canister and light it and

369
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,320
That's where I get heat from I have also done hikes before where I did not cook anything just cold soaked everything

370
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:21,130
That gets a little old after a while

371
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:26,490
So it's worth it for the extra weight a lot of people who like a lot. They just get nuts around weight

372
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:33,170
They want to see how light they can get everything so they carry nothing and what I've discovered in my experimenting with this is

373
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:40,500
Like these folks that carry nothing. They're carrying about nine pounds of weight on their backpack including the pack and

374
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,510
For me I can carry two more pounds, which isn't that much and I can be

375
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,030
Comfortable I can have a little bigger sleeping pad. I can have a stove. I have camp shoes

376
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,030
I take off my wet shoes at night

377
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:59,110
It's not that much you can look at oh, it's like 20% extra weight

378
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:05,310
Nine pounds and 11 pounds. It's easier for me to lose 20% extra weight

379
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,150
When it's the difference when the 20% is two pounds, right?

380
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,510
Yeah, that's one of the things I bring up in data science all the time

381
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:18,910
Like what's the important number? Is it the percent or is it right unit?

382
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,850
The thing I bring up because I get this question sometimes from folks and they say

383
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,880
They'll ask well

384
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:30,120
Wouldn't you like to use that 12 pounds down to 10 pounds and I say I

385
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,930
Will be more I mean you want me to carry two pounds extra weight

386
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:37,410
I will just go lose two pounds of body weight and keep the comfort

387
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,780
Right and keep the comfort and safety like these folks will sleep like I have I have a tent

388
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,820
it's light, but I have a tent and

389
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:54,040
My tent is made so it'll stand up with with trekking poles, but I don't like them there

390
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,080
So I thought a bike trip once I use the tent and I got some actual regular poles for it

391
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,760
They're great

392
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,040
It also means I can pick up the whole tent and move it if I don't like where it is

393
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,480
So I I carry poles it's extra, you know 11 ounces

394
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,240
But some people like I don't need a tent. I just need a tarp to sleep under

395
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,680
I'll just string this up like they're just this ultralight is like no, I'm not comfortable there

396
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:20,600
I kind of like being totally enclosed when I'm out in the middle of nowhere

397
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,380
I don't want bugs and mice crawling up on my sleeping bag. Yeah, I mean I

398
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,830
Was just thinking okay just a tarp, huh?

399
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,670
Do you have like barbecue sauce scented like deodorant or something?

400
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,550
Like just to lather it up for the bears

401
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:45,150
I mean not that the tents gonna really do anything in terms of bear protection, but no

402
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:50,870
But but the bugs for certain the bugs for certain. Yeah, there's just no way so anyway

403
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,430
Okay, I buy a pack fully loaded is about 11

404
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,350
Touch over 11 pounds and but that gives me all the comfort I need which is fine. It's still really light

405
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,730
That's not including food or water

406
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:06,490
That adds weight to so anyway, I'm 24. I did that I didn't do much else

407
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:12,690
I think your dog is trying to dig into your couch. Oh, she insists on making her bed. She has

408
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,410
She's a burrowing gotcha

409
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,890
Yeah

410
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:22,770
Try it she's trying to make it nice. Okay, so let's I don't think anything else exciting in 2024

411
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,240
Let's talk about 2025. Let's do the world first software and then a be testing podcast

412
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,480
What's something you think will happen in the world in 2025?

413
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:44,830
Okay, we'll do that one I

414
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,390
Can chat GPT what's gonna happen no, I'm reorganizing my list, okay

415
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:56,030
my theme for 2025 is

416
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,600
On that topic is death death to the uni party long live the uni party

417
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,420
Okay, tell me tell me more

418
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:10,020
right well

419
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,520
One version of the uni party just got kicked out of office a new version of it just got

420
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,110
Brought in

421
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,030
I do not think the sky will fall

422
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:26,740
Whether that is a bullshit affirmation or not. We will find out

423
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,380
But again because of my reflection in 2024

424
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:39,460
God damn it 2025 is Brent Jensen's year of hope so I don't care what else happens. I

425
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:45,730
Will find the hopeful way of viewing it. I do not think the sky will fall

426
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,120
but

427
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,640
it's

428
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,640
Yeah, things are gonna change

429
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,560
that's

430
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,800
like

431
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
generally

432
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:04,790
World stuff do I think Ukraine will stop like I would very much like to see

433
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,430
the two major wards

434
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:12,070
Stop, I would like 2025 not to be the year of World War three

435
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,990
Yeah

436
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,150
So I see three world threats right now

437
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:25,150
Like I'm continuously afraid of China trying to take Taiwan

438
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,500
Will you can war in I don't know

439
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,340
We can't know but I it's a worthwhile thing to talk about. I think we both agree that

440
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,100
Both of those major wars should stop. Yeah, I think it's I think it's

441
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:45,830
It's likely I think the Israeli one will stop

442
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,530
This really Palestine I think that one will will will likely stop next year

443
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,590
Well, here's what I mean, I think the politics are more complicated

444
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:01,550
Particularly with Russia bringing in North Korea. I think I think it gets interesting

445
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:09,590
With the new administration because it could just be that Trump pulls the plugs on all the US funding to Ukraine and Putin steamrolls them

446
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,950
And it's over so could be

447
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:18,550
And then and Trump will take credit for stopping the war in Ukraine and his his fans will worship

448
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,710
but I think it's actually a reasonable chance that I

449
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:31,390
Actually, you know what after the election? I did two things the highly related one is I removed the politics subreddit from my subreddit feed

450
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,550
I read it food and then I kind of stopped going to read it very often

451
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,750
I just I stopped checking the news. I just can't

452
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,790
I just can't it's it's the potential and this is again going back to the news

453
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,910
But the potential of very bad things to happen

454
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:49,990
is very high and

455
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:53,230
It's higher at me looking at it does not make it

456
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:57,950
More likely or less likely of the bad things to happen. It just raises my anxiety

457
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:02,950
so I look at enough to know what's going on in the world and

458
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,010
Just try and ignore the headlines because they're there to get a reaction out of me

459
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,410
It's kind of like I

460
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:17,740
Think we've talked about art before here and did you paint it all in 2024? No, so art

461
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,220
Yeah, enough stuff other stuff going on

462
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
art is

463
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:30,340
The piece of art isn't the art the art is the reaction of someone viewing that

464
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,540
Sculpture painting banana duct tape to the wall. That's the art. The art is the interpretation of what's there same with music

465
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,550
Why John which is art by the way?

466
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:51,310
I'm aware. Thank you. Yeah, but it's not the piece itself. It's it's how is it felt like when Stravinsky premiered the Rite of Spring in

467
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:57,270
Paris there were riots. That's a reaction to art because it was so different than anything else

468
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:02,950
I could was bad they listen today. This is fucking cool. But back then I was like what a minute my cheese got moved too much

469
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,620
so I think it's the same thing I you know I

470
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,220
Internet headlines or art

471
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,380
It's not the headlines just words on the page

472
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:19,180
It's how those are interpreted by people is is the reaction and those things get clicks and those things get money

473
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,500
And that's not going to get fixed in 2025. So I am

474
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:30,100
Moving myself as much as I can from looking at those things because I don't want to be part of I don't want to contribute

475
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,620
To that art. I don't want to be yet another person reacting to something in a way

476
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,220
that is

477
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,220
Irrelevant to the underlying facts

478
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,970
the I don't think

479
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,730
I was thinking in terms of a data science like to me

480
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,820
Like there's a lot of place where crowdsourcing

481
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,920
Data science is able to show crowdsourcing this benefit. I do not think news is one of those things. Yeah

482
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,740
like I think it is

483
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,500
It's a massive echo chamber

484
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,280
in

485
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:19,120
So, yeah, I get I get where you're coming from like what part of your speech reminded me early on in this in

486
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,840
2024 I I came across

487
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:28,760
Have we talked about the stoics or the stoicism? Oh, I don't know if we have but I have spent a lot of time

488
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,760
Reading about stoics this year interestingly, so please go. Yeah, so did I earlier this year?

489
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,520
um, and one of the things that really resonates with me is one of their key tenets is

490
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,520
only

491
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,240
Control the things you can control right and you cannot control outcomes

492
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
Right, that's it

493
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,990
one million percent and

494
00:39:54,030 --> 00:40:02,870
And they felt there was no point in having an emotional response to any outcome at all because you're

495
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,720
It's nothing you control

496
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,740
Yes, and in fact

497
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,180
Go ahead. Yeah, no, I would like to do an episode maybe our next one sometime on

498
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:19,780
Stow system in modern testing. So let's let's pencil it in that would be fun. Let me thank you for bringing that up

499
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,420
As far as other things like world stuff

500
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,800
I don't know. I don't know. I'm trying not to pay attention trying to

501
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,860
Yeah, I don't have a good thing there. But how about let's talk about the world of software

502
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,100
So which is gonna be largely around Gen AI

503
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:43,300
But what's different a year from now in the world and one thing I said last year just to bring this up

504
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,660
I didn't quite happen, but I still think it's true

505
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,860
was

506
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,900
That you you you wrote down our predictions from last year, right? Oh, there's there's somewhere around here

507
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:59,020
but I kind of went through most of one of them was that I think that the ability to read code and

508
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
interpret it and and and

509
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,280
not interpret read it and

510
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:12,520
Critique it is going to become more important than writing code and I think that's actually true today people just won't admit it yet

511
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:21,560
I think we can rely on Gen AI to generate large amounts on all large amounts of our code

512
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:25,600
But we have to be able to see in the articles this year on and the research showing that

513
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,220
There's lots of bugs in this Gen AI generated code

514
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,600
which means that we haven't shifted yet people haven't able to take this Gen AI code and and

515
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,880
Look at it and fix it or look and see why it's wrong or why it doesn't apply and yeah

516
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,680
But I think Gen AI has has dramatically changed both

517
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,670
right how I said priority though, I

518
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:53,430
Didn't you that that

519
00:41:54,790 --> 00:42:01,030
Reading is gonna be a higher priority than no I said it's gonna be a it's gonna be a more more important skill

520
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:07,290
Yeah, what we're gonna use. Okay, and more important sure

521
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,230
Reading is going to become more important than writing

522
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,510
Yeah

523
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:22,310
And I don't know if that occurred because I think I think it's I

524
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:26,350
Like the fact that you put more important because I think that's true

525
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:29,710
Right because I've seen reading and writing

526
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:34,110
Being done through LOM quite often

527
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,630
like even in my own own

528
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,360
coding I

529
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,240
am using

530
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,000
GitHub co-pilot just a lot more

531
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,860
and

532
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,980
It's mostly because I find that it's a great education tool. I go. Oh

533
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,750
How would you improve the perf of this and it generates?

534
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,190
Code options for me and I look at and I go. Oh, whoa

535
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:09,230
I didn't even know that class could do that like there was one example

536
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,670
where I had a

537
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,430
nested a two level nested loop so n squared

538
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,620
Mm-hmm, and it got rid of the whole damn loop and I'm like and it's because it used

539
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:28,660
Part of an interface of a class that I didn't even know existed and I'm like, oh

540
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,260
Thank you GPT. You know, we made my code better, but you upleveled me

541
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,300
It's actually really that's a good story. We need more stories like that. I

542
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,620
The it's a rare story honestly because I can also see places where where

543
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:50,020
I'm very actively paying attention to my own interaction with GPT

544
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:56,700
Because I can see places where intellectual laziness comes in

545
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,730
Right when it when it comes to interviews

546
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:07,330
Like my stick at interviews used to be no, I don't remember much. I'm old and

547
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,250
Like I haven't remembered much

548
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,490
In the interview basis since 30s my 30s

549
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,520
But I know where to find it right? I'm not a rookie in the industry. Don't ask me how to

550
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,800
It's not important for the type of jobs that I do to have to traverse a doubly linked list

551
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,920
right

552
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,920
But if if in the real world we need a doubly linked list

553
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,840
I know how to

554
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:48,540
You know do find the go through my reference materials and then we'll build one. Well now I don't even need that right? It's

555
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:55,420
GPT generate me a class that I can use as a doubly linked list it like

556
00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:03,270
I've never actually done that but that would be something I have very little doubt that it will do well

557
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:08,190
Okay, so what's gonna happen? Tell me something. It's gonna happen in the world of software in 2025

558
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,260
Here are my three big predictions and I have three and I wrote them down

559
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:23,790
I do not heard so much more prepared than me, but so prepared. Please tell please chair. Okay, I do think

560
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,630
we are

561
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:32,630
Officially at the beginning of the end of the data science era officially God

562
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:38,460
Yeah, I feel like I've talked about this for a few years, but please go on elaborate

563
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,140
Yeah, no, I so I think 2025 will be the year

564
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,940
where data science

565
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:47,700
Scientists who can't actually code

566
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,340
to say a bachelor's CS degree level

567
00:45:53,220 --> 00:46:02,500
Will not get hired. I believe 2025 is the is it won't be formally constructed as such but 2025 is

568
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:10,350
The unofficial year where data science becomes a specialization within death. Okay, I agree

569
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,250
Um

570
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:16,060
number two, I believe in here I'm

571
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:24,020
Soft and fuzzy. Okay, I believe the first major instance of

572
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,330
L. O. M. Causing a human harm or safety issues

573
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,730
Because its controllers don't know what they're doing

574
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:43,930
Will occur in 2025 and I don't know if I completely fucked the grammar with that sentence

575
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,770
But I think you got what I'm saying. I do I do and I think

576
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:53,200
Unfortunately, you're right, but we'll see what happens and then lastly I think

577
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,990
RTW

578
00:46:55,990 --> 00:47:02,130
Will become a much bigger thing. I mean return to work. Yeah, talk to me more about that

579
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,860
And

580
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:09,260
Here I think it's because of the new

581
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:18,010
I think that's a tenant an old-school tenant of the new that

582
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:27,490
The on the onboarding version of the Uni Party. I think that will be become

583
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,690
far more politically correct to

584
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:44,930
Force everyone back to work. Huh honestly

585
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:51,570
What do you mean by so this is a good one to discuss because we may have talked about in a long time enough a ton of

586
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:56,650
time today, but everyone is a lot of people what about orgs that don't even have offices or

587
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:59,770
Like there's not even an office for me. We'll be fine

588
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:02,100
They'll be fine

589
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:06,420
Because if they started off with that as a key tenant, then I think they'll be fine

590
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:12,180
I think well, I think these people these companies that have all of this office space

591
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,620
That's going on utilized. I have an idea for that

592
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,660
Never sure this is freely available

593
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,940
I had an idea because we work kind of they're still around but they kind of died during the pandemic as well

594
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,500
I would love all this unused office space

595
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,180
Here's my idea. We work buys it like sometimes I want to go to an office. I'm gonna go to the house

596
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,240
I don't have a place to go

597
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,240
What I would like a company to do say a company I'll say I'll pick a generic company

598
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,160
ACME software company what I can do is for my I

599
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,540
Buy a certain number of credits like, you know for my thousand-person company

600
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:54,880
I'll buy you know 10,000 credits that we work and what that means is my employees then can choose to go to these offices

601
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,300
It's kind of like a gym membership

602
00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:02,880
And I can pay these companies and my employees when they want to go to an office and work and be around people

603
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,980
They do their work and have internet and a conference room

604
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:09,220
They can book where they don't have an office to go to they can go to an office

605
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,340
And that would I could I think what I think is I think there's a lot of people who would like to go to an office

606
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:20,140
But if you're gonna rent a place that we work it's like every day and it's expensive

607
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:25,940
I think I think there's a way to do sort of a subscription service of of office rental

608
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:31,260
There's some details to figure out and I'm not enough of the innovator and entrepreneur to figure this out

609
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,840
It's been done already by there's got to be a way to use these like downtown in Seattle

610
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:43,040
especially sounds to go dead because so many people aren't going back to work and very similar in the two cities because

611
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,280
The people that used to work there have don't live anywhere near the cities because it's so expensive to live in the cities

612
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,120
They live farther away and it's expensive to commute to work

613
00:49:53,490 --> 00:50:00,090
Right, right. Yeah, so I I don't we're gonna talk more about that throughout the year about curious to see what happened there

614
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:05,850
We almost time here. Do you have a picture here? So what we'll see is

615
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:09,600
I

616
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:16,050
Do you think like I realized myself just in the last couple of months?

617
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,010
right the

618
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:24,170
so I have my own leadership team that reports to me and

619
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:32,170
We just have a better meeting when we are all in the same room. Absolutely. Absolutely

620
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:40,130
So the question is why aren't we putting more effort into teaching people how to have a successful virtual meeting?

621
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,600
Like it's doable. It's doable. I've been very good

622
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,280
Figure it out myself. Yeah, I think people just kind of forward in I think that one of the challenges

623
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,940
I fully agree on why there would be a reason to go back to work and I think people are just frickin lazy

624
00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:00,540
Remote, I mean, oh my god. So many people is the thing that kills me if you're in a meeting room

625
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,060
And remember the old days somebody we're gonna go a little bit over here

626
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,420
Somebody be on a laptop in a meeting say hey close the laptop. No, whatever

627
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,520
Because we're virtual then the people multi and you know

628
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:18,660
multitasking during a meeting like I'm so frickin tired of repeating myself for someone because they couldn't be bothered to pay attention in

629
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,100
It's ridiculous

630
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,540
Anyway, I want to have a whole other thing about there. So they're like

631
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,340
There I think bringing in

632
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:31,280
Open space principles. Yep

633
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:38,860
If you can't be bothered to pay attention to the meeting then why are you get the hell out like get the hell out

634
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,380
unwritten rule

635
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,140
There should be an unwritten rule

636
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:51,420
Where like a socially charged rule where where people are like if you're not actively paying attention

637
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:55,660
Yeah, get out get out. I think it's laziness

638
00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:02,420
Shouldn't have to kick you out. You should feel guilty and get out. I think people are lazy. Okay very quickly because then I got

639
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,500
What's your predictions? I don't have any whatever I comment on yours

640
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,500
podcast what exciting things are we looking forward to in 2025

641
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,870
All right. I did the last topic that one's you okay once again

642
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:19,470
I'm every year I say I'm gonna I'm gonna get the it's like asking the hot girl out

643
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,070
I'm that was I was really sexist

644
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:25,790
If I'm so afraid to ask Nicole for his grin again, that sounds weird in context

645
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:30,190
But I'm such a huge uber fan of Nicole for his grim that I've been afraid to ask her actually

646
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,430
I don't know how to get a hold of her, but I really like to have her on the podcast at some point

647
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:40,510
We gotta do that I feel like I committed to helping on that one. Yeah, that's right

648
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:45,470
You have you have her email address right didn't she did can't you just like send her a message on on?

650
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:54,060
I think we will have

651
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,310
We're gonna have a lot like connecting with her

652
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,090
Okay, not right now

653
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:07,010
Well, we're gonna have an odd recording schedule in 2025 because I have vacations and weird stuff going on

654
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,330
We'll probably talk more about that throughout the year and then that's all I got

655
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,880
Those are my I don't have really much going on there

656
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,510
We're gonna get to

657
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:22,790
We're gonna get more people listening but more people wondering why the hell do we have a podcast when we just talk about nothing for an hour

658
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:32,660
That's it. All right, Brit. Yep. Anything anything else before we go for the day? No, I can she's
