1
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:09,890
Hello listeners.

2
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:10,390
Howdy.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,890
I'm Alan.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,490
I'm Brent.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,070
Back for another episode of A.B. Testing.

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,490
We have an episode number, don't we, Brent?

7
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:16,210
We do.

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,050
We're number 79.

9
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,820
Is that prime?

10
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,860
You should know these things.

11
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,980
It might be.

12
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,780
All right.

13
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,260
A.B. Testing is a podcast about things

14
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,820
like agile testing, software testing,

15
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,500
software quality, data science, organizational change,

16
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
coaching, and very much recently, a thing Brent and I

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,660
have been calling modern testing.

18
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,340
Yes.

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,780
How's that for a summary there?

20
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,140
I didn't forget too much.

21
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,020
No, you did a well.

22
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,780
I have to write one out.

23
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,580
Fantastic job.

24
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,940
As Brent suggested last time.

25
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,340
I should write one down.

26
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,460
So Brent, what you doing?

27
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,060
I'm trying to fix my microsomes stand

28
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,900
without interrupting the podcast.

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,060
OK.

30
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,900
So I, as you know, as the listeners

31
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,220
would know from the last podcast,

32
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,580
in between then and now, I have,

33
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,150
through the magic of air travel, gone to England and back.

34
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,050
I knew that too.

35
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,570
I was at Test Bash in Brighton at a wonderful time.

36
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,730
At 9 AM?

37
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,490
Was it 9 AM?

38
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,240
Yes.

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,080
What do you mean at 9 AM?

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,260
What do you mean?

41
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,340
No, I was.

42
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,380
What are you talking about?

43
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,100
I was.

44
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,060
We're doing a podcast.

45
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,580
I know.

46
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,340
All right.

47
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,620
It's 8 AM here.

48
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,500
It is.

49
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,980
Ish.

50
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,620
No, it seems the, I could tell when you were presenting

51
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,660
or rather when you were done because Twitter was a flurry.

52
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,060
There was a flurry of Twitter.

53
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,740
There was.

54
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,780
A flurry of Twitter.

55
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,920
Tweet.

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,070
Tweet.

57
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,470
So I must have been on, I was on at 2 o'clock there,

58
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,470
which is early morning here.

59
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,670
Not too bad.

60
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,650
Like 7 o'clock here.

61
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,330
Yeah, something like that.

62
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,890
So anyway, I gave a presentation about modern testing.

63
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,010
One of lots of good feedback, lots of really good feedback.

64
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,060
But I'm trying to tell the story of modern testing.

65
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,300
And something weird happened in the space time continuum.

66
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,620
Vernon.

67
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,300
Richard.

68
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,060
Yep.

69
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,540
Vernon asked how many people listened to the podcast.

70
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,380
And in the way I counted there was one, two, three, one,

71
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,420
two, three, three, three.

72
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,660
There were only three listeners, but there were quite a few

73
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,980
of the three there.

74
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,780
Fantastic.

75
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,900
That was pretty cool.

76
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,940
But they told me that, yeah, this is what I aim to do

77
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,100
was take all the stuff we've been babbling about

78
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,620
for God knows how many episodes and summarize it.

79
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,300
78 at that time.

80
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,780
Which is a challenge.

81
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,620
A big, big challenge.

82
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,860
But I think I did OK.

83
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,180
I was surprised how many head nods there were.

84
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,580
Usually I didn't scare enough people.

85
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,180
And that's just a tribute to the Test Bash audience.

86
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,420
I think Test Bash is our peeps.

87
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,340
Yeah, they are.

88
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,940
It's the official conference of the AB testing podcast.

89
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,580
Yeah, and Tope.

90
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,860
Official favorite.

91
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,980
Tope we get off her butts and do our own.

92
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,060
Speaking of Test Bash.

93
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,580
Yeah.

94
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,340
I saw Patrick Prill, Test Pappy, one of the three.

95
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,380
Nice.

96
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,100
Hung out with him.

97
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,060
We had some food one night, had some beers here and there.

98
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,890
And he sent this a Ministry of Test Stein.

99
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,050
Oh, thank you, Patrick.

100
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,370
He brought like a dozen or 18 of them or something.

101
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,890
Some huge number from Germany over to Brighton.

102
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:47,650
And was a little disappointed that security didn't give him

103
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,170
a harder time about him.

104
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,250
He wanted to take a picture of what they looked like

105
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,210
in the X-ray machine, but they wouldn't let him.

106
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:57,590
Apparently you can't take pictures of the X-ray machine.

107
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,190
Why not?

108
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,120
Rules.

109
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,800
OK.

110
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,520
Rules.

111
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,230
That is cool.

112
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,470
I'm holding in my hand a brilliant Stein.

113
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,990
It's got a good weight to it.

114
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,070
It says Ministry of Testing on it.

115
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,660
Love it.

116
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,420
It's cool.

117
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,020
Very excited.

118
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,980
So anyway, I gave the talk.

119
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,140
There were lots of tweets.

120
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,620
You had some questions about some.

121
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,420
Had a few people join the Slack channel afterwards.

122
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:31,620
And by the way, by the way, welcome to any new listeners

123
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:36,820
that I met or talked to or you just saw me at Test Bash.

124
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,740
Because it is a fantastic conference.

125
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,030
And I'm happy if you are listening.

126
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,350
And you may never listen again.

127
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,430
But hopefully, maybe.

128
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,350
I don't know.

129
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,870
Whatever.

130
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,990
Anyway, thank you.

131
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,790
I always appreciate having more people in the three.

132
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,830
So thanks for listening.

133
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,350
You can stop now.

134
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,150
You don't have to.

135
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:57,670
You can.

136
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,630
You can stop at any time.

137
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,470
At least finish the episode maybe.

138
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,310
Sure.

139
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,830
Sure.

140
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,870
If we ever finish the episode.

141
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,270
So what do you want to do next?

142
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,990
You had a bunch of questions about the talk

143
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,630
and some of the feedback you saw.

144
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,270
We had a few questions come in that are sort of mailbag

145
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,150
worthy.

146
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,310
How do you want to approach the next question?

147
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,590
So let's talk about Test Bash.

148
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,030
So this time around, I know you probably attended

149
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,990
some of the other talks.

150
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,510
Yes, in fact, I went to it.

151
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,910
I did the full Test Bash experience.

152
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,110
I did two workshops on the first day.

153
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,470
I spent a day and a half at Unity doing some work there,

154
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,830
meeting with a lot of people.

155
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,820
And then I did a full day of two workshops on Thursday.

156
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,980
I got up on Friday and did the Test Bash run along the water.

157
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,940
A little cold, not too bad.

158
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,940
Full day of conference on Friday.

159
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,660
And Friday is the way they do Test Bash.

160
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,580
It's great.

161
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,220
What they do, instead of getting a bunch of mediocre talks

162
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,420
and breaking them into tracks, they get a bunch of good talks.

163
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,340
Mine, meh.

164
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,060
And put them into a single track.

165
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,180
Everybody in one room, everybody watching the whole conference.

166
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,840
Oh, OK.

167
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,920
Excellent, all the way through.

168
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,440
And then the next day, there was an unconference,

169
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,800
which is an open space event, which

170
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,360
I love those sorts of things.

171
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,980
I went to an event to draw a comic from Constance.

172
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,400
I forget Constance's last name, but she's the artful tester

173
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,580
on Twitter.

174
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,720
And she just kind of, I liked her style.

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,240
She pretty much said, look, there's

176
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,440
no extra skill involved. It's just practice.

177
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,280
Now draw yourself a damn comic about your Test Bash experience.

178
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,720
That was actually really cool.

179
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Well, OK.

180
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,640
Because I drew, oh, I named the modern tester, the sick figure.

181
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,240
I saw.

182
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,880
Monty the modern tester.

183
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,400
So I drew a comic of, I tweeted it, you might have seen it.

184
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,080
I did.

185
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,480
Monty goes to Test Bash.

186
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,830
That was fun.

187
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,070
Monty looked a lot like you.

188
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,550
Now I was in, I even replied to your tweet.

189
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,510
I'm like, ooh.

190
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,470
Because we've talked many times on this episode

191
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,390
about the squirrel.

192
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,440
And I'm like, ooh, that's a great name for the squirrel.

193
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,960
It just occurred to me that the quote

194
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,600
that the artful tester shared with you

195
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,720
is almost similar to what we're saying.

196
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,800
There's no special skill to testing.

197
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
Now Delvers, sit down and start testing.

198
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
Well, you got to start somewhere.

199
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,880
But the thing is, it's the practice.

200
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,640
And what Constance said was, if you just

201
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,280
keep on doing this and practicing,

202
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,680
you'll get better and better.

203
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,600
And you don't have to be great.

204
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,720
And she brought up the fact that XKCD, not particularly

205
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,560
well drawn, but it's also written by a genius who

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,040
has funny things to say.

207
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,480
But if you look even at the really early comics of Dilbert

208
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,560
and compare it to today's, it's a huge difference

209
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,920
because Scott Adams draws every day.

210
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,240
So I actually, and I've failed so far,

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,800
but I do want to draw some more Monty comics.

212
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,680
I think I'm going to try and draw a Monty comic a week

213
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,400
and see if I get any better over time.

214
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,280
Or you know what?

215
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,080
You for sure will.

216
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,790
They're not well.

217
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,870
I mean, they're not horrible.

218
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,950
I can tell the story.

219
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,310
But I think the practice will be fun.

220
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,990
So thank you, Constance, for that.

221
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,990
A couple great talks.

222
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,670
I met a lot of great people.

223
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,070
In fact, all the talks were great.

224
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,030
So if I single any out, I may make

225
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,470
it seem like I didn't like the other ones,

226
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,950
but I liked them all.

227
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,350
Let me ask you.

228
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,030
Go ahead, ask me.

229
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,430
And then I'll go ahead and give a few of the ones

230
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,270
that I really liked.

231
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,860
Well, it'll be aligned, I think.

232
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,660
So my favorite question to ask you

233
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,180
whenever you go to these conferences

234
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:48,110
is essentially take all of the talks that you listen to,

235
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,470
aggregate them up into three distinct themes.

236
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,070
Those distinct themes would be what?

237
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,180
Oh, man, that's tough.

238
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,820
I was surprised.

239
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,540
This is going to be the long-round answer for one.

240
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,860
I'm giving a talk on web testing tools at Star

241
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,140
coming up in end of April, beginning of May.

242
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,860
And for that talk, I put together

243
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,700
a small little workshop on Postman.

244
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,500
You familiar with Postman?

245
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,060
No.

246
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,580
Postman is wow.

247
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,950
I know the song.

248
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,840
Stop it.

249
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,960
Postman came up a lot.

250
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,840
Postman's a tool you can use for REST API testing.

251
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,120
It's really, really good.

252
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,320
It came up in a bunch of different talks.

253
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,920
So first of all, I went to a workshop

254
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,480
on exploratory testing web apps, and it

255
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,560
was using Postman for almost all of it, which was cool.

256
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,720
Got a couple ideas.

257
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,310
From Amber Race, also from Seattle.

258
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,310
And then it came up in one of the talks I had.

259
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,190
Danny Dainton, if you ever read his blog or seen him on Twitter,

260
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,350
I didn't realize it was his first conference talk.

261
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,190
He was in the military for a long time

262
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,940
and just told this story how he was basically an F up as a kid.

263
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,300
Yeah, maybe that's a little harsh.

264
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,460
But no, not really know what he's doing.

265
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,380
Parents made him figure out what he was going to do.

266
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,020
He joined the army, really learned how to learn there.

267
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,250
I think that's as long time A, B testing listeners.

268
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:12,850
Well, no.

269
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,290
Once you learn how to learn and develop

270
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,770
that passion for learning, your ability to do anything

271
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,110
is unbound.

272
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,070
As long as you don't lose your drive to get shit done.

273
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,830
Yeah, exactly.

274
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,550
It can't just be theoretical research.

275
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,550
Anyway, he is doing really well working at New Voice Media.

276
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,310
I might have got the order wrong,

277
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,990
where Rob Lampert, who writes a lot of great blog articles,

278
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,340
works.

279
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,220
And using Postman a lot, talked about that

280
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,300
and his experiences there.

281
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,700
But he gave a really good talk.

282
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,660
He made me get my slides out and step up my game a little bit.

283
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,300
Did he?

284
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:50,780
Wow.

285
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,340
And he just did the thing I usually do,

286
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,460
which is mostly pictures on slides and tell stories.

287
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,740
But for modern testing, I had to put a few more words on slides

288
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,350
than I normally do.

289
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,710
And I had to make sure I had kind of my,

290
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:09,350
that I had to make sure I had my stories in order.

291
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,870
So this was sort of the first real official presentation

292
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,630
of the principles, which yes, right.

293
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:18,590
I get why you would have to add additional words.

294
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,550
Yeah, yeah.

295
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,310
My notes on, I shared my slides with everyone.

296
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,750
And my notes for that slide say, most words, if you look,

297
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,350
I don't think I deleted this part,

298
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,230
but it says most words on a slide since my stupid

299
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:35,100
presentation at Star West 2003.

300
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,980
I was learning.

301
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,370
So as far as upside, Danny's presentation

302
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,770
was about 10,000% better than my first ever presentation.

303
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,060
OK.

304
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,460
I started at the very low bar.

305
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,940
I also really enjoyed Rosie Hamilton's talk

306
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,660
on logic and testing.

307
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,470
She worked for a long time in games at EA.

308
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,590
And I forget where she is now, but I'll remember later.

309
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:03,190
And she'll tweet at me and yell at me

310
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,350
if she listens to the podcast.

311
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,710
If she doesn't listen, she'll never know.

312
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,550
Don't tell her.

313
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:09,070
But it was a really cool progression

314
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,710
using principles of logic and testing.

315
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,910
And it was very insightful.

316
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,110
I thought it was very well done.

317
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,470
Sorry.

318
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,070
I got into my answer.

319
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,790
And I need to go back to your answer.

320
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,790
Community was a big theme.

321
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,790
My other workshop was on building community,

322
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,270
a lot of head nodding, a lot of feedback.

323
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:27,150
Community came up at a few other talks.

324
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,870
Ministry of testing is a community.

325
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,580
And I explained to them, and something

326
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,940
we talked about on the podcast,

327
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,220
I've explained to the audience that while my title is

328
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,420
Director of Test or Director of Quality,

329
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,820
or I don't know what it is, Director of something,

330
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,500
I consider myself a community leader.

331
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,260
My role is a community leader at Unity.

332
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,660
And there are people on my team who

333
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,820
are transitioning their people away from them.

334
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,500
And the role they're considering for themselves is,

335
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,580
we're calling it temporarily, role, not title,

336
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,020
is QA community leader.

337
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,900
But I realize that it's really just a quality coach.

338
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,220
So we may push that direction.

339
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,100
But anyway, we've talked about it before.

340
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,180
Community came up a lot.

341
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,860
So community, postman, oddly, very specific thing,

342
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,180
came up a lot.

343
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,500
I'll have to think about what maybe the third thing is.

344
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,100
But I was surprised and pleasantly surprised

345
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,900
how often community came up.

346
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,860
Somewhere between now and the end of the podcast,

347
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,620
I will go, aha, and tell you the third big theme that

348
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,940
has gelled in my mind.

349
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,180
Next time I go to a conference, I'll prepare and coagulate

350
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,730
that ahead of time.

351
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,330
So that's the longest I've ever talked

352
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,410
to not answer a question at all.

353
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,970
Man, maybe not.

354
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,450
Maybe you answered 67% of the question.

355
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,450
Exactly.

356
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,750
What about takeaways?

357
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,550
You said there were a lot of head nods,

358
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,030
which is kind of what I would have expected at Test Bash.

359
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,910
Again, I was talking to Marcus, one of the three, about this.

360
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,430
And if I were to end this talk at a different conference,

361
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,270
a conference that was geared more towards brand new testers,

362
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,190
didn't care.

363
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,710
So here's the difference.

364
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,630
There were new testers at Test Bash, fairly new testers.

365
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,760
But the difference is, I think, people

366
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,030
go to a conference like Test Bash because they

367
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,780
want to go to Test Bash and learn.

368
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,380
There are some bigger conferences that people go to

369
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,540
because their company sends them.

370
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,340
I think the other thing too is with Test Bash

371
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,420
is if you feel yourself a member of the community,

372
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,980
going to Test Bash is also a communing thing.

373
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,060
Yes, there is a communing aspect.

374
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:47,700
Richard Bradshaw, who's the new boss boss, he asked me,

375
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,620
so you were at Test Bash Philadelphia two years ago.

376
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,220
How's the vibe?

377
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,180
So largely the same.

378
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,250
It's really cool.

379
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,570
I like it that people come to commune.

380
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,530
And most Test Bashes, they're doing five this year,

381
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,180
but they need, although they're technically

382
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,700
run by Ministry of Testing, as Rich explained it to me,

383
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,300
that you have someone in the city of the venue

384
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,500
to kind of be the point person, to do a lot of the work,

385
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,400
to have stuff shipped to them, et cetera, et cetera.

386
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,320
So that's kind of cool.

387
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,850
I think, not in the short term, but I think you and I

388
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,090
should think about whether there's a Test Bash Seattle

389
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,900
at some time and how we get involved in that.

390
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,220
I'm going to plant that seed.

391
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,300
Yeah.

392
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,780
I'm not against that.

393
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,990
OK.

394
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,030
Seattle would be a good fantastic venue for this.

395
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,390
This passion for learning we talk about all the time.

396
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,190
I think 99% of Test Bash attendees have that.

397
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:56,580
Often some of the more mainstream larger conferences,

398
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,260
they're good for getting a whole bunch of different kinds

399
00:15:59,260 --> 00:15:59,860
of information.

400
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,260
But I think the people that get sent there maybe

401
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,010
don't have that, I hate to use the buzz word, growth mindset.

402
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,090
That passion for learning, that hunger for learning,

403
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:21,110
that I see across the people I meet at Test Bash.

404
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,630
Yeah.

405
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,070
I think it makes a difference.

406
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,110
The other thing too that I've been thinking about

407
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:30,860
is I've been getting a large number of reports

408
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:38,190
around essentially what we're saying is

409
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:45,260
it's very attractive to younger testers.

410
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:52,730
And I think number one, I think the idea of life hacking,

411
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:57,610
growth hacking, growth mindset, all of these current buzz words

412
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,460
resonates with that crowd.

413
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:07,620
And I think there's another thing too is humans

414
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,060
are wired with this, a good portion of humans

415
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,100
are wired with this idea that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

416
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,180
And I think there's a lot of folks

417
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,620
who have built a strong career off

418
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,460
of the traditional testing methods

419
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,140
and are kind of hiding behind that old theme.

420
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,900
Hey, why is it broken now?

421
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,040
And it's mostly because they're not

422
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,080
paying attention to how the world is changing.

423
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,200
Yes, agreed completely.

424
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
I've gone through and I've reviewed your slides.

425
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,300
There's a couple of things that I think are really important.

426
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:51,850
Modern testing, your first slide,

427
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,890
you talk about this is not a future of testing thing.

428
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,530
Yes, because I want people to know, and they get it here.

429
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,330
I'm going to interrupt for one second.

430
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,890
Because that was really important.

431
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,450
As I'm putting this together, I don't

432
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,690
want people to think this is theoretical.

433
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,490
I spend the first half the presentation kind

434
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,530
of talking about why modern testing,

435
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:15,570
before I talk about what modern testing is.

436
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,430
But I've seen people, and I mentioned in the talk before,

437
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,230
I've given future testing talks, not my best talks.

438
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,030
Because they're speculative and they're not

439
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,230
riding the wave of a trend.

440
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,310
And I think what we're seeing in modern testing

441
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,150
is it's something that it's actually happening.

442
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,910
And the fact we get head nods at a conference like Test Bash,

443
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,750
I would get, the point I was going to make about the other

444
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,990
conferences, there are some conferences where

445
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,670
I would get very few head nods and a lot of looks

446
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,070
of disbelief and disgust.

447
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,990
So yes, I'll let you finish now.

448
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,230
No, I was going to piggyback off of that anyway.

449
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,700
What modern testing is about is there

450
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,710
is a clear change coming.

451
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,710
And what modern testing is about is

452
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,460
how do we help people stay in the driver's seat

453
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:18,140
for their career as this change occurs versus skidding out

454
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,860
and falling off a cliff someplace.

455
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,260
You did a surfing metaphor.

456
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,380
I went with the driving one.

457
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,180
OK, whatever.

458
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:34,880
It is absolutely clear in my mind that this shift is occurring.

459
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,440
Gladwell, we haven't yet hit the worldwide tipping point yet.

460
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,080
Not yet.

461
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,880
But when it hits, this change occurs,

462
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,080
will occur globally very rapidly.

463
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,360
I think so.

464
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,620
I also worry about it, tension time.

465
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,900
I talked about in the presentation,

466
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,340
we've talked on the podcast before,

467
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,740
actually there's nothing I talked about in the presentation

468
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,180
that we haven't talked about on the podcast before.

469
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,420
So that's a lot of drinking.

470
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,310
Companies often will like, oh look,

471
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,870
you can make software with no testers.

472
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,470
OK, we don't have any testers.

473
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,470
Like whoa, you need to transition.

474
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,750
You need to have a plan.

475
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,790
You can't just do it.

476
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,600
You can't just swing the pendulum.

477
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,560
Yeah, I saw my tourniquet quote on Twitter.

478
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,800
I did give you credit.

479
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,600
I worry that some company with, OK,

480
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,960
we're going to fire all of our testers except for three.

481
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,600
You three are the test coaches for the org.

482
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,080
Go.

483
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,020
But, uh, ugh.

484
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,580
Well, hopefully those three are part of the three,

485
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,980
and they'll be prepped.

486
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,740
They are.

487
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,420
Yeah, maybe.

488
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,620
One of the things, you know, I experienced both a team

489
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,300
in the story I tell is I was on, in the short version,

490
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,820
is I was on that stupid Android app, some Windows Phone team,

491
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,420
where we just said, OK, no more testers.

492
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,540
You're the quality and data team,

493
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,340
whatever they called them in Windows.

494
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,660
And I was like, whatever.

495
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,220
And so I watched what happened there

496
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,820
and how to survive, how to transition that team

497
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,740
to doing better engineering.

498
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,060
And then I joined teams where I was the only quality guy

499
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,940
on an established dev team, and my role as quality coach

500
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,500
there and what that was like.

501
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,580
And from those experiences, then I joined Unity,

502
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,820
had no idea what I was going to do.

503
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,740
And to be clear, when I joined Unity,

504
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,100
I didn't have an agenda.

505
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,330
My agenda was to not get fired.

506
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,690
I said, please don't discover that I'm a fraud.

507
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,330
I have imposter syndrome very, very badly.

508
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,690
Please don't discover I'm a fraud.

509
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,490
I'm just going to try and figure stuff out

510
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,290
and see if I can provide any value at all

511
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,890
before I have to go look for another job.

512
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,850
But what I discovered very quickly is, OK, this is,

513
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,250
something's gelled.

514
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,010
My hindsight, my retrospective of, oh, yeah, all that work

515
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,130
I did for building communities, it's like,

516
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,170
I'm a community leader.

517
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:52,490
This actually helps.

518
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,490
Some of the things Brent and I have been talking about

519
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,650
with modern testing, these actually work really well here.

520
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,210
And I actually like that I can do it

521
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,170
in a very guided and purposeful,

522
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,090
I can do a very guided and purposeful transition

523
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,450
to many of the things we've been talking about.

524
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,570
So I've been very, things have sort of appeared

525
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,530
before my eyes.

526
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,570
So I, you know what I mean?

527
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:17,970
Like the agenda wasn't there,

528
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,020
but the strategy became obvious.

529
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,860
I'm trying to test in my mind,

530
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,180
because there's this old phrase,

531
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,020
if the only tool you know how to use is a hammer,

532
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,820
then every problem looks like a nail.

533
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,020
But I don't think that's the story you're doing here.

534
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,740
I think it's more of a,

535
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,760
hey, my strengths and my experience

536
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,160
are a great fit here.

537
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,800
I know exactly what to do to add business value

538
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,640
and what differentiates me from the other.

539
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,240
I guess that's not really what I'm saying.

540
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,390
What I'm saying more is that

541
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,030
I think the idea of doing a transition into modern testing

542
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,870
and having some coaching through the whole process

543
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,790
of don't do it all at once, it is a tourniquet.

544
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:11,040
The transition to modern testing is a tourniquet.

545
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,020
You have to treat stuff while you're removing it.

546
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,810
You can't just rip it off like a mandate.

547
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,250
For a team doing even agile testing,

548
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,250
which is, as we've discussed, very close,

549
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,430
we're definitely an evolution, a variation.

550
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,630
I think you can't just turn the mandate off,

551
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,510
go, okay, now you're doing this, it won't work.

552
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,350
No.

553
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,510
So that's the point I'm trying to make is

554
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,470
I'm lucky that I'm in a position

555
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:39,390
where I can do it gradually and purposeful

556
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,350
and make it happen successfully.

557
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,590
I think the biggest problems

558
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,340
when people take the rip the band-aid approach,

559
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,780
a lot of folks will take the rip.

560
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,140
I will rip the band-aid every now and again.

561
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,780
But the thing is that you have to do

562
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,220
is that the leader who's ripping the band-aid

563
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,220
has to be prepared to react in near real time.

564
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,180
And just to be clear, for people

565
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,740
who haven't seen the quote, and I apologize,

566
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,940
the wonderful quote from Brent on this is,

567
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,180
sometimes you have to rip off the band-aid,

568
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,700
but be careful because sometimes it's a tourniquet.

569
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,930
Yep.

570
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,410
This was a quote that came to me from years ago.

571
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:27,050
I did a presentation around how to transition

572
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,210
into what Alan and I now call

573
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:32,890
a unified engineering role.

574
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:38,040
And if you go too fast on that,

575
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,690
you're actually gonna cause more harm.

576
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,090
Shifting back to manual testing and test bash.

577
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:48,930
No, shifting back, we never got there yet.

578
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,770
What have we been talking about for the last 30 minutes?

579
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:53,760
Test bash, but not manual testing.

580
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,200
Not manual testing, I meant modern testing.

581
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,230
Yeah, interesting.

582
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,590
The MT acronym, modern testing, ministry of test,

583
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,510
manual test.

584
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,870
I hope all three of you feel a little bit

585
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,270
sorry for me right now.

586
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:13,660
Okay, Brent, please go on.

587
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,980
Every episode.

588
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:15,940
Every.

589
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,500
Oh, no, no, no.

590
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,900
Not every episode.

591
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,740
There was one episode.

592
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,820
There was the one where I wasn't there.

593
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,080
The one where you weren't there, right?

594
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,480
Oh, and to be clear, I did, no surprises.

595
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,400
I did not bring my recording equipment.

596
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,520
There was no podcast recorded without you.

597
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,480
So at least you have that.

598
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,200
This is truly 79.

599
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,560
Oh, fantastic.

600
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,120
Where were we?

601
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm not expecting much here,

602
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,200
but after, I assume people came and talked to you.

603
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,920
First off, from the crowd,

604
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,280
so it sounds like Vernon introduced you?

605
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,040
Yep, Vernon was the MC for the day.

606
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,040
Okay, yeah.

607
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:55,470
And it sounds like modern testing

608
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,780
may not have been a new concept to a lot of the folks.

609
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,260
But not entirely.

610
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,660
So one thing I missed,

611
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,420
and then I do wanna dive into some of the questions we had,

612
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,060
is one part of the conference I didn't mention

613
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,860
is in addition to the unconference on the last day,

614
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,700
during Friday conference, during the breaks,

615
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,220
there was an unexpo.

616
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,020
And when the unexpo is, it's a cool idea,

617
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,100
is during each of the two or three breaks,

618
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,640
there were a bunch of poster papers.

619
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,480
Okay.

620
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,360
And you stand by, people come and look inside your poster,

621
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,560
they ask questions about it, et cetera.

622
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,440
So in order to kickstart it,

623
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,760
Richard asked each of the presenters

624
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,160
if they would do one of these unexpo topics

625
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,680
for the morning session to get people

626
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,720
an idea of what was going on.

627
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,600
This is on Friday.

628
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,440
So on Thursday night.

629
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,520
So it was like PR for the talk?

630
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,480
Didn't have to be about the talks.

631
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,640
Could be about anything.

632
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,480
Okay.

633
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,520
And Leila Lea, it goes by Swani,

634
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,120
who was getting into testing

635
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,360
from a communications background.

636
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,680
A lot of, has that passion for learning,

637
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,640
has everything you look for,

638
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,680
just passionately looking for a job.

639
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,640
She had a hire me paper.

640
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,480
Oh.

641
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,520
It was really cool.

642
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,280
I have a feeling if she's not hired now,

643
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
she'll be hired very soon.

644
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,890
Okay.

645
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,170
So I thought about a couple different things,

646
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,690
but what I did was I just listed out

647
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,450
the modern testing principles.

648
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,810
Okay, now I understand what that picture was.

649
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:18,690
That paper was, I stood by that.

650
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,850
People walked by and they went,

651
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,450
oh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

652
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,130
They go, tell me about this one.

653
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:24,570
We talked about, what does that mean?

654
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,970
A lot of the same vetting we've done before.

655
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,810
But I feel good about the vetting.

656
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,210
There's a little more to go.

657
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,650
There's a couple things that are like,

658
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,130
don't sit quite right.

659
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,890
But it sat pretty well.

660
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,020
So that's where that came from.

661
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,740
And then that was cool to have that precursor,

662
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,500
because I don't get to the modern principles

663
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,340
in the talk till the very end.

664
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,540
So it's good to have a few people familiar with them

665
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,820
before I gave the talk.

666
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:52,030
It made a nice little flow for the whole week for me.

667
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,630
Yeah, I was briefly thinking,

668
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,540
so like the expo portion of conferences,

669
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,700
generally love them,

670
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,140
because that's when you walk around,

671
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,300
go from booth to booth and get free stuff.

672
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,800
So an unexpo, I guess, is where,

673
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,320
and all the people come give the people

674
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,370
at the booth stuff.

675
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,830
Love this idea.

676
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,150
Yeah, no.

677
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,830
Just a way to get people talking about new ideas.

678
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,610
Where do new ideas come from?

679
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,630
Where do good ideas come from, Brent?

680
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,150
From other ideas getting together.

681
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:29,510
Yeah, new and good ideas come from the same place.

682
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,350
Good.

683
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,990
Other ideas getting together.

684
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,000
Sure.

685
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,390
Making sweet, new baby ideas.

686
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,140
Before my talk, Vernon said,

687
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,340
hey, so if you could finish it,

688
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,700
that whatever time it was,

689
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,860
leave time for about at least five minutes for questions,

690
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,060
that'd be great.

691
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,900
I can do that, I can do that.

692
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,740
And then I thought of a few extra stories

693
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,340
I wanted to tell during my talk,

694
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,580
because the squirrel came in and told me

695
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,620
I should tell the extra stories.

696
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,140
I think this story will be relevant,

697
00:28:59,140 --> 00:28:59,980
I'm gonna tell it.

698
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,240
And then I was wrapping up,

699
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,980
and I didn't rush the end.

700
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,500
One thing I hate watching talks

701
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,940
is someone who will go,

702
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,220
okay, we're running out of time,

703
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,420
so I'm gonna skip this slide,

704
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,700
I say screw you.

705
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,540
So I have a pretty good idea of,

706
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,420
pretty good sense of time on my talks

707
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,660
and how much, where I wanna be.

708
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,420
So I didn't go over time by any means,

709
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,980
but I finished with about two minutes left to go,

710
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,560
instead of the five minutes.

711
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,580
So Vernon said we could take one question,

712
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,780
and as you know,

713
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,340
we probably could have taken two,

714
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,860
but I'm incapable of answering a question quickly.

715
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,440
So someone asked me,

716
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,250
so does this mean if I don't write code,

717
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,170
I don't have a career as a modern tester?

718
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:40,450
And then I had an answer for that.

719
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,450
I'm gonna ask you first.

720
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,580
Yep.

721
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,660
And then also over Twitter,

722
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,460
I had this question.

723
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,740
Alan, started listening to your A-B testing podcast

724
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,380
just this past week with the two episodes

725
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,720
on the modern tester.

726
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,900
Welcome, welcome to the three.

727
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,820
I found these ideas challenging for me,

728
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,540
and they will be for most of the testers on my team

729
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,170
who do not write test code,

730
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,630
but do their best to add business value

731
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:09,270
to the product we test.

732
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,830
Wondering about your comments

733
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,850
on teaching devs to write tests.

734
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,790
In your experience, what does this look like,

735
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,650
and what do devs not understand about testing?

736
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,370
So there's two things I wanna cover there.

737
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,690
So I wanna get to the devs thing in a second.

738
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,530
Yep.

739
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:26,350
But the first bit.

740
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,190
So I'm gonna ask you first,

741
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,970
and then I'll tell you what answer I gave,

742
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:31,050
which is what is the role?

743
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,090
So I'm a very good tester.

744
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,980
I'm the kind of tester that goes to test bash.

745
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,960
And, but I don't write test code, whatever that is.

746
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,670
I don't write code.

747
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,020
What's my future as a modern tester?

748
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,630
I would say my answer to that question is it's grim.

749
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,150
I'm going to put some more context in you

750
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:57,070
and un-grimify it for you.

751
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,430
Well, so let me just,

752
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,470
so first off, my view,

753
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,990
I guess I could turn about

754
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:06,310
and ask you a different question.

755
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,310
And that is, is there such a thing as a modern tester?

756
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,760
That is actually a great question.

757
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,600
I know.

758
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,680
Because you can be,

759
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,140
you're an engineer that follows modern testing principles.

760
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:23,980
Right.

761
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,080
But your role isn't a modern tester.

762
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,760
There really can't be such a thing as a modern tester

763
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,240
at the same time as a modern tester

764
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,540
being a specializing generalist.

765
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,640
I get that.

766
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,640
So I think a modern tester, if it does exist,

767
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,860
is a transitional phase.

768
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
Right.

769
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,860
If you think about what we're saying in the principles

770
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:57,470
is that we're saying modern or testing over time

771
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,450
disappears as a specialization.

772
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,450
And I do think that manual test jobs.

773
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,970
So don't look at it as manual.

774
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,810
Go back, let me just throw a little bit of context.

775
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,170
You may get an aha.

776
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,370
Go back to my presentation on becoming a technical tester.

777
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,210
Yep.

778
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,050
Which was none of it was about being able to write code.

779
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:28,240
I think, I think that you can be a valuable member

780
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,220
of the team and apply each of the modern testing

781
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,370
principles, you don't have to be a coder.

782
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,050
And I will teach people at STAR

783
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,130
that you don't have to be a coder

784
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,490
to do pretty good API testing for REST APIs.

785
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,770
If you're willing to put in the effort

786
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,750
to learn how tools work.

787
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,770
Using, learning how to use Docker to set up environments

788
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:56,730
to accelerate how fast the team can do work.

789
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,530
I don't disagree with these aspects.

790
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,250
I don't disagree with these aspects.

791
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,770
I don't necessarily think you end up being a coder

792
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:11,890
the way the traditional test dev arguments

793
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,110
have always landed.

794
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:20,940
But I do think you become a much more hands on engineer

795
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,740
in this world.

796
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,520
Like manual testing in the world?

797
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,060
Yeah, do I think that goes away?

798
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,940
Yeah, I do.

799
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,140
Because the customer does the majority of the manual test.

800
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,660
The majority, the majority.

801
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:39,500
But the point I'll bring up, the point I'll stand behind

802
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:44,470
is, well first of all say, there's a large chunk

803
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:47,270
of manual testers who the feature is grim.

804
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,110
Yes.

805
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,230
Absolutely.

806
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:54,230
There are a set of testers who do not write code

807
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,150
that can be very successful in a organization

808
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,510
following modern testing principles.

809
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,790
I fully believe that.

810
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,630
I don't disagree with that.

811
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,510
I think they can accelerate the achievable quality

812
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,590
by finding the right tools,

813
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:10,050
by being a force for continuous improvement.

814
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,250
You can push, if you look at those principles,

815
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,050
none of them are about writing some kick ass tools.

816
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,850
Certainly it's a means to an end for several of those,

817
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:21,060
but there are other things you can do to drive quality.

818
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,140
Yeah, again, the challenge though I think with this

819
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:29,820
is maintaining your role as a specializing generalist.

820
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,620
Yeah, and I also think if you pursue

821
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,140
that technical tester and maybe,

822
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,100
okay I'm gonna be a technical tester,

823
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,140
but I'm not gonna write code,

824
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,700
because I don't like that.

825
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,780
That's fine.

826
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:42,540
I think you will actually stumble across

827
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,460
some coding, like you'll like,

828
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,040
oh, a SQL query here to get at the data.

829
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,220
Not that hard to do, you may go,

830
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,380
this is actually kind of cool.

831
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,560
I might do a little bit more of this.

832
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,200
You may write a little bit of JavaScript to automate a task

833
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,240
or a shell script to automate some Docker setup.

834
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,020
My hunch is that if you are striving to be technical

835
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,480
and via the tool route for your team,

836
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,900
that you will stumble across a little bit of scripting

837
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,780
and eventually you'll do a little bit of

838
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:10,300
what you could consider coding,

839
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,140
but you would never have called coding today.

840
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,640
Yeah, and I think a good portion of,

841
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,240
I think in the long term when the transition

842
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:23,040
finally closes globally,

843
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,680
I think actually we'll find a lot of those people

844
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,130
who are still around have shifted into probably

845
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,410
a job closer to what we describe as a PM role today.

846
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,250
Could be.

847
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:41,430
It's more of a customer focus.

848
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,430
It's more of a, I'll give you some advice I gave PMs

849
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:50,450
as an example when we were going through this transition

850
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,330
because one of the things that ended up happening

851
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,570
when Microsoft was going through

852
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:57,410
the unified engineering transition,

853
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,970
TESS was all aboard of sweet.

854
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,290
We're no longer part of the stupid safety net.

855
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,850
TESS realized very quickly that actually this move

856
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,490
helped move quality upstream

857
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:13,330
because it forced Dev to do their own testing.

858
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,210
On paper.

859
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,650
On paper, right.

860
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:20,650
But what ended up happening is they shifted at the same time

861
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,890
to PMs acting as the POs

862
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,470
and doing the acceptance testing,

863
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,810
acceptance testing from an agile point of view,

864
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,160
not an old traditional point of view of the new feature.

865
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,520
And I had to stop a bunch of PMs

866
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:43,850
from actually doing the actual testing of the feature.

867
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,290
I'm like, no.

868
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,850
When you do acceptance tests,

869
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,570
you're interviewing the developer,

870
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,560
you're not even loading the feature up.

871
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,460
You're going, okay, this was my requirement.

872
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,820
How did you cover, explain to me

873
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,780
how you satisfied this requirement.

874
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,550
What tests did you do?

875
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,150
And the PMs that listened to me,

876
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,510
they actually helped to reinforce the behavior.

877
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:09,030
The PMs that didn't started recreating

878
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:11,830
the safety net that Dev was accustomed to.

879
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,530
No safety nets.

880
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:14,530
That can be one of our mantras.

881
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,250
We need like some one-card, one-liners,

882
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,410
like no safety nets.

883
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,250
Yeah.

884
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,070
I like that.

885
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:23,010
The other half of the question I want to answer,

886
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,090
because it's a quick answer,

887
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,090
wondering about your comments

888
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,890
on teaching Devs to write tests.

889
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,890
In your experience, what does this look like

890
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,250
and what do Devs not understand about testing?

891
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:33,690
Actually, there's nothing.

892
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,530
They don't understand.

893
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,090
Well, there's lots they don't understand about testing

894
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,840
until they try it.

895
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,480
And just like when we first started testing,

896
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,640
we tried things and we learned from them

897
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,320
and we tried new things.

898
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,480
You can accelerate that trying by coaching,

899
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,020
by pairing with them is the best example,

900
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,440
giving them new ideas.

901
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,420
I talked a lot about how I taught a team to test

902
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,840
by just doing code reviews all the time,

903
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,520
how to write automated tests.

904
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,760
There are better ways than that,

905
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
but that's one way that works.

906
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,880
In general, test every developer,

907
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,320
I have never had a challenge like,

908
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,920
here's a testing concept that developers just can't learn.

909
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,540
Never, ever, ever had that.

910
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:18,970
No.

911
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,170
The only challenge that I've had around teaching Devs

912
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:33,010
to test, walking through the tool,

913
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,770
walking through learnings we've had

914
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,210
around data-driven testing or things like that,

915
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,250
these are all algorithmic concepts.

916
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,290
They get those pretty quickly.

917
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,850
The only challenge that I've ever encountered

918
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,850
is addressing the, okay, now, why am I doing this

919
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,200
versus you or those other guys?

920
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,220
Why am I wasting my valuable coding time doing testing?

921
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,260
That's it.

922
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,160
I haven't had that.

923
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,780
It's a cultural...

924
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,300
Oh, let me give you one challenge.

925
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,520
One of my teams I work with

926
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,850
are very good at writing code

927
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,730
or delivering a feature where the feature is,

928
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:13,210
okay, it's supposed to do this, it does this,

929
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:14,810
and it does that very well.

930
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,370
But they're getting better,

931
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,730
but there was a point where it was always like,

932
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:22,530
well, what if we do something slightly differently

933
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,240
every time it would break?

934
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,300
That probably is one of the more common learning curves

935
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,060
I've had to get some developers over

936
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,710
is just thinking a little bit about

937
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,670
what are the ways in which this may not work

938
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,230
and planning for those, that defensive programming.

939
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,540
Yep.

940
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,380
Coachable.

941
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,660
They get better at it.

942
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,720
Completely agree.

943
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,800
One of the models that I do,

944
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,400
so in retrospective, actually,

945
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,680
so my engineering model,

946
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,720
which is a variant of Kanban,

947
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,150
my engineering model helps us solve this as well.

948
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,350
So number one, we don't maintain a bug database,

949
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,270
and every time there's a bug

950
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,190
that's shipped in the wild,

951
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:10,870
that's the thing that interrupts the whole team.

952
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:16,480
And the team gets kind of irritated

953
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:20,360
when it's very clear that we're constantly being interrupted

954
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,380
because Alan keeps shipping bugs.

955
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,220
I suck.

956
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,480
Shouldn't let me write code.

957
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,320
No, and by making it,

958
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:33,320
the team pays the consequence for the weakness of one member,

959
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,580
creates sort of a social pressure on that one member

960
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,380
to stop doing it because they get tired

961
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,980
of having to explain to the team yet again

962
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,080
why they're having to come and save the day.

963
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,020
I'm pretty sure it's your fault.

964
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:53,860
The second one that I found that works rather well

965
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,900
is in retrospectives,

966
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,500
I don't hold the code owner responsible.

967
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,910
I hold the code reviewers responsible.

968
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:08,510
And that sort of helps to support,

969
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,390
we talked about spider and starfish,

970
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,670
that kind of helps to support the starfish principle.

971
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,630
Interestingly and coincidentally enough

972
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,230
is I send a part of my community leader,

973
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,990
I send a weekly newsletter to my org,

974
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,430
my community, I should say,

975
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,510
because many of them don't report to me anymore.

976
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,990
And yesterday the article is about retrospectives

977
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,350
and how damn valuable they are

978
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,870
and how more teams should be doing them.

979
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,470
And a bunch of some tips and things,

980
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:40,710
again, I plant seeds, some will stick, some won't.

981
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,910
That's true.

982
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,750
All right, shall we get to this?

983
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,790
Can I get one more question for you?

984
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,530
Yeah, yeah.

985
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,130
Actually one thing though,

986
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,770
the other thing that we've talked about,

987
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:49,850
no, hold on.

988
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,410
Because one of the things is what does it look like

989
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,930
to teach devs how to test?

990
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:54,890
The other thing too,

991
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,310
so we've talked about a little bit,

992
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,320
there's some set of testers

993
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,520
in the traditional mindset

994
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:11,080
that we basically are warning,

995
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,360
yeah, you should probably make a shift

996
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,500
because the thing that you're used to

997
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,320
is not gonna be as valued

998
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,120
and significantly not as valued.

999
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,440
And we talk about how testing

1000
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
can be technical without coding,

1001
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,040
but let's also talk about,

1002
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,540
there are technical testers in the world

1003
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,640
who can code

1004
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,460
and their role,

1005
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,840
in my view, does not,

1006
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,320
is also not protected.

1007
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,360
Those folks are writing new tools

1008
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,280
or writing new automation

1009
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,600
and I actually, from my observation,

1010
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,050
what I found is that those guys

1011
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,550
become the devs of the future.

1012
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,230
Those guys shift over

1013
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:56,870
to starting doing product development

1014
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:01,740
with a strong, solid point of view

1015
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,020
of how it needs to be test

1016
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:05,180
and these guys rock.

1017
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,700
Yeah, and I think, and one point to make there

1018
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,900
is there isn't a single,

1019
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,860
if you're a tester today,

1020
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,620
this is what you do in the future.

1021
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,460
No.

1022
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,000
And that comes back to modern testing principles,

1023
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,360
our principles that an engineering team follows.

1024
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,840
We should look at them again in that view

1025
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,520
to make sure that's clear.

1026
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,660
It isn't about how you become a modern tester.

1027
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,620
It's about how a team uses modern testing principles

1028
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,540
to accelerate the achievable quality

1029
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,580
and to get value to their customers frequently.

1030
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,860
Yeah, again, if there is such a thing as a modern tester,

1031
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:45,740
that is a transitional role only

1032
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,660
because eventually it merges into,

1033
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,180
now this is a set of principles

1034
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,580
and there is a modern engineer.

1035
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,980
So the way I'm describing it in,

1036
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,870
and this rang pretty well as well,

1037
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,910
is I drew a diagram of sort of the Agile team

1038
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,510
which has the test specialist on the team.

1039
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,150
I said, really, if you look at it,

1040
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,070
everyone is a software generalist with specialization.

1041
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,490
And some of them may be,

1042
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,530
you want someone on your team generally,

1043
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,170
maybe if everybody's good at performance,

1044
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,330
you don't need a performance expert.

1045
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:18,990
Same thing if everybody's pretty good at testing,

1046
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,030
you don't need a testing expert,

1047
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:21,870
but you're gonna have some expertise on the team.

1048
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,200
But really, Brent's making a face.

1049
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,240
You saw the slides.

1050
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,080
I did.

1051
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,600
I'm going.

1052
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,200
In that area of specialties,

1053
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,480
a team following modern testing principles,

1054
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm gonna rephrase a question that we saw in the Slack,

1055
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,040
one of the three.slack.com.

1056
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,880
If you wanna join, you can send me a DM to at Alan Page

1057
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,960
with your email address.

1058
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:49,040
So in a team that's following modern testing principles,

1059
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,140
who will perform tests such as security, performance,

1060
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,810
and all non-functional tests?

1061
00:44:56,810 --> 00:44:58,330
In a traditional testing company,

1062
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,290
it's the QA team is in charge of it.

1063
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:04,690
But when you have that homogenous engineering team,

1064
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,330
unified engineering,

1065
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,810
team following modern testing principles,

1066
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,210
whatever you wanna call it,

1067
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:11,610
I know the answer to this,

1068
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,120
but where does that testing happen?

1069
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,960
Well, I'm curious as to what your answer is

1070
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,440
because to me it's very clear.

1071
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,000
Yeah, it's absolutely,

1072
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,980
just like you are a testing specialist,

1073
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,640
you have performance specialists.

1074
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,240
The team does it.

1075
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,360
The team does performance testing.

1076
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,480
The team does security testing.

1077
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,700
I actually, you can outsource it?

1078
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,540
I think I disagree with that, yeah.

1079
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:35,260
So the NFR tests.

1080
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,900
So number one, I think,

1081
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,460
I agree with what you're saying in terms of

1082
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:44,580
within a unified engineering team,

1083
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:48,240
it may start off with a testing specialist that's in-house.

1084
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,340
But remember,

1085
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,940
their job is to teach the others how to succeed.

1086
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:57,940
It's if their job isn't the big portion of coaching,

1087
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:02,220
their job is to make that testing specialization

1088
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,100
not as special.

1089
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,620
So over time as they succeed,

1090
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:11,820
the other members pick up that skillset.

1091
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,660
Yes.

1092
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,500
Now-

1093
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,140
I'm in agreement so far, keep going.

1094
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:18,980
On the performance, security, scalability,

1095
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,780
any of the illities, right?

1096
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,300
Those are deep topics.

1097
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,100
And I do think deep topics,

1098
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:30,820
warrant a specialist.

1099
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,020
There are certainly breathwise things

1100
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,940
that should be introduced.

1101
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,820
But one of the things that we also,

1102
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:44,820
and I experience this with teams

1103
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,100
that tried to go too far on the,

1104
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,860
in my view, the unified engineering model.

1105
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:56,760
What you found is that a single developer

1106
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,420
had to know too much

1107
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,460
in order to just do their regular day job.

1108
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,700
They had to have done the deep security testing,

1109
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,020
the deep performance testing,

1110
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,780
to make sure that they're,

1111
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,900
and it was just too much to move forward.

1112
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,670
So it stalled the system.

1113
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,750
I do think some combination,

1114
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,350
and I wouldn't be surprised if the,

1115
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:22,540
if the quote unquote QA team still persisted,

1116
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:27,590
but they only owned the illities.

1117
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:29,550
I would say, so there's a,

1118
00:47:29,550 --> 00:47:31,110
I get where you're coming from,

1119
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:33,990
and I would modify what you said to say,

1120
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,070
rather than saying it needs specialization,

1121
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:39,660
it may need specialization.

1122
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:41,900
And it's gonna be context sensitive.

1123
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,380
What comes to mind a little bit,

1124
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,980
there's a couple, two models that come to mind.

1125
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:48,660
One is the Spotify squads and tribes and guilds model,

1126
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,300
where you could have specialty that spans orgs

1127
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,460
in a way that covers those things.

1128
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:58,580
But also if you look at the quality coach rule,

1129
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,580
so I will soon have people on my team

1130
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,000
who are responsible for,

1131
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,660
they will be the QA community leader

1132
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,540
or quality coach for maybe 75 developers.

1133
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,250
You could, I could actually see a world

1134
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:16,330
where maybe they have a few direct reports

1135
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:17,990
who have those specializations.

1136
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:20,610
Maybe someone in performance or security,

1137
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,730
or security is actually,

1138
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:23,930
we have a separate org worried about that.

1139
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,930
Performance, reliability, who could work deeply

1140
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:29,050
with those teams around that,

1141
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:32,130
be their reliability engineering coach,

1142
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:33,770
if they didn't have that specialty.

1143
00:48:33,770 --> 00:48:36,560
So I think what I'll say now

1144
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,080
is there isn't a one model fits all.

1145
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,700
I think in many teams,

1146
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,220
that specialization can come from the team.

1147
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,920
I think it depends on the scale of what you're delivering.

1148
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:49,260
I think at the Microsoft scale,

1149
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,680
I think you probably need that specialization.

1150
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,960
But in a smaller, depending on what you're delivering,

1151
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,840
you may not need a specialist to help with that.

1152
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,440
You can get good enough performance,

1153
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,960
via the performance skills of the engineers on the team

1154
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,200
and those that have some sort of specialty in performance.

1155
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,720
I agree with performance.

1156
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,920
Reliability, you can go up to a certain point, right?

1157
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,560
At some point in time though,

1158
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:20,880
the reliability problems are due to the architecture

1159
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,600
underlying the solution.

1160
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,080
To solve that, I would traditionally put that

1161
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,920
on the architect shoulders.

1162
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,200
What I'm looking at is there is...

1163
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,360
Security.

1164
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,200
Let me finish.

1165
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,400
So basically, I agree with you.

1166
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,720
I think given the business impact of security and privacy,

1167
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,280
specialists for those,

1168
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,320
and I think most companies of reasonable size

1169
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,840
have special security and privacy, that's warranted.

1170
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,080
I think on the reliability side,

1171
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,560
there is a community building around chaos engineering,

1172
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,000
where the Simeon Army and the Chaos Monkeys, et cetera,

1173
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,280
came from Netflix.

1174
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,400
It's beyond Netflix now, this idea of chaos engineering,

1175
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,070
but that can be a specialist.

1176
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:05,310
You may not need a peer specialist for that.

1177
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:07,750
You need an interest in that.

1178
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,750
You need a guild, whichever the Spotify model is,

1179
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:12,910
you need a community around chaos engineering,

1180
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,880
for example, to build reliability.

1181
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,320
Yeah, although my point of view today

1182
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,680
is that a chaos engineering team

1183
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,200
is just another engineering team.

1184
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,040
Sure.

1185
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,040
A unified engineering team.

1186
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,320
Yeah, I'm calling it community, but yeah.

1187
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,000
Okay, that's the questions.

1188
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,640
Do we cover, probably not.

1189
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:34,640
Probably didn't cover everything,

1190
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,150
but I'm afraid our time has come to an end, Brent.

1191
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,070
Do you have any final words?

1192
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:42,230
Of course you did, go ahead.

1193
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,820
No, next episode is 80.

1194
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:47,980
I like whole clean numbers, 80.

1195
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,140
You're so frickin' weird.

1196
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,900
I'm still Alan.

1197
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,940
And I'm Brent.

1198
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,220
Talk to you next time on A-B Testing.
