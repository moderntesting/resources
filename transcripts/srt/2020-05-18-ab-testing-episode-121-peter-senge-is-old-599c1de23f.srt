00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:10,580
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,980
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, agile, and anything else

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:24,340
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hi everyone. Howdy. I'm Alan. He's Brit.

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:33,380
Yeah. We are back. This is our third or fourth. I can't remember episode during COVID.

5
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,060
Are the days all getting blurry for you? Yeah. Everything. Every day is a Tuesday right now.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,600
Luckily I have some recurring meetings that drive the business that keep me from,

7
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,060
they keep me from forgetting what day it is completely. But yeah, it's a little blurry.

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:57,700
I don't know how many of these we've done, but it's going well. It's going all right.

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,340
I was pretty happy with how the last episode with our guest, David Bishop, went

10
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,660
episode before that was retrospectives also on COVID. And then I think we had one or two,

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,820
maybe just one. I don't know. We've been here a while. I have some skip level employees

12
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:18,550
that I just do once a month, one on ones with. This is our fifth. All right.

13
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,710
The data man, data man. I meet with them once every four weeks and we're getting around

14
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,790
to our second round of meetings the last few weeks under quarantine. It's like, yeah, it's

15
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,050
been a while. One interesting thing. And then we'll probably have a little bit of COVID

16
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:42,050
talk is we did a survey internally and without going into all the details of what our

17
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:49,300
return to office plan is, it's slow, which is good and voluntary, which is good.

18
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,100
And people have a choice to come back in some of the early phases. We have three

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,860
phases of coming back to the office, then a phase where everyone's welcome to come

20
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,180
back and everyone on my team, except for one has said, sorry, none of my team and my

21
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:12,110
whole organization has said, we'll come back when it's, you know, code green, when

22
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,150
there is no more precautions, when everything's good in the world. And with a few of

23
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,720
those people saying, I don't think I'm ever going back to the office. We have some

24
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,760
people who are really embracing the work from home and liking it a lot.

25
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,420
Oh, yeah. Not me. Not me. Yeah. There are there are those as well. How are you doing

26
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:41,160
on the work from home burnout? Explain. Are you getting fried working from? Oh, I

27
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,650
I passed fried like three weeks ago. Same. I have taken a couple half days on

28
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,130
Fridays. I'm going to do another one today just to recover. I just saw

29
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,320
something posted from Google. They have given their entire company May 22nd off

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,040
a day, just an extra day off to rest. Yeah. Last. We actually unity has that day as

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,360
a holiday. Anyway, we always get the when there's a U.S. three day weekend, we

32
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,000
always get a four day weekend. So that's a holiday for us as well. What day is

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,190
that? That's next Friday. So not this Monday, but the next Monday is a

34
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:28,470
memorial day. Then I guess right. You're going camping. Yeah. Yeah. So last week,

35
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:37,550
so I'm in a part of Azure known as Azure compute. And is that part of Azure

36
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:43,370
Windows? I'm just joking with you because is it Windows part of Azure now? Yeah,

37
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:50,460
it is. Okay. Anyway, go on. Azure compute. Is that like a W S compute? It's

38
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,300
like a W S compute stuff better. I'm going to let you finish. But just so

39
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,240
you know, are you a W S has a good computer? Yeah, I'm familiar with it.

40
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:09,230
Um, anyway, so the executives we have two of them. One that runs the

41
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,780
the engineering or the other one that runs the PM or gave us last Thursday

42
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:25,370
and Friday off. This is actually last Thursday was was when I decided, hey,

43
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm going to attack the blackberry bushes in my neighbor's yard. I got his

44
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,170
permission. So I'm just slaughtering them. Uh, ended up wounded myself in

45
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:43,810
the process. Um, I have what's known as trigger finger. Can't really show it

46
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:52,100
to those on the podcast. Um, and it's supposed to go away. Hasn't yet. Uh,

47
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,900
it's it's annoying to type with anyway. We hold on those last two days off.

48
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,260
It up again. Hold it up again. I want to get a picture. Uh, I gotta do it

49
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,370
this way. Now stretching all of my fingers out except for the one that

50
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,930
won't go. And it looks a little weird with looks a little weird with your

51
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:15,010
virtual background, but I'll get it in there. I'll ask you in a minute. I'll

52
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:20,460
tell you why I took that picture, but go on. I usually assume it's, uh, some

53
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,310
version of you mocking me. Um, yeah, yeah, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta

54
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:34,110
admit that 95% of the time that's that's right on. Um, anyway, so I

55
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,870
spent last Thursday slaughtering blackberry bushes and then I spent

56
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:46,200
Wednesday, uh, panicking around. Oh my God, I need my hands from my

57
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,720
business. What has happened to my finger. Um, but other than that, uh, the

58
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,380
only, the only difference was we weren't allowed to work in some regards.

59
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,520
What I would have, what I would have preferred is that they had said, Hey,

60
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,800
everyone, you can work, but we're banning meetings for the day. Now they

61
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,800
wouldn't have done that because most of my ICs are like, Oh, well, that's

62
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,280
nothing. I don't have any meetings anyway. Whereas I have back to back eight

63
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,520
to six half hour. Yeah, that's been a killer. I'm, I'm five to three usually

64
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
or six to three, but yeah, I would love that. That's fact. That's why I'm

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,160
taking a kind of a half day off this afternoon. I don't have any meetings.

66
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm taking advantage of that to get some, to just do some housework to get

67
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,200
away from my computer for a bit. Yeah. And then there's the other aspect

68
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:49,000
because of, um, because of how long we've been in here. I, and I don't want

69
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,620
to go into the full brain study here, but we've now been in this situation.

70
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:05,080
Um, Oh God, I don't know. It's coming up on two months. And after, after 90 days

71
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:13,420
of a consistent pattern, it becomes part of how you operate it. It's,

72
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,140
for those who care, go look up how your subconscious learns and the hippocampus

73
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,470
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And one of the things that I've slowly

74
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:35,270
seen happen with me is, uh, starting to hate my home office because going

75
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,030
into it represents the oppression of meetings.

76
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,390
That is fricking interesting.

77
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:51,910
Yeah. The, any, yeah, it's anytime I can get out of this thing. And it's

78
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,510
interesting because I, because I spent a lot of time making this some place

79
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:03,200
that I enjoy, but it's right at that's, it's slowly dissipating Fridays.

80
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,880
They're good. We do the podcast. That's fun. Uh, I have a couple of, of

81
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:17,160
meetings with my PM partners and, and those have become sort of, um, a, a

82
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,160
mutual back each other off of the edge of the cliff. Cause we're going crazy.

83
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,840
Cause of this, this meeting games, um, a misery loves companies sort of one-on-one.

84
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:34,110
Anyway, I want to follow up and it's not just mocking you that I love.

85
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,270
It's in finding new ways and new venues to mock you, which really

86
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,830
delights me and keeps me going strong in this world of code.

87
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:44,510
Right. I do try to give you something new to work with.

88
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,350
Yeah. Yeah. And the new avenue this week, it says things that could only

89
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,670
happen in the boredom that comes with, uh, what do I do when I'm trying

90
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,110
to keep myself away from my computer, but I'm still near my phone with COVID.

91
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,550
I want to keep myself young at heart, despite the fact that I'm

92
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,470
chronologically older than you, I do try to remain younger.

93
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,750
There's this thing you may have heard of it's called Instagram.

94
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,770
And I started an Instagram account for the AB testing podcast.

95
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,690
And your picture of your finger will be there in about an hour.

96
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,250
Why does it take an hour?

97
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,330
Because I'm, I'm talking to you. I'm busy for a little while.

98
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,370
I haven't posted it yet. I just took the picture by the time you hear this.

99
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,570
You, you will understand what the picture is for. Gotcha.

100
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,130
Right. Right. The picture will go out ahead of people hearing this.

101
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,250
It's kind of like time travel, but it's really just because it takes me

102
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,250
some time to make me sound better.

103
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,730
And you sound worse before I released the podcast to the public.

104
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,170
I understand.

105
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,370
But if I remember, right, if I remember, right, if I remember, remember,

106
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,870
I, if I will put our Instagram link in the show notes for the

107
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:06,930
podcast release when it goes out on Monday.

108
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,540
So today's the 15th Monday's the, that would make Monday the 18th.

109
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,070
Yes. Math. So on Tuesday, the 19th, moving through my calendar,

110
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:25,150
I am kicking off the spring 2020 online test conference,

111
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,110
free virtual conference, three days.

112
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,230
I'm going to be there talking about, Oh God, here he goes again.

113
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:42,300
Modern testing. So what I'm finding is I do not like giving the same talk twice.

114
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,300
And when I gave a talk at the test bash conference, which was,

115
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,520
I don't know if you got to see any of that, but what a fantastic idea.

116
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,880
They did a 24 hour marathon conference.

117
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,160
Some people tried to stay up for all of it and watched it all live.

118
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,560
They did. I cannot believe how well put together they were.

119
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,820
It was really cool. But Tristan, who's awesome,

120
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,580
who introduced me was very keen to keep repeating a brand new talk.

121
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,260
And it was a brand new talk. Some repeated concepts, brand new talk.

122
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,980
I am off on a tangent, but the point is is modern testing is getting less and

123
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,180
less modern. Yes. When I first talked about it a couple of years ago,

124
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,740
I was afraid that people were going to throw shit at me.

125
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:32,700
And it turned out that they didn't. Some people thought I was weird.

126
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,660
Some people said, yeah, we're already doing this. This is really cool.

127
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,340
And it's kind of taken on a little bit of a life of its own, especially over,

128
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,140
I mean, more and more and more and more.

129
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,380
And so I'm not going to explain what it is and why it works,

130
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,100
maybe for three minutes,

131
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:53,570
but I just want to tell a lot of stories from what it's meant to

132
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,060
me over the last, oh God, well,

133
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,620
three years at Unity for sure.

134
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,940
Some things I've heard from the three on how they're doing it,

135
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,780
what Lisa Crispin is doing with it right now.

136
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,980
Do you know Lisa and Janet are going to be giving a talk on modern testing?

137
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,980
No. Awesome. So Lisa, Lisa, ping me about that.

138
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,260
I don't have the details in front of me and maybe it's not announced.

139
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,980
So maybe I shouldn't say that, but I will,

140
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,900
but we'll definitely promote the heck out of that. I'm excited about that.

141
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,740
There's all kinds of cool stuff going on.

142
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:28,340
And so by the time you hear this on Monday,

143
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,060
hopefully you listen to this the day it comes out because then you can set your

144
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,820
alarm clock to for Tuesday,

145
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,940
which is one day after Monday and Brent will never get a chance to talk.

146
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,780
Cause I am full of saying stupid stuff. Anyway, Tuesday,

147
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:46,740
online test conference, yada, yada, yada. Uh,

148
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,580
that's it. So Instagram, that's it for my notes.

149
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,620
So Lisa, Janet, are they doing that? It was part of what you see.

150
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,850
Do you remember the, uh,

151
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,050
the post they did on their take on the modern testing principles on their blog?

152
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,400
They're doing a talk based on that. She didn't say which conference.

153
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,000
They just said they're doing a talk based on that blog post. And they,

154
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,680
she was asking for, uh,

155
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,920
the short version of the principles that they could use those.

156
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,840
Yeah. Which version of the short version?

157
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,560
I think I used your, I think we're aligned on the short ones.

158
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,720
I think we're darn close.

159
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,680
So business first bottlenecks out, always learn and improve lead,

160
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,080
equality culture, customer is King data, trumps, intuition. Everyone can test.

161
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,330
I think my last one is different.

162
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,640
That's all right. Yeah, it's all right.

163
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,040
It's the gist and we're not trying to be prescriptive with these.

164
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,920
We're just like, here's what we see.

165
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,160
And to be fully clear for our own egos,

166
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,880
this stuff that we're calling modern testing that is happening,

167
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,320
it was going to happen anyway.

168
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,500
Brit and I could not,

169
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,300
it would not exist on the planet and the same things would be happening.

170
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:58,980
We are two people.

171
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,300
We are historians documenting the path of this thing across

172
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,910
across the industry. So that's it.

173
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,700
Yeah. I, I'm looking at that,

174
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,580
looking at my penultimate or my ultimate, uh,

175
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,510
my last blog post that was almost a year ago.

176
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,470
And that's the one where I talk about the,

177
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,750
where I do my final post on the, the modern testing principles.

178
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,180
So my last one, the way I pivoted it, you said anyone can test.

179
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,860
Yeah. But I pivoted is embrace the fear.

180
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,060
Oh yeah. Yeah. That's a little, that's true. A little bit more abstract.

181
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,420
Yeah. I see it. Either one.

182
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,910
Did you see, uh, Abby, uh, tagged us this morning in a, in a post.

183
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,980
Did you happen to see this?

184
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,060
Uh, Abby bangs or was looking at a preview of a book on service,

185
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,340
service level objectives,

186
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:00,540
which is I'm looking forward to taking a look at it because it's something that,

187
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:05,580
uh, we are prob I'm guessing I will be asked to put together in the near

188
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,020
feature. So help is always appreciated.

189
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:14,020
But there's a quote from the book says QA, this is your last stop.

190
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,500
This is the one group that will be most concerned about what these changes

191
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,860
mean for them. And I don't have the context of that,

192
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,380
but she says that it implies testing hasn't evolved past the defensive stance of

193
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:28,300
you can't automate my job away and we'll fight innovation.

194
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,060
Wish I could properly disagree. And which is the stance that we take as well.

195
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:36,660
It's a, one of the things I acknowledged in my,

196
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:40,060
I bring up often is that we do live in a bubble as much as we see this

197
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,220
happening, as much as it's common sense to what we're doing,

198
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,180
there's a large part of the overall software industry that live in this world

199
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,540
where test last testing quality in testers is purely

200
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,820
an information provider.

201
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,740
Testing is something you do if you're not good enough to do the other work in

202
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,810
some cases exists a lot. And,

203
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,370
and you and I have both seen numerous examples of people digging in their

204
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,310
heels and say, no, this is dumb. My job,

205
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,810
isn't going away. I'll always be necessary.

206
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,090
I saw yet another Twitter feed last week that we explored together.

207
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:22,850
I think it was last week. Oh look, so-and-so company had a quality problem.

208
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,560
Their testers must be bad. It's like, that is the weirdest,

209
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,560
it's such a ridiculous non sequitur for me to say that.

210
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,800
I'm enjoying your snarky comments every now and again on Twitter.

211
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,560
I've been trying to keep the snark.

212
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,560
One I don't tweet as much anymore because I just don't feel like it.

213
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,600
But when I do, I kind of tweet like three snarks against software for every one

214
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,380
snark against Trump. That way people, you know, I don't want to be too political,

215
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,660
but sometimes he's just so stupid. I have to point it out.

216
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,260
We have no choice this year on that one, but no, what the,

217
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,140
the thing I've been finding amusing is your sort of

218
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,740
backhanded queries around, holy crap,

219
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,700
did I just go into a time machine? Is it suddenly 1992?

220
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,420
Yeah, I might've said something like that. Right. But that was to be fair,

221
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,540
to be fair. I had not had my daily cap full of bleach by then.

222
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,700
So I wasn't quite my full self. Yeah. Going back to Abby's comments,

223
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,340
right? I have seen over and over and over again,

224
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,920
people digging in their heels. However,

225
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,640
when the bulldozer of modern change

226
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,220
starts heading in their direction,

227
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:53,280
I have not observed a single person who

228
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,740
has successfully stopped it. Right.

229
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:01,100
So the people who are digging in their heels, in my humble opinion,

230
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,100
they're operating from a purely theoretical standpoint at this point in time.

231
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,960
No, no, absolutely not.

232
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,700
They're protecting the craft. Yeah. Hashtag sarcasm.

233
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,820
Hashtag baloney. All right. Uh,

234
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,780
was there anything else I wanted to talk about? Maybe one other,

235
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,290
do I want to get in the mail bag?

236
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,490
Do you want me to talk about one other thing and get your take on it?

237
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,900
I have a random topic that wasn't on our list. So I can't remember.

238
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,480
I'm pretty sure in our retrospective,

239
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:48,190
wait, do we do retrospectives before David Bishop or after before my brain is

240
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:52,110
completely food bar. And by the way,

241
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,430
by the way I've got his book.

242
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,010
I haven't gotten to the meaty stuff.

243
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:03,010
I really want to understand how he measures what we call it vorticity,

244
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,370
agile vorticity. Yeah.

245
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:11,450
But it is, it is deeply research driven,

246
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,330
which is great. Unlike say Nicole's book,

247
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,530
which we also know is deeply research driven.

248
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,940
His reads a bit like a doctoral thesis,

249
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:33,220
which is a choice. I'm not placing judgment either way.

250
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,020
Uh, but I haven't,

251
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,360
haven't gotten to the interesting bits yet.

252
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,580
All right. Well, keep us posted as you go along.

253
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,860
I will do. I'm sure that's critical.

254
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:55,470
So once, once I get to the section, if I'm able to, um,

255
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,790
with, with my background in agile as it stands,

256
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,830
if I'm able to sort of translate it to our, our listeners, I'll do so.

257
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,570
Excellent. Excellent.

258
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,130
I read the coaching habit this weekend. I read, I finished upstream,

259
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,210
which is a book by chip and Dan Heath about very little about software,

260
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,610
but about putting preventative techniques in early, the,

261
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,850
the general upstream thing. Very good book. I like all their books.

262
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,670
They did made the stick power of moments. So it was called anyway,

263
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,190
I've read all their books. They're all very good. Lots of research in there,

264
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,710
but they read pretty easy. Then I read the coaching habit this weekend,

265
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,830
which I highly recommend for people interested in not just the test,

266
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,230
coach or the test consultant.

267
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,630
Cause I think more and more as I hear as I study like that book,

268
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,470
uh, there is a difference.

269
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,500
There is asking questions and growing people,

270
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,060
trying to change your behavior and then giving people advice and pointers and

271
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,340
tools. And those are coaching versus consulting respectively.

272
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,180
So highly recommend that. And then I'm sure in the retrospective episode,

273
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:01,180
we talked about the concept of psychological safety, right? Didn't me? Yes.

274
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,140
It's like this blameless culture.

275
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,880
And I wanted to share one thing I do in my job, which is, uh,

276
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,920
and I should probably tell a story about this at online test conference is there's

277
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,200
this little teeny part of my job where a half hour, twice a week,

278
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,040
once for America's once for Europe,

279
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,440
I run this thing called the product engineering sink.

280
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,440
And all it is is anyone time across our organization,

281
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,760
we have about 60 to 70 different customer impacting projects in flight.

282
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,760
Things we think are worth tracking at a global level.

283
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:44,210
What I do in this sink is certainly don't go through all 70 lines and talk about

284
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,450
what's going on here. What's your status?

285
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,810
That's uh, because that would be super boring and super ineffectual.

286
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,080
What people do throughout the week is they add projects,

287
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,320
they mark projects as either complete, they're done.

288
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,280
New projects go into planning and then there's a status where projects could be

289
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,120
green, yellow or red. Green means everything's good on track.

290
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,520
We are on track for the target date.

291
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,640
Yellow means we are on track for the target date,

292
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,000
but there is some risk that's worth talking about. We want to share this.

293
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,120
And red means, Hey, some stuff came up. The date's going to need to change.

294
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,210
Before I used to use Google sheets and I used to go through all the history.

295
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,030
It would take me another half hour before each meeting to gather all the

296
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:29,670
things I want to talk about by looking at change history.

297
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,790
We recently changed over to air table, which is, this is going to sound harsh.

298
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,430
It's a relational database, but it's kind of like an online version of access.

299
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,830
Okay. For better or for worse. Uh, and it,

300
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,190
but it actually makes it a lot easier for me just to create queries that show

301
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,900
all the things I want to talk about. But,

302
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,020
and we have this meeting takes a half hour and we're unable to go through all

303
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,860
of the delays and we encourage a no blame culture. We really,

304
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,860
this meeting is more about reemphasizing our culture of psychological

305
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,140
safety and it's okay to be late. We do.

306
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,130
If we talked about our P 50 estimates before we have a rule in our org where only

307
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,770
engineers can give dates.

308
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,220
And so people have freaked out when I said this at the test bash,

309
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,060
test bash home and only engineers can give dates. And so,

310
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,340
but they're, and we require them to give a P 50 date,

311
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,100
the date they believe has a 50% probability of being hit.

312
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,180
And we're pretty accurate on that.

313
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,900
Half of our projects finish on time or early half finish late.

314
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,980
The things that finished late probably finished some of the fish little later

315
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,060
than I want, but that's a different, different challenge.

316
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,920
But the interesting thing is we've started to get a lot of people visiting this

317
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,880
meeting from across the company because they're trying to figure out how they

318
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,040
want to run engineering in their orgs.

319
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,820
And the challenge I have is this is where I want to throw something out to you

320
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,740
is I think the reason this meeting works the way it does and the reason it's

321
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,940
effective is cause we already have a culture where it's okay to make mistakes

322
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,940
and it's okay to be wrong.

323
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,640
I think we don't embrace failure as much as we should,

324
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:23,100
but people are happy to be transparent.

325
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,540
They know it's okay to be transparent.

326
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,460
They know it's okay to miss something and to report risk.

327
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,620
They're very comfortable doing it. Uh, every week,

328
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,580
there's probably of those 70 projects,

329
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,690
there's 30 to 40 needs to talk about, you know,

330
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,410
20 for each for America and Europe.

331
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:43,510
And what I see is a lot more people marking things yellow because they want to

332
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,470
talk about the risk and share what's going on, which I think is fantastic.

333
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,950
My worry is, is why I'm not prescriptive about like, oh,

334
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,510
here's the thing every company should do because while I said,

335
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,110
and I'm on a long diatribe here, I should have written my notes out while it

336
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,240
does become a place for us to emphasize our culture.

337
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,790
I don't know how you start this meeting if you don't have that culture already.

338
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,750
Have you had any,

339
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,750
so my question for you finally is what do you think?

340
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,190
Do you think you can use this meeting to drive culture or do you think you

341
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,350
need the culture first in order for a meeting like this to work?

342
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,710
You can do it either way. All right. Next question. All right. Yeah.

343
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,230
Would you like to expand before we go on to our, our mailbag?

344
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:33,590
Well, I get to pull out the mailbag sound effect this time. The, so hurry.

345
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:39,210
But it depends on your leader, on your, your leadership there, right?

346
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,730
If you, if you don't have the, this culture already in place,

347
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:49,560
then what you end up having is everyone going,

348
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:54,710
Oh, Oh, we have to tell the leader that we're green, even though we're not.

349
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,680
And I've seen over and over and over and over and over again,

350
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:05,670
that when the leaders step up and they over,

351
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,880
they go over the top,

352
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,080
when someone has the cajunas to come in and say,

353
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:22,640
we are red and instead of pointing the finger and going,

354
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,210
taking an approach of, well, that's why I hired you. It's your job,

355
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,490
not mine. Figure out how to get on red.

356
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:38,100
The, they instead go over the top and they show appreciation for being brave

357
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,140
enough to tell them the truth.

358
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Yeah. And they do so explicitly reinforced the behavior you want to see.

359
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,360
So that's something that I know my boss did before I got there,

360
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,800
but like this week, for example, we had something off the rails.

361
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,880
It was just a mess. And they're explaining, I said,

362
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,640
and the answer was thanks for bringing that up. Sounds like a pretty big deal.

363
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,760
Here's the worst criticism we get in there.

364
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,330
Let's get the team together and do a retro on that one. That's it. That,

365
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,050
that's the worst punishment you can have for, for being delayed.

366
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,420
Having to add to your schedule,

367
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,220
something that should already be on your schedule.

368
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,420
Yeah. Okay.

369
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,220
This sarcasm aside. Yeah. It's like, yeah. And it's, there's no argument.

370
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:28,580
It's like, yeah, let's, because like production incidents, uh,

371
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,620
errors in planning are things they're prime opportunities to learn.

372
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:38,890
You know, my big thing is I just had a copy. I moved it so I could have a place

373
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,700
for my coffee, but I've been rereading the fifth discipline by Peter Sengay.

374
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,160
Did you ever read that? Brits turning around, looking at,

375
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,080
he has a virtual background, so I can't tell what he's looking at.

376
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,280
Now he's disappeared. He's wearing fricking pajama pants, everyone.

377
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,570
Like a true, like a true work from home warrior.

378
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,440
So yeah, I, the exact book I have, yeah, I have,

379
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,440
I don't have the hard to cover. I have the paperback.

380
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,640
Really? I would have thought you would have had the Kindle one.

381
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,520
Yeah. It's one of the books I bought before cause that book is old now.

382
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,560
I bought it before Kindles. Oh really? Yep.

383
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,670
It emphasizes a lot about the fifth discipline or about the learning

384
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,750
organization and building a learning organization. If I recall correctly,

385
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:33,470
it's one of the first places I read about the five wise 1990 told you it was

386
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,920
old. Wow. Still very irrelevant.

387
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,320
I did not realize how old this is. I mean, it's interesting.

388
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,160
I spent a lot of time thinking through right,

389
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,800
how generations progress, right? The, the,

390
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:58,540
in how knowledge progresses. I find it fascinating.

391
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,360
Right. There's that concept that if you don't learn from history,

392
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,720
you're doomed to repeat it. I'd absolutely think that that's true.

393
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,920
But I do see things like, like the fifth discipline

394
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:18,190
being somewhat timeless. And I don't know,

395
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,070
should that be worrisome? Shouldn't, shouldn't learning organization,

396
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,960
got 30 years after this book. I mean,

397
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,020
interestingly enough, the book is,

398
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:38,580
is greater than 50% of both of our ages.

399
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,240
I didn't even, I was still in college when this thing came out.

400
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:45,250
And we,

401
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,130
we are talking about the dominance of learning organizations and the

402
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:54,730
criticality of it now. And I, I am, yeah,

403
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,570
I don't know. I mean, why isn't this second nature,

404
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:02,050
particularly in, in our industry that pogles me. I find that fascinating.

405
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:08,210
Because power trips and command and control still in many places

406
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,370
rule. Yeah. But we've said over and over again, uh,

407
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,990
right. This is knowledge work. Uh, in, in, in our industry,

408
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:24,450
it is knowledge work and, and knowledge work and

409
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,930
learning, uh, go hand to hand in,

410
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:33,390
in why it is still so much of a struggle. Uh,

411
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,190
yeah, you may be right. It may also be not invented here syndrome dominant,

412
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,510
right? The things that we've, we've heard over and over again,

413
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,310
the deadly combination of command and control and

414
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:50,590
experience as a title, I call it. Uh, and that's,

415
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,050
I've been here for 20,000 years. So I know.

416
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,720
Yeah. Yeah. It's, uh, I didn't mean, I, it sounds like,

417
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,720
I feel like I kind of, uh,

418
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,920
blew your mind a little bit by reminding you how old that book was. Yeah.

419
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,760
I mean, there's a couple.

420
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,080
So between that and making funny your finger, I've had a pretty good Friday.

421
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,720
I'm glad to, I'm glad to help. Uh, again,

422
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,360
it's just another Tuesday to me. There is,

423
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,200
there's a couple of books that I look at and I go,

424
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,720
this is timeless and will remain timeless forever.

425
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:31,510
That is because the concepts are so abstract.

426
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:31,750
It's,

427
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:35,390
it's really difficult to sort of make it part of muscle memory.

428
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,950
And those would be things like, um, Christopher Alexander, uh,

429
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,870
the timeless way of building that bad boy is going to be relevant

430
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,810
forever. Um, I forget the author, but systematics,

431
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:54,170
anything heavy to do with systems thinking systems thinking just does not come

432
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:58,440
naturally being a learning organization. Yeah. I don't know.

433
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,680
Yeah. Yeah. Should we whip through a couple of mailbag questions? And, uh,

434
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,280
I need the dust off is a lot of dust piled up on the mailbag sound effect.

435
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
Okay, go for it. So I'm going to need to polish it a little,

436
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,160
but I'll plug it in later. It sounds like this.

437
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,040
I don't recall it sounding quite like that. Yeah. Yeah. Cause that's because of the

438
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:27,240
dust. Gotcha. But our listeners will hear a better version.

439
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,840
All right. So what's the mailbag question? This first one,

440
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,240
first one comes from little Johnny in Madison,

441
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,520
Wisconsin. And he wants to make a request.

442
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,880
This one goes out to his little sister who's no, uh,

443
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,040
this is from already and it says more for Brent, I guess,

444
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,360
but I'm going to jump in on this one as well. Okay.

445
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:53,960
How does CD continuous delivery look like in machine learning?

446
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:58,210
What are the fundamental differences with traditional CD?

447
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,070
What traditional CD has CD been around long enough to

448
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:08,310
have 10 years. Okay. So what's traditional CD?

449
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,120
I think what's the difference if any

450
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:18,680
between CD in a machine learning world versus CD and like a

451
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
web service world?

452
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,070
Um, I would say from my experience,

453
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:28,390
the most critical difference is CD is required for

454
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:34,070
ML. So the issue with ML is it's rarely the case.

455
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,760
So here's an ML architecture in a nutshell. Okay.

456
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,720
Usually there is a thing called a model, a model.

457
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,920
You can think of it as a function that takes certain inputs and outputs,

458
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,920
a prediction or a classification or whatever. It's a pure,

459
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,360
in the old world, we would have called it, um,

460
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,760
belonging to the business logic layer. Okay.

461
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:06,880
But then you need a host. You need something that say a rest API

462
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:11,680
or something that you can receive a call from the outside world,

463
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,560
and then pass it to your model and return it back. Now,

464
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,240
unless your model is self

465
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,880
learning, meaning you can deploy it once and, uh,

466
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,720
you've got the great feedback loop in,

467
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,480
and it is constantly adjusting here.

468
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,880
You could think of, you could think of say search engines, uh,

469
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,880
kind of work this way, uh,

470
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,560
where they get instant feedback from the customer, uh,

471
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,120
a click through is considered positive.

472
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,440
There's multiple things that are considered negative. And then that can be,

473
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:57,840
that can inform the models, um,

474
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:03,610
instant next round of behavior, even for that same query.

475
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,490
I haven't done it in a while, uh, but when I last work in Bing,

476
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:12,490
you could take a search term and hit refresh sort of

477
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,970
10 times in a row.

478
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,050
And at least three of those times would have been an entirely different

479
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:22,570
experience. And that's entirely because it's constantly refreshing.

480
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:26,470
The models that, that, for example,

481
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:29,110
I'm owning right now today, uh,

482
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,110
have to be rebuilt, uh,

483
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,510
frequently because we have new,

484
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:40,640
we have new data that would affect the

485
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,040
performance of those models. Um,

486
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,520
an example of the model that I'm working through right now is,

487
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,010
is, um, taking, uh,

488
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,050
verbatim from customers and trying to guide them to a place where they can,

489
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,880
uh, succeed in finding solutions to problems. Um,

490
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:09,490
it's not a search engine. It's more directed than that. However,

491
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,810
when, when the,

492
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:16,040
the say Azure has a major outage or a team releases a new product,

493
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,200
uh,

494
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,200
there isn't enough of that customer verbatim for the model to,

495
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,960
to confidently direct the customer towards a new solution.

496
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,120
And the solution to that is of course you rebuild the model on a continuous

497
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:39,840
basis so that it relearns the current patterns that customers care about.

498
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:46,370
Uh, the, the benefit of this is it automatically relearns the,

499
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,370
often what I will describe it and think of, um,

500
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,410
think of any business logic that you may have ever occurred or

501
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,970
encountered from dev.

502
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:59,610
That is just the world's most complicated rules engine.

503
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,760
They'll call it that it's really just a, you know,

504
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,800
50 times nested crappy if statement,

505
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,360
if that was critical decision making process to your business,

506
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,640
you would need to do CICD because a lot of that complexity would,

507
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,240
would time out quickly. It's no different than,

508
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,600
than with, with ML,

509
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,630
except ML is much more efficient at automatically rewriting that,

510
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:33,520
that deep nested if statement. Alan,

511
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,680
time to wake up. I'm done talking. No, no, no, no. Cause I want to, again,

512
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,400
I love that we have different,

513
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,320
it's not really different opinion and perspective,

514
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,440
but I can give a different example, more context, different context. I dunno,

515
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,760
it's like retrospectives we had, we largely agree,

516
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,040
but there's some different approaches we have. Uh,

517
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,150
this isn't an approach difference, but I can talk about recently,

518
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,550
this is going to be a larger story around culture as well. Uh,

519
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,310
but recently our machine,

520
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:07,910
someone in our machine learning team approached to me,

521
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,950
I run our DevOps team and they said, actually pause that first thing is,

522
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,350
the answer is they both should have a,

523
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,380
the pipeline is going to be different, the CD pipeline,

524
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:25,500
but because there's different tools involved in deploying models. Okay.

525
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,580
That's the short answer.

526
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,140
So recently someone from our machine learning team came to me and said, Hey,

527
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:33,660
we need to have CD, uh,

528
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,580
for our ML stuff.

529
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,580
Can you please build that for us and,

530
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,960
and own that. And just like with, but my,

531
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,640
my DevOps team, just like a QA team, it's like, we don't,

532
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,100
we don't like owning stuff. There's not enough of us.

533
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,740
We'd be a bottleneck then and Brent, our bottlenecks good or bad.

534
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,410
They're great. Yeah. Liar. Bottlenecks are bad.

535
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,290
You really get security for your position. And if you play,

536
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,490
bottlenecks are bad, play it right.

537
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,130
You can totally triple your promotion velocity.

538
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,810
They're fantastic. Oh, so anyway, what's fun is actually,

539
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,210
we're actually are working with them and, uh,

540
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,490
on building their own pipeline,

541
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:24,810
their own deployments, their own stuff in a way that

542
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,760
with abstraction and documentation and resiliency that they can maintain it

543
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,520
themselves. Uh, so, which is the right thing to do, of course,

544
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,480
but just some context around that. It's, they've seen it as essential.

545
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,600
We think it's essential. We're going to invest time in it. Uh,

546
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,200
it's kind of fun to see how we'll use,

547
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,800
we use Jenkins for our CD, uh,

548
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,320
but it'll be fun to see how they end up using it for, for their stuff.

549
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,840
I'm pretty excited about that. It's going to be a cool project.

550
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,520
And I will let you, if we find out really cool things in the interim,

551
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,720
I'll let you know, but yeah, not a lot of difference,

552
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,840
but probably worth bringing up. I think cause well, one,

553
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,980
they don't have it now. So they survived without it, but it was painful. In fact,

554
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:12,020
the fact that they don't have CD right now is a bottleneck for that team.

555
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,550
Yeah. It slows them down.

556
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:18,830
Can become very quickly a bottleneck, um,

557
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,750
from right now for me, uh, it slows me down as well.

558
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:28,310
Uh, there's, there's one of my projects where I am,

559
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,570
one of my projects where we have the model going and there's a bit of a,

560
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,650
of a manual deployment. Uh, so we have it all the way,

561
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,890
automated up to staging and testing,

562
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,640
but we need to make sure we don't deploy at craft models. So we don't,

563
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,000
we don't have it automated. The final push. Totally fine. Oh yeah.

564
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,350
Um, but the, the space that we're in,

565
00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:02,350
so we do manually push every week, uh, but the space that we're in,

566
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,740
uh, that model or the,

567
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,010
the customer experience would absolutely benefit, uh,

568
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:14,530
if we could do just out of deploying new models daily,

569
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:20,250
we've, we've gotten actually that's the one small bit of code I've been able to

570
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,980
write over the last month. Uh,

571
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,980
I took our build process for building these models.

572
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,600
It was something that would take literally a week to do.

573
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,160
That was main reason why we needed to,

574
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,680
to do that a weekly basis,

575
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:41,800
but now I've got it down to nine and a half hours and still have evil plans to,

576
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,320
to, to do it more and more better anyway.

577
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,660
Cool. Let's do the other question. Sure. Uh,

578
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,740
just cause we have a few minutes here and I want to get to this one's from Patrick

579
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,340
H. Uh, Hey Patrick, thanks for listening to the podcast. The question is,

580
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,230
does the observer effect play any part in instrumentation and telemetry in

581
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:06,350
software systems? For example,

582
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:09,070
the telemetry services slow down my system.

583
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,390
So I turn them off or try to compensate by adjusting some settings,

584
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,110
changing those settings may falsely contribute to some metric on the business

585
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,950
side and affect decision-making. So if I may,

586
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,400
summarize that already short question, it's,

587
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,280
what's the impact of telemetry on stuff being measured?

588
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,000
And you and I both have worked with us a pretty complex systems around this,

589
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,920
but I'm gonna let you start and I'll just add flavor. Um, yeah.

590
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,760
So I think even, even in modern systems,

591
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,880
it can be problematic. The,

592
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:48,120
how ever brute force is so much easier now.

593
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,300
Right. Uh, in, in the cloud, right?

594
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,300
We can set up a separate networking path,

595
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,460
uh, just for the, the, the telemetry, uh,

596
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,480
in terms of CPU, um,

597
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:11,560
if I think it's been a long time since I've observed that the CPU is,

598
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:16,640
is, is really being taken up a great deal by the telemetry system.

599
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,440
Um, there are obvious solutions around it. Uh,

600
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:28,480
I don't see any of those commonly deployed nowadays in my life.

601
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,170
Like it used to be a way where, right? You could,

602
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:37,850
you could set up a config file or your instrumentation systems and be able to

603
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:42,290
turn off or on and, uh, the, the depth level.

604
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:46,280
So you would have a specific, uh,

605
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,760
constant strain that was very lightweight.

606
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,840
And then you would have a monitor hooked up to it that would fire and automatically

607
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,620
turn on the, the, the really deep traces. Um,

608
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,270
I don't, I don't see that as a big issue.

609
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:07,630
Uh, now, nowadays,

610
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,910
I'm not going to add to that because one, I think you covered it all.

611
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,830
And two, I was only half paying attention because of work going on.

612
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,120
We're such a professional podcast.

613
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,120
Uh, and yeah, so poor little, you said Patrick H, right?

614
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,040
He's probably, uh, yeah.

615
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,880
It probably doesn't feel as important. We do appreciate the question.

616
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,640
And Brent asked, Brent and I have worked with the similar systems, uh,

617
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:40,280
and I will recap what he said based on the fact that I think we think the same

618
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,880
on this is that the overhead of those,

619
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,080
of that collection done correctly in a way where you just,

620
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:51,160
you're just collecting bits and saving them on a non on the non-main thread.

621
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,800
Uh, and then, and then uploading on uploading at opportune times is very,

622
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:02,120
very little overhead. And maybe one thing to add, if you didn't say it,

623
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,560
or to underscore, if you did say it is the one thing we used a lot,

624
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,000
I remember a lot on when I was working on Xbox one was our ability to turn

625
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,160
stuff on remotely. So we had a lot of stuff that turned the collection on

626
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,680
remotely. So all the little ones and zeros, like here's a bit,

627
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,960
this thing happened. We said a bit somewhere. We may not collect that,

628
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,920
but again, the, with a modern CPU, well,

629
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,840
we actually knew exactly which CPU was in there and how much overhead it would

630
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,200
have. And it was negligible at best.

631
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,560
But if we had something interesting, like, Hey, you know what?

632
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,440
Only the people on this version that updated directly to this version,

633
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,200
we think are having this problem. Let's go turn on extra metrics for

634
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,560
that exact demographic. We could do that. And that was fun to do.

635
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,120
And it really helped us. That's what I learned how to debug through telemetry,

636
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,880
which was kind of fun. So, uh,

637
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,400
you can actually collect a lot and not upload all of it,

638
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,680
but be able to turn those things on. And that is,

639
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,800
I think that's the key to being successful.

640
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,080
I talk with a lot of teams on collecting metrics. They go, well,

641
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,120
we don't want to log too much. So he's only going to log very,

642
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:13,240
very specific things. I say, yeah, I see why you think that way,

643
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,760
but let's talk.

644
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,890
I mean, you do and you probably want to,

645
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:25,600
you want to log all the things that you, I don't know,

646
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:28,950
the nice to have. But like,

647
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,990
if you take what you need to log and separate it into some of the P zero P one

648
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,790
and P two, right?

649
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:39,790
You probably want to want to do up to the P ones because that's going to be

650
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:43,030
the stuff that you, you go, damn,

651
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,300
we could totally answer the customer's question if we had actually logged this.

652
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:50,640
Right. Right. The, the P two,

653
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:57,560
there is an idea of going overboard, right? Uh, in terms of what you log,

654
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,720
uh, it, I think that's a happy medium, right? Do you like,

655
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,240
remember the old days when we would find a regression,

656
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,280
find a customer would find some bug and we go write a test to make sure we,

657
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,360
that bug would never get out there again. But these days, more often,

658
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,480
it's what monitoring,

659
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,640
what could we have collected that would help us debug this faster?

660
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,280
And we'll go add that and add,

661
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,440
start adding a few dozens or hundreds of those things over time.

662
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,720
And you begin to build up that ability to debug these things remotely.

663
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Yeah. The, in terms of like the,

664
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,640
the operational cost of a telemetry system,

665
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:38,910
I don't think that is anywhere close to,

666
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,400
uh, the storage costs.

667
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,120
Even with storage dropping, right?

668
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,840
There's a reason why a big part of the world is in,

669
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:53,320
nowadays are, are described, um,

670
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,800
in big data terms, right? Uh, the, uh,

671
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,640
it's because we are storing a lot of stuff,

672
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,770
like I, and, uh,

673
00:48:08,850 --> 00:48:12,970
certainly trending stuff. Uh, for example, one of the feeds I own,

674
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,120
one of the most common complaints I get from my consumers is what do you mean?

675
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,820
You don't have five years of data. I'm like, yeah,

676
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:30,140
I only, I only keep a year. Sorry, but it's an ROI thing, right?

677
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:34,260
It's it for sure. For sure. For sure. If, uh,

678
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,060
I get an ask for going beyond a year

679
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,540
once every year, my team,

680
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:47,250
if we needed it, we would use it.

681
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,760
We would have already implemented it right at the way I operate that particular

682
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,760
data feed is, Hey, uh,

683
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:59,720
this is primarily for my team's purpose. Um,

684
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,430
but because carrying is sharing, everyone's welcome to use it.

685
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,380
Uh, that gets me in trouble every now and again. Uh,

686
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,700
I had an issue just a couple of weeks ago where some team had

687
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,860
super BP visibility.

688
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,720
Uh, I found out a month after they began that they had taken a

689
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,960
dependency on this feed. Uh, and we're,

690
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:32,680
we're, we're trying to use it in a way, uh,

691
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:36,880
to answer questions in near real time. This feed cannot answer.

692
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:41,730
And, and then after they had solidified after a month,

693
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:45,330
they were doing the full court press, you know, uh,

694
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,570
we're going to tell the VP on you type of BS.

695
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,320
And I'm like, knock yourself out.

696
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:57,120
I'm happy to go and explain to the executive how you wasted a

697
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,760
month of your effort that you could have resolved by just asking me a goddamn

698
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:07,890
question in the beginning. Yeah. Let's go have that conversation. Anyway.

699
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,640
Anyway, Patrick H, I hope we did a good job answering your question.

700
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,000
Uh, let us know if we didn't, you can ask more questions. Uh,

701
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,680
you can go to the one, one of the three dot slack.com.

702
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,920
There's an invitation link.

703
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,920
If you're not a member of the community on the website.

704
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:30,740
And I think that better be it for us today. What do you think?

705
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,900
Yes. Brent says two thumbs up. I'm translating for him. Okay.

706
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:39,380
Thank you again. Uh, happy May. I'm Alan. I'm great. Just as always.

707
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:39,940
See you later.
