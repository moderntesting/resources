00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,740
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,180
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, Agile, and anything else

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:30,300
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Oh, hey, welcome to party night at AB Testing Podcast.

4
00:00:32,300 --> 00:01:02,740
After a long time, listeners will know when I first met Brent,

5
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,580
I would always change his name just to confuse people. But anyway, that's a different story.

6
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,060
And to annoy me. You can hear more about that on episode, I don't know.

7
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,880
Anyway, back to my question. What do you been up to? What's new? What's exciting?

8
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,720
Well, what's exciting for me is it's that most magical time of the year.

9
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,760
We had this conversation last time. Are you still doing reviews?

10
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,110
Well, yeah, now we're in rewards. Ooh. Right.

11
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,750
We're doing the same thing. Yeah.

12
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:49,870
It's a little less stressful here. You know, it was. Here's the thing that was interesting.

13
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:56,340
It was non-trivially stressful about a month ago when we were starting the process.

14
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:04,340
Because I've had people who have, well, I'll just put it this way. There are people who have been at

15
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:09,620
Microsoft for half of a millisecond coming and going, oh, it's review time. So am I getting

16
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:18,990
promoted? And I have having to go through in those discussions and given the right message

17
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:28,030
without doing it. But all of that kind of tapered down once news has gone out that

18
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,230
meta is doing a hiring freeze, potential layoffs. They're like, oh.

19
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,230
Maybe I should be happy to have a job. Right.

20
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,700
I'm holding my comments. Which is a new thing for me.

21
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:56,350
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. So the most recent life adventure for me is going through yet again

22
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:02,350
emptiness syndrome with my oldest in an unexpected way. So listeners of this,

23
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,790
I've known he's been out to college. He's actually graduated college.

24
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:18,800
But last week, he moved to Indianapolis and it's so his roommates.

25
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,320
His roommates, which are really tight. And to me, this part makes sense that for him,

26
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:34,110
this he doesn't really have his next stage of life is to get into a PhD program.

27
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,750
He didn't make it this last time around, even though he went through a bunch of interviews

28
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:45,970
and he's going to he's going to get a job there, get experience in his in his discipline.

29
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,610
He can do that anywhere. And then staying with his roommates was a really high priority.

30
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:59,390
And one of his roommates did get into a PhD program at the University of something near

31
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:05,520
Indianapolis. I don't actually know what universities are. But going back to me.

32
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,960
Yeah. What about you? Right. The fact. So I when he left, it was disturbing. And

33
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,640
my son is one of is one of my favorite people on the planet.

34
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:27,490
The end, even though he lived out in Spokane, which for those who aren't listening, it's about

35
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:31,490
depending on how fast you drive is between four to six hours.

36
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:39,890
I was born in Spokane. I did not know that. The the fact that I can't.

37
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,080
I he's now not longer even within driving distance had had some emotional impact.

38
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,280
Now, I'm of course concerned with him as listeners. The podcast are where

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:06,980
my son is gay and in Indianapolis does not have a reputation of supporting that. So we'll.

40
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,700
Well, I think Indiana in general, generally the larger cities are a little bit more

41
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,270
accepting. Well, that's what I'm going to hope for. That's what I'm going to hope for.

42
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,780
So those are the two biggest exciting things in my life.

43
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,460
Clement, one thing I want to touch on before I go over how important I am.

44
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,980
I'm not is same time you're here, but I want to go back to your comment about,

45
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,540
hey, do I get a promotion now?

46
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:43,250
One thing I do and that I do is I am my org will tell you, hopefully, is I'm hyper transparent.

47
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:48,130
So I tell them like exactly how much I tell them how much budget I have.

48
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,560
Here's how much merit is here. Much promo budget is we have.

49
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,660
We do a promotion panel process where I explain how it works.

50
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,980
It's a collaboration between a person and their manager who want to be promoted.

51
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,500
They have a discussion about it if they think, yeah, you're ready for promotion.

52
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,740
You fill out this one page, two page thing, talk listing some examples of what you've done that

53
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,420
correspond with our job architecture, which is familiar,

54
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,500
like ladder levels of Microsoft or career guide, whatever it's called now.

55
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:26,130
And they get some 360 feedback because we want them to be working, not just getting the work done

56
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,930
and having impact, but in a way that fits with the introduced values.

57
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:35,170
And then an independent panel also from my org sits down, reviews the packets,

58
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:39,330
ask some questions and makes a choice on whether one makes a choice,

59
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,210
whether that person is ready for promotion, but two also provides a bunch of great feedback

60
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,770
for that person, either on how to be successful in the new level or what they need to do to

61
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,930
get there. And it's super transparent. People know how it works.

62
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,560
And it's so it's very clear on what you need to do to get promoted. It's not like,

63
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,920
do I get promoted? It's very clear exactly what you need to do. So there's no, there's no mystery.

64
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,900
I, that to me reminds me of, of how I understood the Google model.

65
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,460
Well, the difference between the Google model is Google is the manager wasn't involved.

66
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,070
The employee could say, I feel like being promoted and they would put together their packet on their

67
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,710
own. I feel like the managers, and then there's the other way, the Microsoft way is traditional

68
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:31,310
way is the managers sit in the room and talk about people and they figure out who should

69
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,550
get promoted. This is a mixture of the both, the mixture of both. The manager's decision has

70
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,940
weight, but it's not all the weight and they can't sit there and try and sell. And you've

71
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,900
been in meetings like this because it's impossible not to where the manager who can sell their

72
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,570
employees the best gets more of the promotion budget. And this just takes that part of the

73
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,370
equation out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The, just to point to a point of clarity. So Google,

74
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:07,170
the manager is involved, but optionally so. So to, to, to be considered for promotion,

75
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:15,810
I either the manager or the employee can, can state I'm ready. Okay. And, and then as I understand

76
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:22,450
it, the way the packets are processed are in, in priority order. Obviously the ones where

77
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,690
both the manager and the employee, uh, believe they're ready. Go first.

78
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,780
Okay. I haven't worked at Google. I don't know all other details, but

79
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,100
I don't need their, this is, this is the way we do it in my team.

80
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,180
I, I like, I like the models. I like the model. The, the one thing that's nice about it

81
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:48,400
is the only, the only change I would do with, with yours, if, if I had the ability to

82
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:55,520
was make the committee just be outside of your org entirely. Yeah. Eventually. It's honestly,

83
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:02,080
it's too, and I've involved people from outside the org. It's just too foreign of a concept for

84
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,360
a lot of people right now. Eventually, eventually I have to grow into that. I couldn't train,

85
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,880
I can train my org and give them training on how to be a panel member and how to be a panel lead.

86
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,280
I have less control over training people outside of my org, how to do that.

87
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:25,780
Gotcha. So, but we also do for our, um, more senior positions, uh, like for example,

88
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:33,140
I wanted to open up a high level position, uh, recently. And what I have to do is I have to

89
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:38,500
bring that to a panel outside of my org, a VPs to explain the role and why it's important for

90
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,900
the company that has keeps me from going, Hey, I'm going to open up a VP role or a director role.

91
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,260
Instead. I can't just do that. I have to go through a panel process to even open a role

92
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,950
and all the senior senior promotions go through a similar process. Anyway, uh, that was my comment

93
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:59,790
there. What have I been doing? No, oh, um, normal stuff, avoiding COVID. I got my second booster

94
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,830
shot because I am going to, I'm traveling, I'm traveling again. I'm going to Copenhagen,

95
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:13,020
leaving Sunday, my first trip out of the country in over two years. Fun. Um, my passport expired

96
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,520
during the pandemic, but I have a new one and I remembered to sign it in everything.

97
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:27,660
Do you have a fast path to, to passport enablement? I have not, I have never possessed a passport.

98
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:34,380
Oh my God. You're such a stereotypical American. Really? I'm on my, I've, I've had, yeah. Okay. Yeah.

99
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,780
Um, oh my God. I have, I have a new passport. Get a passport and see the world.

100
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,530
I would love both of the same. All right. Do that. Yeah. The, a lot of people are surprised

101
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:53,570
that I've never been to Europe. I have been outside of the United States. Don't you need

102
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:58,770
a passport like it, or at least an enhanced ID to even go to Canada now. The last time we went to

103
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:07,570
Canada, those rules weren't in place. Oh my God. Yeah. Do you leave Bothell? I do. I'm in Redmond

104
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:13,730
right now. Do you leave Bothell in Redmond? Um, for those of you away, it's all just a big blob

105
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:21,410
of suburbia and East side. I, I was in Seattle getting Krispy Kreme just, just last weekend.

106
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,930
That's fantastic. All right. So anyway, I'm looking forward to that. Should be fun.

107
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:32,290
Just hanging out with the team there. You know, I added 50 plus people to my org in Copenhagen

108
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,410
six months ago. I have met about five of those people in person in my life and none since I

109
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,740
started. So I'm looking forward to hanging out with them. So that'll be fun. All right.

110
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,180
I got a, I kind of a, because it's been a long time. I got a little bit of a

111
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,340
potpourri of topics on the agenda. And what are we at? Did I press record? I did. I remember how

112
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:58,100
to do this. We're about 12 minutes in and 10 after editing. And we're getting to stuff that,

113
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,860
I don't know, this is, this is going to be fun, but a little bit of a throwaway. So first,

114
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,900
I would like to point out that practice test just published a list of their favorite podcasts.

115
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:16,660
Did you know this? I did. And you know, which one is, you know, there's a bunch of podcasts on here,

116
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,860
but also one called AB testing. I'm familiar with this one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the link there.

117
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,860
And we talk, we both talk about, we're asked independently or we answered independently on

118
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,220
our favorite episode. And of course it was episode 67, the traditional versus modern testing manager.

119
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,380
And so if you, that's what you should go check out. If you don't know what modern testing is,

120
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,100
you don't know what you guys do. And I would go check that one out. You probably wouldn't

121
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,020
say it that way, but yeah. I would hope not. I mean, it's more cohesive. They have a great list

122
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:57,060
on here. I was going through and I'm like, okay, who are the, uh, who, you know, number one,

123
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:03,380
what's the sword order? Normally we're number one because we're, we start with A, but this is not

124
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:12,740
where we're listed in number three. I do think in terms of adding awesome, colorful stories.

125
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,100
Oh yeah. Interesting. It's actually you, me, and Joel. We're the only ones that sort of added

126
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,180
stories to, to, um, to their list there. I don't know, but it's the whole list of things you can

127
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,380
go check out. It's a good way to sample and see if there are undoubtedly better testing podcasts.

128
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:38,770
Undoubtedly. Right. And what, what's funny is we're on this list, but our podcast really,

129
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,560
I guess we talk about testing, but it's not a testing's in the title and we've been testers,

130
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,960
but we talk about a lot of other stuff, but today we're going to talk about testing.

131
00:13:50,960 --> 00:14:00,510
Let's talk about AB testing with the slash, which is a, uh, yeah, it's right up your alley

132
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:06,910
cause AB testing with the slash of course, about compare experimentation and comparing different

133
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,310
treatments. And it's all out of Eric Ries and something that I know a little bit about. I

134
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:18,030
give him some talks about, but I would think a data scientist is far, far more knowledgeable

135
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:24,270
in this area than I would be as much as I, you know, I try and I try and learn what I can, but

136
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:30,990
I think Brent, would you agree with me that you between us, you are the expert in a slash B testing?

137
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:38,830
Oh, absolutely not. Well, you would be right. Because if you look at the list of, uh, from,

138
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:45,870
uh, KELOLAND.com of 58 influencers and AB testing, you need to know in 2022,

139
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,420
my name shows up, not yours. Yeah.

140
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:02,850
It's interesting and it's interesting because it seemed like, uh, I don't, I don't know who wrote

141
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:08,690
this harder. No, me neither. I suspect the next girlfriend of Allen's or something there.

142
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:16,690
Gets better. It gets better. I'm in a section of, I'm in the section of AB testing influencers

143
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:22,610
in feature management. I don't know what that means, but you're the only one there.

144
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:29,810
Oh, you're right. Yeah. I don't know what it means either. I don't know any of this. I don't,

145
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,810
the world doesn't make sense, but I wanted to call it out. In terms of like the category,

146
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:43,490
well, feature management, to me, it looks like they, they might've done a LinkedIn search on

147
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:50,130
AB tests and looking for, looking for executives. Oh, maybe. I don't know. Yeah, maybe, maybe.

148
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:58,770
I don't get those anymore. I took, I took, I think I took advice from you on that years ago is basically

149
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:07,070
right. You change certain keywords in your profile and now you no longer show up in that,

150
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:13,310
in their search engine. Yeah. Recruiters don't actually read. They just keyword searched your

151
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,190
profile and they go, Ooh, S debt. And I was an S debt a long time ago. I want to come back to

152
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,430
S step, but do you know who else is a VP of engineering that we both know?

153
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:28,140
I know several people that we both know that are VPs of engineering.

154
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:33,820
That was a dumb question. Yeah. But before, before we move on,

155
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:42,770
Oh, okay. Like I, I'm, I'm looking at this, uh, this, this highly suspicious list of AB testing

156
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:50,450
influencers. The one that includes me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was, um, and it explicitly

157
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:56,690
mentions that you are now hosting the modern testing podcast. Apparently. So when did that,

158
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:04,050
when did that start? I don't know, man. I think for Brent, for Brent's, the also ran. It's like,

159
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,050
yeah, it's, it's, it's the Allen's podcast. Welcome. This is the Allen page podcast with

160
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:17,340
a special guest this week, Burt Jensen. Yeah. You know, one day, uh, when I get tired of your

161
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:22,700
bullshit, dude, I did not like, do you see my byline there? I didn't make that page. Somebody

162
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,900
else screwed it up. No, I'm just going to tease you for it incessantly. It just occurred to me

163
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:34,860
that like the name of the podcast is AB testing. Right. And if you just erase that small little

164
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:41,600
bump in B, it very quickly becomes AP testing. That may or may not have already happened.

165
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,500
All right. I'm, I'm now searching Spotify for the modern testing podcast.

166
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:55,180
All right. We may have a discussion later. Is it called them? That's so funny. They call it

167
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,180
that the modern testing podcast. They called it the modern testing podcast. Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord.

168
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:09,470
I just, I don't, I don't know why people even make these lists. Some, some, I don't know. Anyway,

169
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:18,620
uh, back, back, so check fail. So a long time ago, modern testing

170
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:27,100
podcast. Nope. Nothing on Spotify. So you don't, you're not hosting it there yet. All right. I'll

171
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:34,700
find it. Mr. Page. Wouldn't it be funny if you found it. Oh my God. Alan has a podcast. It's like

172
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,540
totally produced like those ones with like the sound effects and the music in the background.

173
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,180
It'd be like this American life, but it's a modern testing podcast. Oh, I can weave some

174
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:48,780
stories together. Oh, it'd be so good. That's such a good idea that I don't have time to implement.

175
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:56,050
Now you had to hire people for that. All right. All right. Oh, remember, remember that

176
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,890
one time I wrote a book about software testing. I do. And I didn't write at all. I wrote most of it

177
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:06,690
and I take damn, I was damn clear with this. I counted pages and how many I wrote and I wrote

178
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,210
most of it. BJ Ralison wrote part of it. I don't know what ever happened to BJ. I did look him up.

179
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,410
I did a Google search. He did like, he like sailed his boat to Hawaii and then Fiji during COVID.

180
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:25,300
But the other author who wrote two chapters, one chapter on, uh, one chapter actually interesting

181
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:31,140
on like where the term S debt came from. Like, you know, how that was invented at Microsoft.

182
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,660
And some of the stuff around some of the history of tests is actually still accurate,

183
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,900
even though it's changed so much since then the snapshot's accurate. But he wrote another chapter

184
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:47,940
on, uh, I don't know. I don't think it was even called service testing, something around how we

185
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,900
were testing services at the time. And he, within a year, he was so embarrassed about that

186
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,780
chapter and how horribly out of date it was. He was writing that at a time. Microsoft was still

187
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:04,420
figuring out how to do service testing. But anyway, BJ, of course, left, uh, Microsoft a long time

188
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,770
ago. I left five years ago, five and a half years ago. And as of last week, Ken Johnston has left

189
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:17,490
Microsoft. No more authors are left. He is now the VP of AVP of engineering at Ford motor company.

190
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:25,650
Yeah. He sent me a message on linked in recruiting you. He needs data scientists.

191
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,820
He told me initially, it looks like on LinkedIn, his title is different. Right. But he, um,

192
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:42,620
he's the director of data platforms and analytics for the EV division. That's, oh, no, he's, he's VP.

193
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:49,100
Our listeners can hear anyway. Anyway, I'm just, just saying like, look right here.

194
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:56,930
Ken telling me that's his title. Um, look at the, look to the left where it says I'm happy to share

195
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,890
that I'm starting a new position as VP engineering at four voter company. Yeah. No, I see that.

196
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,990
Right. I'm just telling you, I don't, I don't, can tell me this is his title. Okay. He fold.

197
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:15,790
He's told everybody, this is his title. I don't know what it is. So Ken's a big fat liar. That's

198
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,710
what you're going to share your screen on an audio podcast. Ken's a big freaking liar.

199
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:29,630
No, I just say, I'm basically saying, is that your power move? Ken is an executive at Ford.

200
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:35,150
And, um, there you go. What ifs, what ifs, um, I hope he does cool stuff. He's really,

201
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,590
super excited about it. All right, man. So anyway, Ken went there. So all those authors are gone.

202
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:47,470
The book is blah, blah, blah. I got a couple of questions for you. Yes. So I love ministry

203
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:55,730
of testing because, uh, for many, many, many, many reasons, uh, one is like a couple of every day,

204
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:02,610
they are awesome. They asked some questions on Twitter that get a variety of answers depending

205
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:08,750
on who answers them. So I'm going to ask you a couple of days. I'll give you the answer I gave

206
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,870
on Twitter. Don't look at Twitter right now. So I'm going to ask you this. What's the most

207
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:29,010
common cause of failed automated tests in your experience? Uh, crappy automation code. Well,

208
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:41,070
with, um, I just wrote code. Sure. Which one it was either people or code. I didn't want to

209
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:50,910
blame people. So I, I wrote code. Um, yeah, you can't the way, the way I would frame it is more.

210
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:59,700
Yeah, there are better answers out there. People writing automation code under the

211
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:10,140
false assumption. It's easy and learning the hard way it's not right. Quite honestly,

212
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:18,990
yet sure. Sometimes things change and that causes things to break, but that's not a failed

213
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:26,910
automation test that say automation test that failed subtle difference. And the wordings were

214
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:33,090
there too. Cause is it failed? They mean flaky failed. Does it mean the product under test failed?

215
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,050
I don't know how to answer that, but it was, I copied that to share that with you because

216
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:42,530
that was interesting question. There was one yesterday equally interesting for different

217
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:45,650
reasons. And as you can imagine a variety of answers, I'm going to throw at you also.

218
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:55,390
Does a market shift towards S debts concern you? Yes. Me too. And mainly because I wonder

219
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:02,830
how this tweet from 24 2004 got into my timeline as a new tweet yesterday.

220
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:15,200
Oh, that's fun. No, it was tweeted yesterday. And I think it's weird. To me, maybe it's because we're so

221
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,740
into the modern testing world, right? I just, you know, there's a bubble I live in where I think

222
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,620
Estes are still a thing, which was my, actually my answer.

223
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:31,440
Yeah. What does that mean to you? Like, like, well, so it, it means possibly two things.

224
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,200
Great. So in my career here, I've noticed that things kind of seem to circle around again,

225
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:49,840
around every 10 years ish. Right. Where, um, I've often noticed, and you may have noticed this as

226
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:57,250
well with, with, uh, let's say let's take the topic of duplication of effort where, where you'll

227
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:05,810
see teams go duplication of effort is bad. And, and then they try to centralize it under one

228
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:16,370
leadership and one mission and everybody's going to benefit from this. And then that central team

229
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:23,890
eventually becomes a bottleneck and they're only able to provide the 80% solution for everybody,

230
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:31,010
which there's where everyone then has to make their own 20% and they don't have the ability to do it

231
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:36,690
on that platform in which that encourages a decentralization. And I constantly see that

232
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:50,140
pendulum swinging back and forth on this. If assets are coming back, uh, I hope it's because

233
00:25:51,340 --> 00:26:00,220
we're now going into a new realm of complexity where, where it's just not possible to develop in

234
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,260
and test in parallel. If it's that's, that's not it. And I'm going to interrupt because what I think

235
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,740
is actually happening is every once in a while, when I think it helps see the bubble. We've talked

236
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:18,100
about viewing where modern testing is as the change of innovation curve. And I forget, it really

237
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:25,470
has a lot of companies that are still hiring a good number of Estes or which want to go back

238
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,830
in time. Just like somebody wants to go back in time and save JFK. I want to go back in time to

239
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:36,430
that meeting of the test leadership team at Microsoft and just not, just not use that term

240
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,230
and get it erased from history. But what they want, they're hiring people to write a bunch of

241
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:48,110
gooey automated tests because they can write code and what that means. Wait, wait, wait, pause.

242
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:55,090
That question was in context of what you just stated. I don't understand the question. The

243
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,890
question was, does the market shift towards Estes concern you? And you're saying that the

244
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:07,010
context in which that question was raised was around UI automation?

245
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,240
Well, it's unclear. Some of the answers were around that. Some of the answers were around that.

246
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,790
And I think a lot of companies are still hiring test automation specialists, calling them Estes.

247
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:20,990
That was my takeaway from the answers and that concerns me.

248
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:27,680
Okay. So what that tells me, and here's the big concern. I think you and I, and well before

249
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:32,320
modern testing, Agile testing was around talking about whole team ownership of quality and we're

250
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,720
all part of the team. What hiring Estes means is more silos because you probably have manual testers,

251
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,560
your automated testers or Estes, and then developers who don't have to write tests.

252
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,520
Even though we know and the data's out there showing that if the developers write the automated

253
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:58,880
tests themselves, there's a higher correlation of quality in their organization. So in fact,

254
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:05,120
you're hiring Estes, you are setting yourselves up to some extent, at least for lower quality.

255
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:14,960
By hiring Estes based off of studies such as the one that you decided, by hiring Estes,

256
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,540
you are actually harming yourself. That's my belief. That's my belief.

257
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,260
I share that belief. Well, you're no fun to argue with.

258
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,740
No, how else are we going to parallelize? Let's quickly redo episode 67.

259
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,140
No.

260
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:43,580
Yeah, that's, so you had a small sample set and right now I'm just going to choose to believe

261
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:52,700
that the vocal minority in the world that died is the one that contributed to the Q&A of that.

262
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,380
Or are you saying these are active ministry of test people?

263
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,540
Well, I mean, it's whoever's on Twitter. They asked, the thing I love about them,

264
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,380
they asked these questions knowing they're going to get a variety of answers.

265
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:10,700
Yeah, that part I love that's fun. The random questions and

266
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,420
things like the MT has shown up or modern testing principles has shown up on there,

267
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:26,820
I think more than a couple of times. I love that they are spawning conversation.

268
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,900
Yeah, they are. And they know they're going to get debate in a different set of answers.

269
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,620
And good conversations happen. And it's, yeah, I'm actually really happy with it.

270
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,300
Look back at the thread because people are answering in different ways. There's the whole,

271
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,140
well, I'm a manual tester and I don't want my, I don't feel like I have to program. And it's, we,

272
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:52,980
all those conversations go away. If we, if we really embrace whole team quality and look at

273
00:29:52,980 --> 00:30:00,420
whether you're entirely a non-coding tester or a tester who writes lots of code, there are

274
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,390
valuable ways for you to contribute to quality on your team. But the developers should be writing

275
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:15,340
the test automation. If you're like, if I'm a, if I say I'm hired as an SDET, but I'm hired as an SDET,

276
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:19,020
I wouldn't be hired as an SDET, maybe hired as a developer, developer and test. I'll say I'm

277
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,740
hired as an SDET on a team where developers are writing a whole lot of automated tests,

278
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,220
not just their stupid little unit tests. They're writing actual functional tests and they're doing

279
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:33,020
a pretty good job of testing. I'm spending some of my time probably teaching them to write better

280
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,380
tests because who wants, who wants flaky tests? And I know I have some good ideas how to not do that,

281
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:44,540
but maybe I'm also looking at writing analysis tools or tools that will help me put the application

282
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,860
in a state, right? Where, whether it's a stress test or put it in a state where some weird things

283
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:55,260
may happen or diagnostic tools or linking in the telemetry from the app and some other analytics

284
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:59,740
tools. Those are the sorts of things I want to do as an SDET. I don't want to just automate

285
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,860
a bunch of GUI operations. And that's what I, that's what I fear. And what I observed in some

286
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,100
cases happening in some of these orgs. And I, I wish we could just move past it. And again,

287
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,940
it's the siloing, the siloing doesn't work. And you and I have lived through this at Microsoft where

288
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:21,420
we had a huge functional dev org and a huge fun functional test org. And that conflict between

289
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:28,060
developers and testers that we thought was kind of cool 20 years ago is unproductive today.

290
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:36,080
So the only way I can think of why a customer, a company would do this, right? Would be

291
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:44,400
because they could hire people to do automation, potentially at a much lower pay scale.

292
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,160
Maybe, maybe not everybody has embraced this, this style of software development. I even call it

293
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,480
testing because remember modern testing isn't really about testing and it's not that modern

294
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,760
either. It's just, just the antidote to traditional test late test last, conflictual siloed

295
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,640
testing that we had seen coming up in software in the nineties and two thousands.

296
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,980
Yeah. I wonder if ministry of tests even has any data on this.

297
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,740
No, I mean, again, I, I, yeah, there's value. I did. They teach test automation course,

298
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,180
think it's valuable and people still need to learn that stuff and it'll need to for a while.

299
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:29,980
But when I see some answers to these questions, I go, wow, my bubble is smaller than I thought.

300
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:34,620
And sometimes I think my bubble turns out to be bigger than I thought. I, people come up and say,

301
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,500
oh, Hey, thanks for putting the name to what we've already been doing. Or,

302
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,260
you know, we're following these principles. I go, Oh, okay, great. And sometimes I see some answers

303
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,860
go, Oh, the bubbles, I can't tell how big the bubble is and where things are on the curve.

304
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,500
Sometimes I'm constantly sort of probing and checking in on that as well.

305
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,700
And I'll just tell you right now, I obviously like you, I don't have proof,

306
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:04,500
but the number of conversations and the number of insight, like, I think we talked about it the

307
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,340
other, the other day, we're mainstream now. We're not, we're no longer sort of leading

308
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,780
right. The, the, the change curve that, that you've put it multiple times in your presentation.

309
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:23,460
We're no longer part, MTP is no longer really part of the leading edge. It's more mainstream.

310
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,460
Yeah. It's on, it's on the downward power of that curve. It's in, we're past the,

311
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:36,290
yeah, yeah. Anyway, go on. No, it's, we're at a point where it's well duh, right? Because it's

312
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:45,330
just so commonplace. I think, I think more of the traditionalist point of view is actually on its

313
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:53,410
way out. But I think there's enough of us in the industry. That maybe what's happening actually.

314
00:33:53,970 --> 00:34:03,810
There was a, do you remember the QA series you did in partnership with an external organization?

315
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:10,050
I think they were a contract agency. Michael Hunter presented a presentation there. They were like,

316
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,980
they hosted it and they were in like downtown Bellevue.

317
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,260
Talking about Sasquatch. Yes. Seattle, are you a software quality assurance group?

318
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,700
Yes. And actually less, less, I think it was the one that did the presentation. Now I think

319
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:31,100
about it. You brought him in, you brought him into, no, Lee Lee, you brought him into Microsoft.

320
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:36,940
And he, he, his presentation was around, I think he called it the 10 great for giddings.

321
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,900
Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I'm wondering if that's what's happening again. Like we've been

322
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,800
that people are considering assets and think it's new. I wonder if that's what's happening.

323
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,280
Oh, I wonder. I wonder. And there's not enough people around that remember the old days now

324
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:06,260
to go, Oh dear God. No, no, stop. No, no, stop. Anyway, I don't know. It does bother me.

325
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:15,860
Uh, I think which the points of the question, uh, and I dearly hope M O T does not have any

326
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:24,020
data that points towards this. Although Joel probably would, would have the data.

327
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,260
I love that Joel calls out like, you know, what kind of testing do you and MT is one of the things.

328
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,060
Um, I want to, uh, change subjects completely, which will mean we either have a three minute

329
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,780
conversation or a 15 minute conversation on something I've been thinking about a lot.

330
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,500
I want to bounce off you, but really I'm bouncing it off of our listeners.

331
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,260
You know, yeah. Is that cool? Then it is that, or ask you some IST QB interview questions.

332
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,740
So I'm going to skip that part this week. I've been, uh, of course, as you know, at unity,

333
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,580
I manage a bunch of stuff, including whatever you want to call our infrastructure or platform,

334
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:04,980
et cetera, team, the team that builds all of the infrastructure and tools we need in order to,

335
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,100
build, test, deploy, maintain our products in production, whether it's desktop apps,

336
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:14,980
service apps, I think people know that some of the traditional names are internal platform, et cetera.

337
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:20,430
One thing I have a part of my team, uh, doesn't matter what they're currently called,

338
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:30,130
but their purpose is interesting. Their purpose is to focus on helping teams internally use our

339
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:37,180
tools. So enablement, advocacy, awareness, developing training, um, some internal community

340
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:44,690
management, et cetera. And two things, uh, and this could go anywhere, but what I've found is

341
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,210
kind of like when people, this is cool. You know, when people, this is a good segue.

342
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,010
If I would have thought it this apart farther in advance, thought I had planning,

343
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,610
this was one of those podcasts knew what the sound effects like, like the modern testing

344
00:36:54,610 --> 00:37:03,650
podcast. Uh, you would, um, I would have wove this in much better, but people contact me frequently

345
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,690
and say, thanks for putting a name to something we're already doing. Didn't know what it was called.

346
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:17,010
Recently, I had one of those moments myself when I realized there is a name for what this team

347
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:23,410
does. And I don't know if a lot of companies have a team called developer relations whose job is to

348
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:28,610
do this, you know, basically make sure, work with customers to make sure they understand how

349
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:34,450
to use your API and how to use your tools, et cetera. There is a whole bunch of writing on the

350
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:41,730
internet about a thing called internal developer relations, which exactly describes what one of my

351
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:47,090
organizations does, which is everything I just said, engagement, developer experience,

352
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:54,530
enablement awareness. They're doing communication and classes and brown bags and working directly

353
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:00,290
with teams and sort of a consulting role, like a test coaching sometimes, or actually test coaching,

354
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:08,820
working with teams to make sure they're successful using all the rest of the stuff my org builds.

355
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,060
And the question is, when I look at that, you know, now I'm like thinking,

356
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,700
where have I seen this before? And right before I left Microsoft, when did I leave Microsoft?

357
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,100
2017. So a couple of years before I left, I don't know if it's still a thing at Microsoft,

358
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,660
but they had a thing called one ES, one engineering system out of the VS team

359
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,900
to try and again, Microsoft isn't on one engineering system, but you know,

360
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,740
they all use Git now, I think most teams use visual studio team system. Oh, I'm sorry.

361
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:44,580
Azure DevOps, another dumb ass name. So some of us there, but what do you remember about

362
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,380
one ES? Is that still a thing people talk about at Microsoft?

363
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:56,340
It's still there. One ES in the concept that you're referring to is, I would say is not

364
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:05,840
really talked about, but it's still the spirit behind it is still moving forward.

365
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:14,690
Right. It's just Microsoft is huge. Right. The for a long period of time. I mean,

366
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:24,220
hell, we've talked about it before. In terms of what the hell were those things called?

367
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:31,980
The career stage profiles. But even then before, right, the things that you, you, Alan Page,

368
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:38,860
helped to author. It used to have crappy things like it in order to get to principle and test.

369
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:44,460
You had to architect a test. I didn't work. I worked on the old, the newer version,

370
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,220
the old version said like, and again, it wasn't a checklist. It was a horrible

371
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,380
architecture and those things are challenging. I could talk, I could do a podcast talking about

372
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:57,100
those things, but yeah, it didn't, but there were, they were individual accomplishment over

373
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:05,890
efficiency and in it together. It encouraged individual accomplishment over company

374
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:14,930
accomplishment. Yeah. Quite honestly. Yep. I fully agree. And that definitely is changing

375
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:21,090
under under Satya. Yeah. And to be fair, it was Satya who kicked off. It was one ES was his idea

376
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:25,490
to try and bring some consolidation to give the idea of the landscape back then. Let me get

377
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:31,250
Microsoft was even huge. They're bigger now, but every team had a different way of building,

378
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,890
deploying and testing and even tracking bugs for their stuff. It was just a big fat mess.

379
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:43,260
There is in various different places in the company. So earlier I mentioned sort of this

380
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:50,300
tendency to, to shift back and forth between centralization and decentralization. And I would

381
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:59,490
say right now we are, at least in the group I'm in, there is a shift towards centralizing again.

382
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:09,540
I don't know. I'll just tell you, I will help. I will contribute and collaborate. I am not yet

383
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:19,060
bought into the vision and I hope the leaders there convinced me otherwise because on the face

384
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:28,580
of it, it feels like there is a, there is a, there's a committee that's going through and trying to define

385
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:39,060
the set of standards that will cause everyone to standardize. And, and I'm like,

386
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:46,350
you can't make those things. Every business will require you to change your standard.

387
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:50,830
You have to have a way to handle that. And that's a huge scale. Let me talk about how I'm doing that

388
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:59,470
at my scale because I, we really believe in autonomy and letting people and giving people

389
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:05,310
choices. So, but in some cases we can't do that. In some cases around like security tooling that we

390
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:10,910
implement, we're going to be very strict about that. The way I look at it is providing paved

391
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:17,180
roads. And you're going to, if you want to get the absolute best support from my team and have your

392
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:22,960
best chance for success, you're going to stay on those paved roads. But sometimes you need to

393
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,440
go onto a dirt road and it's fine. It's probably, it's probably still going to be okay. A lot of that

394
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,200
dirt road comes back, connects to a paved road, but you're going to get a little less support

395
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,440
from us because we don't want to support you there. If you're going to be all off mountain biking in

396
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,520
the wilderness, you are on your own and nobody's, no exec business is going to support that. They're

397
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,400
going to say, if you want to run a service, you stay as much as you can on the paved roads that

398
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,140
are already provided. That's how you're going to be successful. And so it's not, so you may get a

399
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,820
couple of different things. For example, you maybe, for example, you could use, I don't even name

400
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:02,460
any names. There's a couple of different CI systems you could use. You could use a couple

401
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,100
of different public cloud providers and we'll help you with those. But generally the paved roads are,

402
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,340
are, we want to, again, the metaphor is getting burned out here, but I want to give people a

403
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:20,580
chance, give them a chance to choose where needed, but I can't just let them go wide open, willy

404
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:25,060
nilly, whatever you want, because eventually you're going to need support from my team and

405
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,100
you're not going to be able to get it because we don't know what you're doing.

406
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,340
Well, yeah. And if you can, if you can put constraints around that or principles,

407
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:41,300
to me, the, the solution to this is establishing the right set of principles that, that serve

408
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,860
as guardrails. Right. Guardrails. We want to help people stumble towards success. The other thing

409
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,580
is again, easier to do with a company of 5,000 than it is 200,000. I don't know if that

410
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:58,020
translates into engineers, but there's a level of trust I need to establish with the

411
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:06,900
business leaders, neither organizations where they come. Like I have one leader for a big org.

412
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:13,410
He tells me, tell my team what to do. He wants us to tell him what to do.

413
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:15,570
Go wash my car.

414
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:19,730
You know what I mean? It's like we can, we can say do X like, okay,

415
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,210
we're going to do X, but usually it's here's what we've learned from this analysis and looking at

416
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:29,170
these incidents going forward. We should always do X and they go, okay, it's canon. It's done.

417
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:35,680
We're doing it. And those things just turn into the paved roads. I don't know how.

418
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:42,050
Well, first of all, again, I think this is very difficult at Microsoft. I think to some extent,

419
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:45,810
the Azure DevOps team probably does this internally. One thing I was really impressed

420
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:51,810
with is it is very, very difficult to take a product that's shipped both internally and

421
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:56,130
externally. And I have been talking to VS folks about this for a long time. They said, nope,

422
00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,170
Microsoft employees, not our customers. And eventually Satya said, yes, they are.

423
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:04,050
And it is a difficult thing to do. When I think of companies that have

424
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:11,090
something they use internally, they ship externally, it's almost always a forked version

425
00:45:11,490 --> 00:45:17,170
more often two different teams working on those things. So full credit to that Azure DevOps team,

426
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:21,490
despite their dumb name, figuring out how to deliver to both internal and external customers.

427
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:26,690
So that part is great. And I know they probably have a team that kind of functions as internal

428
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,730
developer relations. I know I would get pinged a lot when I was there by I didn't look up to see

429
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:35,570
who they were. People on that team to say, how's this going? I see you're doing an

430
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:38,770
inordinate number of queries against this data set. What's up? And I explained,

431
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:43,170
I built a dashboard. They go, okay, that's cool. But I'm kind of wondering,

432
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,290
this is very similar to someone else's journey into modern testing. They go, oh,

433
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:53,730
this is the thing I already do. I can read about it a little bit. How often is this?

434
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:57,410
How often is this used? So what I'm curious about from our listeners, and you can go to the

435
00:45:57,410 --> 00:46:01,330
one of the three dot slack dot com or get an invitation from modern testing dot org,

436
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:07,330
if not already there. And I'm just curious if you have a team like this, if you call them

437
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:12,770
internal developer relations, or if you don't, that's fine too. But does your company have

438
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:18,850
a team whose role is to evangelize sort of a central set of tools? And then I wonder,

439
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:25,460
while I ask this question, if your company is 100 people, you probably don't need that,

440
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:30,420
because everybody knows everybody. And there's no need to do that. They know about stuff. There's

441
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:38,050
some tipping point where one or two degrees of separation are so prevalent that you need

442
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:44,960
to have a team to help make sure that people know how to use the dozens of thought, hundreds

443
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,680
of different things that we have to help developers get their job done. So very curious.

444
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:57,700
So I know they haven't been engaged with me if they exist. But as you correctly call out,

445
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:11,120
a lot of within Microsoft is now public. One thing we are about to do, which I think you've been doing

446
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:18,960
this for a while, back in the day, when you join a new team, right? What's one of the first conversations

447
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,830
you had with your admin? Do you remember? You're about to join a team. They always ask you,

448
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:31,230
okay, you probably forgot. One of the first conversations is which machine you're taking

449
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:38,190
with you. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. The laptop or the desktop? Well, I forgot. Yeah,

450
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:48,960
I would never would have pulled that. We are about to remove desktop from active life here.

451
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,720
Yeah. In the world. Yeah. We just have laptops.

452
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:01,840
It'll start with Azure, but then it'll go to it'll go to all of Microsoft pretty quick.

453
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,120
What's interesting, I'll see if I can start the story real quick, but early on in the pandemic,

454
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:12,000
what was interesting is the our desktop developers were a little slow at first because their

455
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,880
desktops were stuck at work. They needed to either VPN into them or get them and bring them

456
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,560
home. But on the services side of things, it was business as normal because we do all our work

457
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,360
on laptops and all the heavy lifting happens in the cloud. Right. Right. And honestly,

458
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:35,070
that last plug, my M1 MacBook Pro is faster than my desktop. It's a my desktop is fast.

459
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:42,110
It's a rocket. Anyway, go on. I am beginning to go into a market. So I don't know if you've

460
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:50,110
encountered this as well. Maybe your glasses are better than mine. I find that as I'm getting

461
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:56,110
older, my eyesight is getting worse. I have a piece of shit laptop right there on the ground,

462
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:02,430
which you can't see with a 14 inch screen, which I just can't work from anymore.

463
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:08,910
I have to I am at the age where the resolutions I run out, I need glasses to use.

464
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:18,750
Even with glasses, I will get a headache. Oh, or I have to blow up the resolution so much that

465
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:26,030
all I can see is like the text box that says your first name. Right. And I'm like, yeah,

466
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:33,310
now give me my monitors at work with Dolmon. And when I heard about us moving to the cloud

467
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:39,150
with virtual desktops, I'm like, okay, that makes sense. Right. And dog food. I've always been a

468
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:47,520
believer in dog food. But I don't want to give up multi-mon. Multi-mon super handy for me.

469
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:52,480
And it turns out it works. I'm running three monitors on my laptop. Well,

470
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,360
can I have the laptop plus two other monitors? Yes. Yeah. So we're going to get apparently

471
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:05,220
workstation class laptops. I don't know what that means. It's a good plan. And honestly,

472
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,580
that whole you can take one machine thing was dumb because those machines

473
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,420
half the time didn't end up going just end up sitting around doing nothing anyway.

474
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:23,900
Oh, not me. My, my last machine, the machine I took with me to Azure was like an 80 gig box.

475
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:32,060
I had, wooed the admin to allow me to buy the memory for it. And people are like,

476
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:40,460
how much memory is in this thing? And I'm like, a lot, but now with the cloud, I'm like,

477
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:46,620
80 gigs. Anyway, I got to get going. We're talking to the old guy talkbook and I love to hear the

478
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:52,140
chatter on this in our stock channel. So bring that on. I got to run. And, but it's been good

479
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:59,340
chatting with you again. Yes. See you in a couple of weeks. All right, man. Bye. Bye.
