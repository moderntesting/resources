00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,250
Welcome to episode 199 of the A.B. testing podcast.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,250
I'm Alan.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,950
I'm Brent.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,640
And we have no theme music.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,160
Why are we doing this like like like brains in a funeral?

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:24,330
Dude dude, hey, since the beginning of time, I have set the tone for the A.B. testing

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,650
podcast in my intros.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,570
And Brent, the beginning of time, and we have something going on.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:32,610
There's a reason Brent got confused on my intro.

10
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,410
You know, honestly, we press record and I have no idea what's going to happen.

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,930
I have a little bit of an idea what's going to happen today.

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:46,370
We have something a little special planned and we don't know how it's going to turn out.

13
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:53,700
This is going to be structured winging it, I think.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,700
Ready to turn down.

15
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,900
Structured winging, there's another term for that.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,180
Structured chaos, chaotic, I don't know.

17
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,170
Here's what's going to happen.

18
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:09,690
It has been 10 years probably since we recorded the very first episode of A.B. testing.

19
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,890
It came out on April 3rd.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,480
We are having a huge party.

21
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,600
Join our Slack group, one of the three.slack.com.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,280
You can find the link on moderntesting.org or my latest five for Friday post.

23
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Probably put it on LinkedIn.

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,960
We want to get a bunch of people there.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,640
Basically we're doing a webinar.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,920
Wednesday night we're calling it a podcast.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,760
It's going to be a party and it's going to be fun.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:35,910
But we're going to do a little back in time, just like Huey Lewis in the news.

29
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,590
And tonight, Brent, do you have anything to say about this?

30
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,590
Do you want to tell us what we're doing?

31
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,060
It was your idea.

32
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,440
Neither Alan nor I.

33
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,040
When was the last time you listened to this?

34
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,160
Ten years ago.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
You listened to it?

36
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,760
And remember, the audience doesn't know what this is, Brent.

37
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,080
Did you mean to put each other's thoughts there?

38
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,080
No, I didn't.

39
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
But you pretty much choked.

40
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:01,650
No, I didn't.

41
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,290
I was leaving mystery.

42
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,530
Oh, I get it.

43
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:18,800
Yeah, actually, I think actually we recorded it probably two days ago, ten years ago.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
Something like that.

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,080
Ten years and two days ago, I think most humans would say that.

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,140
Yeah, we thought it might be fun.

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,220
We had Alex has Alex.

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,650
Alex is my oldest son.

49
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,650
Yes. And he gets irritated when I call him Alan.

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,760
Alan hasn't listened to it in ten years.

51
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,920
I probably haven't listened to it in eight or nine.

52
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,780
We thought it'd be fun to go back and and on the

53
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,610
penultimate of the one hundred.

54
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,850
We thought it would be fun to go back and listen to episode number one and

55
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,890
potentially mock ourselves insensibly.

56
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,130
Oh, definitely mock ourselves, except for how youthful I sound.

57
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,330
But let's let's get on to that.

58
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,290
So without further ado, and I'm actually one thing, I have listened to the first

59
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:24,010
15 seconds of this and I will tell you that the intro had a mix a little high

60
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,810
for the first few dozen episodes.

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,330
So you might want to turn shit down right now just a little.

62
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,650
Here we go.

63
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,040
There's no voiceover.

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,080
Just to fade to nothing.

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,360
And then check out.

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,440
I'm Alan. I'm here with Brent. Brent, say hi.

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,960
Hi, guys. Hey, we are going to be crazy and try and do a podcast because we're

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,840
I have no I was going to say we're really stupid.

69
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,320
But what are we, Brent? Why are we doing a podcast?

70
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,560
Well, you know, Alan, we're kind of learning.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,720
Holy crap.

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,200
I can barely hear you over you.

73
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah. All right.

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,600
I just said let's just go on a little bit.

75
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,920
But yeah, kind of learning and figuring that out.

76
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,240
What we're what we're experimenting on is whether or not this is a medium

77
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:24,400
that will will help ourselves grow as as communicators and help the test

78
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
community around us to learn and adapt and change with these changes that are

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,280
coming on. Was that serious?

80
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,640
I was just thinking we just want to listen to ourselves talk for a while

81
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,470
because well, now the funny thing is, brief pause, we've done both.

82
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:42,430
We have listened to ourselves talk for one hundred ninety episodes since then.

83
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,430
Except for the one you for the one you weren't on.

84
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,750
And then we also have talked about the changes we're seeing.

85
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,990
You continue to see.

86
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,590
Right. And the other one I said is improve as communicators.

87
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,550
Maybe. Yeah, let's go on.

88
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,630
There is definitely a nontrivial bit of that, Alan.

89
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,230
Well, all right, we're going to give it a shot.

90
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,270
Brett and I have a history of having animated conversations at Microsoft.

91
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,390
We thought we'd try and capture some of those and share those with the world

92
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,230
for as many as two, maybe four people.

93
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,070
That's our goal. What's our I don't know if we have guys yet.

94
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,070
I think if we can get three, the architect group that we.

95
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,470
It's three.

96
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,670
This is the funny stuff.

97
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,230
We have three listeners. So you guys to know me, I'm Alan Page.

98
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,670
I've contributed to a few books of software testing,

99
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,270
try and stay active in the community for just about 20 years.

100
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,750
And we want to talk about yourself for a minute.

101
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,430
I am Brent Jensen.

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:44,670
I've been at Microsoft for the last 20 years.

103
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,830
In the last, gosh, five years, I've followed Alan's lead

104
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,150
and been an active blogger.

105
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:59,670
I'm not quite as attached to to the community as Alan is,

106
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,550
but I'm learning from the master.

107
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,430
I like to do it. You're in trouble.

108
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:13,110
I like the joke that I currently get tens of views on my blog every week.

109
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,590
But it's OK.

110
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,830
The tens that I get are are an important ones to me.

111
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,110
All right. Number one, it is absolutely weird for me to listen to Microsoft Alan.

112
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,870
Like you've been gone for so long.

113
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,350
I'm like, whoa.

114
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,750
And and as an aside, I still even though I don't even remember

115
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,030
when I stopped blogging, but I still get tens of views every week.

116
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,750
Nice, nice longevity, longevity.

117
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,850
Let's continue.

118
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,810
Some topics on the whiteboard you can't see.

119
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,130
We're going to kind of look at those and put them straight from the whiteboard

120
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,010
and do this every so often and kind of see what happens.

121
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,130
So how should we start this, Brent?

122
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,690
Well, so just just just to carry on from that,

123
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,290
one of the things that Alan and I have been have been really starting

124
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,530
to pick up throughout Microsoft, it's this concept of lean coffee.

125
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,530
And that's how we'll start off these podcasts.

126
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,530
So we'll generate a list.

127
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,690
We may or may not share all of them with you.

128
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,010
And we'll just go through the top in terms of what we think is the high

129
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,530
priority that's of interest.

130
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,570
New blog title, Alan and Brent Lean Coffee Live.

131
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,890
No, I'm the name of the body.

132
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,330
I'm waiting for you now.

133
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,910
I thought it was A.B. testing.

134
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,110
Yeah, I can't hear you when the other things going.

135
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,270
No, it's fine.

136
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,950
Yeah, Lean Coffee Live.

137
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,910
Yeah, the A.B. testing in a way.

138
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,990
You know, I when's the last time you've been doing lean coffee?

139
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,990
I did a virtual lean coffee like last month.

140
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,350
Really? Oh, I haven't been doing my work.

141
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,870
I hadn't even heard the term for like five years, six years.

142
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,270
Well, it's because you're stuck inside the bubble of Microsoft.

143
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,790
People already know everything.

144
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,550
The rest of us are trying to learn stuff.

145
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,550
Yeah, I know, Brent.

146
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,270
Test meetups are the cool new term.

147
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,170
Yeah, you know, so on that theme, I'm.

148
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,250
Maybe both of our our listeners can vote, except it'll be you and I.

149
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,170
Yeah, the thing about A.B.

150
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,970
testing, I like it because it's it's it's about quality, but it contains the word test.

151
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,640
What's wrong with the word test, Brent?

152
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,840
Well, we'll talk about that a bit later.

153
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,760
Let me say in terms of credibility.

154
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,120
Always the best partner that I have done most of my career at Microsoft.

155
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,160
The title that I've worn is test manager for the majority of that career.

156
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,800
I've been in test for I've held just about every position you can have

157
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,760
with the acceptance of director and my partner in crime here has held that title.

158
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,920
Yeah, I was a director with five director.

159
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,360
No, six director parts.

160
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,240
Director's director.

161
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,400
But I don't even like managing people.

162
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
The the wow number one.

163
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,240
So I should probably two things to comment on.

164
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,040
One is we definitely had a lot of microphone noise back then.

165
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,200
I sound like I just finished running up 50 flights of stay.

166
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,280
I hear you're youthful and excited.

167
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,720
You've been like the cynicism hasn't washed over you yet.

168
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Yeah, but I'm wheezing for some reason.

169
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,800
I think you weren't you doing like the thing at the pro club

170
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
where they beat the crap out of you, that 30.

171
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,280
So the 20 20, I might have been dead.

172
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,640
But yeah, even then I would have recovered.

173
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,080
But so to be clear, like what I've clarified later was I did not want

174
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,360
to manage people at Microsoft because I hated we've been talking.

175
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,200
We just talked about the systems that we made managers go into last episode.

176
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,040
Yeah, directly.

177
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,520
So anyway, let's let's plug away.

178
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,430
I don't even this is fun because I do not remember.

179
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,910
Like, of course, I don't remember this conversation 10 years ago.

180
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,270
So I don't know what I'm going to say.

181
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:20,400
For one change that has occurred in my life was when I gave up the title of test

182
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,960
and I shifted over to Bing.

183
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Bing is a search and anything that I could give the test community today

184
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,780
as a gift would be the experience I had when I went to Bing.

185
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:45,740
The the number one thing that I learned is the difference between testing and quality.

186
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:51,300
When I when I head over to Bing, I took on a dev roll and

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,800
but I still wore wore my test hat.

188
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,960
And one of the most important things I learned very quickly in Bing

189
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,590
is how little value bugs are when you're shipping every day in Bing.

190
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,150
Everything changes every single day.

191
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,070
You have every layer of the stack.

192
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,910
Devs changing.

193
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,230
You have the UI changing.

194
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,430
Bing has a seasonality aspect to it in which what's important changes.

195
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,510
So news today is not going to be the same news next week.

196
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:41,950
And filing a bug just doesn't end up being helpful to to moving the quality forward.

197
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,710
But so I was going to ask a very leading and stupid question.

198
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,910
Isn't it Chester's jobs to find bugs?

199
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:51,530
It is. Over done.

200
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,090
I don't really think that.

201
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,730
That's a neat thing.

202
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,970
Yeah, the OK, to be clear, to be clear, that was over.

203
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,090
Doug, that was you.

204
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,730
We that was 2014.

205
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,250
Alan jumping in with the fake overdub there.

206
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:15,490
So actually, I actually I figured out one of the things about my my voice

207
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:22,250
because I could hear myself back in those days doing presentations.

208
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,650
If I were in front of the presentations from the people,

209
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:31,930
I'd get instant dry mouth and I'm like, oh, that's what's happening.

210
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,010
In the old days, we sat in a conference room together with microphones

211
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,360
and a little mixer and did our thing.

212
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Yeah, I wasn't nervous about you.

213
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,760
I was nervous about the amorphous, you know, three people.

214
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,520
Two to four. Yeah, two to four people.

215
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,600
We hadn't yet said three, but two to four people. Right.

216
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,280
It's amazing how well we nailed it.

217
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,710
We're right in the right of that range.

218
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,270
When you're in a test manager role, one of the key things that you often

219
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,190
have to do is you got to do things like schedule test passes.

220
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,310
Right. And one of the things that I learned very quickly is is wow,

221
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:11,030
if I were a test manager on this team, it would simply not work.

222
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:18,000
We have a a several million test cases that are possible.

223
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,400
And if we were to do a test pass in the amount of time

224
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,520
that it would be valuable, we would need about a million testers

225
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:34,380
to execute the test pass in about five minutes, because all of that would change.

226
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,820
Once that test pass was done, we would have some useful information

227
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,340
and it would be invalid 10 minutes from now.

228
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,420
But you have a million testers.

229
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,060
That's that's so that leads into the next aspect.

230
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,340
Oh, goddamn, Alan, still in my thunder.

231
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,140
I do it all the time.

232
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,540
But what's funny there is you say as a test manager, I just scheduled test passes.

233
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,100
There's a little bit of a gasp for me.

234
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,100
And that gasp has only gotten louder in the last 10 years from people

235
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,100
talking about scheduling test passes or or filling out test case forms, et cetera.

236
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,500
It's like, oh, God, yes.

237
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,820
Just just grow.

238
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,580
Come to the come to the present.

239
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,740
Come to the new world.

240
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,900
Yeah, no kidding. I.

241
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,220
The the gasp is right on.

242
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,640
I'm like, oh, yeah.

243
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,680
Oh, yeah, I still remember doing that.

244
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,120
God, why we press faster?

245
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,900
All right. I just let's let's continue after me stealing your thunder.

246
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,260
This is kind of that.

247
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,460
You know, it's really interesting is one more meta comment here is

248
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,510
I didn't realize we started we let off episode one talking about this feature

249
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,630
that 10 years later, many people still don't see.

250
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,550
We've gotten better at talking about it.

251
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,940
So we've anyway, interesting.

252
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,580
I didn't realize I thought we just talked about B.S. stuff.

253
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,120
We let right into the stuff that became the principles within,

254
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,640
I don't know, 50 episodes or so.

255
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,480
Yeah, Brent's cat has joined the podcast.

256
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,950
She's upset. I'm not petting her.

257
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,830
Yeah. All right. Let's go.

258
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,270
This doesn't help that I know where Brent's going.

259
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,790
I know what he's thinking.

260
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,430
But there's an intersection.

261
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,150
There's a theme here that we'll probably end up talking about a lot, which is that

262
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:32,070
how teams approach software engineering and the roles of all disciplines,

263
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:36,470
especially the roles formerly known as testers are changing quite a bit.

264
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,830
Yeah, that's true. And and one of the one of the themes

265
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:45,070
that both Alan and I very much agree with is that it's not only changing,

266
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,360
but it's changing significantly for the better that that

267
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,080
my my point of view on this is

268
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,000
I think of James Whitaker's

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,840
Whitaker's from years ago.

270
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,440
There he is again where he said all of that testing is getting in the way of quality.

271
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,080
And you mentioned James Whitaker.

272
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,600
There's a whole class of listeners just turned off the podcast.

273
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,840
But we like it. Go on.

274
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,960
So so so we went from two.

275
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,400
They give him shit for 10 years straight.

276
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,920
I don't think James ever listen.

277
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,560
There was a dance at the end. So stay tuned.

278
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,320
Coming back. And it's good thing that this is a maybe my job here

279
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
is just knock Brent off his turn of thought the entire time.

280
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,840
Yeah, I've done that for 200 episodes now.

281
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,560
It's amusing for Alan, but I don't know that this is good audio material.

282
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,360
Yes, it is.

283
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,520
It turns out.

284
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,320
It's a limitation that I get to within the first couple of months

285
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,840
to the test managers in Bing where I communicated.

286
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,840
Wow. You guys own is magical.

287
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,790
We had 300 million test cases being executed every day.

288
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,380
This is something as in my prior role of test managers, I could never do.

289
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:07,120
In addition to that, they were exactly the test cases

290
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,720
that needed to be executed that day.

291
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,680
When you when you're sitting on top of millions of test cases,

292
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,080
one of the challenges is you don't have the muscle to understand

293
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,760
which ones you don't need to execute.

294
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,790
You as a test manager know you are wasting teams time and business value

295
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,070
because you don't have the ability to know which of these test cases have

296
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:35,290
have no value to execute in this in this in this Bing model.

297
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,250
You do. It was fantastic.

298
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,210
One of the one of the things I want to be clear on, though, a test case

299
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,890
in my in my way of thinking is an input

300
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:54,130
being applied to some sort of program, an output observed in a judgment being made.

301
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,810
And this was happening.

302
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,010
Three hundred million of these things were happening every single day.

303
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,770
The one of the biggest difference, though, is it was being done by our customer.

304
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,260
And the problem we had.

305
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,020
Hold on, Brad.

306
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,140
Did you make the customers test your software?

307
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:13,130
All the time.

308
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,130
Sorry, I was mocking people on the Internet

309
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,330
don't understand the difference between customer doing your testing

310
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,880
and getting or not to take data from the way your customers

311
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,120
don't understand the difference between testing and evaluating quality.

312
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,100
Are you talking about checking and testing?

313
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,180
I'm not even going to never mind. Never mind.

314
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,610
I'm just going to hit play.

315
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,920
And is on that last judgment call.

316
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,760
We didn't have all the muscle we really needed to really understand

317
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
what call they were making.

318
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,590
What was the judgment?

319
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,230
And as we move into more and more of a quality focus

320
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:58,550
and away from a testing focus, that's where I personally see us

321
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:02,510
gaining a lot, a lot of muscle as not only in the industry, but in

322
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,950
particularly in our company.

323
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:08,510
Cool. We're going to explore that quite a bit more as we

324
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,710
venture down this role of recording us, giving each other crap on the

325
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,470
on the Internet.

326
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,230
So that's enough of me babbling for now, Alan.

327
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,230
What have you been up to lately?

328
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,390
Oh, what was I?

329
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,080
What? So what was I up to?

330
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,080
Well, you're about to say, but

331
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,760
didn't we do this before Microsoft?

332
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,840
Like when did Microsoft kill test?

333
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
Oh, this is way before then.

334
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,880
But I think now did we was I still working on Xbox?

335
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I think I was doing the Stupid Science Project, the Android apps

336
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
on Windows Phone, which we didn't have testers on that team.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,840
I don't think I was still on Xbox, but I could have been.

338
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,250
No, no, this is 2014.

339
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,690
So I think by 2014, I was in Power BI.

340
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,920
OK, I'd have to look.

341
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,600
I think I was on the Stupid Science Project.

342
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,040
Yeah, because I hadn't gone to teams yet.

343
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,320
No, I was on the Stupid Science Project

344
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,600
because I think Xbox One had shipped.

345
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,840
Oh, hold on. Hold on somewhere.

346
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,040
It was right around the transition of me going from Xbox to Science Project.

347
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,680
But maybe we should just shut up and I can press play.

348
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,680
And maybe I'll say something.

349
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,720
You will probably tell you. Yeah.

350
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,080
Let's check in with younger me and see what I was up to.

351
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,920
God, we're done.

352
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,880
Some people may know I after Xbox One shipped,

353
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,080
I decided to follow my manager because he's a great manager.

354
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,920
Science Project doesn't listen to the science project.

355
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,680
Move over to this small team sort of incubation project, which is under the.

356
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,560
Incubation. I work in the Windows org now, which is a

357
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:00,240
brings its own set of interesting human interactions and challenges.

358
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Oh, oh, God, that was me so nicely

359
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,800
saying that Windows was filled with a bunch of assholes.

360
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,800
Yeah, you were in Sinofsky's org, weren't you?

361
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,600
No, Sinofsky was. Oh, no, no, no, no.

362
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,640
Post Sinofsky Sinofsky had been booted.

363
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,330
This was the frat boys.

364
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,170
Uh, who was in charge back then?

365
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,610
But I say the frat boys, all of his directs for the frat boys.

366
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,970
I forgotten their names.

367
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,570
Michael Fortin, Chris, somebody.

368
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,030
It was like it was like a boys club of it.

369
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,150
Yeah, I did not like the people I liked my team, my team.

370
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:43,990
Oh, no, I'm going to tell a quick story here and I'm going to leave.

371
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,190
But I remember this team was made up of a handful of us from Xbox.

372
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,870
Really cool people.

373
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,160
I loved working with them and some people that have worked on Windows Phone.

374
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,320
And we were making this thing.

375
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,680
And there was a dev manager on that team.

376
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,440
God, if you could ever hear my eyes roll like once a frickin day, he would say,

377
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,680
we'd be talking about how to fix something, how to engineer something,

378
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,960
how to architect something.

379
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,440
And when he would lead a sentence by saying, well, on Windows Phone, we'd just shut him out.

380
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,880
So no, no, that means we don't do that.

381
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,480
Whatever you do on Windows Phone, let's do the opposite.

382
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,830
The exact opposite, please.

383
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:25,270
All right. I'm the way it.

384
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,210
Yeah.

385
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,890
And what we did on Ken was.

386
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,560
There's a reason Brett does not bring up Ken often on the podcast.

387
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,760
We have talked about it.

388
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,880
I don't know what episode. Use your A.I. and go find it.

389
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,640
No, I only I mean, I was the anyway. Anyway, it's.

390
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,400
I'll leave it at that for now.

391
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,000
I was very early on.

392
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,800
It was all secrets, some windows.

393
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,080
And if you are inside or outside of Microsoft,

394
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,640
you've ever heard of the way Microsoft works, hearing the word windows,

395
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,440
making big shifts is either shocking or you don't believe it.

396
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,000
Or you think by a big shift, meaning, you know, we're going to do nothing.

397
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,440
Change the startup screen.

398
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,650
Yeah, we'll change the startup.

399
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,840
That's funny.

400
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,080
So we're changing a lot of the way we do engineering.

401
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,960
Windows is going to try and actually make software like I put it

402
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,360
like the rest of the world does are, you know, our developers,

403
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,480
many who probably have never written a unit test in their life.

404
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,800
We're going to write unit tests, functional tests, integration tests.

405
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,800
I don't know if they ever did one team because it's just damn more efficient

406
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,520
for the author of the code to write those tests.

407
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,400
Holy crap.

408
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,840
I was saying this before Accelerate came out and proved that with data.

409
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,400
I didn't realize I go back 10 years to say it is just more efficient.

410
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,160
Actually, what I say at the time was it's more efficient for developers

411
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,600
to write the unit tests.

412
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,200
I had I don't think I had come around to discovery.

413
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
There's a lot of me coaching.

414
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,640
This is actually the first team I did test coaching on.

415
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,440
But coming around to it's more efficient for developers

416
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,600
to write all of the automation.

417
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,120
But I I guess I thought I was much dumber 10 years ago that I am now.

418
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,800
But I'm really just full of the same hot air with different words around it.

419
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
We've kind of been saying the same thing.

420
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,920
And by the way, John Devon and Julie Larson Green, John Devon, who actually,

421
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,160
by the way, John Devon lives like two blocks from me.

422
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,000
OK, I'm just sorry.

423
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,940
Sorry, I guess. Yeah.

424
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,180
Yeah. The.

425
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,580
Actually, I liked John.

426
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,970
His direct reports were just a bunch of jerks.

427
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,370
All right, go on.

428
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,970
John was a nice enough guy.

429
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,010
His his ideas were idiotic.

430
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,000
OK, I'm going to push the button.

431
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,600
Now, you know, it was John that did the director of test thing, right?

432
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,000
No, that was so much.

433
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,760
No, you're right.

434
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,120
John, that was John.

435
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,160
So many tests architect.

436
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,000
I was on the team where he tried it out.

437
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it was.

438
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
Yeah. Anyway, I think it was.

439
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,840
It was. I don't want I don't want to flash back too much to Microsoft land,

440
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,920
even though that's just where we're.

441
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,320
No, I'm too because I'm so excited about this because I'm just like,

442
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,240
what's that? It's only been 10 years.

443
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,280
But the world is so different now.

444
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,760
Let's let's listen on and see if that's true.

445
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,800
We want to take advantage of some of the things we've learned

446
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,400
from people like Brent and others who have been in services for a while

447
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,880
and apply some of those concepts to testing desktop software, doing things

448
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,560
like, you know, we're going to we're going to flight, we're going to iterate.

449
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,240
We're going to do all kinds of great things.

450
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:42,040
I won't go into the details because I'm sure someone will get mad

451
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,720
that the world now knows Windows is going to make software really well.

452
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,240
Didn't work.

453
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,640
But we had this is a big shift for a lot of people.

454
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,720
So we did a quality day, a one day event

455
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,800
where we talked about why we're making the changes, what it means

456
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,480
and what it means for the different disciplines

457
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,280
and how your role kind of changes and lots of examples of that work.

458
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,320
Early on, I worked on the committee for this and early on, we decided that,

459
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,120
well, the original plan was like seven one hour talks.

460
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,000
And whenever I go to every time I go to a conference

461
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,720
and I start sitting in track session after track session, I go, man,

462
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,030
if I ever host a conference, it's all it's going to be all 30 minute or less talks

463
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,590
because, you know, hardly anybody has, you know,

464
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:36,030
as anything interesting to say for a whole hour.

465
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,590
And there's also the aspect that that Alan is riddled with ADD.

466
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,060
Mm hmm. Hey, Mr.

467
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,420
Pot. Yeah.

468
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,460
So I don't know if project my spread a squirrel anyway.

469
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,560
So we had just trying to throw you out.

470
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,880
You included a flurry of talks.

471
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880
We had an opening keynote that was 45 minutes.

472
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,720
And then even vice presidents were limited to,

473
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,000
you know, anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.

474
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,520
We kind of shifted times through the day.

475
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
And a couple of amazing things happened.

476
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,760
One was we actually held, you know, more than a thousand people,

477
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,840
close to two thousand people interested for a full day.

478
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,040
And two is, you know, the talks went pretty well.

479
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,920
People felt like they got something out of it.

480
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,640
And that's, you know, I remember nothing

481
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,200
been involved in other conferences at Microsoft.

482
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,640
And this one, I think, was it went really well.

483
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,800
It was it was some talks were 10 minutes.

484
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,200
A lot were 15, a lot were 20.

485
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,280
I don't think I went to the sort of told the story pretty well.

486
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,760
There's our goal, you know, coming out of that was or going into that was

487
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,760
let's have fewer questions, let's generate, let's answer more questions

488
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,880
than we generate and getting rid of ambiguity is always a great way

489
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,320
to help lead change in an organization.

490
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,640
So it went pretty well. I was pretty happy with it.

491
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,640
So optimistic.

492
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,840
I think it's still a long way to go and a lot to learn.

493
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,560
But I think people have an idea of kind of what it means.

494
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,560
Brent's raising his hand. Excuse me, Brent.

495
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,400
Now, before we get to Brent, you know, we talk about the same things,

496
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,480
but I've matured over the last 10 years, actually is in handling

497
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,720
this organizational change and dealing with ambiguity and and just having more influence.

498
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:33,560
Yeah, yeah. You in the last 10 years, you scaled and affected change.

499
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:37,800
Like, like I think about what you learned when you went over to unity.

500
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,800
You were quite a high level when you left Microsoft.

501
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,260
And yet I still don't think you would have had the impact.

502
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,080
No, and I think, you know, I I had to leave.

503
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,320
I didn't have to leave, but I had believed to do what I did grow where I wanted to grow.

504
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,360
So it's been great.

505
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,000
All right. I can't wait to hear what you had your hand up.

506
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,920
And what do you think?

507
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,800
10 years ago, Brent said, let's find out.

508
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,310
Burt.

509
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Wow. First one, we're going to go that way.

510
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,920
That's an inside joke. We'll talk about that later.

511
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,920
So you said something that I think is super interesting to me anyway.

512
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,920
So you said that it went really well.

513
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,920
Did you happen to talk with a bunch of people?

514
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,920
I'm curious what were sort of the top five themes that came out of that,

515
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,920
that really resonated with folks.

516
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,100
The first thing I heard, the thing I heard foremost was the format worked.

517
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
And that's I was involved in that change.

518
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I was happy to hear that.

519
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,100
As far as people taking away things, there is, you know, at Microsoft,

520
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
we have this three discipline system.

521
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,100
We have program management.

522
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,100
We have software development and software test,

523
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:58,100
which we call quality in Windows now, but it's the same thing.

524
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Trying to shift the mindset by the title.

525
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,100
I completely forgot about that.

526
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,100
Do you remember that?

527
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
So we had the quality and fundamentals group and we.

528
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Yeah.

529
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,100
It was a lot of, it was.

530
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,450
Yeah.

531
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,450
And we need to control.

532
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,450
Far too much. But yeah, it was spin control.

533
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,450
They still had a quality team.

534
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,450
Those folks are all gone now, but they focused on data.

535
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,450
And that's what a lot of folks in Windows like.

536
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,450
That's when Steve, former guest a few times on the show.

537
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,450
Right.

538
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,450
He's really deep into the data science world.

539
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,450
As far as I know, I don't know if he was still there anymore,

540
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,450
but he cut a lot of a lot of folks from test went that direction.

541
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,450
Some went to Deb, some left.

542
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:43,450
But yeah, I forgot about the quality group.

543
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,450
The three pronged.

544
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:48,570
In hindsight, I realized now I didn't know at the time how

545
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,570
wrong the whole approach was because I was in the middle of it.

546
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,570
And as much as you know, I paid more attention to what happened

547
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,570
outside of Microsoft than a lot of people at Microsoft.

548
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,570
But it wasn't until I left and kind of saw more that I really

549
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,570
began to see a bigger picture.

550
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:07,640
Yeah.

551
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Brent just stabbed himself.

552
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
So, uh,

553
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
10 years later, you stabbed himself.

554
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
That's funny.

555
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,640
There was a good one of the things I love to do when I'm like getting

556
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,640
a new team put together is get the discipline leadership together.

557
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,640
I talk about what their team does, what their expectations are for

558
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
other people.

559
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,640
And this was like a big forum version of that.

560
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,640
In talking through what the roles did, we had we had a lot of

561
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,640
opportunity for everyone in the room, all engineering disciplines

562
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,640
to understand what each other was responsible for and what they

563
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
were, what new things they were responsible for.

564
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
So everybody's kind of in it together.

565
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
That was another big theme that came out.

566
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
And people loved.

567
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,700
I'll do the third theme.

568
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,700
People love this.

569
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,700
We had a ton of examples of where data driven quality has

570
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,700
worked and where, you know, making not just the business

571
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,700
intelligence part of understanding how users using the software,

572
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,700
but building statistical models on our analysis and using that to

573
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,700
make predictions on how customers have used software and examples

574
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:10,700
of that, like I think the scales shed people's eyes and they

575
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,700
thought, Hey, I think I get how this can work, which if you

576
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:19,700
work in an org like windows is a huge, huge thing.

577
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,700
It's a, I'll just say it's a team deeply rooted in history.

578
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:28,240
I was far too optimistic, but they are, they have a far

579
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
far far far too optimistic.

580
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,240
It didn't, I thought at the time I thought, man, yeah, it's going to be

581
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
so great.

582
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,240
And it's still a moving ship.

583
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Were you optimistic or were you just at a phase where like, okay,

584
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,340
first episode, it's hard to tell.

585
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
It's listening to younger me.

586
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,340
It sounds like I believed it, but I could have just been trying to

587
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,340
tell a good story.

588
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,340
I feel like you were a good story.

589
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,340
I could have just been trying to tell a good story.

590
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,340
I feel like you're, you're being careful.

591
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,340
Uh, right.

592
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
It's the first thing.

593
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,340
Okay.

594
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,440
We're already talking about Microsoft.

595
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
I don't know either.

596
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
I've been talking a lot about Microsoft over the years.

597
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
So yeah, I don't know.

598
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,440
We both have, but I'm so employed there.

599
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,440
So I'm still very careful, but yeah, I think it was our

600
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,660
first episode where we were like extra careful.

601
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,660
I don't know.

602
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Nobody.

603
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,660
And I'm sure you've heard nothing since, since I left,

604
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,660
but we never got caught.

605
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,660
I don't think a single person who cared at Microsoft,

606
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,660
listen to our podcast.

607
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,660
I've got one reach out from HR.

608
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,430
Oh, uh, I don't know,

609
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,430
like seven years ago and they just wanted to confirm that,

610
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,430
that it was me.

611
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,430
Nothing else came out of it.

612
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,430
I guess.

613
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,430
Interesting.

614
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,430
I guess I showed up and yeah.

615
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:50,880
Anyway,

616
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,880
it showed up in my permanent record somehow.

617
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
All right.

618
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,880
Brett.

619
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,880
Yeah.

620
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,880
The fine tradition.

621
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,040
Um,

622
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,040
of producing really great code at a,

623
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,040
at a really great cadence.

624
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
The,

625
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
the one thing I might say to our competitors is this,

626
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,290
despite what you think about windows,

627
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,290
our people,

628
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:19,290
we have a large number of people and they are really good at execution.

629
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,290
Once this culture shifts,

630
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,290
they're going to be really good at this new culture.

631
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,290
Or careful.

632
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,290
Absolutely.

633
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,290
Correct.

634
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,290
Um,

635
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,290
we have good executor.

636
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,290
And when,

637
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,190
when the hammer did finally fall,

638
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,190
right?

639
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,190
It,

640
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,190
it was either,

641
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,190
I look back at it now and there's,

642
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,190
there was really two people,

643
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,120
two kinds of people,

644
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:51,470
the people who started executing and the white knuckle folks who were like,

645
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,470
no,

646
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,470
same with any organizational change though, right?

647
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,470
That's true.

648
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,470
Yeah.

649
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,470
Same back then.

650
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,470
Yeah.

651
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,530
It is.

652
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,530
We, um,

653
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,530
anyway,

654
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,530
I don't want to get up on the Microsoft raw,

655
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,530
raw band,

656
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,530
but we have a ton of work to do and,

657
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,530
um,

658
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:06,530
sometimes it's frustrating,

659
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:07,530
but,

660
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,530
uh,

661
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,530
it's,

662
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,530
um,

663
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,530
yeah,

664
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:12,530
it's interesting to be part of this change right now.

665
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,080
I,

666
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,080
I,

667
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,080
I haven't seen a more exciting time in my career,

668
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,080
uh,

669
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,080
than the time we were,

670
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
we're in right now.

671
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
I think that I wonder if that's true across the industry.

672
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,080
You know,

673
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,080
we're talking about some of this stuff and we're going to wrap up in a

674
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
minute here for those of you that are extremely boring.

675
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,080
I remember talking about some of this stuff just about a year ago about,

676
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,080
you know,

677
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
some of the changes we're making on my,

678
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
I think was I,

679
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
where I'm,

680
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,080
I think I was on Xbox then.

681
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,080
Sorry.

682
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,080
I had to think for a second.

683
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,080
And it's been a blur.

684
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,080
So just so you guys know,

685
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Alan spent five years last year in Xbox.

686
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Yes,

687
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
I did.

688
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,080
It's all a blur.

689
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Um,

690
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,080
I should have got an extra five,

691
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:53,080
five year service award just for the might two years in Xbox.

692
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
Um,

693
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,620
wait, so where would I describe some of the things,

694
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,620
you know, right?

695
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,620
This is where,

696
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
where were you then then during this talk?

697
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,620
I know that's right.

698
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,620
You were,

699
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
you were on science fair project.

700
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
We just had this conversation.

701
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah.

702
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,620
Yeah.

703
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,620
Yeah.

704
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,620
All right.

705
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Let's go.

706
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,620
So we need to go.

707
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,620
It's cutting edge that I remember talking to someone outside of

708
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,620
Microsoft.

709
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,620
And the quote was,

710
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
uh,

711
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,620
this would all be revolutionary if it weren't already happening.

712
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,620
And,

713
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,620
uh,

714
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,620
I remember that.

715
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,620
I remember that going,

716
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,620
oh,

717
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
cause it's like you and I talk about like maybe we're on the edge of

718
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,620
the bubble,

719
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,620
but we're not,

720
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,620
there's always people ahead of us.

721
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,620
And I can't remember who said that to me,

722
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,620
but that quote has stuck with me for a long,

723
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
long time.

724
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,620
Right.

725
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,620
I mean,

726
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,620
it isn't for,

727
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,640
uh,

728
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
we did around,

729
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,640
it wouldn't be for another three and a half years before we would do

730
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,640
modern testing principles.

731
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,640
Could have been, we had to talk about still end up.

732
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
We vetted it out for a long time.

733
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,640
And again, we're just,

734
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
anyway,

735
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,640
anyway,

736
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,640
love that comment.

737
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,640
I feel like,

738
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,640
I feel like people keep telling me that,

739
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,640
but I kept it in episode one.

740
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,640
It's weird.

741
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,640
It reminds me a bit of,

742
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
um,

743
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
a comment.

744
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,160
What was one of the books?

745
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,280
Oh,

746
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
exploratory testing.

747
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
I was,

748
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,690
I have,

749
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,200
um,

750
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
over there on my shelf,

751
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
they're all my sign books,

752
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,620
including yours and all of them.

753
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,620
I have from Whitaker.

754
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,620
Is that Whitaker's exploring her testing book?

755
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,620
Yes.

756
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,620
And I,

757
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,620
the best part of that book is the forward.

758
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,620
The forward is like the most masterful writing in there.

759
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,620
Um,

760
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,620
yes,

761
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,750
I do know who wrote the forward.

762
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,960
I am just moving on.

763
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
Um,

764
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
Fair enough.

765
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
Fair enough.

766
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,960
Um,

767
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
uh,

768
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
I'm going to say,

769
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,960
I'm going to say,

770
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
I'm going to say,

771
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,960
um,

772
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,960
uh,

773
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,160
I remember.

774
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
So,

775
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,160
so James and I would do monthly lunches,

776
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,160
uh,

777
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,160
back then.

778
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,160
And I remember going to lunch with him and I'm like,

779
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,240
James,

780
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
this book is,

781
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,240
is just like a span on how to break software.

782
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,080
He's like,

783
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,080
he's looked at me and he just smiles.

784
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,080
He's like,

785
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,100
yeah.

786
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,100
I mean,

787
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
if they're not learning in 10 years,

788
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
like I,

789
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,100
I can just bring it all back and act like it's new.

790
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,520
I'm like, okay.

791
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
Indeed.

792
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
All right.

793
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,520
Let's check out the riveting conclusion of Episode 1.

794
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,120
I'm glad to get into the world here, and I'm excited.

795
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,120
It's a fun time to be here.

796
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:43,120
The positive thing for our company in this front is that it is already happening.

797
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,120
There's lots of examples.

798
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,120
We're well motivated because our...

799
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,120
We were so microsoftied.

800
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,120
...are succeeding with this type of model where we're still struggling.

801
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,120
That's a lot of words there. We're getting our butts kicked.

802
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Yep.

803
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Yes.

804
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,560
All right. I think that's enough for today.

805
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,560
We have lots more to talk about, but we'll get to it next time.

806
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Our Lean Coffee List is not exhausted.

807
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I'm Alan. Thanks for listening.

808
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:14,560
And I'm Brent, and have a fantastic week.

809
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:25,950
In my dreams...

810
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,950
So, okay.

811
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,950
A couple of metacom, as we can call it, good.

812
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,950
So, one, I sound young.

813
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,950
I didn't realize I sounded so optimistic.

814
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,950
And I was going to try not to edit this one too much,

815
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,950
but I have to go edit out your typing now.

816
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:42,950
So, thanks a lot, Brent.

817
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:43,950
You bet.

818
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:50,270
Yeah. Overall, it was horrible, but it was fun to listen to.

819
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,270
I was just thinking about something because...

820
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,400
So, Sinovski left in 2012, okay?

821
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,400
And we recorded this in April 2014,

822
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,400
and Bomber left in 2014.

823
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,750
And I'm like, okay, where was...

824
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,750
I'm trying to see the exact month.

825
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:17,970
Were we still under the yoke of Bomber when we recorded that?

826
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,320
Because a lot of the things...

827
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,320
A lot of the things I think that...

828
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:31,720
It took him forever to realize that we needed to shift to Agile.

829
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,720
You remember how he did the roadshow amongst all the high-level...

830
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,790
And I remember the last several levels,

831
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:44,790
he was like, we gotta get more Agile!

832
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:49,790
And he was trying to do the developer-developer-developer thing with Agile.

833
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:53,790
But it was very clear he did not understand what it meant.

834
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:55,790
Right. He was...

835
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:59,240
He grew into the position well.

836
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,240
But one of the reasons I left, it wasn't changing fast enough for me.

837
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,240
But I think it took him a year or more of being in that role

838
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,240
to kind of figure out what he really wanted to do.

839
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,240
And then, anyway, just didn't get there for me.

840
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,240
But yeah, I remember the time.

841
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
It was so weird.

842
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:28,830
It feels like a couple years ago and 20 years ago, both at once.

843
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:29,830
Right.

844
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:32,240
Because I can't do date math.

845
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
Alright, any other comments from you?

846
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,240
So August 2014.

847
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:43,970
So yeah, we were...

848
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:46,970
Yeah, we were like, yeah, these other companies are stealing our candy

849
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:52,040
and that was 100% because we hadn't executed a shift.

850
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,390
Yeah.

851
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:55,390
Yeah, things had to get a little worse for the guy better.

852
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,390
And it's interesting.

853
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,390
You and I both have spent the better part of the last 10 years

854
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,390
working in the service space.

855
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:11,480
And yet still, yeah, still many of the things we say today,

856
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,120
we said on that episode.

857
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,340
Yeah. The cloud may catch on.

858
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
People may use the cloud.

859
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,400
It's still going that direction.

860
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
Right?

861
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
I keep dreaming it'll be a thing one day.

862
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,590
That's why I keep investing in it.

863
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,590
Same.

864
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,590
Alright.

865
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,590
Well, let's call that good.

866
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,590
That would help listeners.

867
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:36,590
You had fun there.

868
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,590
And please come hang out with us Wednesday night.

869
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,590
Links to be found on the internet somewhere.

870
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,590
I'll help you find them.

871
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,590
Thursday morning, depending on the time zone.

872
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,590
You can listen to the recording Thursday morning.

873
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,590
Yeah, another big apology to all of our listeners in Europe.

874
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:54,590
The best time for Brent and I to record was our evening,

875
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:59,590
which is middle of the night for our friends across the Atlantic.

876
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:03,590
So it'll be ready for you when you get up because I plan on just

877
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,590
fixing voice levels and releasing that one right after we're done.

878
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,590
So it'll be out.

879
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:14,650
I show you how to post it to your podcast apps within 20 or 30 minutes

880
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,650
after the recording is done.

881
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,650
Oh, you're going straight to straight.

882
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:20,650
I'm not going to edit anything.

883
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:22,650
I'm going to leave it all there.

884
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:25,650
Hopefully, I don't have to put an explicit tag on it.

885
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:26,650
But you never know.

886
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:27,650
I might be drinking some champagne.

887
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:29,650
We'll see what happens.

888
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,650
Yeah.

889
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:31,650
Alright, everybody.

890
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,650
This was episode one.

891
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,650
Ninety nine.

892
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,650
Sorry.

893
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:36,650
Yeah.

894
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,650
One ninety nine one.

895
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:38,650
But it was one with one ninety nine.

896
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:39,650
Alright, I'm out.

897
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,650
Yeah, I'm Brent.

898
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:41,650
I'll see you later.
