00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,910
The Modern Testing Podcast. Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,890
I am Mindless Agile Robot. I must iterate.

3
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,730
As we talk about software engineering, software quality, leadership, and whatever else comes

4
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,400
to mind. Now on with the show.

5
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,160
Happy snow day, Brent.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
Happy snowpocalypse.

7
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,280
Yeah, so we had a little bit of snow in our area.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:48,290
Yeah, my children were taking bets last night. My daughter said, Daddy, I bet you we won't

9
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:53,850
go to school in February because mid winter break is starting next week.

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,640
Yeah, my kids go two hours late today. So they're getting a little bit in. But what's

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,600
worse is I went to the office. I went to my office yesterday, the first time since

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,340
before I left for my trip to Europe. Because I got back, I was sick for a couple days,

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,960
and the snow came, and then I was snowbound, and then I wanted to leave Wednesday, but

14
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,780
my neighbor managed to get their car stuck in the snow at the end of our perfectly flat

15
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,740
driveway.

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,420
At the end of your driveway?

17
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,540
We have a shared access road that goes to our driveway split off from each other. And

18
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:33,970
they went to leave and they got stuck in the middle of the flat driveway. So that

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,570
happened. So it was good to get out. I'm happy to be out.

20
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:46,040
I was so happy with the snow day because, as you know, I drive a big ass truck, and

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,410
I was able to get into work every single day, and no one else was.

22
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:55,830
We had people come to the office on a few of the days, and there's only 20 people there

23
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,790
out of normally 200, if everyone's there.

24
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:05,340
It was quiet. The only way people could reach me was via teams, and if I didn't

25
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,050
respond, they couldn't tell why. It was just fantastic.

26
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,890
Yaa, yaa, yaa.

27
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,010
I got stuff done.

28
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,360
Anyway, good to be back. I think we've been a month since we've recorded, given my travel

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,600
and being sick and snow. So I'm glad we got a recording in today. We're recording on

30
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,360
Friday as usual. This will go out on Monday. And then while you're listening to this on

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,120
Monday, because everyone listens to the show right when it comes out, I will be skiing

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,720
in Whistler, making my annual pilgrimage up north to do things that I probably shouldn't

33
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,360
be doing at my age on skis, but we'll see how it goes.

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,260
So you're a skier?

35
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,260
I'm a skier.

36
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,740
Snowboard as well?

37
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,740
I snowboarded last year with my daughter one day, and just thinking about it hurts. So

38
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,060
I am going to ski with her this year. My daughter's a snowboarder. I definitely got

39
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,700
better. I definitely got better, but I crashed a lot. A lot, a lot, a lot.

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:14,180
My fascination with the snow right now stems from the fact that I'm a former Californian.

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:22,470
I still think when it's snow-ween, it's magical. But I have pretty much done nothing

42
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:28,610
with the snow this year. I don't even think I have thrown a snowball. Maybe we can do

43
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,130
that after the podcast today.

44
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,000
No, because all we have is slush.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,240
But on that front, my still-at-home son, he made an igloo in my front yard.

46
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,240
That's cool.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,240
It was.

48
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
We had that much snow.

49
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:53,740
He actually, and the thing that was cool the day I, a couple days ago, I came home.

50
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,580
He had strung through and buried electrical, and so his igloo lights up. His igloo's got

51
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,580
power.

52
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,580
That is.

53
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,580
I'm impressed.

54
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
That's my son.

55
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:11,940
I'm impressed. I'm impressed. I thought if it was okay with you, we'd do a podcast,

56
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,300
and then it would be an A-B testing podcast, and we would do mailbag questions.

57
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Sure.

58
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,900
So what number episode are we? We're in the 90s.

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,420
We are in 97.

60
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,820
Counting down to that number 100, which I'm sure, what are we going to do to make, what

61
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,500
are we going to get it up, whatever? What are we going to do to make it special?

62
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Do we want to plan that now?

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
No.

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
I think we wanted to do a mailbag episode.

65
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,940
We are. We are. So that was a rhetorical question for you and a question for the listeners

66
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,060
of the podcast. What should we do in episode 100? Should we bring back one of our former

67
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,890
guests to talk about risk-based automation?

68
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:55,030
I figure that's what you're going to do.

69
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,030
We should do something.

70
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,350
We'll figure something out. We have not too long to decide, but sometimes to decide, sometimes

71
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,950
for you to offer your help.

72
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,470
We should take calls into the show. At the very last minute for the end of the year show,

73
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,110
I asked people to record things. It was too last minute. I wonder if now is early enough

74
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,190
for people to... Actually, maybe we should do that. I'm going to throw this out there.

75
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:26,780
If I don't get at least five, I'm not going to do it, but send me your 15-second or shorter

76
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:34,540
greeting or thoughts on episode 100 looking back as a WAV or an MP3 file. If we get enough

77
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,610
of those, I'm making this little montage. It'd be fun. For one idea.

78
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,610
Is there any way we could just do it live?

79
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,930
Just do it live as I shoot a call-in show?

80
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,410
Yeah.

81
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:53,810
Let me think about that. I know I could broadcast it with Periscope. Let me think, but we don't

82
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,570
want video. We are not video people. What would it be like to do like... Let me think about

83
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,570
that.

84
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:08,300
I'm thinking something. We could do Skype. We could do... I'm sure Percy or Joel do

85
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
something here.

86
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,660
Yeah, I know how to do it. I think I can do this. Only a little bit of setup time.

87
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:21,860
It'd be a little few extra pieces of equipment, but we could take calls during the show. Anyway,

88
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,380
how about we do this show on...

89
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:31,060
That would be fantastic. I'm sure it'll epically fail, which will make it a memorial or a memorable

90
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,060
100.

91
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,460
Sure. Our 100th and last episode. Okay, on with the mailbag.

92
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,460
First. Sorry. It's the only opportunity I have.

93
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:51,480
Oh, yeah. It's plug time. I am doing no conferences in 2019.

94
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:58,430
That's what you say every year. So far. I haven't done in so far.

95
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,510
I have done no conferences so far in 2019.

96
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:11,480
So yes, I think we can all agree that retroactively between now and the start of the year, you

97
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:21,680
will commit to no conferences. However, I am doing one for AST, the Association of Software

98
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:30,080
Testing. It will be on Thursday next week.

99
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,640
So I guess by the time people get the podcast, it'll be Thursday of this week. So quickly

100
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:43,740
go register. We'll put in the show notes the link. Alan will put in the show notes the link.

101
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,460
As long as Brent sends me the links, I don't remember.

102
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:58,400
It is on February 21st at 11 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. I'm going to be discussing...

103
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,560
It'll be a modification of the Unity presentation. I'm going to be discussing how to sort of

104
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,880
the approach or the journey around building a data-driven modern quality culture. I'm

105
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:22,300
actually thinking I'm going to shift the content about a bunch this weekend and tie it to

106
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:28,740
MMT. I'm thinking that obviously the data and the business principle are a key aspect

107
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,370
of that. So I think I'm going to tell the story and tie it directly to those two principles.

108
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,490
We'll see. Cool. I'm going to send my team there. I'll be skiing. I'll watch the recording.

109
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,880
Your team's already seen the first version of it. I have new people since then. Fair enough.

110
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:58,450
Okay. Can we start? We can. All right. Our first question. We have a bunch of them. I'm

111
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,010
going to group a bunch of them into one question that we'll get to in a minute. But the first

112
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:08,410
question is an email I received from Mierich Zalewski. I probably butchered that name. Best

113
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,810
I can do. By the way, if you have questions, you can of course, if you're in our Slack

114
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,250
channel, Slack team, you can post them there. One of the three.slack.com. You can go

115
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:22,450
to moderntesting.org and find the link to join that team. Or you can just email me,

116
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:28,530
Alan, A-L-A-N, at angryweasel.com. And if you're in transition, I highly recommend you

117
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:34,690
go to the Slack channel. That community is super supportive now and it's thriving. Love

118
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,250
it. Yeah. I love that. Somebody will ask a question. I really should answer that,

119
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,400
but then I don't because I'm busy, but then everybody else does.

120
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,680
Yeah. I love that scale part of it.

121
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,400
Hi, Alan. In episode, I'm reading the mail. In episode 94, context-driven testing meets

122
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,920
modern testing. One of you said that back when context-driven testing principles were

123
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,360
created, there was a lot of unskilled testing. I probably said that. Presumably, as

124
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,790
opposed to right now when testing is skilled. Could you elaborate on that part? What are

125
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,150
some skills that testers have today they didn't have back then? What are the most

126
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,510
important skills testers have today? What skills do they need to have? What are the

127
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,470
skills we should hone to stay relevant in the future? That's a lot of questions.

128
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:28,550
I think it's important to talk about the skilled versus unskilled, which is a, it's

129
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,590
not a dichotomy. It's not a binary choice. I should have said testers had fewer

130
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,430
skills or were less, often less skilled.

131
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,310
Yeah. I'm actually hoping that it was you who said that and not me.

132
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,350
I did. I did. Because I remember hiring testers in the 90s because they knew how to

133
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,550
use a computer and they had some, in an interview, they demonstrated some aspects

134
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,390
of critical thinking.

135
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:59,540
So yeah, critical thinking, problem solving, those were all like on the

136
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,140
interviews. We didn't care where you came from.

137
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:10,020
So to finish the thought there, the idea was we had an army of these folks not

138
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:17,280
paid a lot of money, but paid a good wage and we could use them to effectively

139
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:25,450
test quality into the product. But what they couldn't do was scale or they

140
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:32,130
couldn't find, once the bugs got harder to find, they became more or less, in

141
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:37,000
many cases, useless. So as far as what skills they have today, they didn't

142
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,770
have then, I think I just ranted about this on Twitter is we went from folks who

143
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,570
verified a lot of functional attributes were correct, but we need now to be

144
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:55,920
able to use tools to build tools or to use tools that can find a lot more

145
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,760
difficult to find issues, to find the things that are impossible to find by

146
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,530
hand. I think some of those skills are just technical skill. I mean,

147
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,890
technical coding skills, some are technical skills and you knowing more

148
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:12,650
tools of the craft to use and how to apply those. Of course, modern testing,

149
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,450
having some data analysis skills, both in mindset and in coding practices, to

150
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,810
be able to grok large amounts of data. Those skills are much more important

151
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,090
today. But now I'm gonna let you jump in because I finished my original

152
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:36,270
book. Yeah, I was, I was thinking about the day. Right, I'm thinking about the

153
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:43,750
STEs, then they became SDets. Now sort of a more of a unified culture. This is

154
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:51,300
the way I view the world. The STEs, the what, what I remember from them is,

155
00:12:51,500 --> 00:13:00,600
as you call out, they were cheap. We could hire a whole bunch of them. And the

156
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,150
ones that that, and then just sort of deploy a natural selection process.

157
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:12,250
People who just sort of came in and clicked on the product all day. Right.

158
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,000
Sure, that the ROI was there, they would find a bug as long as they had

159
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,280
the ability to notice that they found a bug. What I recall back in the day is

160
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:35,570
that when I first came here, what we call, well, ad hoc testing was the dominant

161
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,580
form. It's essentially click on the product until you find something. Right.

162
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:50,330
And then the manager would mitigate an underperforming person by putting a

163
00:13:50,330 --> 00:14:02,140
kick ass bug count KPI. Right. And now, you know, begins the spiral that we're

164
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,260
still trying to kill. As I read this question again, I'm wondering if the

165
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,220
inventors of the context driven testing principles would be slightly pissed at

166
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:20,660
me for saying unskilled. But I do believe, again, less skilled, definitely less

167
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,140
skilled, less breath in their testing, testing knowledge, less breath in their

168
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:34,360
knowledge of software definitely was occurring up to 2000 ish, maybe a few years

169
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:42,000
after. Yeah, what what I believe was like 97 to me looking at sort of the

170
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,360
difference between now and then. Right. We call them STE software test

171
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,570
engineers, but really they were, as I mentioned, ad hoc button clickers.

172
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:06,400
Now, for me, that's that was damn officially I have now been in the industry

173
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:17,110
25 years in January. I passed 25 years a long time ago. The like, wait, a year

174
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:23,820
ago. So we gave them a common title, but it but the discipline wasn't any way,

175
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,620
shape or form anything that I would have called a craft. Definitely not. And I

176
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,700
think that was true at a lot of companies. I think what CDT did help a

177
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,260
lot was take the people who are actually good at it and give them a

178
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,460
rallying cry. I think much like yes, and which I hope we've done a lot with

179
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,180
modern testing, take the testers that have moved beyond have evolved beyond

180
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:52,260
just being the tester and the verifier. And and actually, one thing we've heard

181
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,080
a lot enough to make this part up is people say modern. We're actually doing

182
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:03,420
that. We just didn't have a name for it for modern testing. Oh, right. So I think

183
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,500
I think there's some similarities there. What I think we've talked a lot about

184
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,260
this recap on this quickly. But we talked about the differences. Testors

185
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,180
are engineers are a little bit more more breadth in their knowledge. They

186
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:19,580
have a little bit deeper, deeper knowledge of tools and or coding. They're

187
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,820
able to do more things. It's much more of a definitely much more of a craft,

188
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,940
definitely much more of there are definitely a test discipline still in

189
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:34,190
many places. Although we have our thoughts on that. What are what are

190
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,750
skills though that you think are different now versus say learned

191
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:44,510
knowledge to me. To me, it's it's a lot of we need a lot more of the

192
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:51,070
t-shaped persona today than we did back then. The game industry and I'm sure

193
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,550
there's others but the game industry is still the only one that I am aware of

194
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:01,750
that kind of still hires that same class of folks. And it's not even all game

195
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,830
companies. I've talked to some game companies who are much more advanced in

196
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,840
how they do testing then than the horror stories we hear out of some

197
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:20,340
large game companies. Oh yeah and I think often of Jimbo a friend of Alan and I.

198
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:26,800
One I haven't talked to him. I haven't talked to him in years. But within

199
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:34,760
Microsoft in the game game space he was doing a lot on data driven stuff. Yes

200
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:42,360
yes for a long long time. That was impressive work what he had done. Yeah the data driven

201
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,090
stuff. I would say I am convinced that the theme around the new skills are

202
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:57,590
around scale. Yeah that yeah test has to the the testing skill set you have to be

203
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:03,510
able to get to the same amount of risk mitigation at a much higher scale

204
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,670
without sacrificing time. So I'm always gonna fall back on data and and doing

205
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,510
customer quality analysis. That's good but that's my wheelhouse in terms of

206
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,110
tying directly to someone in test. Honestly I'm not certain that I would be

207
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,910
a good mentor even on that privately or even on the podcast. I think the

208
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,270
questions we ask a little I think that's right on the money. I think their

209
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:32,830
comment about what we the technical skills we need to hone for the future

210
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:39,210
are the skills that help software scale. I think the maybe the

211
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:45,770
questions what questions do we ask back in the day like does this work? Is this automated?

212
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:51,170
Would this work for and we'd look at I have a variety of computers in our lab

213
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:55,970
ever having like a huge computer lab. Yep so they could test on different

214
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,370
configurations. I was one of the people I had one of my laptops was the same as

215
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,810
Bill Gates laptop at one point so I can make sure that we had a bunch of us

216
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,710
had one to make sure we could dog food on the same build that he was dog

217
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:12,590
fooding on to find harbor issues but stupid stuff right yeah but now we get

218
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,150
all that stuff through data and the question we ask a lot now is okay

219
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,580
that's great will that work for a million people that's great well that

220
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:26,640
worked for 10 million people yes and like one of the questions I asked just

221
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,320
recently one of my when people on my team was they said they were gonna do a

222
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,160
B and C it's great so what happens if that's successful and you have 10,000

223
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:45,430
customers who want to do that and the answer was we can't handle that and it's

224
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,390
a good question I've say I mean it's weird that's a turning point that's

225
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:55,670
someone who's been in testing for a while getting them thinking about scale as

226
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:58,990
one of the initial questions they ask I think is a really important thing to do

227
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,630
and one of probably one of the best guiding things we can get people to

228
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:08,430
start thinking about yeah in terms of a lot of a lot of my go-to examples are

229
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:15,470
right get accustomed to proving and disproving risk on your product by using

230
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:22,590
the the telemetry right that the the example I've given now a zillion times of

231
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,810
change how you think about automation use your telemetry to build the oracles

232
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:36,220
not how I even describe it the previous model where where you would right you

233
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,620
would use automation to not only drive their product but then you would use

234
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:45,500
automation to verify the product mm-hmm right that last bit is the thing I'm

235
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,900
thinking needs to change and it takes it takes sort of comfort with data skills

236
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:58,700
and it takes certainly both approaches take comfort with coding skills

237
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:07,230
cool I think one of the other things testers need as far as skills and we've

238
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,870
talked about this in the principles is this ability to coach this ability to help

239
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,590
people understand to leverage to not take your testing expertise it's some

240
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,310
special snowflakes skill that only you can master but to use your knowledge to

241
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:27,990
make the entire team better at testing I will I even say it further it's

242
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,390
always been the case there's an old book I read years and years and years ago

243
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:44,380
that said testing is 50% politics and what they meant is in order to get your

244
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:51,460
bug fixed you have to be good at negotiating and communicating to win

245
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,740
people over now that was a world that was highly intuitive right it was a

246
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:03,530
world where the first oftentimes we would be looking at bugs and the

247
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:11,600
product still wasn't gonna ship for another year the but I don't think that's

248
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:18,380
I don't think that aspect has changed the if you're still in a test role you

249
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:25,940
also have to be able to communicate and influence others because last I heard

250
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:36,460
unless you're in a unified engineering org you cannot test quality in right so

251
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:42,750
you have to scale yeah I think that influence and leadership part has always

252
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,630
been important and I think it becomes more important as we have fewer testers

253
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,710
or no testers or people just with the testing that that expertise on

254
00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,670
influencing people which segues into the next question which is two questions

255
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,590
I'll read because they're both kind of the same question okay first ones from

256
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,990
Patrick Alexic says I don't know if it was in a previous podcast I don't recall

257
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,950
it unfortunately what arguments did you use to convince developers to do testing

258
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,510
as an activity because faster feedback loop if there's a problem could

259
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:24,830
convince some but not all of them and then after shock 9 who I don't have the

260
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,460
full name in front of me sorry I'm not they asked me these questions anger weasel

261
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,100
a few times on the podcast you have mentioned that part of the quality role

262
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,580
you played at Microsoft Teams was to teach developers how to write good and

263
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,420
useful unit tests and integration tests and lots of other tests I added that

264
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,700
part would you mind exploring what resources books courses that has aided

265
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,560
you in developing the framework and approach you took I was speaking to one

266
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,280
of the devs in my team and he said lots of times they don't know what unit tests

267
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,090
to write I would like to work with them to explore and improve this so the

268
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:02,490
questions are largely around and you can answer this first if you want or you

269
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:09,200
can let me go your call is how do you get developers to write tests and

270
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,840
especially how do you get them to write good tests I see two questions number one

271
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,930
is how do you how do you convince them to start and then once you've convinced

272
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:29,500
them what what are the training resources to get them going running my

273
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:37,720
technique to get them to start was actually rather easy I own the test org

274
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:45,310
you are responsible for the quality of this I will not be using my test

275
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:52,390
resources for writing test cases any longer so I was able to get away with

276
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:59,120
no I'm changing what my team what what I I'm changing the business case for what I

277
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:08,160
use my my team's people for and then all I had to do was was say this is what

278
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,300
I'm doing this is why I'm doing it and much of it is the main reason why we

279
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,900
did this podcast right that I would have a more succinct version of explaining to

280
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:25,840
my peers this is my rationale then I would go through and I said but the type

281
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:33,110
of example we will be there to teach you to fish we just aren't gonna fish for

282
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,150
you anymore so I was able to get away with it because I was when I was going

283
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:44,980
through this I was in a management position and I own the decisions are

284
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,140
why what my resources will do I don't know that that's going to be helpful for

285
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:56,840
many of our I don't think so so I can give a couple stories how I've done it but

286
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:03,090
I'll go back way before teams way back in shoot like 18 years ago working on

287
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,690
Windows CE our dev team decided a big chunk of our dev team decided they were

288
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:12,810
gonna start writing unit tests which is great and I even gave I remember I gave a

289
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,850
talk to the team on how to write unit tests how to get started with our

290
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,820
framework use it for unit tests and it's all going great and that's where I had a

291
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,860
difficult and a very difficult conversation that right after that talk

292
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,980
one was from a developer saying hey if we're writing all these unit tests

293
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,000
what's the test team gonna do and I was able to explain that that's I could

294
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,560
give them context then probably the it easier things that yeah yeah but then the

295
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,520
more difficult question was when a tester came to me and said if devs are writing

296
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,340
unit tests what are we gonna do same answer same answer but a little more a

297
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:54,000
little more stern and strict yeah yeah there was another thing that I did as a

298
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,270
there's another technique I did years ago that are that I recall and it was

299
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:11,390
a the issue was is my test team was slowly but surely getting all of their

300
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:19,430
resources sucked into maintenance costs on the automation because dev wasn't

301
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,030
informing us about these changes before the check-in do you remember those

302
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:31,130
problems I do yeah I do and so I basically laid out a plan for my team and

303
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:42,470
I said hey guys tests will no longer do what did we used to call check-in tests

304
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,190
smoke tests tests will no longer do smoke tests for every check-in for you we

305
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:57,000
will we'll give you a per team for each of my leads will give you eight hours a

306
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:03,870
week you can you can use it as you see fit you need to negotiate but before the

307
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,660
entrance into that is you need to run the smoke test some dev leads did some

308
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:16,060
dead leads didn't but every time a bvt failed or a key test failed I don't know

309
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,920
if this maps to modern times but every time it tests failed I went back and I

310
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:27,520
ran the smoke tests and then I was very public what dev lead guy had you run

311
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,440
this smoke test you wouldn't be dealing with this so I just slowly but surely I

312
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,280
did I did a I need to worry about the scales on my team I want to get back on

313
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,360
the because I wasn't done yet and I'll get back on the right question you're

314
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,810
kind of answering the question now of how do you get them to run tests how do

315
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:50,770
you get them to test before check-in no I want to go back to so let me summarize

316
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,410
the point of that story and then I'll let you go back the point of that

317
00:28:54,410 --> 00:29:03,130
story is that particular dev didn't realize that had he run this the smoke

318
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:10,060
tests himself he wouldn't have gotten into this really messy bvt thing they

319
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:16,660
got really political really fast so I was creating motivation and incentives for

320
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,750
them to buy in all right so not everybody probably very few people in

321
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,150
these days is going to have the leverage you had back then so let me tell a

322
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,190
couple stories about how different techniques I've used to get developers to

323
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:38,550
write tests what I joined actually I'll go back before teams on the the project

324
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,920
that I refer to as stupid science project actually I can go back to see

325
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:46,160
what the story I wanted to tell there and the way I got some of this tangent

326
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:55,680
was when the developers wrote unit tests they wrote really crummy unit tests they

327
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,400
weren't very good tests and at that time I was new enough on my career I didn't

328
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,720
know how to coach them I didn't other than complain I didn't know what to do

329
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,800
I think it's really easy for a less experienced software engineer regardless of

330
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:16,280
discipline to know what to do when you see something you don't like and I see

331
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:23,560
this frequently across in Twitter people I work with regularly people I've worked

332
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,640
with before where they see a problem they don't know what to do that throw

333
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,240
their hands up in the air and that's kind of what I did at the time I knew

334
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,640
the tests were really bad I part of me was thankful they were writing them

335
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,160
but I had other stuff I needed to do so I worked on that when I joined the

336
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,780
science project we didn't have a test team we had a quality team have focused

337
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,620
on data it was stupid it was windows they don't know what they're doing

338
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:57,160
sorry Steve but one very introvert aware technique I used was code reviews I

339
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,160
looked at it I was on the code review alias and the team was big enough I

340
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,120
could look at every check-in and I could start by asking questions like where

341
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,080
are the tests stuff on and what helps and to give some framework what helps and

342
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,920
what helped in Windows CE one thing we did to get the developers write unit

343
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,720
tests and that windows did in a much much better way at the time was make it

344
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:25,280
so dirt simple to write a unit test that it was it was very little tax to

345
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,000
write a test they would type a command line and it would figure a bunch of

346
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,120
stuff out and create the whole framework for unit tests to start writing right

347
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,800
away little command line script and you bam you're writing tests so one

348
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,360
technique is make it so easy for them to write tests you may have to create

349
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,320
a framework one thing I've done a lot over the years is created a dirt simple

350
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,980
to use framework for the team to use to begin to write tests you do have to

351
00:31:52,980 --> 00:32:01,980
eliminate all excuses except for yeah up into test does it for you right so

352
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:07,120
that part was taken care of they had a framework so I'd ask questions like

353
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,320
where are the tests and they go yeah and someone usually you have enough

354
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:15,880
allies someone jump in the yeah these need tests so I asked out for a while and

355
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,840
then after a while I wouldn't need to ask because there was enough people that

356
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,960
had seen me ask that enough people joined the bandwagon that they would

357
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,160
start asking each other hey where are the tests so now we're getting tests in now

358
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:35,720
the tests were kind of crummy way too much complexity odd bizarre asserts

359
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,680
tests that didn't actually test anything tests were if it failed there was no

360
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,680
indication other than a rerunning the test in the debugger to figure out what

361
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:52,120
exactly failed all the test smells that we you and I have seen for years which

362
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,600
even for the most experienced devs what I've learned is 90% of the devs

363
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,640
regardless of experience when they begin to write tests will write really

364
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,560
really bad tests and so I just started asking questions used to experience that

365
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,760
no much less so I think well comes with experience I think these days developers I

366
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,720
work with have been writing tests about as long as they've been writing code but

367
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,360
back then remember that we had a lot of developers at Microsoft and maybe you

368
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,360
still do today who coded for 10 15 20 years without ever writing a single

369
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:30,960
test here I completely agree but here's one of the things that I would

370
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,400
actually say is different between then and now particularly first time I thought

371
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,240
about this in a while but the devs that I work with the sort of the these back

372
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:51,310
then the spirit was no we needed testers because they saved my ass but today that

373
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:57,430
sentence is still true except it's I need my tests because they've saved my

374
00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:02,530
ass yeah so yeah they're definitely better today so I asked questions like

375
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:06,250
and remember people are gonna be at different places so again just via code

376
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:10,610
review I would ask questions about test smells just all the classics wouldn't

377
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,530
have to look at them that closely just all the stuff that I had seen wrong

378
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,210
sometimes just asking what does this do and other people would chime in and

379
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,930
guess what happened just like the last thing eventually enough people would pick

380
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:26,810
up on the things that the test smells they would begin to ask each other

381
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:31,850
questions and then I will continue to look at all the code coming in and a

382
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,130
lot of it have pretty good tests I'd ask I would have to ask fewer questions and

383
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,530
eventually I went through like a week of looking at code and thought these are

384
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:44,320
all pretty good so no resources require just a lot of my experience just

385
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:51,820
looking for test smells a lot of a lot of remote or virtual coaching as well

386
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,020
some one-on-one things walking through some things people were confused it's

387
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,140
taking leadership on teaching the fish asking yeah I'm teaching people to fish

388
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:07,760
and then on teams largely the same when I got there they had written a lot of

389
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,190
tests in the end the dev team wrote all the tests okay 95% of the

390
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:20,000
automate automated tests and their unit tests were actually pretty good they knew

391
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,600
what they were doing they tested one thing they ran quickly they ran

392
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:29,440
exactly as I expect a set of unit tests to run they wrote a bunch of tests with

393
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:39,040
Selenium with protractor and they were crap and again I think writing UI

394
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:46,320
animation is very very very difficult and I hate it necessary sometimes it has

395
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,760
no friggin place in a unit test suite no it was this is not in the unit test

396
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:58,720
suite oh my god they wrote all the tests okay and they made the same mistakes a lot of

397
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,520
junior testers and and maybe even intermediate testers make with writing

398
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,960
UI they try and test too much through the UI they littered sleeps in their codes

399
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,840
to deal with synchronization issues it was just a mess and we slowly cleaned

400
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:20,120
that up it never got great it got better but they also fell into that trap of

401
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:24,440
since I've written this automated test there's no reason I would ever want to

402
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,920
get rid of it or not run it on every single build because I wrote it remember

403
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,120
remember that trap from 15 years ago I think it's interesting to watch people

404
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,400
new to test but not new to development fall into that same trap I am NOT

405
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:46,200
certain that that phenomenon died 15 years ago or even died dying it's

406
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,120
slowly dying way keep the hope alive my friend so that's certain that's true um I

407
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:59,990
know you asked for resources but other than by the time I got to a stage where

408
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:05,310
I was doing coaching of development teams writing tests I have been testing for

409
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:12,960
long enough I was able to do it as a combination of work experience random test

410
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,010
books I had read over the years and pains and tribulations from my life as a

411
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:26,950
software testers so I don't have any I don't have any shortcuts I can think of

412
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:30,510
her or bootstraps other than just leveraging experience and trying things

413
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,110
and experimenting and seeing what works that's getting them to the end like in

414
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:44,600
terms of a bootstrap I but my recommendation is still find a way to

415
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:57,550
just get them started with with TDD right and even even if all you ask them

416
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:08,190
to do is one test per check-in as with a TDD model what you're trying to do is

417
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:15,980
just get them started right don't flood them with if you start truck talking to

418
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:22,460
them and you go through and you and you unwind all the deep technical

419
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:29,180
considerations that you as a two-decade long experience tester has done you're

420
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,350
gonna scare them off you want to because their motivation is there the

421
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,750
right but they also are motivated to not go back and have to fix the code

422
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,480
they just right so just get him I would there's a lot of TDD resources on there

423
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,040
if you can afford it find a local TD expert and bring them in if you can't I

424
00:38:54,040 --> 00:39:02,270
would recommend the dotted objective or dotnet objective guys they travel

425
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:09,310
anywhere they may be outside your price tag but you just want to get them

426
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:18,070
started the next thing you do is is modify your check-in automation and you

427
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:26,880
just need two checks did the sweet pass did this contain a new test yeah one

428
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,700
and one little bit to add that did help I've always said code coverage is a

429
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:38,100
horrible metric but a wonderful tool measuring code coverage on your code is

430
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,300
good and when the one thing I do with development teams I never give them a

431
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,300
goal of number to shoot for I'll say your code coverage is this this say

432
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,340
it's 80% that means 20% of your code doesn't have tests are you okay with that

433
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,140
and they say no we should have a hundred I said a hundred it's really

434
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,060
hard let's what do you think is right and they'll decide on their own goal

435
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,970
which is fine but I'll remind them the goal is not important it's important

436
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:05,510
understand what's not tested but then the piece that helps them with that sorry

437
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,750
you just talked about is this happened on teams without me even suggesting it

438
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:14,950
one of the dev teams followed by more of the dev teams and we've done this on

439
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:20,310
several teams now at Unity as well have added a check-in gate where if the code

440
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:25,870
coverage number drops from the previous build the check-in is rejected because

441
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:32,190
that means that new code was added without tests sure so that helps that

442
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,070
gets people to encourage people like well get a percentage yes so if you if you

443
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:43,680
removed lines of code if you remove lines of code that were tested drop sure right

444
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,920
you could that's the only negative thing on that one it is but I assume the team

445
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,520
the team hasn't taken it that way they figured it's a little bit of a boy

446
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,160
scout rule where they will add oh well I'll add here here's where some tests are

447
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:03,520
missing I'll go add some tests it encourage it actually encourages the right

448
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,680
behavior I love it and there is of course a way to bypass if it really is an

449
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,160
issue but hasn't been an issue yet which is great I like that rule on code

450
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:19,280
coverage what I found is the best thing to do is use it is this is on teaching

451
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,400
the fish teach it as an analysis tool yeah like the first thing I would always

452
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,720
do when I got a good coverage results I would bring in the dev and I would go

453
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,840
for the height high level bits I'm like hey here's a whole class here that

454
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,640
doesn't even have not touched yeah here's a function that's not touch what

455
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,160
does that mean right and I my more of teaching them no for sure to use it

456
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,760
what question wonderful tool a horrible metric there hasn't been a single time

457
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,400
where I've kicked off a code coverage project like first time measure code

458
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,840
coverage had that conversation ask that question about this this class isn't

459
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:02,430
called by any tests oh yeah that's dead code we should remove that yes we should

460
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,310
one last question I want to get to a little bit of overlap these all segue

461
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:14,240
well because I'm a wonderful planner from Sean what are your thoughts on

462
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,760
building out or structuring development teams as first QA person at a small

463
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,160
startup that has no testing specialist do you see a place for hiring a test

464
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,320
specialist to add missing skills to a team any advice on moving the team

465
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:32,800
towards whole team ownership of testing if some might be expecting to push all or

466
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,240
most testing tasks other than unit test this test specialist QA person so to

467
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:47,190
paraphrase the way I hear this is a small startup or a small team doesn't you

468
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,950
on one hand you want to hire someone with some testing expertise to help

469
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,870
bring that to the team but there's also the worry that if you do that they become

470
00:42:54,870 --> 00:43:07,620
the testing bottleneck for the team yeah I was thinking a different B word so if

471
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:14,090
it's a brand new startup and you're the the the first tester there like in that

472
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:21,840
scenario like it is really best for you to to it as part of your interview set

473
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,520
these expectations around what you're what you're going to do when you first

474
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:33,080
arrive your your job if so you're you're coming to a team you're the first

475
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:37,700
tester and because you're the first tester there is one thing that is

476
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:45,080
phenomenal so far with that thing and that is the dysfunctional codependency

477
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:51,080
loop has not started and the first thing I would do is go okay this is how we're

478
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:58,170
gonna make sure it never starts so I can look at two directions one I'm the test

479
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:02,970
person about to be hired onto this team remember I was my official my unofficial

480
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,810
title on teams when I joined was the testing guy they had a team of note they

481
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:11,210
had a large development when I joined about 50 or 60 developers and I was I

482
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,290
was hired to make sure they actually thought about testing a little bit

483
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:20,440
better so but I think you very quickly changed your your pseudo role name title

484
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:26,840
thing yeah to quality guy not testing yeah for sure so if I have this small

485
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,560
company a small team I want to bring in the testing guy I'm bringing in somebody

486
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,320
to help coach testing expertise on the team thinking from the role of

487
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,200
development director or development leader owner or whatever I want I have to look

488
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,360
at it as not bringing in a bottleneck someone to test quality in I want to

489
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,040
highlight efficiency and bring in someone that can help the team get better at

490
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,040
delivering quality software from the other angle if I'm a tester looking to

491
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,550
get started at this company I would definitely ask questions like if I see

492
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:06,510
I'm interviewing some you know ACME startup co and they want me to be their

493
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:11,350
their first tester their only tester I'm definitely gonna ask some questions to

494
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:16,840
make sure that I am NOT hired to be the bottleneck there's a little bit of for

495
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,440
some people I think there's a little bit of ego involved they'd want to be like I

496
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:26,120
want you to dependent and depend entirely on me I will I will do all your testing

497
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,360
for you and validate myself worth anything from shipping but you don't

498
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:34,000
want that I again going back to modern testing we want to be the accelerant

499
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,520
for the team right we want to add business value because we highlight risk

500
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,120
in the appropriate places and we help the team deliver more efficiently and

501
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:46,690
looking at all the different not just functional testing but all the different

502
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:49,610
aspects of quality the team could be working on and making sure they're all

503
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:56,280
on the radar which is a very difficult job but I think I don't know what stuff

504
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,400
I think often what happens unfortunately is I'm this development

505
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,630
director and I have a dev team I need a tester I hire a junior tester to come

506
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:11,110
do a bunch of testing for the team and help me out and and that just sends you

507
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:17,830
spiraling in the wrong direction yeah you do and that can that's a far too

508
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:23,550
common dysfunction of leadership like I one of the things that we started seeing

509
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:29,430
in the last six months people who never grew up in tests joining the slack

510
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:38,400
channel yeah because they're like no this aspect the testing activity and that's

511
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,480
again going that's the thing that I see is shifting is that the industry is

512
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,320
viewing it again more as an activity that has to be done not necessarily by a

513
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,560
particular discipline and they're seeing it more as a systemic problem which I

514
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,160
think is absolutely the right thing so yeah could you a startup created by I'm

515
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,880
thinking about actually a buddy of mine who joined multiple startups with rock

516
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:13,040
star developers right the developer you know is often an inventor or founder of

517
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,720
a concept wrote a bunch of code hired a bunch of people around them and trying

518
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,470
to build a business out of it they may or may not have the business acumen

519
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:29,830
necessary to make that thriver succeed yet yeah right they may not know that the

520
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:34,550
fact that they you know are producing crap build after build is actually going

521
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:40,710
to hurt them I think the specific answer to the question and this is not a

522
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:46,150
great answer but it's because it requires a lot of nuance but in respect

523
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,190
to time yes for any advice on moving the team towards whole team ownership of

524
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:56,590
testing is the person you hire as the testing specialist is not is there to do

525
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:07,160
very little of the testing yes so that's the advice both from the I think to the

526
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,520
tester joining the team as well as the person hiring that testers you hire that

527
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:18,200
person for their expertise not to do all of that task I would do the same

528
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,240
thing of how I was hiring a person someone man I got I got a higher

529
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,160
performance guru I am NOT going to hire him to go around through all the code

530
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:29,440
and tweak it and optimize it I want him he's gonna do a chunk of that it

531
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,680
definitely do some of that but I didn't help the whole team develop that

532
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,480
performance culture that's the same thing I want to do with quality and

533
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:43,650
testing there's so yeah a t-shaped person there on the performance stuff

534
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:48,930
right I would hire somebody that is familiar with the tooling I would want

535
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:53,730
to make sure when with these type of problems that the approach I always start

536
00:48:53,730 --> 00:49:01,310
thinking through is what system or tech can I put into place and then when I say

537
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:11,200
system it could be a process but what can I put into place that will increase

538
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:20,490
friction around this in this case dev doing the wrong thing even without that

539
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:25,840
dev having knowledge of the right thing right the more you can just tell them

540
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,560
what to do in an accurate fashion the better and the more you can automate

541
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,240
telling them what to do even better right if you can if you have something that can

542
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,760
run perf profiling automatically say part of your unit test suite and point out

543
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,840
that there was a regression here and if it can somehow connect up to static

544
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:52,960
analysis tools and tell you why fantastic yeah so we are about out of

545
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,840
time one question not written down that we get a lot is what happens after

546
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,120
modern testing say you've worked yourself you've got your team executing

547
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,320
and the knowledge is all there on the team what happens to you and the answer

548
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:13,920
is about 50 million different things but I've often talked at Unity how my

549
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:22,180
goal has been to work myself out of a role but not a job and I got a little

550
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:28,480
worried because recently I've pretty much worked myself out of a role what does

551
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,760
that mean let's talk about it 98
