00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,820
Welcome to A.B. testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:13,540
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,820
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,980
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,660
Good morning and welcome to the A.B. testing podcast.

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,660
Hello.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,650
Hello.

8
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,610
What I want to do today is take a deep breath and reflect on the last 114 episodes and

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,160
ask yourself why would you come back for more?

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
I'm Alan.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,160
I'm Brent.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,280
We're here for episode 115 of the A.B.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,960
testing podcast.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,080
And it's not like I plan it, but I just like to surprise Brent a little bit.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,080
It's good to see you, man.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
It's been a while.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
It has been a while.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
We have had...

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,520
I'm not even certain we have a good answer to why we need to come back for more.

20
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Because it's like watching a train wreck.

21
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,360
People want to see what's going to happen.

22
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,360
That's probably the best reason I could think of.

23
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,390
Yeah.

24
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,630
So travel, holidays, other stuff.

25
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,750
We did do a show in 2020, right?

26
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,750
We did.

27
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,190
So this is our second of 2020.

28
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,190
It is.

29
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,190
We're a little slow.

30
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,470
We're going to get back on track.

31
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:25,390
I don't have any extensive long traveling trips coming up.

32
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,390
I am.

33
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,210
Of course, no one wants to travel anymore today due to the coronavirus, the virus

34
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,010
you get from drinking Mexican beer.

35
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,010
Right.

36
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,010
Is that right?

37
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,010
That's what I have.

38
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:41,770
I haven't been totally caught up on the details, but I know I didn't have any trips to China,

39
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:43,210
so those aren't canceled.

40
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,170
So anyway, we're back.

41
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,450
We're going to do a podcast and we'll do another one in a couple of weeks as well

42
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,770
and try and get back on track.

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,760
Is that true?

44
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Is that our...

45
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,280
Brent, Brent, rolling your eyes and shaking your head.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,000
The probability is greater than 50%.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,200
After 115 episodes, Brent doesn't quite realize that people who listen to this silly thing

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,720
can't see his face.

49
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,240
Anyway, shall we just...

50
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,120
Anything particularly exciting or interesting to talk about before we get off onto our topics?

51
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm going to Scottsdale, Arizona this weekend.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Going to retire?

53
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
No.

54
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Play golf?

55
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,920
No.

56
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
Watch the Mariners?

57
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,920
Go...

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,360
Did they train there?

59
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,900
I don't know.

60
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,000
Going to do exactly nothing.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,280
And you're going to go all the way to Scottsdale, Arizona to do that?

62
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Yes.

63
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,360
Because you're going to do exactly nothing someplace that's warm.

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
Yes.

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,240
That's exactly what we're excited about.

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,600
I'm going to go be colder next week.

67
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:53,440
It's my yearly pilgrimage to Whistler to try and see if my aging body can still fly down

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,820
a mountain.

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,460
Yeah, it should be fun.

70
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,500
There's a lot of exciting things coming my way, coming up in the near future.

71
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:08,630
I'm apparently doing a presentation to Satya next month.

72
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,990
Share with you and the three.

73
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,870
Oh my God, is my imposter syndrome just proactively triggering.

74
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,870
Excellent.

75
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,430
We're going to talk more about that later.

76
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,950
That would have been a great segue.

77
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,550
It would have.

78
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,070
But that will get you...

79
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,950
That little teaser will get you to come back and listen to the whole podcast.

80
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:34,150
But you also mentioned, obviously I can't talk about it, but yesterday I can talk about

81
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,150
some things.

82
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:49,760
So Microsoft has a whole world crisis team that go through and run humanitarian missions.

83
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,640
You may have heard that we're in the news.

84
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:06,240
We have a plan where we're going to be completely carbon neutral, including retroactively sometime

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,040
in the next few years.

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,960
So there's a humanitarian aspect of Microsoft that is on the rise and growing.

87
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:33,810
But my team, which now has some renown for natural language processing, is within Microsoft,

88
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,930
has been called in to assist on the coronavirus stuff.

89
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:46,460
So I already know, for example, at least one thing the common populace doesn't know.

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,000
Not sharing that here.

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,600
Are we all going to die?

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
No.

93
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,480
Is that thing you can't answer?

94
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Not all of us?

95
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Okay, great.

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
No.

97
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,880
And if you haven't done research, so this is the thing that's very common with this

98
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,200
type of stuff.

99
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:13,670
So coronavirus is, in essence, a worse flu virus.

100
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,790
So flu virus you can die from.

101
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:24,930
Coronavirus, there's a greater likelihood that you can die from, but not significantly

102
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,960
greater.

103
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:34,510
So like Douglas Haddow would say, keep calm, don't panic.

104
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,510
It's not...

105
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,110
You can actually do a lot of harm by panicking.

106
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,110
People want to panic.

107
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,680
They want this to be the one.

108
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,920
The 20th century, the 21st century black plague.

109
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,800
It's not going to be that.

110
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,800
I think the worst thing that's going to happen is a lot of people are going to be inconvenienced

111
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
greatly.

112
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,850
All right.

113
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,850
All right.

114
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:03,850
Shall we start?

115
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,850
Yeah.

116
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,850
Okay.

117
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,210
I have to turn around and see what the topic on the board...

118
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,770
Oh, I should mention, we're in a whole new building.

119
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,170
Brent has moved offices.

120
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,170
Yes.

121
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,930
He's in a secret location.

122
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,010
I can't announce it.

123
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,370
I had to be blindfolded, had a hood over my head, a couple of people walked me out along

124
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,810
to the hallways, and I'm in the middle of a dark room, middle of a building inside of

125
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,890
somewhere at Microsoft.

126
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:33,600
So that's exciting, but let's just hope I get out in time to edit this podcast.

127
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
It actually...

128
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,200
So it's fairly new to me as well.

129
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,640
It took us a good five minutes just to find the conference room because I haven't been

130
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,520
in the building long enough to know these things.

131
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,680
And I was a little late and I thought Brent would be prepared, but I thought wrong because

132
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
I didn't want to.

133
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
I don't know why you would think that.

134
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
There was no reason.

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
There was no reason.

136
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,040
So let's go ahead and segue into the topic you alluded to earlier.

137
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,600
You're presenting to Satya.

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Yep.

139
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,600
And I have presented to Satya.

140
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Well, I've been part of a presentation to Satya, which is way different.

141
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,240
I have also been part of a presentation to Bill Gates, and I have also was around

142
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,680
during the Steve Ballmer area.

143
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
So area?

144
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Steve Ballmer era.

145
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,320
In my time off, I forgot how to speak, but whatever.

146
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,480
One of the three whom I've forgotten asked if we could talk about like what's different?

147
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,380
What was Microsoft like in the Gates, Ballmer and Satya eras?

148
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,560
So that's, I think it's worthy of an opinion.

149
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,320
I have opinions of all three.

150
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,380
I don't know how you want to structure this or start because we started about the same

151
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,380
time at Microsoft.

152
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,300
We both had a significant amount of oh, there has been a significant milestone.

153
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,620
I saw I'm now on an age where significant milestones just make me feel old.

154
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,260
You have no idea.

155
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,940
But last week I hit my 25th year.

156
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
Oh, wow.

157
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Yeah.

158
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
I, where would I be?

159
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,380
If I was still at Microsoft, I was slightly behind you, right?

160
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,380
So I would hit 25 in.

161
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,900
Oh, June, this June.

162
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Yeah.

163
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,690
I actually remember you being slightly ahead of me, but it would have been at Microsoft

164
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,450
since January, 95, but I wasn't full time until June.

165
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,170
So June would have been my 25.

166
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,170
All right.

167
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,420
Then.

168
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Yeah.

169
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,700
So we're very similar.

170
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:40,160
You have less experience now on how the Satya era is progressing, but I don't know.

171
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,160
I guess I'll just start.

172
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,000
Should we stop and go backward or how do you want to do this?

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,260
So here's.

174
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,360
You want to start and I'll jump in with commentary.

175
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah.

176
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,760
So here's how I view and we will have different perspectives and I guess we can just talk

177
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,560
about what we see as a different perspective.

178
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:06,240
The way I see the three CEOs and it was it was interesting that the bomber and the

179
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:15,190
Bill Gates, at least during my career here, was very cleanly separated by decades.

180
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,190
Right.

181
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:25,730
Microsoft, as you may or may not know, started in 1975 in actually Albuquerque, New Mexico.

182
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:26,730
Right.

183
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,050
All well-known facts.

184
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,550
I did not join until 1994.

185
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,990
So there was nearly two decades of Microsoft before I came here.

186
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,030
Yeah.

187
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:42,270
And for context, because we joined about the same time, Microsoft was about 15,000 people

188
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,270
back then.

189
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,430
Probably 94 a little less.

190
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,250
It was 15 when I joined.

191
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,250
Yeah.

192
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,940
My, if you use batch numbers, those aren't sequential.

193
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,380
So I have a five digit batch number.

194
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Mine too.

195
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,500
And I can tell you mine because it's not, it's not, it's invalid.

196
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,580
I still remember my numbers, 39630.

197
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,580
Yeah.

198
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,060
So mine's 5,000 less than yours.

199
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,700
But again, Alan believes they're not sequential.

200
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:14,620
I think at that time they were, but I don't know.

201
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
Don't care.

202
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,140
Not relevant today.

203
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:23,650
Here's how I see as the three different decades.

204
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:30,220
And I don't know if Satya has already been here a decade, but it's coming up on it.

205
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,060
Bill Gates, we were all about growth.

206
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:45,260
And the way I would specify that that decade was sort of the competitive innovation decade.

207
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Right.

208
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,700
We were rapidly growing.

209
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:58,760
The way Bill ran things, he highly encouraged cross team competition.

210
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:09,000
In some regards, that cultural aspect is what led not only James, but I think also you to

211
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
leave the company.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Right.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Because it's competition over customers.

215
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,020
Right.

216
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,540
Competition is more important than the customer.

217
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
Internal competition.

218
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
Everything's about competition.

219
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,860
Internal, but it was the way to build up the abilities to compete for external customers

220
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
was to compete internally.

221
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,020
And that was still around.

222
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:34,060
When I worked on teams to jump ahead, there were at least two or three other groups that

223
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,020
thought they were building a Slack competitor.

224
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,700
Our team just built the one that Satya liked best.

225
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,760
Right.

226
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Right.

227
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:49,840
And while I don't have a lot of visibility, I don't know too many teams that are doing

228
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
it today.

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:57,280
I do believe that they are still likely teams in Microsoft, both believing that they are

230
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,420
going after the same mission.

231
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,910
And that's that as a business strategy, I think that's fine.

232
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,350
It's fine.

233
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:14,110
It's not again, I got burned out on competition being part of the way we built software,

234
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:20,630
even internal within a team due to the way people were reviewed, the way the highly

235
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,110
competitive I must crush you to get up.

236
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,470
It's like this isn't helping people.

237
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:34,950
The incentive model in combination with these, these competitive, again, competitive innovation

238
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:43,030
strategies created a lot in my view, it created a long term cultural issue that actually

239
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,390
still exists today.

240
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:52,130
Not nearly as bad as it did, but still exists and is detrimental today.

241
00:12:52,130 --> 00:13:03,440
New startups that are going into space similar to Microsoft, they have the ability to move

242
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,240
forward in a way because some of the teams within Microsoft are going to be busy stepping

243
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,440
on each other's toes, which will slow us down.

244
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
I'm reminded of a Steven Sinek story.

245
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,920
I believe was in leaders eat last, but I could be wrong.

246
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,600
Ray talks about I'm sure I shared this on the podcast before where he was at a Microsoft

247
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
exec offside.

248
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:33,500
This is in the Balmer era and he saw presentations from execs and 90% of them were about competing

249
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,620
their competitors.

250
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,840
Who are they competing with?

251
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,480
That team, that team, that team, and that company, that company.

252
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,640
Then he went to an Apple and they've changed also.

253
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
They have new CEOs.

254
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:53,360
Went to an Apple exec retreat within the same year and 100% of those customers were what

255
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,800
they were doing for the customer.

256
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:01,200
I think there's something to be said about corporate culture there.

257
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:06,450
Did you ever go to a, were you ever part of a Bill G review?

258
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,490
Not a Bill G review.

259
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:13,250
I mean, I've been in meetings with Bill, but never one of the official Bill G reviews.

260
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:19,090
So I had two, I had two unique experiences with Bill Gates.

261
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,250
One was presenting in a group of test architects.

262
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,870
The original six or seven of us gave a presentation to him on what was going on.

263
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,190
It was state of the art and testing.

264
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,910
And we just made, made stuff up.

265
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,470
But I remember him walking in the room and saying something to the effect of I'm glad

266
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,790
you're here.

267
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:44,910
I pay a ridiculous amount of money to hire testers for my company, but I don't know what

268
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,210
you do.

269
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,530
But after that, he was really nice.

270
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:51,410
He was actually interested in what we had to talk about.

271
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,410
He liked the techniques.

272
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,940
We showed him some model based testing stuff with some visualization and he loved the visual.

273
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,260
He wanted to play with the visualization for a long time, but we didn't let him.

274
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
We moved on.

275
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,500
But anyway, very super mellow friendly.

276
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Yeah.

277
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:16,140
He was in a Bill G business review years later and he got the result he wanted and it was

278
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,980
it was good to watch him work because he was so smart and so quick and he could pick apart

279
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:27,660
anything and he would spot better than anyone I've ever seen where you had, where you were

280
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,790
right and where you were hand waving.

281
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:37,500
And to me, people knew this about him, yet they still fell back on.

282
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:45,220
I mean, just the idea that I would, I was watching a PM on our team get torn apart because he

283
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:54,000
went off script, started talking a little bit hyperbolic and, and he got ripped apart.

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,700
So it was about facts and data and not feelings and about knowing exactly what you're doing

285
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,660
and why you were doing it and backing it up and anything else was just shredded off

286
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:09,400
like meat on a bone.

287
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:20,830
There is a bit of advice that I give people and it's very relevant here.

288
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:30,130
I don't know if it prevails multiple different companies here.

289
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,200
A path of success is visibility.

290
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,640
And it's well known, hey, like for example, I'm doing a presentation to Satya.

291
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,960
I should be super excited.

292
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm going to be visible to Satya.

293
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,200
That's going to grease the wheels for my triple skip promotion next month.

294
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,960
That's I think, I mean, that's hyperbole, but that's kind of how the old school guard

295
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
would view these things.

296
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,760
And I'd say very much the way it's viewed now.

297
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,120
I mean, I've been gone three years, but that was, that was still 100% the case three years

298
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,240
ago.

299
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Go on.

300
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,880
It is not 100% today, but yes, it's still there.

301
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Absolutely.

302
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,600
Like until, until much of the old guard keeping, keeping that old culture alive, retire or otherwise

303
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,360
leave the company.

304
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,520
AKA your last boss.

305
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Yep.

306
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Yep.

307
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,520
I saw that.

308
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Yeah.

309
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
The, it's,

310
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,360
That's going to be, and let me just a quick tangent.

311
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,160
That's going to be interesting to watch.

312
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:48,020
So my old VP is retiring and how shall I put this without being, I don't think anybody

313
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,500
in my old team is educated enough to listen to the podcast except for, except for Dan.

314
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,660
Hey, Dan.

315
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,940
It's going to be interesting politically what happens because that org, but push me over

316
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,540
the top and leaving, that org was built around people.

317
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:09,210
And this is not, you know, I, I, I think teams is doing well.

318
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,610
It's great.

319
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,650
This is not spiteful, but that team, the frustrating part, the biggest frustration

320
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:23,380
for me on that team was a leader who surrounded himself with people who sucked up to him.

321
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:33,110
And that is not my vision of building a good engineering or a good culture on a team.

322
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:40,030
So I wonder what's going to happen with someone coming in to replace him who I know of vaguely

323
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:46,210
it's a way different style, how that's going to work and how fearful some of those people

324
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,270
should be about their continued success in that organization.

325
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,970
Yeah, I don't know who's, I think there's some, and it's weird that you have to

326
00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:00,330
worry in a company like that, like this, that, wherever they are, Microsoft, those political

327
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,730
things, those, those, those bits become very, very important.

328
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,290
But anyway, let's go back to where are we at?

329
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:12,210
Satya, we skipped bomber, but bombers, a whole story we want to get to know.

330
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,450
We're going to get into that one.

331
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:21,850
So the one thing the important in the, the yes, there, there are some things that,

332
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:30,250
Bill Gates era that still persists and it's, it's a negative aspect of the culture in my

333
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,930
humble opinion.

334
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:38,710
And it turns out based off of a report I saw recently of Bill's opinion too.

335
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,600
But he, he's like fine wine, man.

336
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,280
He's mellowed with age.

337
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:52,200
He, he, he, his focus on innovating was critical to this company.

338
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,080
And it was a big part of why our stock.

339
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
1 million percent agree, if that were possible.

340
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,360
So I'll go with a hundred.

341
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,420
Yeah.

342
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,630
Now bomber era.

343
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:21,200
So Bill Gates brought Microsoft to number one on all sorts of bars, including capitalization.

344
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,480
Meaning here we were the most valuable company on the stock market.

345
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,440
Now there's consequences that come with that.

346
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:42,560
And one of my favorite authors, Stephen Blank wrote a bunch of studies on this is that because

347
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:50,060
of the free market, you're pushed to sort of continuously play the king of the hill game.

348
00:20:50,060 --> 00:21:01,110
And once you're the king of the hill, just by design, you end up having to defend your

349
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:07,920
position and that takes up so much energy, innovation stagnates.

350
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:18,740
Now bomber grew up in sales and was beholden to the board.

351
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,990
And we were in number one and the bomber decade was purely around how to defend our

352
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,820
position.

353
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,820
Okay.

354
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:35,190
Now there is a law that I've stated repeatedly on this one.

355
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:47,030
Any time I call it, well, the law that I've coined states, he who is defensive loses always.

356
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:51,880
You cannot win any game being defensive only.

357
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:59,290
And Stephen Blank goes, that's actually the natural thing that happens to large enterprises

358
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,090
that are the king of the hill.

359
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:07,480
And the biggest mistake that they make is they significantly underfund the innovation

360
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,960
in their desperate attempt to defend their sales.

361
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,400
And at that time, there was a lot of confidence as well.

362
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,840
Like I remember having conversations with my manager at the time and like we all knew

363
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:31,320
that Windows had, to build Windows, it had one quadrillion lines of code.

364
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:40,200
No company was going to go from nothing to competition on that overnight, except unless

365
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:50,010
they start working through an agile paradigm and prioritizing building one little incremental

366
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,290
piece of code at a time that satisfies the customer's needs.

367
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,330
Fast forward, Android OS as an example.

368
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,570
So I have an experience, yes, and I fully agree.

369
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,930
And I have an experience that from the bomber area, from one of his, I guess it'd be one

370
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,520
of his skip levels, so his down, it's one of the exact VPs at the time.

371
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,040
I was at some leadership training and he was our guest presenter talking about operating

372
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:23,570
systems and networking, et cetera.

373
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:32,440
I asked, because this is the time when Chrome OS wasn't around, it was thought of, it wasn't

374
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:39,680
really out there, and I asked him if, say, given the amount of knowledge work that is

375
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,340
done in the browser today, do you see any reason for Microsoft to make a lightweight

376
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:55,500
OS that could be used on lower cost computers for browser-based work?

377
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,500
Which I think makes a lot of sense.

378
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:04,500
It's not like Chrome OS has swept the industry or anything, but whether or not I'm not the

379
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,260
marketer that figures out what the next thing is is going to win, but I felt like there

380
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,620
was something there and I was curious about his opinion.

381
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,360
And his answer was literally, but you can't play games on those and on Windows you can

382
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,360
play games.

383
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:22,870
And I think that epitomizes, it's a defense of like, we have something that does this while

384
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,790
we want to do something else.

385
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,510
We have, we've solved that problem.

386
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:30,550
You can do games and use a browser.

387
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:37,790
If I classify the Bill Gates era as sort of competitive innovation, right, bomber era was

388
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,130
competitive sales.

389
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:48,730
We shifted from a growth approach to trying to protect our revenue.

390
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,730
What was the bomber era?

391
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:53,610
Do you recall when he started and stopped so I can frame that in my career?

392
00:24:53,610 --> 00:25:01,240
It was around 10 years and no, I don't.

393
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
It's on Wikipedia.

394
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
All right.

395
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,680
Early 2000s to about 10 years later.

396
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,910
All right.

397
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:15,880
When bombers leadership, for example, Sanofsky used his position as the head of Windows, which

398
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:25,280
was the cash cow at the time or one of them to sort of influence features in other teams.

399
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:33,750
They were driving towards the only thing that matters is protecting Windows sales.

400
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,750
And.

401
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,270
How'd that work out in the long term?

402
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,350
I think time has shown.

403
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:48,500
So the one thing with the bomber eras is that is actually when we were, when the tech era

404
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,300
was strongly shifting between different worlds.

405
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,100
That's the shift to more of a services.

406
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,620
It's the shift to the cloud.

407
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:04,660
I remember watching all that happen and we were slow to adapt as a company.

408
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:10,500
That had been in many ways, not just in software, but in how software was made, engineering

409
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,860
approaches a leader.

410
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,100
We had, you know, I was in the room.

411
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,140
We talked about the S debt title and now we can't get rid of the title.

412
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
I'm very sorry.

413
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,620
Industry with the shift to cloud.

414
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,660
We did not innovate.

415
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,860
We followed for a long time in that area.

416
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,980
There were teams doing, doing real.

417
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,890
There were organizations doing things like blue, green deployments, testing and production

418
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,960
while we were still focusing on building up our environment.

419
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:46,090
Here's the thing that I learned as you know from my, my job history.

420
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:53,860
Bing has already figured it out, but they hadn't figured out a way to generalize it

421
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
to everyone else.

422
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,660
And I remember being, being like, Oh, you're not like us.

423
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,540
Well, we can never learn from you.

424
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,860
We had talks about being in, we had a talk with how agile worked in being being, you're

425
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,860
right.

426
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:12,800
Bing was probably, they might've been right there with the industry if not slightly ahead,

427
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,400
but definitely not as behind as some other orgs were, but that didn't happen.

428
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:24,840
But the thing is Bing, because they were fighting a, not only a losing battle, but

429
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,200
a severely losing battle with Google.

430
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:37,170
And at the same time, we were strongly trying to defend our, our sales.

431
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:43,110
Even if they had the leadership that, that could influence the rest of Microsoft, it

432
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:47,510
wouldn't have happened because all the other motivators were in the wrong direction.

433
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,510
Okay.

434
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:58,510
Satya part of his prior career is guess what organization he once had.

435
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,760
Bing.

436
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,160
Like he was well suited for understanding this new world.

437
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,320
He had already been doing it for almost a decade.

438
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:14,750
And the way I would classify Satya's thing right now is he's gone back to innovation,

439
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,910
but it's collaborative innovation now.

440
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,910
Okay.

441
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,030
That's new in the last three years.

442
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,510
That's new.

443
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:28,310
He's very clear on his messages here, but he's also very clear that there's a lot of

444
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:34,590
work to do to shift that culture internally to be a lot more collaborative.

445
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,090
There's still, for example, my team.

446
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:46,090
I'm doing a lot of work that benefits all of Azure, but I am funded by one specific

447
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,240
team within Azure.

448
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:58,240
My PM is an entirely different organization, an entirely different organization.

449
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,760
We are an example of cross-group collaboration success.

450
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:11,640
However, there's still enough of the old world practice that I am constantly worried,

451
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:20,720
wondering around when am I going to be notified of the reorg that moves my team

452
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,440
into the same organization as that PM.

453
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,120
Thus killing cross-group.

454
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,000
And one of the arguments I'm finding right now is actually me being outside of that

455
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:40,840
group actually strengthens the forward progress because I can ignore their

456
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:45,160
particular politics that may actually slow me down and they can ignore mine.

457
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,400
So it allows us a little bit more adaptability, a little bit more agility.

458
00:29:49,400 --> 00:30:01,300
But we still have budget concerns, so there's still a semblance of competitiveness,

459
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:07,800
but the review has definitely softened on that front.

460
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,070
And yeah, we still have a lot more to do.

461
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:17,910
But the biggest thing in my view is that he's really pushing on innovation on

462
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:19,110
this one.

463
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:27,800
And if you read the news on the Microsoft stock quotes, there are now financial

464
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,480
advisors going with Microsoft motivation.

465
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,080
It's a matter of time before we're number one.

466
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,720
All right.

467
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,480
So I would re-summarize your errors as Bill Gates is drive for innovation.

468
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,440
Steve Ballmer is defend where we are and Stagnate.

469
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,970
And Satya is let's put the bullshit behind us and try and actually win again.

470
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:52,810
Sure.

471
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,490
How does that work?

472
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,530
That works for me.

473
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,770
I had a few reviews of Satya before I left.

474
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:59,650
I was in the room and I talked to him.

475
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:04,890
Very level-headed, very, I believe from my interaction with him,

476
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:07,250
I believe what you're saying.

477
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,770
My frustration definitely with James Whitaker's frustration is how slow the

478
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,320
ship is moving because of the old guard.

479
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,720
Yeah, I completely agree.

480
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,240
And you said win again and I want to tweak that because he is really driving that

481
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,720
and again, it's going slower than I think you and I would want,

482
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,120
but definitely Whitaker would want, but he is pushing towards it.

483
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,390
Whitaker even mentioned it in his last article.

484
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,030
He loved what Satya is doing.

485
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,370
The only complaint, too slow.

486
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:46,320
I mentioned earlier the humanitarian efforts and the carbon stuff.

487
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:52,760
Satya is pushing to have Microsoft win, but also to have the world win.

488
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,040
Yeah, and you look, if Bill Gates is still in charge of the company,

489
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:58,080
he'd be doing the same thing today because that's what he's working on.

490
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,880
Probably would be, I agree.

491
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,960
I think it was more of the young let's go out and make something exciting happen.

492
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,440
And I don't recall if Bill is still the chairman.

493
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:16,550
I think he is, but Bill absolutely has influence over the board.

494
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,590
But he's just not the CEO.

495
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,270
Yep.

496
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,510
And in fact, I didn't go to any of them, but during the bomber area,

497
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:28,170
there were still regular Bill G reviews with teams.

498
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:32,100
He would still come in for reviews frequently.

499
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,500
And that I think was part of their thing.

500
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,540
Like between the two of them, right, they always had the strong partnership

501
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,660
relationship.

502
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,660
He was the...

503
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,140
Yep.

504
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,550
He was always the tech guy, and bomber was sort of the charismatic sales guy.

505
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:57,130
Now, going back to...

506
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,650
So we started this, and I realized I'd never close on this.

507
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,650
So there's advice I give people who try to go and talk to their executive.

508
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:11,830
Like you told the story around PM coming in, and Bill could immediately see

509
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,720
where fact was and where hand weaving was.

510
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,150
When you were building a deck for an executive, the first and foremost thing

511
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:28,200
you should understand is that they cannot scale.

512
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:32,160
They cannot know the details.

513
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:39,280
So they have optimized, and they have practiced, and they have gained skills

514
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:44,120
in entering one question and one question only.

515
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:52,930
And that is, can I blindly trust this guy to lead this mission?

516
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:59,970
So when you're doing a presentation to those folks, your number one goal

517
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:07,070
needs to express confidence that you got this.

518
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:14,140
And different executives will have different bullshitometers,

519
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:20,600
but understand they're using it every single time, because they are accountable

520
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,200
for so many things that you do not understand, and you will often not even

521
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:31,100
get enough time on their schedule to know how...

522
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:36,870
To what degree your aspect of this is important to their mission.

523
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:41,350
Yes, I'm looking up a tweet, because actually Angie...

524
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:41,790
What kind of...

525
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:44,690
I can't find this.

526
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,250
I mentioned this on Twitter.

527
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,770
She had a question on Twitter around...

528
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,850
I'm at the paraphrase, because I can't find the tweet on my phone.

529
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:56,000
She asked about internal presentations versus external presentations,

530
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,840
and what do you do differently?

531
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,280
And I said...

532
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,080
I replied, because I have an opinion.

533
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,680
I have three presentations I give.

534
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,120
External presentations are about entertainment.

535
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,420
Okay.

536
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,860
Internal talks to my team are highly interactive.

537
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,540
I wouldn't do an interactive for a keynote.

538
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,460
It's like, let's get stuff out here.

539
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,740
We'll talk about it, ask questions as they go a lot.

540
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,460
Exec presentation is...

541
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,320
I think I said also for external tell stories entertain.

542
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,880
For execs, also tell stories, but using carefully researched and well-backed up

543
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,370
data and not going off on any tangents.

544
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,650
You have to communicate confidence.

545
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,370
Yes.

546
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,450
That's it.

547
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,450
Yeah.

548
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:46,450
And I tell...

549
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,450
I tell...

550
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,450
Yes.

551
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,650
And then be ready for any question at any time and have a confident answer.

552
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,090
That's not just preparing the presentation for confidence.

553
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,650
It's preparing the...

554
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,840
It's having the background at tip of tongue.

555
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,560
I have a different perspective than that for that question.

556
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,920
Like number one, if you are doing a presentation, the purpose of every presentation is to entertain

557
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,920
your audience.

558
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,210
Right?

559
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:14,050
A lot of people go, no, it's to inform your audience.

560
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,050
No, it's not.

561
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:16,530
It's different between a...

562
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,770
Like my external presentation is more of a...

563
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,720
I'll put it this way.

564
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,320
My presentation to execs is a documentary.

565
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,200
Still entertaining, but full of data and information.

566
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,320
You do it in a way that gets them excited.

567
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Yes.

568
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:38,980
You have to do a different style if it's a right only presentation versus a read-write

569
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
one.

570
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:42,500
And here I mean writing a keynote.

571
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,830
You're right.

572
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,190
You got to be doing all the talking.

573
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,190
It's definitely not my preference.

574
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:54,720
I prefer the give and take with the crowd.

575
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,280
But that doesn't scale at a certain size.

576
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,320
In my view, the difference...

577
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,680
So Alan is better at presenting than I am, but my difference between internal and external

578
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,120
is external.

579
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:22,340
I will scrub corporate IP and then on internal, I basically remove the fluff slides from the

580
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,360
external to give room for interaction.

581
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,720
That's my difference.

582
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,720
Yeah.

583
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
I...

584
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,720
There's not much.

585
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,240
In fact, I may take a couple of the presentations I gave internally at an internal conference

586
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,480
and give the exact same presentation externally.

587
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,560
I have very little corporate IP.

588
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,360
I add some numbers, which I think are public.

589
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,720
Well, we're not a public company, so they're not.

590
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
So I'm doing...

591
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I would have to scrub a little bit.

592
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,760
I'm doing a lot of data science presentations and...

593
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,460
Yeah, just put a bunch of math.

594
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,460
Yeah.

595
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:01,780
So, if you're doing math in a data science presentation, I kind of find that pointless

596
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,340
because you can just say, hey, look, here's a link to Wikipedia.

597
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,540
Go look up the math.

598
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,540
Right?

599
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,500
The data that I would be presenting almost always represents IP.

600
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,200
So I have to be very careful with that.

601
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,650
Understood.

602
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,650
Tell stories.

603
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:20,170
Anyway, are we done?

604
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,650
I'm not that we have time to get to anything else, but I want to make sure...

605
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:30,630
Was there anything else on the Gates-Bomber-Sautia era?

606
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:33,050
Did you ever present anything to Bomber?

607
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:41,660
I had a word once, very simple interaction.

608
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,920
He and I shared an elevator.

609
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,960
And I'm like, he looks familiar.

610
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,800
And I just looked at him and he looked at me like, what are you trying to figure out?

611
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,620
And I'm like, you're Steve, aren't you?

612
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,540
And he said yes.

613
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,540
Excellent.

614
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Excellent.

615
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Have a great day.

616
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
What a dork.

617
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
What a dork.

618
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:09,780
Well, so apparently I had not hidden my body language enough, so he looked at...

619
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:12,580
I mean, he was clearly going, sup.

620
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,350
Yeah.

621
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,990
I just tried to figure out...

622
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,190
Because you look a lot like him.

623
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,270
There's an anecdote from the Bomber era where...

624
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,510
Developers, developers, developers.

625
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,110
Well, that was actually during...

626
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,950
He said that during the Bill G era.

627
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,950
Correct.

628
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:33,470
But during the Bomber era, he did snatch someone's iPhone out of their hand and throw it on

629
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,630
the ground at a company meeting.

630
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,630
Yeah.

631
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,310
And again, defend versus innovate.

632
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,760
It's like, wow, this is taking off.

633
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,680
Maybe we should make a bunch of apps for this.

634
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,160
No.

635
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,160
So...

636
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,160
You'd have to go...

637
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,160
That defense...

638
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,480
So like here, this is one of the things, and this is something that I will state over

639
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,190
and over again, because every now and again, I run into something like this.

640
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,910
Teams that kind of will go, oh, you're duplicating our effort.

641
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:03,910
I'm like, no.

642
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,910
Right.

643
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:10,890
I have developed a great strategy for when I get accused of that.

644
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,330
But let's go back to modern testing principles.

645
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,330
Right.

646
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,730
That actually drives me on this one.

647
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:19,990
And this is, in my view, Bomber did do that.

648
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:23,170
And I think it was a tragic mistake.

649
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:29,930
Like look, Bomber, we had the Windows phone and it was competing with iPhone and we were

650
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,290
at least three years late.

651
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,290
Okay.

652
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,000
Yes and no.

653
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,280
I had a touchscreen phone with Wi-Fi in my hand years before the iPhone came out.

654
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,880
But here's the thing.

655
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:54,630
Even if Bomber was able to, we'll call it, negatively motivate all of Microsoft to go to

656
00:40:54,630 --> 00:41:00,250
Windows Phone, and I don't remember, there was a period early on in his where we would

657
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,630
all get Christmas gifts.

658
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,110
Like we all got a Surface.

659
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,110
I used the...

660
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:05,110
Did we get a phone?

661
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,110
I don't recall.

662
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,110
Yeah, I got phones for years.

663
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,110
Right.

664
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:18,060
And like in terms of the market that we're trying to go into, even if all of Microsoft

665
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:24,620
were users, if they weren't vocal advocates, then all you're going to get is Microsoft

666
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,620
and that is a blip on that market.

667
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,620
Right.

668
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,620
It is small.

669
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,660
It's not even a blip.

670
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,140
A blip.

671
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,140
A blip.

672
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,140
A blip.

673
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:41,060
And that's part of the thing I think was strategically in error, just quite honestly.

674
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,220
And that's the point I was getting at.

675
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,820
I think not looking...

676
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,220
And that's, I think Bomber also epitomized the...

677
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,620
It was all about not invented here during that time especially.

678
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:59,420
It was not just for the internal tools like we've talked about, but we didn't look

679
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:06,020
about how we could, we as Microsoft at the time, could take advantage of and interact

680
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,820
with the changes that were happening.

681
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,300
We talked about web stuff.

682
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,820
The phone growth happened there too.

683
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:20,140
And we saw it through our competitive colored glasses instead of, okay, what...

684
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,140
How do we...

685
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,700
Instead of principle number five.

686
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:24,180
How do we ride the wave?

687
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,260
Like I said, instead of principle number five.

688
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,260
Right.

689
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:34,700
We had phone products and we were doing pretty well with them.

690
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,300
The ones that were all on the WinCEOS.

691
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:43,100
I loved my PDA phone, if you remember those things.

692
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,820
Yes, I do.

693
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,620
But Apple was out innovating us.

694
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,940
When we came out with Zoom, Apple was like, oh yeah, that's pretty neat.

695
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,700
Hey, have you seen our iPhone?

696
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,260
Like we were three years behind and still trying to play...

697
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,260
We didn't quite...

698
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,740
We tried to play catch up.

699
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,740
Yes.

700
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,100
And in those phases, you can't play follow the leader.

701
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,780
You have to play leapfrog.

702
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,780
Right.

703
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,780
Right.

704
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,780
And that's what's missing.

705
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:11,940
It's like, how do you leapfrog instead of follow the leader?

706
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,940
I like that.

707
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:21,840
And the thing is, I actually thinking back, I think a lot of the bomber era in analyzing

708
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:29,720
what happened, what went well, what didn't, helped influence my opinion around the modern

709
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,600
testing principles.

710
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,040
Absolutely.

711
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,280
Because I kept on...

712
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:40,040
By that point in time, I was teaching people how to do agile migrations.

713
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:45,550
And I don't know if you remember this, I'm sure you will once I bring it up.

714
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:50,710
Bomber had division by division sort of talking events with principle level folks.

715
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,390
Oh, I remember those, yes.

716
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:59,070
And I remember that I had already talked to three teams and major teams that go through

717
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,510
this agile transition.

718
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:09,010
When I first heard a bomber stayed out of his mouth, that we needed to shift to agile.

719
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,010
Huh.

720
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,530
Anyway, we got to go.

721
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,530
All right.

722
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:14,720
Yep.

723
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
See ya.

724
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:15,740
Bye.
