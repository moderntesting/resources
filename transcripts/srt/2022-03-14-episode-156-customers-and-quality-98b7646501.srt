00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
If you're not connected to the customer, I'm sorry.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,440
I don't, I don't see how you can defend that you're a customer advocate.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,200
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,960
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,160
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,960
Now on with the show.

7
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,780
Hey everybody.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:29,980
Howdy.

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,940
I'm Alan.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,380
And I'm Brent.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,660
And here we're back to our normal intro.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,860
Well, Brent types while I'm talking yet again, one minute in, I'm

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,100
already pissed off at you, Brent.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,560
That's a record.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:43,960
Yeah.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,360
Well, usually it's no, it's not a record.

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:46,760
It's not.

18
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,120
Unfortunately, it's not a record.

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,000
No, I mean, I lasted that long.

20
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,840
Yeah, of course.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,600
Of course, of course.

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,960
I was, uh, but I was blabbering on a previous incantation of today's podcast.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,240
When I was going to do the whole thing without you, I was talking about how

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,560
mechanical keyboards have made me not type what I'm on meetings, but

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,400
apparently not you, you're just rude.

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,760
How you been, man?

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,200
How you been?

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:08,800
Hey, we are.

29
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,880
It's just the two of us today.

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,600
If you're looking for our guests, I, I'm looking around my, I don't have one here.

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Brent, do you have one there?

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,520
Uh, no.

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,400
Nah, it's just us.

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:17,760
Sorry.

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,160
If you want to, unless, unless you count that.

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,320
Well, Brent has a bottle of wine and I have a beer.

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,520
What is that?

38
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,920
It's a Lucille from Georgetown brewery.

39
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,220
Wasn't that, can you write your song?

40
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,180
Yeah.

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,900
You picked a fine time to drink me Lucille.

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,780
Right.

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,060
This is our first just us podcast of 2022.

44
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,260
Yeah.

45
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,100
I think it is, man.

46
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:46,900
So we're going to have Annemarie back sometime because she was great, but, uh,

47
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,700
here's a secret.

48
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,900
Brent and I talk too much.

49
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,550
He says, Brent and I talk too much.

50
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,390
I yeah.

51
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,750
So let's go, let's go review the transcript.

52
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,550
So here's the deal.

53
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,710
We love to have guests on our podcast, but just to be clear, because some of you

54
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,390
maybe last time was the first one.

55
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,870
You thought, holy crap.

56
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,230
These guys suck at interviewing.

57
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,150
True, true and guilty.

58
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,550
We don't do an interview podcast.

59
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,430
I'm no Tim Ferriss and that's obvious on multiple accounts, but what we do is

60
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,950
it's more like, you know, remember, um, ah, crap.

61
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,670
What's his face?

62
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,910
Michael.

63
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,410
Michael Hunter.

64
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,490
No, no, no, no.

65
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,690
The one that said we sent him like two guys sitting around drinking beer

66
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,690
talking about testing.

67
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,760
Why am I spacing on his name?

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
Alan here with an edit.

69
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,440
I was thinking of Michael Larson.

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,280
Sorry, Michael.

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,240
Uh, I'm impressed that you remembered it was Michael.

72
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,520
I, and I met him and I feel really, really stupid.

73
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,440
But anyway, that's kind of what we do.

74
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,920
We kind of, it's like sitting around talking about testing.

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,600
It's not an interview show.

76
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,880
And if you thought that was rambling us talking too much about random stuff,

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,320
if this is only your second time listening, welcome to AB testing your

78
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,240
home for random crap Brent and Alan talk about.

79
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Yeah.

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:08,880
Yeah.

81
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,320
If you expected someplace else, you probably have selected the

82
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,680
wrong podcast in Spotify.

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,640
Yeah.

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,760
Or whatever your favorite podcast platform is.

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,840
So, um, I don't think it's much new for me.

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,080
I have one quick story to tell.

87
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,560
I went to the office today.

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,840
Brent is in his office.

89
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,320
This is the second time I've gone to the office in the last two years.

90
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,560
There was about five people there.

91
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,920
I got a lot of work done.

92
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,720
It was weird.

93
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,320
I'm going to try and go back more often.

94
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,960
Uh, but wow, it's going to take a while to get used to the world again.

95
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,520
Anything cool.

96
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,480
And where, where, where is your office now?

97
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,040
Bellevue.

98
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,640
Have you ever been there?

99
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,360
Didn't I invite you once for a recording a long time ago?

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,840
I thought you moved out of the Lincoln square south.

101
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,520
Still there.

102
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,150
No, no, no, no, no.

103
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,030
Oh, you're in the old, old one by the old toys.

104
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,230
RS we're literally four blocks from the last off last desk I had at Microsoft.

105
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm one building over.

106
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:05,740
Gotcha.

107
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,620
Gotcha.

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,100
Okay.

109
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,380
Yeah.

110
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,500
So Lincoln square, I have not been into all the non Seattle people.

111
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,540
You can look it up on Google maps if you want, but it doesn't matter.

112
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,580
I went to the office.

113
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,140
It was, uh, interesting.

114
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,620
I might go back again sometime.

115
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,900
I'd love to actually go one day a week eventually.

116
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,300
And like, you know, for a couple hours, just check it out.

117
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,580
It's fun.

118
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:24,780
Yeah.

119
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:33,260
I I've, I've been coming into office for all of the COVID period, except maybe a month.

120
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:33,900
Yeah.

121
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,140
It's interesting, right?

122
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,140
A lot of people.

123
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,420
So Microsoft is now back to stage six where we're fully reopened.

124
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,480
And for people that want to go back.

125
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,080
Yeah.

126
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,520
Let me show you what fully reopened looks like.

127
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,960
Rent is showing me the parking lot.

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,840
And I do see two cars, three cars.

129
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,240
Four cars in the entire parking lot, which you normally I've been to that building.

130
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,200
I, you cannot get a parking spot in.

131
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,320
And what's also interesting is Brent, you have probably been in more, again, more

132
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,640
information that has absolutely zero context for anyone listening.

133
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,880
Isn't this fun?

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,680
How long have you been in studio X?

135
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,140
Four years now, I think.

136
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,540
I don't think in my 22 years at Microsoft, I was never in a single

137
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,860
building for four years ever.

138
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,650
But you've had the same job for four years or five years, right?

139
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,170
No, actually I am.

140
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,690
Wait, did you change jobs?

141
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,570
No.

142
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,530
Um, are you an S debt now?

143
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,010
No, I quickly had the load.

144
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,650
I'm like, S because actually we don't even, so SDE isn't even a title anymore.

145
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,770
It's now SWE.

146
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,610
I have software engineer.

147
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,060
So when you and I last worked together, I am now in the job that I have been in

148
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,460
the longest in my career.

149
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,500
And I think I'm coming up on, oh my God, actually I'm right around it.

150
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,620
I'm either at six or seven years.

151
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Like yeah, this week I'll never, I'll never, and actually given where I'm at

152
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,580
age wise, I will never make that in my life.

153
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:11,780
Why?

154
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,680
Because I've been in this job for the current role I'm in for like six months.

155
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,440
And I don't think I have six years left in me.

156
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:19,970
Oh, really?

157
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,050
Yeah.

158
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,530
So that's one thing I'm jealous of.

159
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,320
Ellen around like he's got like goals and plans for after work.

160
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,340
Like to me, it's just like, Nope.

161
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,020
I surround myself by a bunch of 20 year olds and I kind of pick, pick up the

162
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,020
same sort of like, Oh, we're all going to live forever.

163
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,100
And to be fair, I'm not, I'm not, I don't have dreams of sitting around all

164
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,060
day doing nothing.

165
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,060
I think I will never stop working.

166
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,180
I may stop working as much.

167
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,020
I may probably go into some sort of consulting some place where I can

168
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,020
really, really make people angry.

169
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:56,780
Yeah.

170
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,700
So speaking of making people angry.

171
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,300
Yes.

172
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,460
Nice, nice segue.

173
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,460
Thank you.

174
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:02,820
Thank you.

175
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,780
Let's talk about, um, you might've heard about him before the modern

176
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,180
testing principles.

177
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,620
Yay.

178
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,020
And this is not the first time we've talked about this.

179
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,420
Or boo.

180
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:13,860
Yeah.

181
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,300
So wait a minute.

182
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
They're not modern.

183
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,470
Hey, they're not about testing.

184
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah, we know we're dumb.

185
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,590
Uh, also I remember Brent and I putting these together and trying to think, uh,

186
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,830
and again, this is for a lot of people, this is old information.

187
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,310
We'll just assume you haven't heard the podcast before for a second, even

188
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,190
though there's only three listeners and we know you all, so whatever bear with me.

189
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,630
We weren't trying to invent anything.

190
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,990
And to be very clear, I bring this up every time I talk about them,

191
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,150
we didn't invent anything.

192
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:48,590
We were looking at what was happening to software teams and the testers

193
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,710
in the industry going back seven years.

194
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,750
And we thought, man, this isn't going to be confusing for people.

195
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,950
Let's, uh, well, our attempt was let's talk about what's going on.

196
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,070
So it's less confusing.

197
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,070
And then sometimes that happens and sometimes we make people more confused,

198
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,950
but it gets them talking, right?

199
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,950
And when people, when people complain about the principles and say we're dumb

200
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:13,190
and we're full of crap and we're, and we're, um, other words, we welcome you

201
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,910
to the conversation because, you know, we don't claim to be right.

202
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,630
We don't, we don't, we will debate and discuss and give you context on where

203
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,020
we came from, but then again, people come up to us all the time and say, yeah,

204
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,620
this is, this is what we're seeing.

205
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,780
Thanks for putting a name for it.

206
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,620
So there's that too.

207
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,940
So, uh, way back in my context aside, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

208
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,220
When we wrote them down, we, number seven, the team paraphrasing, you may get

209
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,900
to a stage where the team does no longer needs a dedicated testing professional.

210
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,820
We thought that was going to be the one that was going to be the one people

211
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,820
were going to pin us up on a wall about some sort of threats, whatever, but no.

212
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,140
Oh my God.

213
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,300
But no traders, no people, people read that and they go, and this wild, they

214
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,820
go, there may not be need for testers anymore.

215
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:08,650
No, that's not as bad as saying that I don't evaluate quality.

216
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,090
What's this the customer?

217
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,130
So principle number five says, I should probably read it.

218
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,890
Uh, only that I should probably read it and I'm not, cause I don't have it in front of me.

219
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:17,850
I'll read it for you.

220
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,250
I have it.

221
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,490
Oh, Hey, Brent, please participate in the podcast and read me principle

222
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,730
number five, and then we can talk about it.

223
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:23,930
Oh, thank you.

224
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,970
Uh, what a delightful and warm welcome.

225
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,810
I appreciate that.

226
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,090
I am going to barf and then my beer is not going to taste as good.

227
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:33,210
Uh, the barf on your beer.

228
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:40,810
Um, we believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate

229
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:42,570
the quality of our product.

230
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,170
I absolutely believe that.

231
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,330
And I stand by that principle, but, um, as do I, yeah, but, uh, had some

232
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:55,610
feedback this week that it's cringe worthy at least, and I stand by it.

233
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,450
I mean, there is, I had a nice conversation with the author.

234
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,650
I'm not going to name names here or even the poster or the Twitter threat.

235
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,050
Because I think it's actually a really good point.

236
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,710
They may like, if you're, if you're viewing the principles as a tester and

237
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,750
those are principles of what testers do, which they're not.

238
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,030
And again, goes back to our dumb naming of the thing.

239
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,350
And here, here's a fly on the wall when modern testing came about.

240
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,910
We're trying to come up with, talk about the big dedicated test teams

241
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,070
and how they test quality.

242
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,150
And like Brett and I spent a first trick of our career and we

243
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,510
call that last traditional testing.

244
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,230
So we, but what we want to talk about is holy crap.

245
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,390
Um, what is, what's the thing that's not traditional, but it's a new,

246
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,270
we'll call it modern testing and it's stuck and it's wrong, but it's,

247
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,310
but it's what we called it.

248
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,030
Well, I don't have a problem with the name.

249
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,070
The problem, the problem comes from leading people to think they're about

250
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,830
testing and looking at it, they get the wrong lens to look at them from.

251
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,270
This is around, this is around delivering quality software to customers.

252
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay.

253
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,910
So it depends on if you think of testing.

254
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:07,110
So I stand by these are more modern testing principles, which means testing

255
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,390
in that phrase is an adjective, not a noun.

256
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,380
What are the testing principles that are modern?

257
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,060
Okay.

258
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,700
And I would say this, this is our stab at that.

259
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:20,620
I get it.

260
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:20,860
I get it.

261
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,500
So what's interesting, this one is, and again, we welcome the feedback.

262
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,060
I'm not, and by no means, if the person who posts this thing, we're not mocking you.

263
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,940
I want to bring this up.

264
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,740
Cause if you're worried about this one, you're not the first and you not even

265
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,620
the third or the 10th, and you will not be the last person to, to question

266
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,220
this one and go, Hey, wait a minute.

267
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,660
If only, and I'll ask you this Brent, this, this goes back.

268
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,660
Is it episode 56 where we actually role-played the traditional test manager

269
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,020
and the modern test manager?

270
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,060
It's in the 50s somewhere.

271
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,140
58, 56.

272
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,140
I want to, I want to say it was 57.

273
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,260
Could be there too.

274
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,260
But let me ask you this, Brent.

275
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,100
Yes.

276
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,420
Only the customer can evaluate quality.

277
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,820
Then as a tester on my team, what am I doing?

278
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,120
You're evaluating risk.

279
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,120
So what's the difference between again, this is dumb, brisk and quality.

280
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,320
Will I evaluate risk risk to what?

281
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,780
To the risk to quality.

282
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,260
Ha.

283
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,180
Oh, it wasn't.

284
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,940
No, no, no.

285
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,820
Brent, it wasn't 57 to answer your question.

286
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,100
Which question?

287
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,060
What episode?

288
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,660
What, what was it?

289
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,900
My question was, oh my God.

290
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,580
No, you are incapable of multithreading.

291
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,340
It is 67.

292
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,260
67 was the debate.

293
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:40,820
Okay.

294
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,700
So go back way, way back to 67.

295
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:43,980
Great.

296
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,340
So I'm going to ask you, so as a tester, I, I'm looking at risk, but it's, I'm

297
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,940
like, I said it tongue in cheek, but it's true.

298
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm evaluating risk of quality.

299
00:12:52,820 --> 00:13:00,540
I am trying to make sure I'm doing my best to make sure that I am looking at

300
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,920
the software from the eyes of the customer and ensuring that do not, I

301
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,800
don't ensure anything.

302
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,960
I don't assure quality.

303
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,840
I know that, but what I do is I examine the product to learn information

304
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:20,600
about it and evaluate what the customer's experience will be and what kind

305
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,520
of quality they'll have and give that feedback to my stakeholders.

306
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,720
So we make good decisions about delivering a quality product.

307
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,420
Barf.

308
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:28,700
Sure.

309
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,340
Okay.

310
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:36,700
Again, a little, I mean, I think the barf is because Brent and I look at software

311
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,140
delivery and software quality as it, it's a team role that if you, and you can

312
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,100
have a tester on the team, but that's not what they do.

313
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,340
They're helping the team on evaluate risk, which is right.

314
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,420
But what we're saying is it is so easy to build the wrong product and you can't

315
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,940
build a high quality product.

316
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,500
You can call it the engineering is good quality.

317
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,260
We can say we've evaluated our engineering practices.

318
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,900
We found lots of bugs that customers don't care about, but if it doesn't

319
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,860
provide any value for our customer and go back to Weinberg's definition,

320
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,940
quality is valued to some person.

321
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,180
If it doesn't give them, if it doesn't give that customer value, it is

322
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,980
by definition, not quality.

323
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,300
Correct.

324
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,900
Correct.

325
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,520
I actually think in principle five, there are two, two things that, uh,

326
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,400
like we've, I don't know how long have we talked about modern testing

327
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,680
principles three, four years now.

328
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,480
I don't know.

329
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,400
The term probably came up four or five years ago.

330
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:42,690
Can't, it doesn't matter a long time in my years, a long time, 67

331
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,670
episode 67 was September 2017.

332
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:48,360
Okay.

333
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,760
So coming up on that long, cause that wasn't the first time we talked about it.

334
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,760
That wasn't where we coined the term.

335
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,020
Modern testing principles happen later.

336
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,620
Yeah.

337
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,220
But we didn't coin it for that conversation.

338
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,980
Anyway, go on.

339
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,940
No, no.

340
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,780
So two things.

341
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,900
Number one.

342
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,180
Uh, yeah, it's interesting.

343
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,180
Like even back then we were saying this is old and, and in conversations

344
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,740
that we've had in the podcast recently, right?

345
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:14,980
Yeah.

346
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,500
Your, your discussions around post-modern.

347
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,180
Yeah.

348
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,380
Yeah.

349
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,260
Yeah.

350
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:19,660
Right.

351
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,780
And that's just rephrasing those.

352
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,620
So it sounds even less like the tester saying them, but right.

353
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,140
Also we were seeing just for more context.

354
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,780
One of the reasons we talked about this is we saw teams who were getting rid of their

355
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,660
testers and failing miserably because they didn't think they didn't have a plan on

356
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,820
how to achieve quality without dedicated testers.

357
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,860
So once I talk about that situation as well.

358
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,940
Anyway, go on.

359
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,460
I think the two things that, so in that time I've been looking at, okay, what

360
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,820
are the patterns, what, what's causing people to, to have a negative reaction?

361
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,460
Okay.

362
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,350
Uh, and I'll say there's, in my view, there's sort of three things that, that

363
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,110
pop out of that one number one.

364
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:07,310
And I'm going to go in, in probably what I view is the, the least impactful order.

365
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,510
So the one I see is the least impactful is sort of the semantic discussion

366
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,910
around what the hell a customer is.

367
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,910
Or what the hell, I mean, I would say equally as much semantic

368
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,350
discussion about what quality is, which is what I think Weinberg's is the one

369
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,230
used most among the testing community.

370
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,150
There's plenty of definitions, but for that one, I think principle five is 100%

371
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,820
supported, but anyway, go on.

372
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,340
Don't my number two was the semantic discussion around quality inside your head,

373
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:37,700
Brent.

374
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,460
Yep.

375
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:43,420
The, the, that's number two, the, and here, I don't know what you do in your

376
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,700
stage presence, but whenever I talk about this, I proactively bring up a

377
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,740
distinction between quality and code, correct.

378
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:52,820
Yes.

379
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:53,420
Right.

380
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,460
And a lot of people read this will, will interpret quality as a synonym for bugs.

381
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,420
And then, and then they have a negative reaction.

382
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,340
Oh my God.

383
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,060
If I'm not, if I, if I test something, I'm a good test, test something for a

384
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,900
while and there's no bugs, I would say this is probably pretty good quality, but

385
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,460
I don't know if it solves the problem for the, but it's code correctness still.

386
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:14,770
Anyway, no way.

387
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,490
But, but when you, when you think of the word quality as a synonym for bugs, then

388
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,490
you could very easily interpret number five, right?

389
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,610
I'll just restate it.

390
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,970
We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and evaluate

391
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,690
the bugs in our product, right?

392
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,410
Doesn't that sound like, Oh, we're saying all of these things, like

393
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,170
the customer should test for you.

394
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:39,690
Right.

395
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,450
And, and

396
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:44,610
yeah, but that's one misinterpretation.

397
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,370
I think that's the second most common one.

398
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,490
The third one, the one I don't know in terms of frequency, but I think this

399
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:58,940
is the one that raises the most heat is because this is this, I think about

400
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:06,170
an old slide deck from actually Alan on this, where he talks about what

401
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,570
test believes they are, right?

402
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,610
The champions of quality.

403
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,130
Oh yeah.

404
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,730
I almost pulled out that slide.

405
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,050
Yeah.

406
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:20,240
There's this identity within test around that they are the great

407
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,120
defenders of the customer.

408
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:22,880
Yeah.

409
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,440
Yeah.

410
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,440
Um, people have said this is bullshit because QA is the voice of the customer.

411
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,040
Right.

412
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,240
And then it's, it's interesting.

413
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,600
So you and I talked about this, I did one of the blog posts

414
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,450
that a long time ago, right?

415
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,810
Um, it was, it's titled test.

416
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,850
Doesn't understand the customer.

417
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:44,690
Yeah, they don't.

418
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,690
And I know I just, I just made a bunch of people mad.

419
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,290
Oh, actually the people listen to the podcast aren't mad.

420
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,090
They have the people are right.

421
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,490
The biggest problem.

422
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,050
And when I, I'll let the listeners go and find it or we can post it in the notes.

423
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,050
I mean, that's right.

424
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,770
That's, and again, let me just put an interlude there because this is not

425
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,590
really, this is, I mean, it's where, cause quality is in the, the

426
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:17,150
hands of the beholder from my perspective, um, or from its easy to see a perspective.

427
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,430
This is not a quality podcast.

428
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,470
Cause I forget to put stuff in the notes all the time.

429
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,230
All kinds of things go wrong with the production of this podcast.

430
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,310
Yet some people find it valuable.

431
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,430
Does that mean it's a quality podcast or it's not?

432
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,670
It depends for some customers, there is value and some there is not.

433
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:36,630
So for some, that's exactly it.

434
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,190
For some there is value.

435
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,990
And, and exactly some, there isn't.

436
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:46,030
And, um, the nice thing, like I think about your specific example, the nice

437
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:52,150
thing about the community of the three is they step up and fill the gaps.

438
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:52,830
Yeah.

439
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:56,910
And, and, and I do want to point out, I think back to your semantic argument,

440
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,070
then I'm going to get let's step out of the way for you to keep your,

441
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,950
keep on your role here.

442
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:07,260
But the quality one to me is I think that's the word that angers people

443
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,500
because they don't, they think of quality as, I don't want to put my thoughts

444
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,260
in their head, but they see that they don't think of value to the customer.

445
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,620
They're thinking about, like you said, code correctness or engineering

446
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,740
quality or all the things that testers are really good at finding before

447
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,620
things go to production, those obvious bugs, those, even those edge case bugs.

448
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,020
But in the case of edge case bugs, I was at a conference once and there

449
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,420
was a tester there who was super happy because he played with some

450
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,100
onscreen display next to a conference room for literally hours and hours and

451
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,940
hours and found, and then got it to exhibit a bug.

452
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,420
We're super proud that the thing was broken.

453
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,340
It was low quality, but, uh, in the end, was it?

454
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,260
Cause it was useful until he really, really tried to screw it up.

455
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,860
And I think maybe I'm off too much on a tangent here.

456
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,380
Those edge cases may not matter to most customers.

457
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,220
Like how many customers, how many times have you found a bug?

458
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,620
This is good.

459
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,860
I'm all over the map here.

460
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,620
Well, a customer would never do that.

461
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,220
And we go, ha, they would too.

462
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,620
But today we use principle number six because we use data to determine if

463
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,420
a customer would actually see that or not.

464
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,620
And in the case of this one, I'm thinking of from the conference.

465
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,100
No, it's not, it's probably the only time it had ever been triggered.

466
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,220
It wasn't a risk to quality.

467
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,460
Anyway, go on.

468
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,740
I'm going to stop babbling for a minute.

469
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:22,980
Go ahead.

470
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,740
No, no, no.

471
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,340
I mean, you're absolutely right.

472
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:30,860
Like the defenders, I was, I was reffing off of sort of the defenders

473
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,420
of quality and people can go back and read my story.

474
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,700
Uh, where I came to the conclusion where I actually had a mentor talk to them.

475
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:46,600
And I'm like, Hey, why do you think it's very rare where the leader from the

476
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,960
test organization becomes the leader for the multidiscipline organization?

477
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,680
Right.

478
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,560
The, the title we used to use was POM, a product unit manager.

479
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,600
And that, that mentor was like, Oh, that's probably one of the

480
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,920
easiest questions, uh, I could answer.

481
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,040
And he just simply stated because the test isn't the customer or the

482
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,840
test does not understand the customer.

483
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:19,620
Now I had been a multi-year multi-year, uh, manager by that time, but not decade.

484
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,900
I might've been a decade by then.

485
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,700
God, I'm old.

486
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:31,230
Um, anyway, the, and I'm like, what total bullshit, right?

487
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,710
Cause I was very much in the mode that you talk about in your slide where I'm

488
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,270
like, I am the goddamn defender of the customer.

489
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,550
I prevent harm to the customer.

490
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,300
But what he said is like, Oh, well, test test, test doesn't understand the customer.

491
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,760
And I sat back and I'm like, it was getting immediately ready to, to push

492
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,920
back and call him on his bullshit.

493
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:06,180
And I realized I couldn't because I didn't understand the customer.

494
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,260
My understanding was a series of requirements.

495
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,740
My understanding was a series of theories.

496
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,220
We did not have any understanding around.

497
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,260
Okay.

498
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,100
What's the customer going to do with the product?

499
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,100
What are their goals?

500
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,540
What, what's, what did they need to achieve?

501
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:29,460
How does this thing, like you talk about Weinberg, I, and I've brought it up here

502
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,650
before, um, like one of my favorite quotes from the pop and dikes where Tom

503
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:43,410
Popendike is said, says a lot of software engineering teams failed to understand

504
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:50,250
that no customer ever in the history of the planet has ever wanted software.

505
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,020
What they want is their problems to go away.

506
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:04,640
And so if, if you're in test and if you are not, and you do not have a non-theoretical

507
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:14,080
engagement with the customer, and if we define quality as the ability, either a

508
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,720
value proposition to someone or, or the ability to make problems go away.

509
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,260
If you're not connected to the customer, I'm sorry.

510
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,180
I don't, I don't see how you can defend that you're a customer advocate.

511
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,060
It's an attempt to be a proxy and the intent is right, but it doesn't actually.

512
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,460
It doesn't make it true.

513
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,020
It doesn't make it true.

514
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,100
And what you said is also why that principle of neuro six is so important.

515
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,260
Why we think you have to be able to look at that data to help

516
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,580
you understand the customer.

517
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,660
And again, without that, even if you're not looking, if you are using the data

518
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,540
to help understand the customer, you can get closer at least, but

519
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,500
you're still not the customer.

520
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,620
There is another definition of quality.

521
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:01,250
I want to bring up a Philip Crosby in a book called quality is free.

522
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,250
Said that quality is conformance to requirements.

523
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,340
So if I were to take, let me, let me come back on that.

524
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,900
Cause I don't believe, I believe that statement is right with two more words.

525
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,260
Maybe one more phrase, a few more words.

526
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,880
Uh, but if quality is just conformance to requirements, if there are

527
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,800
requirements developed by a product team given to a development team to implement.

528
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,240
And as a tester, I verify those requirements have been fulfilled.

529
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,800
Have I built a quality product and don't answer.

530
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,840
I think the answer is no.

531
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,440
And hopefully the answer is no.

532
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,920
I built the product that works as planned.

533
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,840
But again, the caveat I put on Crosby's definition is, is I believe that I

534
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,800
actually believe that quality is conformance to requirements, but also

535
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,880
that only the customer can define those requirements.

536
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,520
I like, I'm trying to think through where we, Oh, I like how we talk about it in

537
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,040
number six, right?

538
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,640
Where we say we use that extensively.

539
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:05,040
The second half of number six, we use that extensively, deeply, deeply

540
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:10,040
understand the customer usage and then close the gaps between product

541
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:17,000
hypotheses and business impact requirements are nothing more than

542
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,720
hypotheses and you can, and I am a data scientist now.

543
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:31,040
I can tell you in the last year, I have run through multiple experiments and, uh,

544
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:37,280
I can guess, I, I don't even, and my brain just got stuck because I'm trying

545
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,560
to guess how many times.

546
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,920
I'll just say it this way.

547
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,560
The dominant experience when you go through that, at least for me in the last

548
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,440
year is these hypotheses are almost always fail, right?

549
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,870
And it's an eye opening when you go, wow, 15 years ago, these would have been

550
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,150
requirements we would have implemented them.

551
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:08,430
Whereas right now I'm going through and I'm doing hypothesis tests and I'm like,

552
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,390
Oh, that one failed.

553
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,350
Oh, that one failed.

554
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,350
Oh, yay.

555
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,270
That one worked.

556
00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:13,910
Oh no, that one failed.

557
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,670
That one failed.

558
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,180
It's, it's a different world.

559
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:24,260
And for me, like no one's ever going to, to get me to based on my recent

560
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:29,460
experience, no one's ever going to get me to back off on principle number five.

561
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,370
At least from the perspective in which I interpret it.

562
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,410
I, again, I want to reiterate, I love the controversy.

563
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:41,850
And I had a conversation with the person who brought this up on Twitter and, and

564
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,250
they get it now within context and they understand where we're coming from.

565
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,450
And the fact that it's not obvious at first is fine with me.

566
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,730
Uh, but it's interesting to see people.

567
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,520
Our goal.

568
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,040
It was quite, it creates a very interesting debate and I didn't jump in because

569
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,480
there's people on that thread who I find are toxic to the community who

570
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,640
I refuse to engage with.

571
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,400
But, uh, so I did not engage in the thread.

572
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,040
I talked to the person personally and had a nice cordial conversation and

573
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,680
tried to just show them where we were coming from and it was great, but

574
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:15,240
there's a good debate on both sides.

575
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,640
People supporting us, people saying, Oh my God, they're all cringe worthy.

576
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,120
How can testing improve the business?

577
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,800
That's not our job.

578
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,180
Yeah.

579
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:30,470
That one, that one I didn't, I, I didn't quite understand the point.

580
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,630
I read the threads as well.

581
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:38,450
I'm like, the goal of what we're trying to do here and we have done it.

582
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,610
And it's, it, to me, it's somewhat even fascinating that even as recent as

583
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,010
yesterday, like it's still doing this.

584
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:50,490
The goal is to construct a conversation.

585
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:50,770
Yep.

586
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,810
Well, welcome to the conversation that we like to say.

587
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:58,610
Hey, I want to, I want to, uh, sorry, but hopefully not a polarizing one.

588
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,490
I don't feel this one.

589
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,650
No, I, I, I liked the conversation.

590
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,930
I love that people tell us we're full of crap, um, because sometimes we are,

591
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:10,450
but it also makes us think about, well, what is wrong with this?

592
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,370
Should we reward it?

593
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:14,290
Should we, should we add more context?

594
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:14,890
And it's tough.

595
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:18,890
One comment in there, I remember who made it up because I'm not saying names

596
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,410
here, but it was really cool.

597
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:26,050
He said, someone said something to the gist of Deming would hate all of these.

598
00:29:26,650 --> 00:29:30,320
And I thought, huh, I used to read Deming.

599
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,080
Deming is famous for total quality management.

600
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,660
I want to talk a little bit about Deming's 14 points on quality management in

601
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,420
relation to the modern testing principles.

602
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,020
And I don't know if you've read these before.

603
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:47,300
I'm going to give you, I'm not going to go through all 14, but I am going to,

604
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,380
uh, give you a couple.

605
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:53,260
And then I want you to tell me if I want your reaction to these in

606
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,620
the context of modern testing.

607
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:55,780
Okay.

608
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,740
I'm just going to go, should I go in order for the ones I care about?

609
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,700
Let me try this one.

610
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,900
I'm not going to go in order.

611
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,660
Break down barriers between staff areas.

612
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,160
We're all about getting everyone together.

613
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,680
It's about a quality culture.

614
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,760
Yeah, we're breaking.

615
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,560
That is the modern principles are all about breaking down barriers

616
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,520
between stories.

617
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,520
Now, one, one thing.

618
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,000
So I didn't see that comment.

619
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,720
Do you think they were serious or do you think they

620
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,920
might've been tongue in cheek?

621
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,440
I don't know, but man, I want to talk about these because we've

622
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,880
ever talked about Deming and modern testing principles for, let me,

623
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,000
and you can just recall back.

624
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,840
I said this earlier, why we first started the podcast and talk about these things.

625
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,040
One of the things in Deming's 14 points on quality management is drive out fear.

626
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,430
Yep.

627
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:47,390
Right.

628
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:56,680
Which, which is why principle number seven is kind of written the way it is.

629
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,680
I don't think we fully succeeded in that one.

630
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,640
Like that one is the one that does scare a lot of people, but we tried to soften

631
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,680
it to sort of guide like what you need to do, but yeah, I don't know.

632
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:09,960
Yeah.

633
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,640
Can you read the first six words of principle number three?

634
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,960
We are a force for continuous improvement.

635
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,320
Okay.

636
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,080
Let me, let me read you number 13 from Deming's 14 points on quality Institute,

637
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,760
a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for everyone.

638
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,640
I'm looking at a different version of it and maybe they've collapsed it,

639
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,240
but the one I'm looking at says improve constantly and forever.

640
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,680
Okay.

641
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:43,440
You know, I don't claim to be a Deming by any means, but I would say also,

642
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,160
it's worth calling out that Brent and I did not make these in a vacuum.

643
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:51,400
We just didn't sit in a room one day and decide these are the modern testing

644
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,960
principles that will drive the world.

645
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,840
These are a description of what was going on based on what we were seeing based on

646
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,760
our study of Eric Reese and the lean startup and that method of movement highly

647
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,880
on this lean principles in general.

648
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,480
A lot of it comes from there, but it's interesting.

649
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:14,400
The, uh, this, I don't, I think Deming would be supportive is my hypothesis.

650
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,000
I don't, I don't.

651
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,670
And maybe that person was tongue in cheek, but it made me look it up and it

652
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,110
made me think about it and start this conversation.

653
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,550
So no matter what, thank you.

654
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,110
So let me read you one of them that I'm seeing.

655
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:26,790
Okay.

656
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,870
It, so I'll just summarize.

657
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,790
I'll just go through them.

658
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,510
Number one, create a constant purpose towards improvement.

659
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:34,950
Yep.

660
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:35,750
Yep.

661
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:35,910
Yeah.

662
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:36,390
I care about that.

663
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:36,710
All right.

664
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,150
Adopt testing.

665
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,230
Well, wait.

666
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,910
So he's got another one called adopt the new philosophy.

667
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:43,470
Okay.

668
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,670
But this, the sub bullet underneath that is embrace quality

669
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,510
throughout the organization.

670
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,110
You mean like having a quality culture?

671
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:51,870
Yeah.

672
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,270
Okay.

673
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,750
Let's check in.

674
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,510
Okay.

675
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:57,390
And put another sub bullet under the new philosophy.

676
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:00,230
Put your customer needs first.

677
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:00,750
Huh?

678
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:02,190
Interesting.

679
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:02,870
Huh?

680
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,950
I could, well right there, I could see why Deming would wait.

681
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,910
No, they may can't.

682
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:13,230
Number three, stop depending on inspections.

683
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:13,950
Yeah.

684
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:14,710
Huh.

685
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:17,870
Inspection.

686
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,030
Maybe we can't test quality in anymore.

687
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,150
Oh, no, no.

688
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,070
This is like the summary here.

689
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,790
Oh, I'm going to read all of these.

690
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,670
I'm going to stop the paint inspections are costly and unreliable.

691
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,070
They don't improve quality.

692
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,430
They merely find the lack of it.

693
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:40,450
Build quality into the process from start to finish.

694
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,970
Well, this goes back to the fight that, that I'll call it

695
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,930
faux argument against principle one, like testers don't improve the business

696
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,370
or testing doesn't improve.

697
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,010
They say testers, well, they should.

698
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,210
And testing does improve the business.

699
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,210
The, so what they're saying in, in there's someone else, I'm forgetting

700
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:59,290
their name that has the same sort of point.

701
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,690
Oh, um, we talked about it with the, with the podcast with Al

702
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:10,170
Shalloway, the, the system, the systems theory guy, removing bugs.

703
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,070
Does not add quality.

704
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,040
Removing bugs does not add quality.

705
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,800
You're making some enemies now, man.

706
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,920
No, I'm just saying.

707
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,960
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, we're going to get mail.

708
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,640
No, we don't get mail.

709
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,600
We're going to get tweets.

710
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,120
Who sends email anymore?

711
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,370
What's the, without that old.

712
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:34,810
Use statistical methods.

713
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,250
Like, yeah, I love this.

714
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:42,730
I'm going to go ahead and assume that Deming is a fan of the show or Deming

715
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,010
would have been a fan of the show.

716
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,120
Yeah.

717
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,480
There's one thing.

718
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,880
There's one thing in his principles that I'm not certain how it

719
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,800
adapts to us.

720
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,320
Okay.

721
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,760
And that is one of the principles is use a single supplier for any one item.

722
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,180
And I'm like, um, does not apply.

723
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,660
Use training on the job, implement leadership, eliminate fear, breakdown

724
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:13,100
barriers between departments, get rid of unclear slogans, eliminate

725
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,380
management by objectives.

726
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,580
Oh, that's a good one.

727
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,900
Remove barriers to pride of workmanship.

728
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,420
So craftsmanship is absolutely important.

729
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,700
And we're not saying that the modern testing principles and Deming's

730
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,380
quality objectives are the same.

731
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,500
We are saying that the ones that overlap are supportive.

732
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:37,100
And in fact, I would say none of these, none of these are conflicting

733
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,580
with Deming's principles.

734
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:45,260
No, I, I, I think Deming, if you were to evaluate more, just to be fair,

735
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:51,480
I think, I think we would experience it very similar to the blog post we

736
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,530
got from, from, uh, Lisa Crispin and her partner,

737
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,130
the, um, Janet Gregory.

738
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,650
Thank you, Janet.

739
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,050
Right.

740
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,490
When they addressed it and essentially the feedback is that it doesn't see

741
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:12,550
a problem, it's sort of a summits of we didn't go far enough or there's,

742
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,670
that we're not entirely complete.

743
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,470
That was kind of.

744
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,190
Oh, for sure.

745
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:16,910
For sure.

746
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,830
We never claimed to be.

747
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:24,790
No, but I do think in general, like I don't see a lot of evidence that Deming

748
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:28,350
would, in fact, I think Deming would fully support what we've written there.

749
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,230
Yeah.

750
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,950
That's an interesting call out.

751
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:31,990
It is, it is.

752
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:36,230
But what I would maybe put a cap on this is what I want to thank the person

753
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,990
who had a, who was thought the principle was cringe worthy for starting

754
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,470
a discussion on it because I love it.

755
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,230
Yeah.

756
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:46,630
And thanks for being, uh, you know, just cordial to me establishing context

757
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:51,310
over DMS and Twitter and, and, uh, they're going through my modern, the modern

758
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:56,550
testing course on, on ministry of testing.com, which is available.

759
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,070
And what I started to do is, as you know, um, maybe just a little bit

760
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,510
of business here live.

761
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:08,270
So it's for context is, uh, Brent and I, this is not, we don't do this for any

762
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:11,750
other, what we just like talking about this stuff.

763
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,310
And we hope it helps a few people.

764
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,830
Uh, we're in it to make money.

765
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,190
Occasionally we'll do an ad.

766
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,670
I do this ministry testing course.

767
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,630
We, uh, donated some money last year to, um, a couple of worthy causes.

768
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,070
We have a little bit of a bank account from money I've received

769
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,510
from talks around modern testing.

770
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,510
So anything I do around modern testing, I just put that money back into

771
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,870
our, our AB testing account.

772
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,350
And we'll use that for good causes scholarships, hopefully someday.

773
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,430
So with the course, uh, there's a new option from modern tech from ministry

774
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:43,390
of testing, which is great.

775
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:47,870
When they get my dividends for the course every quarter, I just don't

776
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:50,390
date them straight back because ministry of testing is fricking awesome.

777
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:54,990
And they, I know they'll put it to absolutely good use to improve the

778
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,110
community and just, just big fans.

779
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,110
So those of you that taken the course, even I love it, you take in the course

780
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,990
and you go, wait a minute, I'm on day one and I hate it, but I'm going

781
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,550
to keep taking it and see where it goes.

782
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:05,350
Thank you for doing that.

783
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,030
I think it's great.

784
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,990
And then if you have conversation about it, uh, there is a forum on ministry

785
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,750
of testing, but if you want to bring it to Twitter and have us get involved

786
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:20,200
there or, or, or, or you can go to one of the three dot slack.com.

787
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,280
And if you want an invite, all you have to do is go to modern testing.org

788
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,080
and pay how much money, Brent?

789
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,440
Zero.

790
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,040
Zero.

791
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,840
We don't do that.

792
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
We don't do that stuff.

793
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:33,160
So if actually, if you want to go to anchor and, uh, you know, be a, some,

794
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,440
whatever anchors version of Patreon is, you can just know if you

795
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,960
want to do that, you can, we never asked for it.

796
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,040
Uh, and I'm not asking for it now, but if you feel obliged, you go, oh my

797
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,080
God, this is so great.

798
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,800
I want these guys to just to determine where they're going to donate money

799
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,880
for me, if that's like a thing, uh, we can do that for you.

800
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,200
All our proceeds.

801
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,640
In fact, we would be a nonprofit org, except that requires way too much paperwork.

802
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,440
Yeah.

803
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,800
And I'm, and I'm, and I'm super lazy, super lazy.

804
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,760
No, it is.

805
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,200
If someone wants, if one of the three wants to sign up and set that up,

806
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,840
yeah, we'll, we'll support that.

807
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
But yeah, no,

808
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,800
yeah, I'm way lazy.

809
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,520
So anyway, uh, we'll yeah, that's, we're not a, no, it's too much work.

810
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,800
I got a file paperwork.

811
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:15,960
Yeah.

812
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,440
If someone wants to do that, if one of the three happens to be an accountant and

813
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,190
wants to set us up as a full time, a nonprofit, whatever those letters,

814
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,470
numbers, the combination that is, we can do that.

815
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,910
But anyway, we're here for you.

816
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:31,110
And so if you want to engage with us, have conversations, disagree with us,

817
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:33,230
fight with us, you can do so on Twitter.

818
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,990
You can do so with me because Brit's never on Twitter anymore.

819
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,830
You can do so in one of the three.slack.com go to modern testing.org.

820
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:40,910
Again, I get there.

821
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:44,030
If you want to, uh, no, don't come to my house.

822
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:44,830
That'd be weird.

823
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,310
Um, how well should they engage with us?

824
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,950
That it kind of Twitter or Slack?

825
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:52,950
I think Twitter and Slack are the best ones.

826
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:53,310
Yeah.

827
00:39:53,310 --> 00:39:55,430
But we, you know, welcome to the conversation.

828
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:58,150
We're happy to be, you know, we're going to argue our side,

829
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,910
but tell us how we're wrong.

830
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,950
We're not going to, we're not going to get mean.

831
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,070
We're not going to start pulling out random philosophical points.

832
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:08,230
We're just going to talk about the context where we're coming from and make it to

833
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,390
a point we agree or disagree.

834
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,030
And that's cool too.

835
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:10,870
Yeah.

836
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:15,790
It's it's, I would, I would say if you want to have a conversation,

837
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:20,150
have a conversation, if you want it, if you want to shout at us, you know,

838
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,750
um, fine Alan on LinkedIn.

839
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,950
Yeah.

840
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:23,870
Hey, Brent, I lied.

841
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,270
There is one more way that you can converse with us.

842
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,910
There is Twitter and the slack, but for, if you're up for it again,

843
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,950
you know, from our interview shows, we don't, we're not,

844
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,070
mean that if you want to come on the podcast and have like a longer in conversation

845
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,750
about this, we're reasonable and nice.

846
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:48,430
So we're happy to have almost almost anyone on the podcast.

847
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,750
I can think of one previous guest.

848
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,670
We're going to say no to it's not Annemarie.

849
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,230
Annemarie is welcome anytime.

850
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,310
In fact, I should just give her the link.

851
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:55,950
It'd be great.

852
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,550
She just showed up and said hi for like 10 minutes once in a while.

853
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,950
Like she's free on a Saturday in Australia kind of shows them.

854
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,470
He goes, Hey, Brett, now, and how you doing?

855
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,990
And we'll check in for a little bit and she can get us a few more downloads

856
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,830
like she did last time and she can go back to her day.

857
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:15,550
I'm happy to, to, I'd be happy to do that for almost all of her.

858
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,070
Yeah.

859
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,070
In fact, if either one of us can't make it, which the other one should

860
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,590
just do the podcast with Annemarie.

861
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,310
Ooh, another a,

862
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:23,710
all right.

863
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,070
I can, I can't make it.

864
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,070
I'm on vacation.

865
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:30,430
Hey everyone, it's Annemarie and I'm Brent and it's the A B testing podcast.

866
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:31,830
Yeah.

867
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,110
Yeah.

868
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,390
Yeah.

869
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,390
Uh, except for if you're on vacation.

870
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,520
Oh, I have the recording equipment.

871
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,560
We're kind of, we're kind of screwed.

872
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,160
Yeah.

873
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,040
The, the, the only thing I don't know if you've forgotten this.

874
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,680
I still have this.

875
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,160
What?

876
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,720
Oh, this is, I need to look at this for the, I think we're going to close

877
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,880
here in a second, but I've been looking all over my house for the good

878
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,200
microphone and I think, uh, Brent has it with him.

879
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,330
What does that microphone say on it?

880
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,920
Are they the same?

881
00:41:59,120 --> 00:41:59,920
Are those both?

882
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,360
Oh, the one in the middle.

883
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:01,960
What does that say?

884
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,780
It says sure.

885
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,580
Beta 80 58.

886
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,060
Yeah.

887
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,340
That's my good mic.

888
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,700
That's the beta 58.

889
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,980
That's the, yeah, he's licking it.

890
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,940
That's the really good mic.

891
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,580
I wanted that.

892
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,540
I couldn't find, I tore my house apart for getting you had that bag.

893
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,940
I got a couple cheap mics and one beta 58.

894
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,600
Were you looking for an 80 bitty C cable?

895
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,200
Um, I wasn't looking for it, but I knew you had it.

896
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:27,880
No.

897
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,240
All right.

898
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:29,480
Okay, man.

899
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,840
Well, someday, someday.

900
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,000
Why don't I, you know,

901
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,440
what here's the geeky part and as we close here, I usually play D and D right

902
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,480
after this podcast.

903
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:41,600
So, um, my Friday D and D games have been gone for about four years, maybe five

904
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:41,920
years.

905
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,440
So, uh, but someday we should record a podcast together like in the same room.

906
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,160
Oh, you want to do that again?

907
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,000
We could do, we could do that again someday.

908
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,360
Then I can get my shit back.

909
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:52,660
All right.

910
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:52,980
You know what?

911
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,660
People are bored.

912
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,500
And so we should just, this was fun.

913
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,700
Maybe just call it a day and, uh, let everybody get on with their lives.

914
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,580
What do you think, Brent?

915
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,100
Fantastic.

916
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,980
All right.

917
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,420
Well, this was fun.

918
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,140
Again, we appreciate your feedback.

919
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:07,940
We love your feedback.

920
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,780
Thank you so much.

921
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,780
And I hope you found some interest or excitement in here.

922
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:15,140
And some of you are going, Oh my God, I got to go find this thread on Twitter.

923
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:15,980
Believe me.

924
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,820
This conversation, I mean, the threads fine, but the conversations, what

925
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,900
matters, thank you everyone.

926
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,700
If you've listened this far and thank you, Brent for enduring our car.

927
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,260
I would, I don't know.

928
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,900
What did you bring to the table this time?

929
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:31,140
I showed up.

930
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:31,660
Yeah.

931
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,180
And you had better, you had a better Deming page than I did too.

932
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:34,820
So that's good.

933
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,720
Uh, yeah.

934
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,040
And I had perspective.

935
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,480
Yeah, I don't have that.

936
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,920
I'm just a crotchety old man.

937
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,340
Okay.

938
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,580
I am crotchety old Alan.

939
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:46,620
And I'm not.

940
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:47,020
All right.

941
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,740
I'll see you later.

942
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:48,620
Bye.
