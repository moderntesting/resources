00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:11,620
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,580
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,050
Hey everyone

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,050
Brett say something. Hi

5
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,250
All right

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,300
But you said hey everyone like that was for the list that was for the three people

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,600
Brit you're you remain the smartest idiot I've ever known but luckily we have someone even smarter joining us on our

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,140
our

9
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,460
Socially distanced podcast this morning. We have Julian Bucknell who is the CTO of test cafe? Hey Julian and

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,100
Good morning. It's well, it's morning for me. Yeah

11
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,180
Hello

12
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,520
Long-time listeners may know that we we record it 8 a.m

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,140
On Fridays usually so are welcome to have Julian get up early for us. Which part of the world are you in Julian?

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:16,420
I'm actually in Colorado. So it's it's not an early morning for me. It's it's pretty good. I mean I've got my

15
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,500
Starbucks coffee which I went to him, you know a

16
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,660
Drive-thru

17
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,660
To get and I'm ready

18
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,260
It's

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,260
Ready for the the morning's work

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:36,500
All right. Wait, you introduced me as the CTO of test cafe. I actually am the CTO of developer Express who

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:45,570
Create and market test. Thank you for the clarification. What else does dev express do we are mostly about

22
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:53,470
Kind of user interface controls for for developers across the gamut from Windows

23
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,790
to the web and

24
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,170
You know, I can get into why we created test cafe because you know

25
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,010
we have all these user interface controls for the web and

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,030
We need to test them and so on so forth. But yeah, we we basically target developers

27
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,670
creating applications

28
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,150
you know either for Windows or for the web or

29
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:24,070
It's getting more and more things like the Mac and and so on so forth. It's it's getting very interesting

30
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,190
Yes, indeed and I like that you said you cater towards developers

31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,830
I don't I didn't mention this earlier in our pre-show talk, but I

32
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,350
My role is difficult to describe. I run engineering systems for an org of about 250 people and

33
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:50,070
We don't have any dedicated QA. In fact, we have a lot of people doing testing. They're also called developers and

34
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,430
many of our developers for the parts of our

35
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,110
Our product that are in UI are using test cafe and I have played with it in the past for some prototyping

36
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,110
And I have to say I'm a fan

37
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:06,110
so I am curious why in a world where

38
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,950
Selenium is ubiquitous. Did you like what was the

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:18,550
Where'd you where'd you come from here? Well, the thing was this is my word. This is probably about seven years ago now

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,430
Yes, we we developed

41
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,630
Web controls

42
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,190
controls for web applications

43
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,370
so, you know the boring things like menus and buttons and all that kind of stuff we have a

44
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,470
theming thing we have grids and spreadsheets and

45
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,710
Previews and dashboards now and all that kind of stuff and the big problem without this is yeah, we can write

46
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,750
our own

47
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,070
Tests or the developers can write their own tests

48
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,730
to a certain extent when you're talking about things like

49
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,950
unit tests or integration tests and so on a functional testing but

50
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,790
When you're talking about the web

51
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,540
as

52
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,060
I'm sure you both know and all everybody listening knows

53
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:16,450
You're not actually running the web app on its own. You're running it inside a browser and

54
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,510
We ran into the problem with Selenium

55
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:27,470
Which I'm sure a lot of people run into is in order to test an application say

56
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,310
test your user interface you've got to

57
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:38,830
Install something inside your browser. I think it's called web driver or something like that and

58
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:46,510
And that becomes a problem. You can't just you know start up a browser and say, okay

59
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,670
Let me test this particular piece of my application or this particular piece of the UI

60
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,150
Am I getting the right results from my back end and so on so forth?

61
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,230
and so we we started to run into these problems and

62
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,110
Pure JavaScript controls were originally written for the mobile market

63
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,230
so we talk about phones which were tablets and all that kind of stuff and

64
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,830
Selenium tablets the phones

65
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,070
No, so we had to basically come up with an idea

66
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:28,750
Some kind of tool that we could use to test our own user interface controls on mobile devices

67
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,510
Automatically and

68
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,490
You know put it inside our continuous integration

69
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,870
Service and all that kind of stuff. And so we started off in test cafe

70
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,070
I remember when we first launched it. I think was 2013

71
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,870
There was a big conference in San Francisco an HTML 5 conference or some description

72
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,190
and so we had a booth there and we were showing it off and

73
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,830
and I had my

74
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,770
my Kindle and

75
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,310
You know, we were showing everybody that oh it runs on this laptop that we have here and there's Julian with his Kindle

76
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,510
Look, then test cafe was working on the Kindle

77
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,990
Yes, we love doing stuff like that

78
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:22,410
And it kind of grew from there really people got enthusiastic about it

79
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,950
The thing is with test cafe, I'm sure you know is you write your tests in JavaScript

80
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,590
So not only you writing JavaScript for your web app

81
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
You're also writing JavaScript for your tests

82
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,360
You're not having to learn something new. You're not having to install something new. It's just

83
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,290
You know, it's no JS essentially a nice

84
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,290
framework for no JS

85
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:58,110
Can install it with NPM and you know, it's dead easy and as I say you don't have to install

86
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,550
Anything on the browser to make it from the test

87
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,020
The thing was that you know at that point

88
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,460
We realized there were a lot of people out there who would like it even

89
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,400
We just have a user interface which ran in the browser and

90
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,200
People saying yeah, but you're not doing this you're not doing that

91
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:29,100
So we basically stopped developing user interface and we decided to create an open source

92
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
framework for test cafe

93
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,800
And

94
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,560
Then once that was popular

95
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,960
create a better

96
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
dashboard style or studio style

97
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,840
Interface for recording tests and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, you can you can download it from

98
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,080
GitHub it's open source project. We get a lot of

99
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,580
Feedback from from people who are using it

100
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,160
and so on so forth it's

101
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,120
It's been a it's been a journey

102
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:13,760
Yeah, so I briefly my experience touched on this a little bit in our pre podcast talk, but

103
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,760
Many years ago when I was still at Microsoft as a Microsoft for a long time with Brent

104
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,760
That's where we met tonight. I've moved on from there about three years ago. I

105
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,040
My last job there. I ran a team where the developers were using

106
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,920
Slow down protractor for an angular website and

107
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,400
one of the things that

108
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,660
Bugged me was that the only browser we could get all of our tests to run on consistently was Chrome

109
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,720
There were various issues with Firefox more issues with ie and granted. This is now five or six years ago

110
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Five well three four four or five years ago. I can do the math here

111
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,360
So when I got a chance to prototype test cafe just to let you know

112
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,380
My experience as a user it was NPM install test cafe

113
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,340
Open some you look at the docks write a little code go

114
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:09,000
Oh, wow, this just runs and then try a different browser and it just runs and I wrote more extensive tests

115
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,620
And not only did I write I just wrote a little

116
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,400
Basic test for one page to create some random project names for us. This was an angular set at the time and

117
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,980
It was pretty easy to get a basic test up and running

118
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,180
Ended up having to do a lot more and I'm gonna really anger the Selenium crowd

119
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,940
I'm not against Selenium as everybody knows we had Jason Huggins on the show last year to talk about it's a lot of value to it

120
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,100
But as far as quick

121
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:44,220
Getting things up and running it worked really well for me and those tests ran with only one

122
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,180
Air when someone pulled them out and dusted them off to build on them

123
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,740
Six or eight months after I wrote them. So I think that's a testament to

124
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,460
How well things work?

125
00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,020
I'm a little bit removed from that but I remember in Selenium a lot of waiting for elements to appear which

126
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,780
You have to do a little bit of a test cafe

127
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,940
But it's a little smarter about not needing to write these massive nested

128
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:15,820
Weights and checks so a big fan. So this is all leading to a question. So when I first used test cafe, I

129
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,500
posted

130
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:25,100
Eventually Alan gets somewhere. I posted to Twitter and said hey because I haven't done a lot of web automation. I

131
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:31,180
Said I've used test cat facings to work pretty well and what am I missing? What's what?

132
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:37,180
Why isn't this a bigger deal and the feedback I get from my followers who use

133
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,820
And others who are forwarded. There's a lot of Selenium folks out there

134
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:47,420
We're really just two things and maybe watch you address these and kind of get rather than my opinion your opinion

135
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:55,060
One was which I will actually argue with first one was will it inject JavaScript into your website?

136
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
So it's not the real site customers are seeing

137
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,900
I thought that is and just I'll just dismiss that one is lame

138
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,020
but the second one is

139
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,900
But web it doesn't use webdriver and webdriver is w3c c standard w3c standard and

140
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:17,940
My answer to that was so and they said but it's a standard and I said so and they said but it's a standard

141
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:22,780
But you may have a better answer to that question. So I'll leave you with that to comment on

142
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,260
My my viewpoint

143
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:33,940
Just to go back. I mean we create these user interface controls written in JavaScript for web applications

144
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,300
And the thing is we don't just say

145
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,020
these controls only work in Chrome or Firefox or

146
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,050
Safari or whatever edge. Yeah, that was the other one edge. Ha

147
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,250
Yeah, we say it's you know, it's a

148
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:58,130
User interface control for the web and it should work in any browser and what we get is if we get it wrong

149
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:06,130
We get you know a support question or whatever it happens to be. Hey, I'm using this version of Safari and your web

150
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,730
Your user interface control doesn't work

151
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,070
And so we have to basically, you know

152
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:18,750
Boot up some Safari or other and check it out. The problem is

153
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:26,530
Once you fixed whatever issue it was in whatever particular browser it was

154
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:30,210
You've got to repeat that test forevermore

155
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,610
It's part of your test suite at that point because you don't want to revert to a buggy

156
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,330
Version and so on so forth

157
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,290
So that's you know

158
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,930
emphasizing the fact that

159
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,490
Yes, web driver may be

160
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,050
W3C

161
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,610
Compatible and all the rest of it, but it's not in every browser

162
00:12:53,570 --> 00:13:00,210
It's not there if I download and install Firefox, it's not there you have to then install

163
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:03,010
something else and

164
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,290
And you know if I come my

165
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,250
I'm old-fashioned. I've got an iPhone 6

166
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:17,890
It's you know, the operating system is version 12 of iOS not version 13. It won't go up any further

167
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,370
so at some point, you know

168
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm just saying

169
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,740
We're going to create a user interface control or some feature and other and it's just not going to work on my iPhone 6

170
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:33,100
And i'll be able to say okay guys, you know sort this out

171
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,330
but with selenium

172
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,550
until

173
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,750
If you like the web driver becomes like

174
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,750
um

175
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,670
The big thing everyone's talking about these days is wasm web assembly

176
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:56,290
Every browser now has web assembly built into the browser so you could now write applications

177
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,150
Which target web assembly fine?

178
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,030
web driver is not like that

179
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,430
and um, so

180
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,470
You know for us in particular

181
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,310
Uh emphasizes the fact that we needed

182
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,110
something which went beyond

183
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,190
Um what selenium could do because we have customers out there across the world

184
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,910
Using a wild variety of different browsers, so we cannot

185
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,270
Just say oh, sorry. You're using internet explorer 11

186
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,590
You would believe the number of people you still use internet explorer 11

187
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,150
Um, I would because i've run those

188
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,750
Because we had to when I when I had web apps

189
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,590
At microsoft I would look at browser percentage and at the time again four or five years ago

190
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,130
At I was surprised how many people were running ie8

191
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:57,470
Yeah, absolutely. I mean it is it can be absolutely crazy, but then you start thinking about okay

192
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,510
It's a legacy app and you know, we haven't upgraded all our users

193
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:10,590
So on so on so on I mean, I wonder how many people out there are using the new microsoft edge for example if they're using edge

194
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,550
Did they actually do the extra step to install this brand new chrome based edge?

195
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,030
Brand you you're probably using chrome edge

196
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,080
Uh not by purpose. No

197
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,520
Do you call it credge internally?

198
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
No, we do not we do not

199
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
I'm gonna offer that up for free

200
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Just pass that along to satya or the ie team directly

201
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,280
If it goes that way it's already going to get translated to frames internally. Oh, i'm sorry. I'm sorry. I said microsoft

202
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm sorry. Credge for business

203
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
No, so like the

204
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,400
the

205
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,940
uh

206
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,940
I do think going with the chrome

207
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,180
Architecture was a net positive for edge

208
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Uh, I don't think there's much disagreement there not for me

209
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,500
No, no

210
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,540
but

211
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,740
Like to me, I think there's a bit of a branding problem right now because I think the majority

212
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
About if I were in the right position

213
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,460
Once I made the decision to go with the chrome back in I would have rebranded

214
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,760
Right because I think I think edge is synonymous with

215
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
pain

216
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,480
in in

217
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,600
the world market

218
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,560
That's just my opinion and satya listens to this and what's the question me on it?

219
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,960
Um, I'll still stand by that even though I have no data to prove it one way or the other

220
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,150
um

221
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,150
couple couple of things, uh

222
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,710
So i'm currently stocking

223
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,190
julian on linkedin

224
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,250
Oh and I see he actually has spent time at microsoft as well

225
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,130
Yes, that was a while back

226
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,250
I was at microsoft for about a year. Um

227
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,050
I was brought on um

228
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,890
because

229
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,090
The visual studio team were about to release visual studio

230
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,790
2003

231
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:23,230
And if you know your visual studio history, there was no visual studio 2003 because there was a major cockup

232
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:28,830
And so it became visual studio 2005 and so I was brought into you know

233
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
in theory to

234
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
provide

235
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:41,580
I was program manager to provide ideas and thoughts about what the next version of visual studio would would have and

236
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,100
Would be doing and so on so forth except that

237
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,020
I was brought in and everything had been decided and

238
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,300
We were doing visual studio 2000, what's it called? Um codename whitby

239
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,680
It's kind of interesting. I remember these things. Wow. Yeah

240
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,800
C-sharp was getting um generics. That was the big thing about it

241
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,570
I remember when generics came out those were cool. Uh,

242
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,810
So you remember when wittaker was in dev dev

243
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,930
Was it around that time frame?

244
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,770
It might have been so barton barton was running their massive qa org

245
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,450
But when did I don't remember when wittaker's first stint at microsoft began and ended?

246
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,850
But yeah about that time he actually might have come a little bit later

247
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,490
Yeah, was was tfs a thing then julian?

248
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,450
Tfs was just starting

249
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:44,450
It hadn't the team foundation server

250
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,550
I I I

251
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,070
No, that was later i'm sure i'm trying to get back now

252
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,580
I mean i've i've been with dev express now 14 years. So it's like

253
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,250
you know

254
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,290
I forgot I forgot most of those days at microsoft. It was uh,

255
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,570
It was fun, but I just didn't fit in at that particular point. Unfortunately, so all right

256
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:14,130
I had to give your yearbook away. No, that makes that makes perfect sense like like um

257
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,800
You know, he started this question with sort of a web driver

258
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Is the standard thing right in in the somewhat of a?

259
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,940
cyclical argument in my view standards change

260
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,660
right, uh, I

261
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,660
Just happened to be looking

262
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,780
uh

263
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,580
Uh in right now I found a page that talks about laws that have changed

264
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,700
Right there was a law apparently in washington in 1969 where it

265
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,540
Made it a felony and punishable by five years in prison if you um

266
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Slayed bigfoot

267
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,270
Where are you going with this?

268
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,950
No, I I'm just

269
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,950
Which page you've got up?

270
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,650
So so that law that law was in 1969

271
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,070
In and in the context back then there was there

272
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,270
Either this was a complete joke or

273
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:23,180
Uh in in the people who passed that a lot had nothing else better to do or there was some evidence or a real strong belief

274
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:31,010
That bigfoot is a creature that needs to be protected. My my point is is that as time advances?

275
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,010
We create new tech new standards need to be

276
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,490
Uh

277
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,490
Standards need to be reconsidered

278
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,690
right, um

279
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,730
Qa certification

280
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:51,560
Right. There's still a lot of standards in in in the eu around qa certification

281
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,540
And and as an example i'd make a large argument

282
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,260
that those standards are

283
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,240
Contradictory, uh to to many marketplaces today

284
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,300
Not all but many

285
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
I I I

286
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:17,380
Alan you you sort of just immediately bit flip the javascript argument. Likewise. I bit flipped the web driver argument

287
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,940
um, alan

288
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,340
Well, actually i'll i'll ask one question that i'm very curious about so

289
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,340
Dev express targets deaths, right? We we talked about at the very beginning. It's very

290
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,340
fascinating

291
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,340
What about test cafe?

292
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,180
Specifically do you have any sort of sense of

293
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,560
If you can share this sort of your your customer segmentation

294
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,860
around

295
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,540
Uh a developer versus a a traditional

296
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,820
Uh ui tester or ui automator

297
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,000
Uh, so

298
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
So let me let me approach that in in a slightly

299
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,360
weird way

300
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,480
Originally, we wrote test cafe for developers because we as a company

301
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,680
market to developers essentially

302
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,360
um

303
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,000
As I said, we do user interface controls across the board

304
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,160
and so originally test cafe was targeted towards developers and those developers would be

305
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,000
Fairly proficient in javascript as I said we're talking about five six seven years ago

306
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,920
um

307
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,720
and

308
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
what we found was

309
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,920
that

310
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,920
The developers were saying

311
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
This is too simplistic

312
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,540
um

313
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
For us to use you've got to

314
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,300
broaden it and you've got to

315
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,900
Make it easier to program to

316
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:55,180
Um, and so on so forth. So that's why we split test cafe away from its user interface to

317
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,660
a pure

318
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
javascript framework essentially

319
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,180
And that was made open source and blah blah blah blah

320
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,620
And then we went back to the user interface to say

321
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,220
Okay

322
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,220
We know that developers

323
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,980
will um

324
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,740
I'm going to say the word enjoy using test cafe because

325
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:22,620
You know, they're writing web applications and writing some javascript and they know javascript and they can write javascript to do their tests

326
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,220
brilliant

327
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,620
Now we have to target those people who

328
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,740
Maybe don't know javascript as well

329
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
but are

330
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,820
Qa people testing people people who

331
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,620
basically

332
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,210
are

333
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,330
If you like away from that developer mentality and go

334
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:50,370
How is this application really going to work and how easy is it to use and how can we test the

335
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,310
usability of this application

336
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:58,830
Easily and quickly which is when we produced test cafe studio, which has

337
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,070
basically a visual

338
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,510
test recorder

339
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,350
So yeah a developer could go in with the studio and say all right

340
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:12,510
Here's my web page and i'm going to press this button i'm expecting this to happen and you know these

341
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:19,710
Elements to be updated and so on so forth and they could actually just record that using

342
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,190
the visual

343
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,910
Test recorder instead of actually, you know trying to write the javascript and

344
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,430
Oh, they're using or really and they need

345
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:37,470
You know an extra bit of code to actually access the elements and and so on so forth

346
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:42,270
so we originally started targeting developers, but with the

347
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,510
User interface either studio side or

348
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:50,910
It's going to migrate into a kind of dashboard type

349
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,810
application

350
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:54,430
um

351
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,430
You know, we're we're then

352
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:00,270
Basically saying okay developers you have a qa team

353
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,950
Um who may not be as proficient in javascript as you are

354
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:09,470
And you don't want them to come to you to say write me this test, please because i've got to run it

355
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,550
You know add infinitum every day

356
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,270
uh in my integrated test suite

357
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,070
um

358
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,270
that's

359
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:21,550
The whole point where we thought okay, we have to target

360
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,070
um

361
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:27,230
Uh the testing environment in these companies these uh corporations

362
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,110
and make it easier for them to

363
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,470
Create a suite of tests to run that suite of tests as part of some integration

364
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,230
um

365
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,350
and

366
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,350
So on so forth so it's um

367
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,550
We're not we're not saying

368
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:49,900
Oh developers you've been doing it wrong. Here's a great new studio, which will help you do it better

369
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:54,540
And we're not saying to the testers. Oh, i'm sorry. You don't know javascript that well

370
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,140
Here's something to make it easier for it. No, we're basically saying

371
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Writing tests is

372
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,960
I mean, there's so many different types of tests you've got you know, as I said units integration tests functional testing

373
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Which is very developer based

374
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,040
um performance testing

375
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:20,220
Hmm in usability testing the thing that fascinates me most and um,

376
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,160
uh as uh

377
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,160
Cto at dev express no

378
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,050
I'm very into usability

379
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,110
Unfortunately these days I don't do much development

380
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:38,810
Um, you know, I started off years ago as a developer, but I don't do much development nowadays. So I tend to look at things

381
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,370
from a

382
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:44,910
User standpoint more than a developer standpoint

383
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,970
so usability testing for me is is something that's

384
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,650
interesting and um

385
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,250
I I really want to get more into and um, you know to be able to look at our

386
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,130
particular controls and to say

387
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,330
Yes, they're usable if the user

388
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,410
Comes across an application written with our controls. They know how to use the application. They're not searching around

389
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,090
You know the window going well, what do I do to do this? It gets obvious

390
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,980
um, and you know test cafe is all about that it's uh, um,

391
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,740
especially the studio side of things it's the ability for

392
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,340
um

393
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,900
Qa testers to actually

394
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:39,500
Write tests which show that an application is usable and continues to be usable

395
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,500
so

396
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:45,820
I don't know the state of the art today on test recorders

397
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,740
when

398
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:53,100
When I started this this was back in oh my god ms test was when it started

399
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,300
Ooh

400
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,220
Are those who remember that? I I I was a beta user

401
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,620
um

402
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:05,340
and one of the traditional problems with this is they were

403
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:12,780
They were absolutely great for very quickly creating a bunch of repeatable tests

404
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,980
As long as your developers didn't check in any changes

405
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:27,620
Uh, then it very quickly then it very quickly became a maintenance nightmare often with people who didn't understand

406
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Uh the code being produced

407
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,580
um

408
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
What's the what's the state of the art on?

409
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,180
that

410
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,780
that's

411
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:47,980
That's that's that kind of a broad question because if you like we suffer from that from our um, you know main

412
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,820
um thrust of our um our company is

413
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,020
Breaking changes, you know, we're we

414
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
So let's say we produce a control

415
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,800
Um people like it and they want some changes and they want this feature and that feature and all that kind of stuff

416
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,160
It's very easy at that point to say, you know

417
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,520
We thought about doing abc with this control at the beginning

418
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,640
but it turns out that c is not really required it really ought to be d and

419
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,720
We make the change and it's a breaking change and

420
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Yes, we have to tell our

421
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,000
Customers that yet there is a breaking change

422
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,640
Uh, it won't work in the same way as it did in the previous version and all that kind of stuff and the one thing about test cafe

423
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,240
video

424
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,080
Test recorder is that it's actually writing the stuff as javascript in the background

425
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,320
So it's not some weird and wonderful

426
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,680
Database there and we're just doing some wacky sql to

427
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,720
Put the test into the database and all that kind of stuff. No, it's just a javascript file

428
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,480
so

429
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,560
In one sense, it's uh fairly easy to make changes

430
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,480
Yes, the developers can do something which will break a test

431
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,400
as the test broken because the change made was

432
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,360
Um bad or was the breaking change a good breaking change in this case you have to change the test for sure

433
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,880
and it's easier to change the test if it's just

434
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,600
You know language, you know and can just quickly change or re-record the test with the new

435
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,480
Um new outcome that you're expecting from this new feature

436
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:38,350
Yeah, so to build on what with what brent asked and as answer part of it myself in the old days of windows ui automation

437
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:45,290
People would change an id of a control or the tab or a tab order or something that would screw up all your automation

438
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,770
in the web world brent the

439
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,540
If people

440
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:57,900
Have auto generated or randomly named or or usually unnamed controls things get weird even in test cafe

441
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:03,420
I had one control in that little suite. I wrote that didn't have an easy way to access

442
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,580
so I had to make a constant with

443
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,400
with the

444
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,800
Totally ugly selector name and we went back and changed it later

445
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,280
But the way you get around those tests breaking is you you give your controls ids with sensible names

446
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,760
That makes them easier to access

447
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,600
So which is one of the reasons I think it's critical

448
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,840
Whether you're using selenium or test cafe or any of the other tools around this is that for that

449
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,680
Unit level that basic bvt of ui wouldn't be unit level test

450
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,160
But that basic bvt of ui like are my controls there and they do

451
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,840
I'm beginning not testing logic is the stuff where I want it to be

452
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,480
Have the devs write that because they're going to feel that pain right away and go fix

453
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Yeah, and I mean

454
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,800
We don't have qa on our team, but if they if they go oh wait, this is stupid

455
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,200
Why am I doing it this way? That's such an efficiency boom rather than the if you have a like there are some

456
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,920
organizations where a tester writes test cases and an automation team goes to automate them and the back and

457
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,720
forth between those layers and the developer

458
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,600
Just it's it's an inefficient game of ping pong that drives me nuts

459
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,480
So let's take care of and maybe if you have that automation team, which i'm not a fan of

460
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:30,160
I'm not against having qa teams. I think it makes sense, especially in a in a ui centric application, but get that basic

461
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,680
Testing that that first level of testing done by the dev team have them own those tests

462
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,240
Because if not you're going to be playing a constant game of back and forth and back and forth the entire time you're building your product

463
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,800
And it's just a horrible way to make software

464
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,360
That's a that's a good point actually

465
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,040
And one of the things we discovered is yes

466
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:58,800
Uh test cafe will record a test saying is the 13th child of this particular parent because you haven't actually given it an id

467
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,960
And yeah, something will break pretty quickly at that particular point

468
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,080
Um, which is why we also have

469
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,240
Not only pure if you like css

470
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,000
um

471
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,800
Classes and ids that we can search for and use and all that kind of stuff. We also have

472
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,360
the ability to

473
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
um have

474
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:26,190
Format format framework specific

475
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:31,070
Um selectors, so if you're using react for example react is

476
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:38,430
If you like notorious for hiding things from you because it creates an old separate dom and you know

477
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:45,230
What do we do about that in test cafe? Well answer is we have a react

478
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,270
plugin if you like which knows about react and knows how to get

479
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:57,310
uh to a particular control or a particular element in the react dom tree to be able to

480
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,650
ascertain its

481
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,630
status and

482
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,140
What it's showing or whatever

483
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:11,740
But yeah, that's an excellent way of putting it if your developers can't write the test then

484
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Nobody else could

485
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:22,380
Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance a book on the philosophy of quality basically says quality and care are two sides of the same coin

486
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,140
If I look at my work, if I look at a string of random

487
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:33,870
Glued greater than signs and strings that that that is a thing in my test. I am not proud of that work

488
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:40,190
Right, and I want to be proud of what I make whether it's a test or production code or or even a project

489
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,910
I like to be proud of my work. Uh, I want to

490
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
Ask you a different question

491
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,600
And I think it's fair for because again a lot of people

492
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,080
I don't I don't think it's any mystery to you. There are more selenium users and there are test cafe users

493
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:01,680
I haven't looked up that number, but I'm pretty sure I can say that I feel I have a high confidence. That's correct

494
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,160
What are some for the selenium crowd maybe because i'll get questions about this maybe let's preempt some of those

495
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:16,880
What are some things you think selenium does better than test cafe or or or a reason you would use selenium in some instance over test cafe?

496
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,120
that's a question that I really could not answer because I

497
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,360
Personally have never used selenium. So I

498
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,980
I

499
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,820
I just don't know. I am to officially outsource that question then because I don't know either

500
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,980
I

501
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,100
I mean I get I get the point that selenium has been around

502
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,420
the longest

503
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,840
so

504
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,440
So actually I have one maybe we can talk through because I haven't thought about this

505
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,640
But I think I think I can talk through it. Maybe you can help me with it

506
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,160
is

507
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:00,520
One of the things that were built on top of selenium is selenium grid the ability to have a basically a server farm run a whole

508
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,960
bunch of things

509
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,720
you test across a whole bunch of browsers and a whole bunch of

510
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,250
permutations

511
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,370
I'm as I say that because I brought i'm just trying to think I think I could duplicate

512
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:16,170
All of that in a modern ci system

513
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,290
Is that something that's come up with you?

514
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,610
Has anybody ever asked like I want to run this across on every build across

515
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,410
16 different browser and os flavors

516
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:30,570
Would they just use test cafe on something like browser stack or like what will be your what would be your answer to that?

517
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:37,370
That question that's something that we are continuing to improve. Let's put it like that the ability to run

518
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,550
Test suites concurrently

519
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,550
and

520
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,240
it's

521
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,600
Quite unquite difficult, but it's still it works at the moment. We

522
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,080
The other thing is to go back is

523
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,080
We get an awful lot

524
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
these days

525
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,380
Of people are using sites like source labs

526
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:10,700
To run their application on multiple different mobile devices

527
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,740
And yes, we'll do that in quite parallel. Uh, unquote

528
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,770
Um

529
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:23,370
Which again, you know selenium is more geared towards your desktop browser

530
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,730
Experience and not necessarily. Oh i'm running it on a very smaller

531
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:36,970
Very smaller and a smaller screen and you know, these things disappear until you hit the hamburger menu

532
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,370
Icon and stuff like that

533
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,090
The way test cafe works is it uses a proxy server essentially

534
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,040
so

535
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,400
It's end-to-end testing and test cafes in the middle. So

536
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,160
If your browser asks for a particular, you know

537
00:37:54,790 --> 00:38:02,170
HTTP request test cafe receives the HTTP request recognizes it sends it on to the actual back end

538
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:10,650
And then when the back end replies will then pass that reply over to the browser and um

539
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,900
Um

540
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:18,780
You know inject if you like it's uh its own test, uh information

541
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,340
Uh so that it can verify that test is running. Okay, and all the rest of it that server

542
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,460
proxy server will

543
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
work with multiple

544
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,920
browsers at the same time

545
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:37,180
So you can basically with test cafe set it up so that

546
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
You know it'll run

547
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
even on a desktop

548
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,780
Chrome and firefox and edge all at the same time running the same test for the same application and so on so forth

549
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:59,180
But I would guess that selenium if you like does it better because it's it's an actual application. It's uh, you know, it's

550
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,560
Giving the whole hog as it were

551
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,250
Yeah, I think in

552
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:12,970
So let me talk through this. I haven't thought through this completely but because the installation is just an npm install

553
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:20,170
Yeah, uh, it's it makes it fairly easy. Well, not fairly makes it extremely easy to add to my

554
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:24,490
My ci workflow. I just added I add a step that's

555
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:30,890
Uh, there's a setup step for npm install and then it runs the test results get reported and I can definitely

556
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:38,350
in parallel send that that that step to multiple locations whether it's on a farm or

557
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:43,150
Or I can specify where I want those to run. So that should work and i'm sure and again

558
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,550
I have used selenium protractor fairly extensively, but again, this is years ago. I I don't have the data

559
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:53,710
But uh, my experiences are similar, but i'm actually looking forward to hearing

560
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:59,790
Uh what our listeners have to say and if you're fairly new to the podcast if you go back to

561
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,050
About a year ago one of the early posts from 2019

562
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,850
I think that's what it was. We had jason huggins on the podcast

563
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:11,820
in response to a tweet

564
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,220
Actually, this was better brought up a minute ago. We're talking about ids

565
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:22,380
I had come across a blog post and someone talking about how they solved the problem in selenium

566
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,700
And they're very proud of this code

567
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,660
And I looked and talked about looking at code and saying am I proud of this?

568
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,300
They were very proud of code that I thought was

569
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,440
ugly

570
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,040
Unfarrassingly ugly. It was a long string of

571
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,200
Of the selector they had to choose to get it get access to the control

572
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:45,160
And I tweeted something crass like reason

573
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,420
438 why I hate selenium

574
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:56,680
And the community exploded against me and told me I I couldn't hate selenium and it's not I don't actually I I think selenium is great

575
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,640
Uh, it solves it solves a huge problem

576
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,040
What I didn't like is that it enabled that stuff. This is true also in test cafe

577
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,320
but it started a nice little war, uh, one of the

578
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,480
the contributors to web driver was extremely mad at me and and gave me uh,

579
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,800
I'll just say some grief over twitter

580
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,720
and I

581
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,600
We ended up having jason on the show to talk about it and he was actually he was super pleasant and he got it and

582
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,000
He asked he tried to bait brent and I with a uh, a question

583
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,320
Well, should should selenium just not support selector? So that make it easier said no

584
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:37,920
We should you've you've you have legacy of a million different tests. You can't just go break them

585
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,560
Uh, I think in a way he was acknowledging it that part kind of created a monster

586
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,880
But the point I wanted to make was not that I hate selenium

587
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,760
Uh, I hate hated the way it was being used the way people like again going back to my statement before

588
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,680
which is

589
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,960
Don't don't settle for having to access controls like that

590
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,880
And I got all kinds of well, we can't get developers to do that

591
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:09,320
Okay, if you if you're not collaborating with your development team if you're in a dedicated testing role and you're not collaborating with your dev team

592
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,480
That's the problem

593
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,880
Solve that problem. You'll solve all kinds of other things, too

594
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,120
so anyway, uh

595
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,640
We we support everyone if in fact I will put an open invitation out

596
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,960
If someone wants to come what else wants to come on the show and tell and tell me why?

597
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,280
uh

598
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,640
Why selenium is so much more awesome than test cafe?

599
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,620
We could do that too and I will offer that to you julian as free competitive analysis

600
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,800
I'll tell you I'll tell you if you if you want to do that

601
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,840
that's somebody on and uh have me be there as well and

602
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:53,080
You know have a big discussion about this versus why and i'm gonna even go more meta on this and say

603
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,040
uh

604
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,400
Don't use a tool because it's the one everyone else is using don't follow someone

605
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,880
Because that's the guy you think you want to follow form your own opinions

606
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,480
Whether it's around philosophy approach quality

607
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:17,400
Test automation tools do your research and form your own opinions. I can tell you i've formed mine and mine is that

608
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,720
uh test cafe is very easy to use and

609
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,320
Consistently runs my tests across every browser. I could throw at it

610
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,240
It does seem to me that intellectual laziness and

611
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,400
In the knowledge work business is a great way to limit your career

612
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,120
Um one million percent. Yes

613
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,760
The and then for those listeners who are curious

614
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,760
Alan's uh ui rant was episode 102

615
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,280
And the follow-up 103 was the one with

616
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,760
Jason

617
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:01,160
I I will look up those and um, um listen to them afterwards. I just like to say, um

618
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,700
I had a thought and it's gone. Um, it sounded like me

619
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:11,100
No, it's completely gone

620
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,980
Actually, I was looking at um angry weasel ab testing the website and um

621
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:25,100
You are responsive or the site is responsive. So it's a word. It's just a wordpress site. Yeah

622
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,340
Actually, I should bring this up

623
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:35,180
I used to give a workshop at conferences called tools you can use a bunch of different tools that any tester could use for testing

624
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,780
And I use test cafe as part of that i've since open sourced that I know one of our listeners chris kentz has

625
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,460
Given that workshop and anyone can but I used a quick little test cafe script

626
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,340
uh to do some automation of angry weasel.com and

627
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:57,210
And show that as a demo like this is this is how easy it is. It was not very much code

628
00:44:57,930 --> 00:44:58,810
Yeah

629
00:44:58,810 --> 00:45:01,370
The I I just remembered what I was talking about. Um

630
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:04,570
You were saying about, um developers

631
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,680
um

632
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:10,680
not being um

633
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:16,360
Exploratory enough if you like and just plumping for whatever everybody else is using

634
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:21,960
Um, this is something that we we come across with regard to our trial versions

635
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,200
Essentially the trial versions of our products are there so you can

636
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,800
Play around with them and see if they're actually going to suit your particular application your particular company and uh

637
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:39,320
Whether you should actually buy them and all the rest of it and I always say to developers when they're

638
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,800
When they're saying well, you know, why why should I buy yours and not?

639
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,700
Um, you know competitive be your competency

640
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:52,440
And I just say to be honest, you know writing user interface controls

641
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,400
You have two audiences you have the user and you have the developer

642
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,080
and

643
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:02,540
So play around with it use it as a developer

644
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:09,560
And show it to your users and see if they like it and the same thing with test cafe

645
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,720
essentially

646
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,720
Try it use it

647
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,260
You know do a

648
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:23,740
Contest if you like between selenium or cypress or one of the other big ones

649
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,620
Uh versus test cafe

650
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:33,340
How easy is it to use? Does it suit your particular application? Does it suit suit your particular?

651
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,700
environment

652
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,740
And

653
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,620
Go from there if you plump for one brilliant

654
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:45,420
I'm not going to argue with you if you say, you know, we did a test we checked, you know

655
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:51,420
You versus selenium versus cypress versus weber and we like selenium better

656
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:55,240
fine, brilliant you actually did the work to

657
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,000
say

658
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:57,960
that

659
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,560
Selenium was better and i'm not going to argue with that i'm not going to jump up and down and say well we use javascript

660
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,080
We use javascript

661
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,160
You know, you know, it's it's nothing nothing to do with that. I

662
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,440
Goes back to that whole, you know writing crappy code or whatever or writing

663
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,480
Code which you look at and go. Holy cow. Is there any way to make that simpler?

664
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,080
Uh, maybe if I switch my framework, it would be simpler to write and to maintain and to use and all that kind of stuff

665
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,720
but at that point it's

666
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,240
you and

667
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,240
your developer mindset

668
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,680
Whichever thing works best for you go for it

669
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,840
Yeah, same same advice for me

670
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,120
Yes, brandt. Sorry. Yeah, this is to julian

671
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,880
Julian has so are you familiar with the work of nicole forstman?

672
00:47:51,790 --> 00:47:54,350
She recently published a book called accelerate

673
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:02,990
I just like to point out now for our listeners. This is the 37th podcast in a row. We've mentioned the book accelerate

674
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:05,550
Go on brandt. Yeah, we we

675
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:10,800
Um, so what she did is she went back and did

676
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,360
A research study around sort of typical agile practices

677
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,920
and

678
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,920
she concluded

679
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,600
many interesting things

680
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:24,220
um

681
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,380
one of them was that

682
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,640
Uh developers owning their testing

683
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:36,320
Owning the testing for a company was highly correlated with

684
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,650
Uh the company's success and productivity

685
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:43,850
uh, however

686
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,330
qa owning

687
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,410
the the tests

688
00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:52,730
uh was not at all correlated with

689
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,350
highly valuable business results

690
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:58,890
and um

691
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:04,570
This is somewhat towards the salimian salimian comment and perhaps test cafe

692
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:08,810
But I wonder if if companies in your sorts of business

693
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,760
Shouldn't in some regards help your your customers?

694
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:18,700
um

695
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,140
I need those sort of goals. Uh, meaning

696
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,260
Right. Sure. If you don't have an id

697
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:32,140
Uh, if you don't have ids we're gonna fall back and we'll still succeed within test cafe

698
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,620
But now you're gonna have the high maintenance

699
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,180
Uh version of your recorded test rate. Um

700
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:47,840
I'm wondering if things like annoying warnings or or or something along those lines to sort of

701
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,680
Start changing the their engineering behavior towards

702
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:01,320
towards things that are that are known to produce positive business outcomes like it seems to me

703
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,150
Uh if test cafe was able to say

704
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:12,120
Hey, we not only just do tests, but we actually help you change

705
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,800
Uh the culture of your business

706
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:19,900
Right. We're an ally to your business as well as our own

707
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,790
anyway

708
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:29,710
That's an interesting viewpoint and i'll have a chat with the developers. We already produce a

709
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,950
Uh a product for c-sharp developers and javascript developers

710
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:36,830
called code rush which

711
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:42,030
Helps you analyze your code and suggest ways of improving your code

712
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,830
like it already

713
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,350
and

714
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:51,230
That seems to be or what you're saying there brent seems to be something that we could

715
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:54,110
do with test cafe whereby

716
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:55,790
as a

717
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:02,510
An example like the stupid example I gave earlier, you know instead of hey, you're selecting the 13th child of this parent

718
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:04,860
Why don't you give it a name?

719
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:11,180
And here's a name for you or something like that. Let me that's an interesting viewpoint

720
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:17,980
And I I've just bought it on amazon and it's coming tomorrow. So there you go. It's a great book

721
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:23,420
Um, okay, that was my turn to forget what I was going to say as a photo

722
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,420
Yeah, it's the end of the week

723
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,860
Mind you every day seems to be the end of the week

724
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,460
Oh, yeah. No, my my recurring comment there is every day is tuesday

725
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:43,770
Right. It's not monday. It's like the not the typical misery of monday. It's it's not oh wend's day

726
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:47,130
Hey, we're halfway through it is most certainly not friday

727
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:54,830
All right with with that I with us all being confused by the day of the week

728
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:58,030
but not being confused on uh

729
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,870
branch shut up

730
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,670
But not being confused on having a great and fun time talking to julian today

731
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,260
Uh, we need to close

732
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:18,540
Well, thank you very much. Alan and brent for invite me on to the uh, the podcast. I I must say I enjoyed it very much

733
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:25,500
We're super glad to have you here. And I uh, I say again if you uh invite somebody who wants to have a discussion

734
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,420
A versus b then I'll certainly come back

735
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,220
Yeah, sure. Let us know. Let us know. All right. Great. How do you hear?

736
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,740
Brent what were you saying? I said hear that hugs

737
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,780
We'll see if one of the listeners uh routes it to a

738
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,580
Yeah, we'll see what happens and again

739
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,620
I think it's I think again. I just want to close and say

740
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,220
critical thinking blind faith in anything

741
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:54,060
is

742
00:52:54,060 --> 00:53:01,340
Whether it's ideology or tools or anything in between is going to get you in a heap mess of trouble

743
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,340
so

744
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,180
with that message, uh

745
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:07,820
Thanks again. Julian good talking with you brent

746
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:10,060
