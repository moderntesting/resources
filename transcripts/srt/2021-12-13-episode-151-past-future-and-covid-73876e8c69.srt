1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
Will you still feed me?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,530
Will you still need me when I'm 64?

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,480
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,200
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,400
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,200
Now on with the show.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,160
Hey everyone.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,160
It's Alan and welcome to episode one 51 of the AB testing podcast.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm Alan.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,540
And that silence is Brent who is not here yet, but let's go ahead and start with Adam.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,140
It'll be fun.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,460
He'll show up and jump right in.

13
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,900
This show is also our end of year extravaganza.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,680
I don't know what to call it, but every year, our last recording of the year,

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,210
we talk about, you know, things, things that we have reflected onto the year,

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,270
predictions for the next year, that kind of stuff.

17
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:05,190
So, um, I don't know if Brent's prepared, but I certainly have not, but probably

18
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,170
worth reflecting a little bit on what's happened in 2021 and what's, it's been

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,350
a long year, right?

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,830
With the pandemic and everybody working from home and we have more of it in

21
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,710
front of us, it's been hard, but a year ago, I went back and listened briefly to

22
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,630
not all that part of our year end extravaganza from 2020, uh, we talked

23
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,410
about, we were still talking about the election and it wasn't certified yet.

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,930
And, and Brent was still fairly worried.

25
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,430
Oh, Hey, Brent, I started without you.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,890
Everybody say hi to Brent.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,840
Brent is working on getting his microphone to work.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,000
He is muted right now in zoom.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,600
That could be part of it, but a welcome to the podcast, Brent.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,340
Are you excited to join us here today?

31
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,760
Join us?

32
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,320
Yes.

33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:47,800
Yeah.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,440
I was just letting everyone know this is the year end extravaganza.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,760
I'll catch just hold on everybody.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,880
Just fast forward for a second.

37
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,160
It's the last podcast of the year.

38
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,540
And a year ago we were talking about, uh, would the election be certified?

39
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,160
That's kind of where I was when you joined us.

40
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,900
So welcome.

41
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,340
I'm happy to have you here.

42
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,620
I was talking about last year.

43
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:09,380
I told, I already told them I'm not prepared at all for this, but, uh, I

44
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,420
do want to now tangentatize, um, did you, have you watched get back?

45
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,060
Okay.

46
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,540
Apparently not.

47
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,700
It is so good.

48
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,100
It is so, so good.

49
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,760
It's all I'll say.

50
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,100
So.

51
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,160
I did watch a Sergeant peppers, lonely heart club band.

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Yeah, that's different.

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,880
So, uh, yeah, it's one of the high points of the year for me.

54
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,360
And there was a lot of, you know, one thing if I were to reflect on the

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,880
year, as we bounced through, we felt probably have an order I'll get to in a

56
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,740
moment, but one thing I could reflect on for the year is the streaming

57
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,600
services really stepped it up to make being at home all the time work.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,480
Having some first releases get to HBO or, or Disney has been really nice.

59
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,020
I have earned my money's worth.

60
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:58,260
You know, I've gone over my Comcast limit almost every month and why we have

61
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,040
limits on internet, I do not know.

62
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,740
I hate you Comcast, but we have gone over our limits about every month.

63
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,540
So there's no,

64
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,220
I thought you were off Comcast.

65
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,340
No, unfortunately, no, there's nothing else I can get here.

66
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,740
Just as of recently, we can get T-Mobile 5g, but everything I hear about it

67
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:17,020
tells me I'm not going to like it just for spotty-ness.

68
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,680
Oh, okay.

69
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:25,460
So you, you just, um, you cut the coax cord, but right.

70
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,780
I've got the coax cord.

71
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
I still pay for internet access.

72
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,340
I would love to live someplace where I can get fiber or have anything else, but

73
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,460
instead we have a monopoly.

74
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:35,700
Yeah.

75
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,260
So streaming services.

76
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,660
So you said you've, um, so what streaming services are you, uh, currently invested in?

77
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:43,660
Oh my God.

78
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,240
It's a little embarrassing, right?

79
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,140
So I have the.

80
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,100
Is the answer.

81
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,740
Yes.

82
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
The answer is almost yes.

83
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,240
So I don't have any live TV services.

84
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:01,400
I do have, uh, I have the package from Disney, which gives me Disney plus Hulu.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,560
Plus ESPN plus, and that gets me a lot of soccer.

86
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,320
So that's very nice.

87
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,600
I watch a lot of soccer games on ESPN plus or Hulu.

88
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,080
I thought there was live things on Hulu.

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,340
You can get live Hulu, but it's like, it's again, it's, it's the same price

90
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,440
as cable and I don't watch enough live TV.

91
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,610
Gotcha.

92
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,550
I watch, in fact, I usually, uh, anything like any sport event, and I don't

93
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,290
watch a lot of sports, the only sport I watch is soccer.

94
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,330
And if there is a match that's not on ESPN, uh, the internet is full of

95
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:32,910
streams for those and I'll watch there.

96
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,990
Um, I don't feel bad for taking your money.

97
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,110
In fact, uh, if you go to Fox sports for American people, uh, just

98
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,050
log in incognito, uh, watch for an hour till the time limit goes up and

99
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,870
then relaunch your incognito window and log onto the event again.

100
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,510
It's very handy.

101
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,890
I really, I really enjoy, uh, that Fox makes it not very difficult

102
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,150
to watch their live events.

103
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,250
And I also have Netflix, of course, and Amazon prime.

104
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,450
Uh, anything else?

105
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:05,910
Oh, I just, yes, because T-Mobile for my phone, uh, has given me Apple TV for free.

106
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,870
I've only watched Ted Lasso on there.

107
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,810
It's excellent.

108
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,970
But I got to tell you the Apple TV app.

109
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:20,260
On, on my Mac that I watched it stuff on is by far the worst streaming

110
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,080
control experience of any of the streaming experiences made by anyone.

111
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,280
I it's, it's awful.

112
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,050
So I am, I am on T-Mobile and I did not know that they will do Apple TV.

113
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,910
They also gave just, I just signed up for yesterday, a free year of paramount plus.

114
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,610
So I can catch up on Star Trek.

115
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,110
It's CBS.

116
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,310
Oh.

117
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,530
Awesome.

118
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,090
Like I, so what was it?

119
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:53,150
Amazon prime just did the one episode of Picard, uh, which I watched the

120
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,270
second it came out and I'm like, yeah, I'm not.

121
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:55,650
Yeah.

122
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,990
They're all on paramount plus, man.

123
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,070
So I think that's it for my streaming services.

124
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,850
Uh, it's not too horrible.

125
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,980
Oh, also HBO max.

126
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,340
Nevermind.

127
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,200
HBO max.

128
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,200
Yeah.

129
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,220
Now I'm just so, so I'm probably paying more for streaming per month

130
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,120
than I used to pay for cable.

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,220
But much more value out of it.

132
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,020
Cause I can watch what I want, what I want.

133
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,720
And there's, and you, and you feel better about it.

134
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:21,780
Yeah.

135
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,620
Get apple TV on us.

136
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,320
Interesting.

137
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,740
Check it out.

138
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,000
So I, I actually want to watch Ted Lasso and I want to watch foundation,

139
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,420
which are only there.

140
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,120
Oh, it's foundation based on the, the, the, and ran stuff or something.

141
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,440
No, no foundations.

142
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm thinking fountainhead got, I'm dumb.

143
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:40,900
No.

144
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,800
And Rand.

145
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,400
I was thinking fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, but that's thinking fountain.

146
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,520
Yeah.

147
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,520
Atlas Atlas Shrugged is what I was thinking of.

148
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:48,820
No.

149
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,800
Uh, foundation is Isaac Asimov.

150
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,720
Oh yes.

151
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,160
Yes.

152
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,360
Yes.

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,600
Yes.

154
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:52,800
Yes.

155
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:52,960
Yes.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
It's like the crux of science fiction.

157
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,840
I should watch that.

158
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
I should get back to that.

159
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,600
So what was I saying?

160
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,920
Oh, I should probably, well I'm on this rant and not rant, soapbox, whatever.

161
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,720
Maybe it's worth talking about last year.

162
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,840
You recommended the masked singer to me, which I still hate, but it's all right.

163
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,840
Ted Lasso.

164
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,720
Good recommendation.

165
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,560
The new season of the expanse, uh, kicked off.

166
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,960
I'm super happy about that.

167
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,000
A new season of lost in space on Netflix.

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,480
You haven't watched it.

169
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,680
I think it's a really good show.

170
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,080
It's great.

171
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Canceled Netflix.

172
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,200
I forgot lost in spaces on there.

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,360
Some space was fantastic.

174
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:28,840
Yeah.

175
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,040
Yeah.

176
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,280
Yeah.

177
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,280
New season just, just showed up.

178
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,080
So I've been pretty happy.

179
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,200
What else have I watched?

180
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,080
A lot of stuff.

181
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,480
Um, those, those stand out from recent memory, but Ted lastly, you're like,

182
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,480
what are you been watching?

183
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,160
What did, what did, what did you stream in 2021?

184
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,920
Oh, uh, and of course all the Marvel stuff on Disney as a given.

185
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:47,920
I know.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah.

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:57,800
I, I, I would say anything Marvel DC is what I've been watching like the, but

188
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,680
not, how do I put this like doom patrol or have you been watching doom

189
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,480
patrol on HBO?

190
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,840
No, no, not yet.

191
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,920
Oh, oh my God.

192
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,120
Like that is a fantastic show.

193
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,440
All right.

194
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,440
I'm going to check it out.

195
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,440
And they've gotten, they've gotten, I think multiple Emmy nominations.

196
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,280
Uh, they're just completely irrelevant or not irrelevant.

197
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,360
They're relevant.

198
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,280
Probably not the word you're looking for here.

199
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,160
Irreverent.

200
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,880
Um, which is as a data scientist, irrelevant is, is a word that they use far

201
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,600
more often.

202
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,120
And then, uh, even, even the, the live action team Titans knock off that

203
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,760
they just called Titans.

204
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,160
Yeah.

205
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,200
I, I've, I thought that wasn't bad.

206
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,680
I didn't have time to get back.

207
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,160
I've watched like two or three episodes and I got sidetracked.

208
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,920
Like there's more than enough stuff.

209
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,840
I want to watch to occupy the relatively small amount of time

210
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,000
that I give to watching videos.

211
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,280
One of the one to call out is on Amazon prime is invincible.

212
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,080
Have you seen this?

213
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,200
Uh, I watched the first episode of it.

214
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,520
Okay.

215
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,800
I think it's, if you get into it, it is fantastic.

216
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,160
And where it goes in the end, it is dark.

217
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:12,790
I'll leave it there.

218
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:16,110
Well, the first episode, it ended very dark.

219
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,230
Yeah, it gets darker.

220
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,550
And I'm like, yeah, I'm not certain this one's for me.

221
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:22,470
All right.

222
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,030
Fair enough.

223
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:28,350
Uh, although like last night, last night, what, where was it?

224
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,790
Uh, HBO max.

225
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:41,120
Uh, somebody had made a cartoon version of the, the Mortal Kombat story.

226
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,710
And I'm like, I was just so, I'm like, why would anyone build this?

227
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,030
Like no one knows Mortal Kombat anymore.

228
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,510
Uh, so I was fascinated, watched it.

229
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,630
And I can, I can tell you, I didn't actually get the answer to my

230
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,070
question, uh, but I can absolutely save you an hour of your life.

231
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,310
All right.

232
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:04,910
Noted.

233
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,950
What are you gonna make my list?

234
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,070
And of course, I think I mentioned this in our last podcast, uh, from the podcast

235
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:16,150
before then, but my video watching time has also been greatly reduced because

236
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,870
I've been playing through fallout four again.

237
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,310
Yeah.

238
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,990
Uh, I, I saw that.

239
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,310
Uh, I think we talked about it in the last podcast.

240
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,070
And then I saw you posted on that.

241
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,470
And then I'm like, you know, that's an interesting idea.

242
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,830
Um, yeah.

243
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,150
Cause I forgot how, cause it's a good, it's a different experience.

244
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,510
So there's two things and there's no spoilers on a game.

245
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,950
It's five years old, but you can play a completely different build.

246
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,030
Like I played pretty much a tank the first time I beefed up on

247
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,070
strength and, and punching and those things.

248
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,710
And now I just sneak and nobody can ever see me.

249
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,710
Cause I maxed out and I'm maybe not maxed out, but I can, I just.

250
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,280
One shot all the bad guys.

251
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,200
Oh, see when I play a fallout and pretty much all the time is I'm, I'm

252
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
a generalizing specialist.

253
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,720
Okay.

254
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,040
Sometimes we're going to get to, uh, the fallout four guide to modern testing.

255
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,040
Oh, did you see it?

256
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,520
You saw it in Slack, right?

257
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,200
That's so, uh, well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,400
No, I was, I was waiting for a segue.

259
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,240
I guess.

260
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,360
Well, let's segue.

261
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,680
Because we have no plan.

262
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,600
I do want to talk about, you know, have a little bit more reflection on what we

263
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,040
like from things we enjoyed in 2021.

264
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,000
But there's a nice article from the people at Monoma.

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,440
No, Mono, Mono, Mono, Mono.

266
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm not sure.

267
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
A lot of references to modern testing.

268
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,320
And, uh, and if you want to see this stuff, like when it comes up, you know,

269
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,280
we didn't tell them to write it.

270
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,780
We didn't pay them to write it, but they just talked about, uh, uh, what

271
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,420
they do and the inspiration.

272
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,740
And they made it their own.

273
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,540
It's fantastic.

274
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,220
But, uh, we, I found out about this from our Slack group.

275
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:05,980
You can go to modern testing.org and to get the invitation link and join.

276
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:15,260
And there are 745, minus Brett and I 743 of the three are in that group.

277
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,620
Uh, lots of collaboration, very good self-sustaining community.

278
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,300
One of the, one of the things that I continue to be proud of and thankful

279
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,500
for, but you were going to make some other comments on that article.

280
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:33,140
Just say like, if you are, if you were a new listener, obviously in this

281
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,780
particular format, it's very difficult for us to determine that if you are a

282
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,180
new user, a listener, Jesus Christ.

283
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:49,840
And you find that what we are saying resonates, I can't encourage you

284
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,120
enough to join the channel.

285
00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:01,410
There are people there that, uh, have actually taken modern testing

286
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:09,810
principles, uh, even further than, than Alan and I ever even thought it's.

287
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,050
It's fantastic.

288
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,770
It is definitely a community that if these things resonate with you, you should

289
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,890
join, uh, cause there's a strong community there.

290
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,210
Indeed.

291
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,930
Indeed.

292
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,810
You're exactly right.

293
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,490
People there, there's people in that channel that actually know more about

294
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,210
modern testing than we do.

295
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,490
Yeah, that's true.

296
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,090
Yeah, because they're actually, they're practicing the transition and

297
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,600
Brent, you know, I did the transition with my team here at unity four years ago now.

298
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,040
So it's not something I'm actively doing.

299
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,040
There's, I, you know, we, I don't have, I got a couple testers, but anyway,

300
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,480
it's not something I'm actively doing, but anyway, very cool to see that stuff.

301
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,520
So I'm going to ask you, we got onto videos for a moment, but what else did you

302
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:05,120
do of note in 2021 or things that kind of made, I say, affected your time other

303
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,730
than the pandemic and streaming affected my time.

304
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,770
Like, I don't know what I'm asking here.

305
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,330
Like what do you want to reflect on for 2021?

306
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,050
What's interesting to share with me?

307
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,450
What was interesting to share?

308
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,610
Uh, I don't know that we've ever actually talked about the podcast, but

309
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:28,770
you already have visibility to it in that, in that I have begun the discovery

310
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,690
of my inner artist.

311
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,090
Yes, you have.

312
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:33,930
Yeah.

313
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:45,410
So I have, uh, started and, and, uh, down the path of learning to paint with,

314
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,570
uh, watercolors, but, uh, as an adult, not, not, uh,

315
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,690
fingerprints, uh, we may have, we may have all done as children.

316
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:02,110
Um, and I'm pretty proud of like, I can, I've tested it with Alex on that.

317
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,630
Alex is my oldest son.

318
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,550
And every now and again, I call him Alan and I call Alan Alex.

319
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:17,150
I tested it with Alan and it has, uh, repeatedly achieved my bar, which is Alan.

320
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,670
Can you tell what it is?

321
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,950
I attempted to paint.

322
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,910
It looks like a turkey eating a seal.

323
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,390
And then I go, yes.

324
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,670
Awesome.

325
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,470
Nailed it.

326
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,550
Like my bar is, is quite low.

327
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,070
I'm reading this book right now on how to paint with this, this person

328
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,390
that far exceeds my ability.

329
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,930
And she was talking about how in her book, she's talking about how, um, to her,

330
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,210
it's really important to have a set of principles if you're an artist, because

331
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,770
everything, everything then shapes around those principles.

332
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:04,460
And one of her principles, uh, was the viewer can't see the brushstrokes.

333
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,820
And as a result, what she's noticed with that principle is that the, the

334
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,860
viewer gets lost in the scene, forgets that it's a painting, right?

335
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,580
But the second you can see the brushstrokes you're, you're reminded of,

336
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,980
oh, this is something somebody did.

337
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,260
Right.

338
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Is there, is there any equivalent of that?

339
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,500
Uh, I know your artistry is, is in the music side.

340
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,060
Isn't there equivalent of that?

341
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,820
Maybe you don't see the practice that went into something.

342
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,580
It's a little different though.

343
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,920
I think it's a little different because maybe it's the same.

344
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,360
I don't know.

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,360
You can watch a musician and play.

346
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,560
Wow.

347
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,840
That's, that's effortless.

348
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,040
It must be easy to do that or, and it's not cause it's, it's easy for them to do

349
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,620
because they've done it a hundred thousand times, but I think it's a little different.

350
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,300
That's the repetition versus the building of the art through brushstrokes.

351
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,200
Don't know, man.

352
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,160
Yeah.

353
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,720
But that's cool.

354
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,080
That's cool.

355
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,280
I think that's to be commended because a lot of people thought, okay, I'm stuck

356
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,880
at home all this extra time.

357
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,960
I have all these projects I'm going to do.

358
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,120
I'm going to, and everybody at first like, I'm going to make bread.

359
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,240
I did.

360
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,920
I did that.

361
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,360
I've seen, I've seen these dolphins or some sort of fish before top view.

362
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:22,530
Yeah.

363
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:28,350
No, so for the listeners or orange, because the image doesn't really come across

364
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,390
where when, when zoom blows it up, but those are essentially koi fish.

365
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:33,270
Oh, okay.

366
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,750
They're big.

367
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,870
That's why they're orange.

368
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:35,150
Okay.

369
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:35,430
Great.

370
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,870
Yeah.

371
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,670
What was I talking about, man?

372
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,510
I don't know.

373
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,870
I was pretty loaded up by I could coat a koi fish.

374
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:48,550
No, I think the point is I think that a lot of people attempted to do something

375
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,230
new and creative in their, their time, you know, in our time or spending more

376
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,780
time at home and most people did not actually try anything drastically new or

377
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,540
get better at something they haven't worked on in a while or come up with

378
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,340
the actual sustainable hobby, but now kudos to you, you did.

379
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,500
You said, you know, I want to do this.

380
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,140
I'm going to do this.

381
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,180
And you practice at it and got pretty good and you're getting,

382
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,660
you're good and getting better.

383
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,220
The rest of us are like, yeah, maybe I'll become a professional pizza eater.

384
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,860
A pizza critic that would, that might, that would be a decent, you know,

385
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,740
upon the fifth piece, I begin to notice the tang of tartness against my upper pallet.

386
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:39,080
And I find creating things really helps to balance out the sort of the destruction

387
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:47,480
of the melancholy that comes from like this persistent COVID bullshit.

388
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,120
Honestly, the right.

389
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,240
It's, it's not going to end anytime soon.

390
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,320
Although it was interesting.

391
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,320
I don't know if you saw the article, Bill Gates is claiming pandemic over 2022.

392
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,320
So how's that going to happen?

393
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,360
So actually I had a thought about this this week in a conversation.

394
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,520
I don't know what you think, but what we really need is a variant that is,

395
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,920
has mild, mild effects, but is massively contagious.

396
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,600
So everybody can just get it and get herd mentality, that herd mentality,

397
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,160
herd immunity that way.

398
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:25,890
That's my plan.

399
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,330
Cause otherwise it's not going to happen because people won't the same people

400
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,240
that won't get vaccinated also won't get tested and they won't stay home and

401
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,240
they won't wear a mask and they won't be conscious of spreading it to others,

402
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
even if they don't know they have it.

403
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
So it's not, and there's too many people that way.

404
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,880
It's not the contagion is not going to go away.

405
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,560
I am curious and maybe I'm being pessimistic, but Mr.

406
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,240
Former boss, Bill G, how the hell do we get there, Brent?

407
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,120
I only read the first couple of paragraphs and then honestly,

408
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,520
I kind of bit flipped and then said, you know,

409
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,480
I wonder if the next Doom patrol is out.

410
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,080
Our listeners are tapered off because they don't want to have a discussion.

411
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,440
But I think we just have to make sure we have the medicines and it's not

412
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,880
Ivermectin you jerks to treat it.

413
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,200
So it's not such a big deal.

414
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
People have it because it's not going away.

415
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,480
Just, we're just going to have to learn to deal with it better than we have.

416
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,240
One thing that will, I mean, there's some things that'll change.

417
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,160
Let's, let's talk about, uh, maybe a little bit about what this means

418
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,200
for the future of work.

419
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,680
Like, you know, I'm not sure what the latest is a Microsoft on you.

420
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,520
You're going to the office.

421
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,560
No, people don't have to.

422
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,960
Is there a date when people are expected to go?

423
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,600
Everyone goes back or, or is the expectation of Microsoft that

424
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,760
everyone's going to go back or is it a hybrid where you're back a couple

425
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,960
days a week or is it really up to every team or individual to figure out

426
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
how much they want to work in the office?

427
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,920
And this is all new.

428
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,560
And one thing, one thing new is when people are sick, they're going to stay

429
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,800
home, which they, we didn't always do before.

430
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,600
So Microsoft's policy is the, is the third one that you mentioned.

431
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,640
So we are at, uh, internally, they call it stage four or no, I'm sorry.

432
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:22,480
Stage five, which is Microsoft officially recommends that you,

433
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,240
you still work remotely.

434
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:32,600
Uh, however, uh, you no longer are required to have management approval.

435
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,980
If you do so choose to come into facilities.

436
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,500
Okay.

437
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,820
We're in a similar place.

438
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,340
We don't require a manager approval from much, but we're called, we're at yellow

439
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,100
two, which means you can go to the office if you want.

440
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,010
And some people usually have between two and maybe at most 15 people on a

441
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,930
really hectic day at the office.

442
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,660
Oh yeah.

443
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:00,300
I'll say, so I don't see people too often.

444
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,620
There's a couple of people I see all the time.

445
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:10,060
Um, but just at glancing at my, my parking lot, uh, I'll say there's maybe

446
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,460
20 cars here on an average basis.

447
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,580
If I were to, and that building you're in is probably is bigger or holds

448
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,300
more people than our unity office.

449
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:24,100
So, you know, we have the same thing, which I think is common where we, in

450
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,140
fact, we just changed this.

451
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,660
There was originally going to be a requirement that everybody had to

452
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,820
go in at least two days a week.

453
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,340
And I fought back on that.

454
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,140
I didn't think it seemed like people should go in when they felt like it

455
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,060
or when it made sense.

456
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,700
And that's finally kind of where we're at now.

457
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,460
People, we want people to live in general.

458
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,780
We don't hire fully remote people, even though a huge percentage of my team,

459
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,780
like 13% of my team is fully remote.

460
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,900
They're not near an office.

461
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,100
Our general guidance is we want people to live somewhere near enough, a unity

462
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,220
office that they could come to the office if needed, you know, it's

463
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,140
helpful for it and things also for tax stuff.

464
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,860
Cause we don't have an entity in every state in the U S nor in every

465
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,220
country like Microsoft probably does.

466
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,100
So I think it's a good, fair thing.

467
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,860
I'm going to push back on hiring more fully remote people.

468
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,980
And I think I can get away with it.

469
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,020
You're going to push back on that.

470
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,140
I want to hire more fully remote people.

471
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:21,740
The policy is they're an exception, not a, and if I want to get the best people,

472
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,800
some people live in a place and they like living in a place where we

473
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,060
don't have an office and I want to make, I want to make sure I can

474
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,460
do that when it's strategic.

475
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,510
Uh, but yeah, same thing.

476
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,570
Um, and I've told people throughout this thing for the last, ever since we've been

477
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:40,890
talking about the idea of maybe going back to an office that I would go

478
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:47,170
in at most once a week and it isn't the reason I like our office and they have

479
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,530
snacks there and seeing people as fun.

480
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:54,090
But as I mentioned before on the podcast, I start my day at six or six

481
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:57,610
30 every day because of the overlap with my teams in Europe.

482
00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:02,810
I am usually in meetings solid from that time till late morning usually.

483
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,710
And at that point I'm five hours into my day.

484
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,430
And unless there's a reason for me to go to the office, then I'm not going

485
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,790
to go into the office for the last part of my day.

486
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,190
So I'm trying to work out my schedule in the long run where I can have,

487
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:23,230
actually I'm trying to move our org to a no meeting Friday as a

488
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,670
proxy for a four day a week.

489
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,470
And if we do that, then at least I can go to the office on Friday.

490
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,510
So when I have meetings to be in, in the morning and, uh, use that time

491
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,750
to catch up with folks and other parts of the company, do, do some

492
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,590
office socialization and stuff, but we'll see 2022 is a new year.

493
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:47,030
Um, we're going to get that to happen, but, uh, anything else from 2021, we

494
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,390
should talk about before we talk about the future and what we think

495
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,630
is going to happen in 2022.

496
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,880
Uh, 2021, what was interesting?

497
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,520
Yeah.

498
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:02,480
I think, I think the adaptations to COVID are interesting.

499
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,120
Yeah.

500
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,800
I've been fast.

501
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,720
I am more than a little bit.

502
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,760
Okay.

503
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:15,920
With, with Microsoft taking a, a good long while to do full, a full open,

504
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,840
which is what they call stage six.

505
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,080
Yeah.

506
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,000
We call that green.

507
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:26,530
It's nice knowing that I, that, uh, I get the same parking spot that I have every day.

508
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:40,000
Uh, I, um, uh, I think meetings, honestly, I feel like meetings online are a little

509
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,560
bit easier than in person, right?

510
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,400
And you just things like, all right, you're hungry, right?

511
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,080
Uh, social decorum.

512
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,480
Right nowadays, you just like, all right, I'm hungry.

513
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,880
I'm going to turn off my camera and I'm going to eat something.

514
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,520
That's not viewed as rude, right?

515
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:08,920
If it's a meeting where, um, I'm there for just getting the status for five minutes.

516
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:09,930
Right.

517
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,050
I get my status and I get off the meeting.

518
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:12,930
Right.

519
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,090
It's, uh, whereas previously you might've stayed longer because you didn't

520
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:22,490
want to disturb the next topic as you got up and tried to leave the room.

521
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,410
There are some nice things about it.

522
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:31,850
Uh, my team has, has well, so we still have a daily standup at the same time.

523
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:38,250
I had to make some accommodations on that one a little bit because of time zones.

524
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:44,690
I didn't, I wanted every one of my employees to, uh, normally I will do standup

525
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,050
in the, in the morning and I wanted every one of my employees to not have a

526
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:55,350
religiously attend standup at their lunchtime as an example, but at the same

527
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:01,830
time, I didn't want to require like those of us in the PST or the Pacific time

528
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,630
zone to, to, you know, start our day at five 30, even though I do.

529
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:07,990
Yeah.

530
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,190
But I think we've well adapted to that one.

531
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:11,350
Yeah.

532
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,910
See what else on 2021?

533
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:21,150
So that into art, obviously I did more in data science, but I think you

534
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,670
and the audience expects that.

535
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:27,830
So let's talk about let's, you know, I missed a segue opportunity.

536
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,310
We're talking about COVID and COVID going away or just becoming endemic.

537
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:32,230
Yep.

538
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,550
What else is going to happen?

539
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:39,890
That one we can, I don't think when we first went home in March of 2020, we

540
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:46,190
thought that we'd still be at home in December and longer of 2021, but it's,

541
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:52,070
it's, it's what happened, but what else let's talk about what in respect to

542
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,590
AB testing, modern testing, software development, or interesting things in

543
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:00,310
the world, what do you think is going to happen in 2022?

544
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,630
What's going to be interesting?

545
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:13,440
So I'll tell you the thing I'm, I'm currently most afraid of is in this waxes

546
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,400
political, but I'm currently most afraid of world war three beginning.

547
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:27,360
And that sounds, uh, hopefully that doesn't sound like hyperbole, but, uh,

548
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,960
I think I'll just say it on the podcast.

549
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,480
I think Taiwan needs to be left the hell alone.

550
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:38,800
Uh, I think worried about, uh, Ukraine as well at the moment.

551
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,120
Um, and something like that happens and all of our predictions are completely.

552
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,360
Off base.

553
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,560
Yeah.

554
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,160
Yeah.

555
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,600
Yeah.

556
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,430
That's all we need on the tail end of a pandemic.

557
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,110
Like, Hey, we're all going back to work and now there's a real world war.

558
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,310
Yeah.

559
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:58,370
That's let's just, uh, stay in dark land and you thought

560
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,910
invincible was too dark to watch.

561
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,790
Yeah.

562
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:05,270
I did the first, I'll just say the first, the first episode, absolutely.

563
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,710
I'm like, what the hell just happened?

564
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:08,510
Yeah.

565
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:14,190
Um, and I assume as you keep watching, you understand why the, uh, I

566
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,670
forget you obviously know his name, but the father, why the father's

567
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:20,230
doing what the father's doing.

568
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:20,470
Yeah.

569
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,550
Um, find out, you'll find out.

570
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,270
If you want more.

571
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,070
Yeah.

572
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:31,630
I'll just honestly say probably not gonna, um, and the world is soft.

573
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:40,550
Where like I actually see, I honestly see the trend continuing, right.

574
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:46,190
Um, and probably even solidifying, cause I don't know if you've gotten this feedback.

575
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,270
Um, I've already started to receive feedback from certain people around.

576
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:58,780
Hey, they actually want to stay full remote as this thing ends.

577
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,900
Um, yeah.

578
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,700
Uh, and, and the most common, the common reason, do you, do you have a guess on that one?

579
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,890
They hate commuting to work.

580
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,980
That's 100% commuting, commuting is like, I don't have to do the community anymore.

581
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,780
So, all right.

582
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:23,660
It's depending on, you know, where you stand, um, that's either an hour between

583
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:29,580
an hour or two, uh, additional work time or between an hour or two additional

584
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,860
free time every, right.

585
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,540
And that goes back to the reason I'm only, I'm only going to go into work when the

586
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,820
commute, and I don't have a long commute.

587
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,500
Some people have a very long commute.

588
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:44,540
You're obviously not prepared for this part, Brent, I didn't do your homework,

589
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,770
but I do want to talk about one prediction I had that I failed on, but

590
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,450
I'm going to make, I'm going to predict it again in 2022.

591
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,490
I wanted to have Nicole Forsgren on the podcast 2021.

592
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:04,490
Uh, not only did I not do it, I blew a golden opportunity somewhere in my

593
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:10,330
Twitter feed inbox, I saw a talk, a fireside chat with Nicole Forsgren.

594
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,890
It was in a pack.

595
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,730
It was so in Eastern Asian time, I thought this is my Monday night.

596
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,050
I'm going to do this thing.

597
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,970
It'll be, I just want to hear what you say.

598
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:19,410
This is great.

599
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,410
I actually have, I doesn't overlap any meetings.

600
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:26,130
So I sat down on my kitchen counter with my laptop and poured myself a glass

601
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:30,370
of wine and I log into this thing and it's only like 25 people.

602
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,570
And she's, she's being interviewed by the folks at shoot, launched darkly.

603
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,360
And then I'm kind of half paying attention, half taking care of a couple

604
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,040
of work things and all of a sudden we get shoved into breakout room.

605
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,520
So now I'm in a breakout room with five other people and Nicole Forsgren.

606
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,600
Cause I got in the group with Nicole Forsgren.

607
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,720
Oh, uh, I had a chance to ask her questions and I did.

608
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,120
And, uh, she gave great answers.

609
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,880
A perfect opportunity to do tooth.

610
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,200
So here's my, my dilemma.

611
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,920
It's like, I was thinking like, should I actually use this time

612
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,040
to ask her to be on the podcast?

613
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,440
So that's, that doesn't seem right right now.

614
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,600
And then I wanted to, one of the things I know, it isn't very stalker-y.

615
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,400
It doesn't, it's not as stalker-y as it sounds, but I know Nicole Forsgren's

616
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,680
birthday only because it's the same day as mine, it was like three days

617
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,520
ahead of my birthday.

618
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,320
And I also thought about wishing her a happy birthday in that call, but

619
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,600
it didn't want to be, you know how stalker-y that would sound?

620
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,000
Some old bearded guy goes, Hey, it's your birthday fry.

621
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,160
I just, it's like, there was just no way.

622
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,800
I think there is no way to not make this completely awkward.

623
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,320
And I will, yeah, I don't want to make people feel awkward or uncomfortable.

624
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,240
And I was afraid of that.

625
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,640
I figured I'd keep my mouth shut and she gave great answer.

626
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,520
She's wonderfully smart.

627
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,960
It made me go reread her article on space, which is a, what's your

628
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,440
already get lab, but I forget what space stands for, but it's a lot of

629
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,480
things about developer productivity, which is what my questions were about.

630
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,080
And what I'm highly concerned about in my current role.

631
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,600
So anyway, I absolutely blew, but at least Nicole Forsgren may remember me

632
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,440
as the person who didn't freak her out by asking awkward questions

633
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,760
during a breakout room in zoom.

634
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,680
So this year I'm going to try again and see if I can get Nicole to

635
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,720
be on the podcast.

636
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,000
You know what I've never asked.

637
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,940
Maybe Marit.

638
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,100
I asked to be on the podcast.

639
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,500
She may have asked us to be on.

640
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,220
I can't remember how that happened, but most guests we get on the podcast, they

641
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,780
ask me and then I check with Brent.

642
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,220
What do you think?

643
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,100
Yeah, it sounds good.

644
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,620
Let's do it.

645
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,820
So, uh, I'm not very good at it.

646
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,980
I need, uh, lately that's been a, no, we should pass on that.

647
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,180
I need a producer.

648
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,700
I need, we need a producer who goes out and finds our guests for us and

649
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:52,380
actually maybe even gives us topics or less of a haphazard crap show here of,

650
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,380
of random bits of information, but it's a story worth telling.

651
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,460
Uh, someday, someday.

652
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,740
And when, when, if not, if, but when we have Nicole on, I do think Dr.

653
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,380
Forsgren Chicago, I should call her Dr.

654
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,940
Forsgren when we have Dr.

655
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,820
Forsgren on the show, we should actually get our act together and have our

656
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,820
questions thought of like in advance.

657
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,860
So we don't get all weirded out and, and make her think we're like unorganized

658
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,540
because we are unorganized, completely unorganized, but I think we should

659
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,860
hide it from the pros.

660
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:28,260
I would say, say, I know.

661
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,020
Unorganized, right?

662
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,020
Come on, Brent.

663
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,300
Don't argue that point.

664
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,500
No, I'm going to argue that point.

665
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,860
I'm going to say, yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't agree with that.

666
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:45,300
I would say we're not organized and that is not a synonym.

667
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,180
Oh, I see.

668
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,300
I see what you're saying.

669
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,940
We're not organized by design.

670
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,820
We don't choose to be organized.

671
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,220
We choose to be not organized.

672
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,500
It's part of our charm.

673
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,660
Right.

674
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,180
Yes.

675
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,860
That charm.

676
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,540
But that's who said that someone so long ago.

677
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,870
Okay.

678
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,870
I rapid fire questions for a makeup on the spot.

679
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,950
So this is episode one 51.

680
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:13,110
I forget what the episode was the end of last year, but how many episodes

681
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,870
we're going to do next year?

682
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:17,070
What's our year end show number for 2022?

683
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,180
You have five seconds.

684
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:23,160
Uh, one 75.

685
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,080
Ooh, good.

686
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:25,640
24.

687
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,670
That that's, that's going to, that's a stretch, but I'd love to go for it.

688
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,920
That'd be so close to 200.

689
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:36,160
That means we'll get to 200 in 2023, which we're going for.

690
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,520
Uh, so we can get that done before I go on the PCT.

691
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,920
Yeah, but that's still not going to be till April, 2024.

692
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,480
Okay.

693
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,960
Uh, vanity metric time.

694
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,800
We currently have 742, three members of the three in our Slack channel.

695
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,360
Uh, do you think we go over a thousand this year?

696
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:02,660
No, cause we're, we're, uh, no, I don't, I don't know what the rate at which

697
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,220
we are growing actually.

698
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,980
I don't know either.

699
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,380
And, uh, I didn't even know if there's a, any analytics to show me that.

700
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,260
So, but I actually think our Slack channel blows up once we get to a thousand.

701
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,980
You think, you think a thousand's a tipping point?

702
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,300
I think, no, no, I think, um, I think we had to like start paying

703
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,980
for it or something that, uh, a thousand.

704
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,340
Oh, no, no, we don't.

705
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:30,700
Um, the way, and again, I was having a conversation, uh, with somebody that's

706
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:35,620
one of my team members, my team members this morning around, I'll put it this way.

707
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,380
This is a long story and I'll make it short, but it's good.

708
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:46,300
So I can fit the tangent back in a lot of service providers don't know how to sell.

709
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,060
Their pricing models are screwed up.

710
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,660
Their pricing models don't scale with usage.

711
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,620
We had a vendor we wanted to use.

712
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,420
We liked their product.

713
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,500
The way they wanted to price us made zero charges made zero cents.

714
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,740
So we couldn't use them.

715
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,260
It just could be too expensive because they were charging us for stuff that

716
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,220
we would never use because of the size.

717
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,060
This is probably at that tipping point a little bit like a Microsoft, you know,

718
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,100
build versus buy, it's almost always build.

719
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,460
Almost always.

720
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,060
Yeah.

721
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,420
And we've been at by by versus build and we're at a weird tipping point where we

722
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,580
have to consider buying a chunk of, we have actually use a lot of open source

723
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,260
and a lot of, uh, external tools, but we need to figure out what we can build

724
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,820
versus buy.

725
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,020
So the slack model is I would love, in fact, I would pay for it.

726
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:39,060
If there was a model in between the free, what we have and the corporate model,

727
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:44,580
like the prices jumped from like free to unaffordable.

728
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,940
And I would gladly pay like a per member fee or a per message fee.

729
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,340
If it was, you know, reasonable, or they just need a middle tier.

730
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:57,460
Cause the pricing is, and what we get for zero is a limit to how many

731
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,340
messages can be archived.

732
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,580
So if you go back into some of our channels and scroll up, eventually you

733
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,000
don't see the full history and that makes sense.

734
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,360
They, they giving the services is fairly, you know, a storage is expensive.

735
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,600
So we don't pay for much storage.

736
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
You know, they don't want to pay too much storage for us.

737
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:21,720
So jumping up, uh, like the next level up from free is pro and pro is $8 a

738
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,520
member, so multiply eight times 750.

739
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,040
And that would be our monthly cost.

740
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,000
Dude.

741
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:27,720
Yeah.

742
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,240
Where I just noticed we're on a pro trial right now that ends in January.

743
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,360
Yeah.

744
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,620
So something is going to disappear in January, I'm guessing.

745
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,210
Cause $8 a person, right?

746
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,410
That that's a limit on how many plugins we could do.

747
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:51,130
But again, that price is just not affordable for a community like ours.

748
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,530
And I wish they had a community cost where you could not associated with

749
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,810
the company and I don't know how they want to do it, but if they had a, a

750
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,010
model in the middle, they would make money off of me off of us.

751
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,970
Maybe at least for some period of time, right?

752
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,330
We would.

753
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:12,370
So we have, we have the podcast account, right?

754
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,690
But, uh, it can't drain that that quickly.

755
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:16,570
Right.

756
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:16,730
Right.

757
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,930
It'd be gone a month, right?

758
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:18,850
Right.

759
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,330
Not even, no, not even, I got to think what's in there.

760
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:22,290
Yeah.

761
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,730
It would be gone in less than a month.

762
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,450
We just can't do it.

763
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:25,730
I don't want people to be able to come up.

764
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:31,890
So again, they're missing out and I've talked to other vendors who also charged

765
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:37,590
that per, I don't want to give names away, but the pricing models don't work.

766
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,350
We talked to a vendor who made a tool that was fantastic.

767
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:45,830
They wanted to charge a hundred dollars a seat at a seat was anyone at all who

768
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:49,320
access the website, the services running on a month.

769
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,760
And it just said, no, we can't, that model doesn't work.

770
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,120
That model may work for a 10 person company.

771
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,240
Yeah.

772
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,200
We'll pay you a hundred dollars a month to, for everybody can access this.

773
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:06,720
But once you have 2,500 developers, we just, that price no longer makes sense.

774
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,420
And I think I'm just coming across a lot of companies.

775
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,300
I deal a lot with vendor relations here.

776
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,100
Well, when you, a lot of times they just blow when you do a hundred dollars a seat,

777
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,060
a hundred dollars a seat per month.

778
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,800
I mean, honestly, I don't think, I don't think I, uh, I would even

779
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,920
subscribe to, to get at that rate.

780
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,240
No, right.

781
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,440
Right.

782
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,640
Right.

783
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,000
Right.

784
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,560
Which is just absolutely critical to business.

785
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Uh, and that may not been exactly, but it was something outrageous like that.

786
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,840
It may have been a thousand dollars a year, but same thing.

787
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,040
It was some round number that was incredibly huge and it just, yeah, it doesn't work.

788
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,800
So anyway, slack reminded me of that because, uh, they have, I, I wanted to

789
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,160
find a pricing model where I could pay them because it's a great, it's a great

790
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,040
app, a great service.

791
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,440
I like it a lot, but I can't pay $8 a user.

792
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:04,590
So what do you think, what do you think is a head for the test community?

793
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:11,500
And, and here you accused me of not preparing the, was I, was I wrong?

794
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,780
No, uh, you were wrong.

795
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:14,890
Okay.

796
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:15,090
Great.

797
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,530
The thing is, tell me what you prepared.

798
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:21,730
The thing is, is that in this case, I realized that in order for me to develop a

799
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:27,950
prediction, right, this is one of the struggles as it relates to me in terms of

800
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:31,270
our podcasts at this point in time, right?

801
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:37,230
I'm, I'm not really attached to the test community and most of my prediction

802
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:43,620
power in the past has actually come from the right that I'm living it.

803
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,140
And in that.

804
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,580
So,

805
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,260
and we talked about this early a little bit.

806
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:48,540
I'm in the same boat.

807
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,500
Yeah.

808
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:58,180
So yeah, I liked the idea of, uh, we, we started the podcast, uh, with, with, or

809
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,700
somewhere in the store, we, we talked about, right.

810
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:07,340
The thing on the Slack channel where the one team just completely shifted and they

811
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,180
created, they made it their own and I just absolutely adore everything about that.

812
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:12,700
Right.

813
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,180
And then I don't know how I missed it.

814
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:21,140
Uh, you, you circled back, you circled back later and posted their vision statement.

815
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,820
But when I read it, I had completely missed it.

816
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,580
I think, I think I had just, my brain just said, Oh, random add, ignore, keep reading.

817
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,260
But I'm like, Oh my God.

818
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:31,860
Right.

819
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:38,340
Uh, just, I don't even know how many random words it is, but that the, the

820
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:43,820
random words I posted in a, in a blog post so many years ago really does

821
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,180
resonate with people.

822
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:52,660
And it, it's still, I chalk it up to self-esteem issues, but it still surprises

823
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:58,540
me even today that that's a, it's an excellent rallying cry to accelerate

824
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,620
the delivery of shippable software.

825
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:04,860
And that, that, that they just bolted on in industry.

826
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,660
Um, oh, that's fantastic.

827
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,780
You know, they turned it into a design pattern.

828
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,260
The other thing I liked though, what did they call it?

829
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:16,200
They called it craft, but they started it with a Q, something like that.

830
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,000
Uh, the yeah, yeah.

831
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,360
Like a quality craft.

832
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:19,680
Right.

833
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,800
And then they changed QA from quality assurance to quality assistance.

834
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,200
And that's something I actually, a last thing gets credit for, for doing about

835
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,720
the same time, maybe even before, but sometime back years ago, maybe even

836
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,640
before we did modern testing, they ended up calling quality assistance.

837
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,760
I don't think I would.

838
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,040
Like if I were, if I were in the process of informing a, another

839
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,440
company's transformation on that front, I don't think I would go with that.

840
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:51,880
Right.

841
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:56,640
Because it, if you still go in and say, Hey, we're part of the QA team,

842
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,920
but QA has changed, I think that complicates the story.

843
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,320
I think,

844
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:06,520
well, yeah, but what's, what's important to what we're seeing is there's

845
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:10,840
two different, there's this bubble of people that are, that are moving the

846
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:18,400
role of QA or a test forward by making it an accelerant and not a, not

847
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,120
the other school, which is purely an information provider.

848
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,520
Yeah.

849
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,000
And on a separate team, we have people seeing the value of collaboration

850
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,220
and the value of bringing that test frame of thinking, that tester

851
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:36,820
frame of thinking to a development team and development team, seeing

852
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,900
the value in that via collaboration.

853
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,140
Uh, yeah.

854
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,700
And I think, I think a lot of teams are moving on like that.

855
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,980
I, I really do wonder if we're already living in the post modern testing

856
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:50,660
principles.

857
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,100
That's exactly what I was.

858
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,380
So I'm giving a webinar next month and I forgot about it till I got the

859
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,740
reminder to give them a title and abstract.

860
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,740
And I don't know what it's going to be about yet, but that one of the

861
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,740
idea in my head was I want to talk about postmodern testing.

862
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,140
I don't know what, I don't know, I don't know what that is, but that's the

863
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,660
first idea for a title that came to me, even though I have no idea what

864
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:19,690
that talk is about because I don't, I don't feel right giving another

865
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,530
talk on modern, I think I've beaten modern testing down.

866
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:25,050
People can see talks on the internet, me talking about it.

867
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,010
So what's next?

868
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,410
And it's for a test audience.

869
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,930
So I have to, even though I'm not doing testing, it's something about

870
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:36,370
life after modern testing, or I haven't quite figured it out, but maybe

871
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,090
you have some ideas.

872
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:46,090
So I do just high level, like we've talked about multiple times, right?

873
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,280
That there's always the early adopters, right?

874
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,400
And what happens is the early adopters find what works and what

875
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,200
doesn't work. When we came out with modern testing principles, we

876
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,420
were part of, we were part of the entail of the early adopters.

877
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,740
There's always a role, I'm forgetting the name of it.

878
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,860
Al Shalloway actually recommended this book to me where they talk about

879
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:20,880
the names, I'm forgetting at the moment, but where the benefit is,

880
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,560
is by paying attention to early doctors, seeing what works and then

881
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,400
proactively trying to pull the lagers forward, right?

882
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,120
And what we are now seeing right now, I truly believe is that modern

883
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:42,640
testing principles can safely die to some degree, because anyone

884
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,440
else, because I think the majority of the world is actually doing it

885
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
already.

886
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,760
Yeah. So maybe as I think about this talk in my head, you know, when I

887
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,280
first talked about modern testing at Test Bash 2016, I showed the

888
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,640
cost of innovation curve or the innovation curve from crossing the

889
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,520
chasm, which shows that kind of showed that modern testing isn't all

890
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,160
the way out of the front.

891
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,440
It's kind of on the front, but maybe what we're talking about with

892
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,680
modern testing has shifted back and there will always be leg rates.

893
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm not going to pull them along.

894
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,920
Some people are going to stay in their test last information provider

895
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,560
world forever, and I'm not going to worry about them anymore.

896
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,280
I'm again, I'm far enough removed.

897
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,320
I don't worry about those bubbles anymore.

898
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:36,020
I forget that they're there and tell people with their claws dug in

899
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,260
deeply and feet planted in that world.

900
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,900
Tell me they're never leaving, but it's fine.

901
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:45,060
But maybe what I could talk about is that curve and how it's moved.

902
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,700
And then maybe even the updated principles we talked about, which are not

903
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:56,300
as a tester, but as a team member on an agile or a software delivery team.

904
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:58,940
Like we went over in the podcast about four episodes.

905
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:05,380
Yeah, what I'm what I'm actually thinking through is in this might actually

906
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:10,660
be a consequence of COVID it I'm thinking through is it a consequence of COVID

907
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:16,380
is a consequence to like when we started down this path, you and I that

908
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,900
eventually led to modern testing principles.

909
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,130
Like there was, there was you and I had a lot of commonalities.

910
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:28,570
We could, we could sort of share individual division culture.

911
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,570
We were both still within Microsoft, right?

912
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,370
You actually set up community meetings.

913
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:40,330
And so you could see sort of the common patterns throughout the company

914
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:46,210
and then kind of get a sense of what where the industry is going.

915
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:52,730
Now, as part of COVID, I'm not not only am I not really doing that

916
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:57,610
across the board throughout the company, definitely not doing that cross company.

917
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:04,260
And so what I find myself right now is if our let's say you're in our role

918
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,900
is to sort of lead people to the next best thing, right?

919
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,740
But without being early adopters ourselves, like what I'm trying to think through is

920
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,300
who are the early adopters of the next best thing today?

921
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:21,460
Like I'm arguing, I'm arguing post-partum testing is already

922
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,990
occurring in this world right now, just you and I aren't aware of it.

923
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,150
Yeah, and that's maybe something to talk about, too.

924
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:31,470
We're we're yeah, out of the loop there.

925
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,670
But I get it. And software is evolving and people are doing great things all the time.

926
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:40,870
It's been something to explore in 2022 in our podcast.

927
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:46,420
It's been a lot we've talked about and things varied from it, explaining bits of it,

928
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,060
which we can still do.

929
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:52,990
But the practitioner side, well, on one hand, it's far away,

930
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:57,150
but it's still a lot of what I mean, I have people on my team who are

931
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,460
modern testing evangelists.

932
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,660
Just a couple of making sure we're doing things the right way as far as quality goes.

933
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,620
But just a few for a fairly large organization.

934
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,380
So think about.

935
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:12,820
But I think that should set us up well for, you know,

936
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,300
what we want to talk about in 2022.

937
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:15,540
I don't know what that is.

938
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,580
I am going to actually see if I can put together a title, an abstract

939
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:24,380
and if maybe a little idea of what this talk is about and post it for feedback

940
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,660
in our Slack group. So so, hey, another reason to join.

941
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:30,260
If you want to help me figure out what this is.

942
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:36,500
Postmodern. No, I I'm actually I may spend some time over the holiday

943
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,380
thinking through this because I every single time, like I said,

944
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,420
I'm absolutely convinced the early doctors are out there and are publishing.

945
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:47,940
They're just they're they're small and their voice is small.

946
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,220
Yeah. Yeah.

947
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,950
I agree to where we can find them.

948
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:54,390
Well, look for maybe I can find them.

949
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,350
I won't. I probably won't find them at this webinar, but we'll give it a shot.

950
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,990
But we'll look for them.

951
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,310
All right. We should get going.

952
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:01,230
But this has been fun.

953
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,590
Not our novel prediction episode.

954
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,150
Nothing too wild, but good to talk a little bit about the past,

955
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,150
a little bit about the future, a little bit about covid.

956
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,870
Sounds like a good Friday afternoon or Monday morning when this podcast comes out.

957
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,750
Yep. All right, everyone.

958
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,740
He's Brad. I am.

959
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,660
We'll see you later. Bye.

960
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,340
Happy holidays, everyone.
