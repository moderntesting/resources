00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,510
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,270
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started.

4
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,430
Welcome once again to the ABT 343 podcast. This week, the one of the three joining me

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,430
is none other than Chris Canst. Welcome to the show, Chris.

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,190
Thank you for having me.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,350
This is exciting. We have crossed paths many times and I'm glad to have you on the hot seat.

8
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,670
So are you prepared?

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,670
Nope.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,270
Me neither. All right. We are set. It's just like when Brett and I do it.

11
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:51,430
Yeah. Which by the way, I think are some of the funnier aspects of it where you're

12
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,850
just trying to figure stuff out because in some way that's just reality where you're

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:01,410
just literally trying to figure stuff out and come up with the best solution to something?

14
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,410
Yeah, it works out surprisingly well. And that's the, I'm sure we brought this up once

15
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:12,250
or twice on the podcast. That's how it started. We would have these interactions and meetings

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,410
and some way with Michael Hunter. I don't know where my, he's a tableau now if I remember

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,930
correctly, but he said, you guys should have a podcast and record these conversations.

18
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:30,240
So we did and we still have it. But this is not about Brent. Brent who? I don't know.

19
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
Today it's the AC testing podcast with Alan and Chris.

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,560
That's right.

21
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,350
And I'm going to throw you a softball to get started. Tell me your story. How did you

22
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,550
get into software testing? What was your path from there to here?

23
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:49,550
Yeah. What was my path? I know people don't like this term, but I did fall into it.

24
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:57,710
I literally got into testing after college because that was, I had a friend who worked

25
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,910
at a company in Southern California. I was living in the Bay area at the time. I wanted

26
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,910
to move to Southern California. So I had a friend who got me an interview at a company

27
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:16,740
and I just sort of ended up in the QA department and worked for a large company. It was AIG,

28
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,500
started there, worked there for a couple of years, worked for Countrywide for a couple

29
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,260
of years. Basically, I went through all the companies. There were big enough companies.

30
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,700
People sort of knew what they were doing, but no one could tell me what it is. There

31
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,140
was very little expertise, it seemed like, in the companies outside of people just had

32
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:40,260
a lot of domain knowledge. So I started working for smaller companies, startups. And

33
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,300
as soon as I started working for startups, I had to figure out what it was that I was

34
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,940
doing. Because it turns out in traditional test management, which was what those larger

35
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,180
companies used, it was a lot easier to sort of just go about your business and do things

36
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:03,860
without it having to contribute value or direct value to the business.

37
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,620
It was big enough organizations, big enough testing organizations that as long as you

38
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,100
were doing the same thing that everyone else is doing, it's assumed that there was

39
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:16,780
value creation. This is part of the reason why I really like the modern testing principles

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,460
because as soon as I joined my first startup, it was very clear to me when I was providing

41
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,660
value and when I wasn't because the company was small enough that the individual impact

42
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,980
each person had had some positive or no impact on the business.

43
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,420
So there's a little bit of a tangent. I've been in software quality for 15 years,

44
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,260
software testing and software quality for 15 years. I've worked for big companies, small

45
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,180
companies. I tend to like working for smaller companies, smaller startups. Part of that

46
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,580
is just the impact that you have. And the other part is big companies do like to do

47
00:03:54,580 --> 00:04:00,890
traditional test management. And I'm just not in favor of that at all.

48
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,490
But outside of... So I currently work for a company called BloomNation, which is in

49
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:11,390
Santa Monica, California. So I am in the Los Angeles area. BloomNation, if you go to BloomNation.com,

50
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,750
is a marketplace for flowers. You can put in your zip code and get connected with local

51
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,510
florists to buy flowers. But our big business is that we're a software as a service platform.

52
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,030
We actually bring those florists online, build them an e-commerce site, all that good

53
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:33,840
stuff. And so that's what I do. I'm a senior test automation engineer there, which is going

54
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,120
to be fun because you talk about how much... Hold on a second. I'm making a note to make

55
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,760
fun of you in a minute. Go on. Go on. Yeah, it's fine. It's fine. That's part of the reason

56
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,480
I wanted to do this because I think a lot of the things that you preach against, I

57
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,120
either sit in that situation or have come up through that situation. It's going to

58
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
be good times. I'm glad you're preparing yourself.

59
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,600
It's going to be fun. So in addition, I've been in software testing and software quality

60
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,280
for 15 years. I have been a longtime volunteer and am currently a board member of the Association

61
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,810
for Software Testing. I run their webinars, help put on the conferences, make decisions

62
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,690
at the board level. I do some writing at kens.com and a few other places around the

63
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:25,810
web. I also occasionally speak. So I have actually been speaking about the topic, about how

64
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,930
I became a test automation engineer. And I've got some modern testing portions of that

65
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:44,510
influence in the presentation I give, we can talk about. I also run basically the largest site.

66
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,910
It's a community driven site of software testing conferences from around the world at

67
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,910
testingconferences.org. It's an open source project. Anybody can contribute to it. But

68
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:01,380
that just grew out of a aspect that I saw wasn't being covered in the testing community,

69
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,300
which was how many software testing conferences and workshops are being run around the world.

70
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,100
So that's a little bit about me.

71
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,180
That's a whole lot about you. I have more than three questions and I only have two left.

72
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,420
I don't know. Prepare yourself for complex and multi-part questions. But first, a tangent.

73
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:26,100
Interesting at Bloom Nation. And I think it's a great idea to just make it easy for these

74
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,900
shops that obviously can't afford a technology department to build up their e-commerce site.

75
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:37,300
It's interesting, one because it's interesting, but two because just recently, maybe last week,

76
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:43,700
I met someone virtually. I met someone who did the same work. I forget the name of the company,

77
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,540
but they basically made the same thing for wine companies.

78
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,900
Was the company called Drizly?

79
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,260
I don't remember. I don't remember. It just made things click. It made me realize why,

80
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:59,540
because I buy and drink a lot of wine. Why so many of the sites all felt familiar. I thought,

81
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,900
are they owned by the same parent company and they're not. They used to use the same

82
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,860
e-commerce software.

83
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,710
Yeah. It turns out to be a really big and important business too. If you think about

84
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:16,390
Amazon just dominating everything from an e-commerce perspective, but still, Amazon's

85
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,590
really small in the global terms or in the United States. The United States has something like

86
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:31,670
$500 billion is done through just commerce retail sales, and Amazon probably does

87
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,190
$50 billion or $100 billion in total.

88
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:42,550
Amazon still has this really small market share. From a perspective of a business, a small mom and

89
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,990
pop business, being able to go online, even if that's not your forte and your expertise,

90
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,230
that could have huge impacts on your overall business, whether you're like an alcohol,

91
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,390
like a liquor store or a pizza shop or a florist.

92
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,390
Especially now, right?

93
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,230
Especially now.

94
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:06,310
Everything. Yeah. Interesting times we live in. Before we get on, this doesn't count as one of

95
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,670
my questions, but how is it going for you in California or just in general dealing with

96
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,110
the new scenarios of life we have right now?

97
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,440
So I'm doing okay. My wife is a nurse, so that aspect of it is incredibly complex because she

98
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
has to deal with COVID patients. Yes.

99
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,360
So that's where the stress comes from, but I used to work from home

100
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:41,360
by choice, and now I work from home not by choice. So it's fine. I keep telling myself it's fine.

101
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,560
We don't go out too much. We do a lot more cooking at home instead of going out, but

102
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,240
otherwise it's fine.

103
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,780
Well, give your wife a huge round of thanks from me because that's a

104
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,360
well, hopefully not thankless entirely, but that's such an important job right now.

105
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,680
I can imagine that could break some stress.

106
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,520
Yeah, a little bit.

107
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,870
Okay. Now let's bring you some stress. Why is a test automation engineer important?

108
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,310
What do you do to convince me that that has anything to do with modern testing? Go.

109
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,160
Yeah. So I had, like I said, I've been doing this talk about how I became one. And so

110
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,220
the story that I like to tell is that I had been just a QA engineer for the longest time,

111
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,340
senior QA engineer, whatever you want to call it. And in that role, I did a lot of exploratory

112
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:48,100
testing and then I did some automation. And now my breakdown of exploratory to automation,

113
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,740
it varies week to week, depending on our releases, but it's like a 60 40 split between

114
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,100
automation and exploratory testing. And at least in our company for Bloom Nation, we basically have two

115
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:08,400
products that we're working on. We have a new application, which is in react and node.

116
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,960
I have a bunch of really good front end engineers who have built this. It's a greenfield project.

117
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,760
It's been around for like a year, maybe a year and a half. It's really well built.

118
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,440
They're very into testability. So they've got, you know, unit integration level tests.

119
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:31,120
And we just deployed some UI automation using cypress. This will get a little bit into the

120
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,760
the modern testing frame of how you like to sort of, um, I'm basically a coach in that role.

121
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,800
So wait, and so wait, you're doing test automation and you're, you're not using Selenium.

122
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,780
Well, I am just not on this particular project.

123
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,180
Okay. No, fine. Fine. Because I actually am a lot of people have

124
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,660
pushed back a lot on cypress and a test cafe, which I really like as well.

125
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,220
Well, thank you. Thank you for giving him a run. They can believe it or not. They actually

126
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,730
can be a good solution. Yeah. And I mean, any tool that I use has to just make sense for the

127
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,330
particular problem that I'm trying to solve. And so we can discuss that a little bit. But the reason

128
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,770
that cypress made sense was this is a node application. This was an application where

129
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:20,690
I really wanted to give my developers the power to because they were so, uh, test infected is

130
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:28,930
probably a well common term, but because they write so much, write so many tests themselves from,

131
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:35,540
you know, using jest and, and to shallow render components and do all that kind of stuff,

132
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,020
it makes sense to, so basically what we decided is that it made sense to use cypress.

133
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,220
I did the initial deployment of the framework, wrote the first test. And then, uh, one of my

134
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,500
developers has since gone. And one of the problems that we found when I wrote it was that

135
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,580
it's a, essentially a single page application, but it was just, it uses some graph QL and it

136
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:05,460
uses some technologies that made it really hard to just interact with from a UI perspective.

137
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,780
And so having gone through and wrote those things, I was able to write a bunch of stories and work

138
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,300
with my developer to basically go, listen, can we re-architect this? Can you open up some of the

139
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,580
APIs in the underlying system so that we can see what's going on and use some of cypress's

140
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,420
built-in methods to actually work with the node application in order to make the testing

141
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:32,820
better? And so he did that when my developer, Aaron, he actually went through basically

142
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,500
re-architected and made it so that cypress could pull in a lot of our like server fetches and

143
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,780
that kind of stuff. And then rewrote the test that I did made it a lot more complex,

144
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,620
but also made it so that it better fit into the development workflow. And now it's set up

145
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,420
such that they can continue writing tests for components and they can use the server,

146
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,180
they can use the server data, they can use a lot of fixture data. And basically the test is now,

147
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,100
in testing terms, we'd call it a lot more glass box where you can actually see the implementation,

148
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,900
you're actually relying on the implementation to automate some of the UI. But now it's this

149
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,050
really great fit where, and that's what cypress made a lot of sense to do.

150
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:22,290
Cool. It reminds me a lot of times that's been before I knew I was coaching or consulting,

151
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:31,200
I thought I was just being lazy. I would write a test, a test, stick it into CI or stick it

152
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,440
into the build pipeline. And so now we have a test to make sure this never fails.

153
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:40,370
It would run, people would ignore it, and then it would run and fail and go,

154
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,330
oh, it's caught a bug. Great. And then once they knew it was there, they would add things to it.

155
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,700
I don't have time to write all your tests. I'm just going to make it as easy as I can for

156
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:54,180
you to do the right thing. Yeah, that's the approach that I took with this. And it just

157
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,500
sort of fit that it worked. Okay. You're slowly digging yourself out of a hole,

158
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,020
but still a test automation engineer. Tell me more about how that relates to modern testing.

159
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,030
Well, so I make it a lot of people mad, but I know you have good answers. So go for it.

160
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:15,190
Well, let's see if I do have good answers. How does that relate to modern testing? I mean,

161
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,150
I have to look up what the principles are because I don't have them memorized.

162
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,470
That's a prerequisite for being on the 343 show, man.

163
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:34,230
Well, I didn't pass the quiz you gave me. So there's a lot of things about how I approach it

164
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:41,110
that are, and we can talk about modern testing principle-like. And so really the coaching is

165
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,590
about just expanding the testing abilities and know-how across the team. That's principle seven.

166
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:51,750
And so while that doesn't necessarily, in my case, reduce the need for a testing specialist,

167
00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:01,640
the idea that I can work with my developers just across our applications, and I'm still developing

168
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:08,480
this skill because I don't know exactly what a test coach is, but being able to just give them

169
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,080
a tool and build it out and then be able to help and coach them as they build out the tests.

170
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,040
And by the way, do the code reviews on those tests contribute? I've actually contributed probably

171
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,960
a lot more for code reviews on unit tests and that kind of stuff. That is actually valuable.

172
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,160
But so from a modern testing principle, it's really trying to coach them and be better about

173
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,240
understanding what it is that they're doing and how to test better and build out that function

174
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,750
functionality to allow it.

175
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,950
All right. I'm getting convinced. Again, because it reminds me of probably the first time. It was

176
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:52,870
the first team I was on at Microsoft where we didn't have any dedicated testers. And I'm not

177
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,630
sure. I was given one of my typical jobs where Alan go figure out what to do. And I did a whole

178
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,870
bunch of code reviews of unit tests, a bunch of code reviews asking people to write tests.

179
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:11,830
And basically I taught a entire dev organization of about 70 people how to write testing,

180
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:18,840
just almost all through code reviews. So definitely a good way to consult or coach or help people

181
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,680
improve. And then I really love that because if I'm a big proponent of testers doing code reviews

182
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,400
or at least participating in code reviews. And one of the first places I tell them to look is

183
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:35,640
if there are unit tests on those code reviews, I naturally gravitate to those because I can see

184
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,400
what they're doing. I'm like, Oh, cool. You're passing in a string here. The string is a phone

185
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,440
number, but you did it twice. Why are you doing it twice? Shouldn't one be like a crazy, you can

186
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,080
start to apply your testing mindset to that kind of stuff.

187
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,720
Yes. And testing is the test written for an application, actually reasonably good documentation

188
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,200
for that application. Yeah. And that's exactly what I did. Even if you don't know a lot of code,

189
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,200
it's like a language. You can read it and understand it versus

190
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,760
usually at a much faster rate than you can speak it and be fluent in it.

191
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,000
I was going to say it's about being literate, like code literate, but not actually being able

192
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,920
to program. So if you can be code literate, if you can read it and make sense of it and

193
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,950
talk to somebody about why they did it, there's a huge opportunity.

194
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:33,520
Yeah. So my, in a nutshell, you start with where are the tests, then they add them. And then you

195
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,950
ask questions like, should we test this? Or what else should we test? Or let's try, you can sound

196
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:46,870
like a genius just by saying things like, Hey, let's just test one thing per test. Or,

197
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:52,870
Hey, let's try some invalid values here and see if we're handling handling errors. Oh, yeah. Wow.

198
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:57,190
Great idea. So it's a, yeah, we're fully in alignment there.

199
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,060
And so I will say that this works really well for that new node application. And then it's like a

200
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,660
whole other world that we can talk about a little bit more why I think test automation

201
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:12,020
engineers are necessary. I live in this like two different worlds where the node application,

202
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,580
where I have my developers, and we're doing all these things, I'm doing the code reviews,

203
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,940
they're adding unit tests and all that kind of stuff. And then we have our older

204
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,500
monolithic PHP and magenta application, where almost none of the same stuff applies.

205
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,320
I need to dive in on one of those things you said, why will we always, because I disagree.

206
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,800
So we're going to have it, we're going to discuss this tangent or tangent section or

207
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,520
something's going on here. Why do we always, why would we always need test automation engineers?

208
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,200
I can't speak of why we would need them other than I can tell you why I needed currently.

209
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:54,680
Okay, that may be better. Because that makes sense. The generality doesn't. But tell me about

210
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:59,800
the context. What's going on? Yeah, exactly. So context matters. And so when people like you harp

211
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,320
on this, and I'm like, I can't answer this as a global question. And even when I give my talk,

212
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:08,360
I can't answer it as a global question, but as a specific question. So we have outside of our

213
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,560
React application, our main application, our main e-commerce platform is on PHP and magento.

214
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:23,240
And we have platform engineers, PHP developers, who I have in that work on site with us, just

215
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,600
regular employees, great developers, they write unit tests, they write integration tests, I do some

216
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:35,080
writing of integration tests, I tried to write some PHP unit tests for magento, I spent like

217
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,920
two weeks and wrote 10 of them. It was this very frustrating process for me. But we have

218
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,200
a bunch of contractors that we use as well. And so in that world, they're not very good at writing

219
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:56,040
unit tests. My developers on site for platform engineers, they ask for unit tests, they rarely

220
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:03,560
get them. My CTO is, although he came up from the development side, he's not a big proponent,

221
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:10,180
like he would rather have no unit tests and a feature delivered than a feature delivered with

222
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:17,170
unit tests. And so a part of that comes that doesn't have an impact on my node developers,

223
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:23,730
because they are a lot more tests infected. But when it comes to this particular application,

224
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,170
and our development process and workflow, there's not as big of an emphasis on it. And if we can

225
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,210
skip it, then we skip it. And so I was actually hired to be a test automation engineer,

226
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,370
to actually write a UI, build a UI framework to play it for the magento ecommerce stuff,

227
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,840
as a safeguard against some of this stuff. And so ecommerce, it actually makes a lot of sense to have

228
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,240
UI tests, you literally want to go through and make sure you can collect people's money.

229
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,520
So I have a limited set of targeted UI tests that go through and make sure we collect people's

230
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,360
money. I have some targeted UI tests that are around SEO and making sure that we have the

231
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:09,320
specific tags and kind of things that we need. But in that world where you literally can't,

232
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,720
if you think of the test automation pyramid, and the model that it implies where you have

233
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,160
lots of unit tests, and you catch bugs there, and you have lots of integration tests, and you

234
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:24,920
catch things there, and you have a smaller set of UI tests, we do have that smaller set of UI tests,

235
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:30,360
but we really were growing the integration tests as well, but the unit test coverage is just

236
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:40,000
lacking. And so that needs sort of by definition, a lot more love from somebody who is not the

237
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,380
developer themselves. You had me till that last part. Yeah.

238
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,660
I can tell you kind of regretted saying it just as soon as it came out of your mouth.

239
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,060
It's not the way I meant to say it in that like, so in with my no developers, like I can build

240
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,620
something for them and say, Here you go, this is completely integrated, because everything is

241
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:08,100
basically been built in a way that it makes sense that I can that we can include this as an organic

242
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:16,180
part of the process. And with the magento PHP application, it's not organic at all. So

243
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,380
whereas I'm going to use some testing terms here. But so as with the node application,

244
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:28,240
where the UI tests are actually more glassbox, the magento UI tests are fully blackbox, they have

245
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,040
no idea what the code is, the underlying code is they're literally just going through the business,

246
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,200
the logic, and, and checking out and doing those kinds of things. And so because of that,

247
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,000
and this all really stems from the development process that's around it, because of the

248
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,280
development process where there isn't so much of a way to tie everything in or even a desire

249
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,640
to tie everything in. That's, that's the particular part of the particular problem that I solve.

250
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:05,810
Okay, I do. It sounds like you are doing a reasonable job of accelerating the achievement of

251
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:11,920
shippable quality. I'm trying not to be a bottleneck is what I'm there you go and accelerate there is

252
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:19,640
the right words. And at your company and in your role, you've, you have a specialization sounds

253
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,400
like you have influence. It sounds it's really you could be. And here's what I think it's the

254
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,160
semantics that are going to change in the future. What the company like yours needs is they need

255
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,360
someone with your ex they need someone with your expertise, someone actually they need.

256
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,330
Whether you call yourself a tester or a developer who happened to have a specialization in test

257
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:49,650
automation, you'd be doing the same thing. And I think at I would be willing to bet that a

258
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:56,130
companies that perhaps make a similar thing without someone they call a dedicated testing

259
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:02,530
or test automation specialist, that a developer has picked up most of the same tasks that you

260
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,690
are doing now. I think given your background, you have some more experience and expertise to

261
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,370
make it work right now. But I think it's semantics. I do want to go back on one thing and underline

262
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,400
the test automation pyramid slash triangle for those who must make the argument.

263
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,920
A lot of people look at the, they see the, probably almost everyone's seen the picture,

264
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:32,280
but few people have read the accompanying article where Mike Cohn says that for that top level,

265
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,720
just write as few of these as possible or a few of these as needed. And in your case,

266
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,160
the money flow, not only is that necessary to make sure you take people's money,

267
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:48,440
I would argue that that's a test that needs to run in production and fire an alert if it fails.

268
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:54,390
That's one of the goals that I have is to eventually be able to do that. Right now,

269
00:24:54,390 --> 00:25:00,390
we rely, so like the upside for us is that we have regular, I mean, so we use data,

270
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,070
we use a bit of data, we don't use it as extensively perhaps as we could,

271
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:09,990
but we do have a lot of monitoring in place. And at least for the e-commerce flows,

272
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,990
and we have people going through that every few minutes. It is funny, though, New Relic

273
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:22,150
has an application, they pitched it to us, we use New Relic for our application monitoring,

274
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,970
and they have other applications that they sell as a part of their solution. And one of them is

275
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:34,690
literally, oh, yeah, if you can write some JavaScript, we can constantly go through your

276
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:41,520
checkout flow and tell you when things don't work. And I was like, are you guys just using Selenium?

277
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,330
And they're like, oh, yes, we are. And I was like, okay, so we're not going to pay you for that

278
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,050
because I can do that on my own. But it was one of those things where you're like, we can just keep

279
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,970
going through your checkout flow and then alert you when things happen. I'm like, yeah, so can

280
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:00,880
we? Like, that's not a big deal. But we haven't done it yet.

281
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,680
You have to put yourself in a, without your experience, someone else may go,

282
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,520
well, that sounds amazing. Do your magic for us.

283
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:19,120
Yeah, but everything has to be so like, the way I approach it is, and I'm very specific when I

284
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,640
say we have a set of targeted UI tests. And what that means is, and we, like you guys harp on this,

285
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,160
I harp on this too, you don't want hundreds and hundreds of these things. You don't want to just

286
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:37,040
always be creating them because then you are one not improving the business, right? You're creating

287
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,280
a mess of maintenance. One of the things that I like about my current infrastructure is like,

288
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:49,520
I don't have to maintain stuff very much. I use so I use WebDriver IO, that's a JavaScript version

289
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,720
of Selenium. I've had to do a lot more maintenance recently because they upgraded to version five,

290
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,320
and then just came out with version six. So I'm, I'm scrambling to upgrade. But outside of that,

291
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,040
I can basically just walk away and my tests work for the longest periods of time. And I don't have

292
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,200
to typically worry about it. So I'm trying not to create more work for myself, so that I can go

293
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,600
and do other work. That to me is very modern testering. Yep, I can't I can't argue with that.

294
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,000
I want to change the subject for one last question, because there'll be some dives here too.

295
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:30,360
I have you have helped change my feelings toward AST, the Association of Software Testing over

296
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,120
the years. So can you talk about how you got involved there? If or how you've seen the

297
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,200
organization change, just catch me up. Tell me about what's going on with you and AST and

298
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,100
just do that. Tell me, tell me about just do that. Just just, yeah,

299
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:51,700
I won't get into the the my deeper questions yet. So let's just start with.

300
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,700
Yeah, and we should have those deeper questions because we're going to get there.

301
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,700
We're going to get there. So I found the AST because I was I started working for a small

302
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:07,540
startup. I was I just on my first testing conference, which was star West. And the

303
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,260
reason that was important was because I live in Los Angeles, and that is down in Anaheim next

304
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:19,780
to Disneyland. And that was groundbreaking because I got to meet other testers, see how

305
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,100
other people did things. And then all of a sudden, like it didn't necessarily make I

306
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,740
very quickly came to the realization that I knew nothing about the thing that I was doing,

307
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:36,660
and had been doing for several years. So I went looking for other ways to learn. And I came across

308
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:44,260
the BBST courses that AST teaches. Those are created by Chem Caner. He gave those out. That's

309
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,460
all free, open source. So if you go to testingeducation.org, that is a lot of the

310
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,140
BBST material that the AST uses. And I took all the courses. The courses are crazy in depth.

311
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:02,100
They're all university level. You can't memorize stuff. You it's not just like you go through a

312
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:07,460
MOOC and you answer a bunch of true and false questions. In order to pass the class, you have

313
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:14,660
to work with people from all over the world on projects in a sort of in a pretty realistic way,

314
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:22,320
except in a very distributed way where sometimes people don't participate at all, and you're left

315
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,960
doing all the work for them. And then in order to pass a class, you have to

316
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,840
take essay questions and answer them in a way that shows that you understand the questions.

317
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:39,320
And so that was such a huge challenge. The courses required 10 to 15 hours per week,

318
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:47,320
which is crazy to do when you're working full time. But I ended up doing those. I ended up

319
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,640
learning so much that by the end, I went back and looked at the first course that I took. And

320
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,200
I was like, how did I ever pass this class? I'm stupid and terrible. Like I didn't understand

321
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,800
how to answer questions. And then I eventually was like, this is great. I want to start teaching

322
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,680
this. I started teaching that. I've probably been teaching with them for over 10 years. So

323
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,760
I'm an instructor. I help teach the courses. I'm actually now that I'm on the board of the AST,

324
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,560
I'm actually going back and updating all those materials as we speak to try and make them more

325
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,160
modern, make them easier to read. And so my end, the AST was founded by a lot of testing

326
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,280
luminaries. James Bach, Ken Caner, Doug Hoffman, all these people that have these deep roots within

327
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:38,920
testing and specifically context driven testing. And I think that obviously has influenced the way

328
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:47,460
that I understand testing. But I also just find it just hugely historic and rich in a lot of

329
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,360
testing knowledge and that kind of stuff. And I've had the chance to teach alongside

330
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:59,560
Ken Caner, I've had the chance to teach along James Bach. But of course, the AST is different now

331
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:07,000
and Ken Caner is retired. We've had conversations within the AB testing Slack channel about

332
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,800
everyone's experiences. And these are individual people, they're flawed people.

333
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:18,200
People don't get along with everyone. In fact, James Bach is very controversial.

334
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,560
That's an understatement.

335
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,920
Yeah, yeah. His rapid software testing stuff. I don't agree with some of the stuff that they do.

336
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,120
Like I'm not a fan of testing versus checking. But that's okay, because I know when it's useful,

337
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:36,120
and I know when it's not, and I can navigate those things. And so as a part of AST, the reason that

338
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,000
I became a board member, and the reason that I do these webinars, which thank both you and

339
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,400
Brent, you guys both did great webinars. I'm trying to make sure that people that are in

340
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:54,040
context-driven testing or not, that they have just this wide range and understandings. And really,

341
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,680
I like to highlight the disagreements. Because the disagreements are real. These are real things

342
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,200
that we all live in. You don't have to live and die by them, but you should be aware of them and

343
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,680
the pitches and the things that people are talking about.

344
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:19,170
Yeah, let me dive in a little bit deeper. Your involvement in AST has helped me change my opinion.

345
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,960
When AST was first formed, I joined because I thought it was a good thing. And then

346
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:32,550
both Chem Caner and Caner, I think I told the story. I won't tell it now, but if you go back

347
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,310
on one of the podcasts, I'll tell the story about how I really pissed off Chem Caner for

348
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:42,980
doing literally nothing. Whatever. Doesn't matter. Moving on. And Bach and I have sort of a,

349
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,620
James Bach and I have sort of a truce going now, but I would just push back on him just trying

350
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:54,260
to be a jerk sometimes. And we kind of made up, we just kind of stay out of each other's paths.

351
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,380
But those guys have moved on. Like it's the people on the board now are like you,

352
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:05,410
like Ilari's on there, if I remember right. And Eric, there's some, you can see it's changing

353
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:12,950
with the times. And I really flipped the bit back on the good side permanently. Was it last year you

354
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:19,250
had charity majors as your keynote? Yeah, we did. And that's, you know, that's, that's having

355
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,530
someone who's big on observability, which is some of the basis of being able to test in production

356
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:28,610
or being able to trust production to understand what's going on. No, it doesn't mean the users

357
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:34,820
are doing all your testing. But that was, to me, that was like, Oh, they are caught up to

358
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,900
the 21st century. Thank you, AST. So it's good to see that happening. And the courses are good.

359
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:47,460
I've had employees at Unity take some of the BBST courses. I have another one might be taking

360
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:55,720
another one coming up here. They're ridiculously affordable, I think. I think it's like $300 for

361
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,360
a class. Yeah. So the upside and downside of the AST is it's all run by volunteers, right? So

362
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,320
everyone on the board is volunteer. Everyone teaching those classes is a volunteer that has

363
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,000
upsides and downsides. One of the upsides is it's incredibly affordable. Even we actually,

364
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,200
they're very global. I haven't taught a course that's been majority US and eight years, right?

365
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,880
They're just everyone from all over the world that do them. They're really affordable,

366
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:33,160
but they're also taught by volunteers. So you set your expectations around those lines. Literally

367
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,520
everyone that is teaching and taking the courses, they all have full-time jobs. They're all doing

368
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:44,360
that. But that's just the value. And it speaks volumes about people that do this kind of stuff.

369
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,920
They're doing it because they really, really love it.

370
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:55,440
And I will make sure I include links to... I wish it was AST.org, but that's actually some

371
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,200
other company's website. It's associationforprompertesting.org.

372
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:07,280
Yeah. It's way too long of a name. We've tried to buy it. It's too generic. But yeah. And so I will

373
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,320
say too that the AST is trying to keep up with the Ministry of Test. And to a large degree,

374
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,720
it's a lot of the AST is actually trying to figure out what we do now. Back when you joined,

375
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,120
AST was sort of the one group trying to do this kind of stuff. And again,

376
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:29,040
when you're dealing with just volunteers who are spending their nights and weekends trying to do

377
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,240
this kind of stuff, you only get so far. And trying to pull yourself out of the debates and

378
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,200
that you need to push people out who aren't doing the thing you think is right has basically passed.

379
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,440
And now we're trying to usher in this new idea of where does the AST provide value outside of

380
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,200
education. And so if you have any ideas, if you want to help out, please, by all means,

381
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm all the ears. Or if you have a great idea for a webinar, I'm all the ears on that too.

382
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,750
Yeah. One of the things, because I think this COVID thing is going to go on for a little while

383
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:14,690
longer, is I'm going to try and do some more webinars. If you have anything you want me to

384
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:18,950
talk about, just let me know. I'll do one. I will. I'll keep that in mind.

385
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:24,710
I think that I don't have to travel that way. And yeah, I think people just need it now more

386
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,350
than ever. There's fewer conferences going on. So sign me up if anything comes up.

387
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,890
Okay. I'll do that.

388
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:39,920
Trying to think of random lame things I can livestream. So far my list is short.

389
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,360
I mean, it's all kind of funny too. So I think test coaching, we talked a little bit about this.

390
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,160
Test coaching is this very sort of abstract thing that I still don't know what it is.

391
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,310
And so when we did the webinar, when you were talking about, I forget, the abuse and misuse

392
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:04,310
of test automation, one of the things that struck me that we've already talked about was like,

393
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:09,030
how do you how do you help coach? And we sort of did talk about a little bit where you like start

394
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:13,750
with unit tests, ask people what tests they're writing. I think those approaches are probably

395
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:19,670
really valuable and very specific enough that people can get started. And I don't think people

396
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:26,230
talk about that enough. And so I'd like to see more stuff on test coaching just personally,

397
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:31,110
so that I can get a better idea of am I already doing this? Is this what test coaching is about?

398
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:36,950
Can I do more? There's all kinds of stuff. I will say too that I've done a couple of

399
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:44,630
lightning talks around the modern testing principles. And even at CAST last year, there were just,

400
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:51,190
you know, 50% or more of the audience knew what or had heard of the modern testing principles.

401
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:58,070
And so it's my favorite part about this is that it's showing people that this is what the current

402
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:05,990
state is and how people can look at that and go that doesn't like we're not even close to that yet.

403
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:11,270
And does that mean that you're just in a development process that's 20 years old?

404
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:19,430
And so I think those are maybe those things are all and so that's really informative. Because as

405
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,910
somebody when you go and do these courses, you start searching the web and you're trying to learn

406
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:30,070
about what is the current state of something, it is hard to really get definitive answers on that

407
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:35,620
kind of stuff. Even if they're wrong, these are models, right? The principles are models for

408
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:41,860
about how this thing looks according to the people talking about it. And so then you can

409
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,140
start to break that down and apply and see where it applies and where it doesn't.

410
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:52,400
Yeah, I, yes, yes, yes, and yes. One quick thought I had, then we better close here, is

411
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:58,720
I think test coaching is such a new thing. And it's people like Rob Meaney and Anne Marie

412
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,480
Cherrett and others who are talking about it. But right now, I think if you ask 10 different

413
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,800
people what test coaching was, they would give you 11 different answers. So I think it's emerging.

414
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:18,960
And it makes me think I need to figure out, and maybe this is a webinar or me just hosting a chat

415
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,080
session sometime, a sync or a series of syncs, it'd be good to hash it out and start to define

416
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:29,600
what that is. Because I think it's a lot of different things. And some of it's more

417
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:36,320
consulting than coaching. But when do we do one versus the other? I think it's growing.

418
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,040
You and Brent had this conversation. We did. I'm not even sure I remember what the difference was.

419
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:49,440
That's how subtle it is. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll get into it another time. But it was fantastic

420
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,160
hearing what's going on. I no longer hate all test automation engineers.

421
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:02,240
I get what you're doing. Oh, good. And so that was a success. And I love to hear what's going on

422
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,720
with AST. I think, like I said, my opinion grows and grows. And it's a solid organization. So

423
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,480
glad to see you involved there and making such a difference. And of course, most of all,

424
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,720
thank you for hanging out with me for a little while today and being on the ABT 343 podcast.

425
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:27,650
Thank you very much for the opportunity. All right. Great talking with you.

426
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:31,800
And we'll see you later. Have a good one. Bye.
