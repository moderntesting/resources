00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,720
A B Testing, the modern testing podcast. Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

2
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,160
I am mindless agile robot. I must iterate.

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,670
As we talk about software engineering, software quality,

4
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,910
leadership and whatever else comes to mind. Now on with the show.

5
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,200
We're back. Howdy. It's another episode of A B testing. Yay.

6
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,600
As we count down as Casey Kasem would have in the seventies and

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,880
probably longer. I used to listen to Casey Kasem every Sunday night.

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,900
I did America's top 40 countdown with those little

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:55,380
and a mighty six 90 with those stories. I don't know what station it was on here.

10
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,100
Anyway, we're counting down to episode 100, but we're not there yet.

11
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,780
Yeah. We're a few away. I just made myself feel really old.

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,060
I can the day the pop music channel was on at a.m.

13
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,220
Wowzer. So we're back. We took an extra week off.

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:18,580
Travel snow, life, work, etc.

15
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:23,450
Yeah, you you have you've you've had your

16
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,890
years worth of change in the last few weeks.

17
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,210
Have I? I think so. Maybe we'll talk about that in a.

18
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,130
Damn it, Alan. I deserve that. I deserve that.

19
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,090
I totally deserve that.

20
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,650
That was well, well placed. We couldn't have rehearsed that any better.

21
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,690
Oh, my God. Yeah.

22
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,700
It's been a hack of the first of the year.

23
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,060
Mostly good stuff.

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,860
Took a week off to go skiing, a bunch of work stuff.

25
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,580
I'll talk about in a minute.

26
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,500
Kind of hangs in limbo, but mostly I think all good.

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,580
Hey, everyone. Alan breaking in before we get too far to talk about our sponsor

28
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,700
on A.B. testing this week, PractiTest.

29
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,820
You may have heard of PractiTest from Joel, who is one of the three

30
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,340
or from the online test conference, which is sponsored by PractiTest.

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,060
Joel himself gave Brent and I a walk through this week of PractiTest.

32
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,180
And I have to say, we were both pretty darn

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,420
impressed about what it is and what it does.

34
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,900
As you're aware, there's no one size fits all in testing.

35
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,460
That's why they built PractiTest to be a centralized solution

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,420
that supports testing of different types and sizes,

37
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,940
whether it's scripted, exploratory or automated,

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,700
or whatever they work for you.

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,380
They envision a place where all testing data will reside

40
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,940
so that stakeholders can generate the information required for their needs.

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,100
Another issue they're trying to solve is that you can create

42
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,380
and run more tests and more type of tests,

43
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,340
and you end up having a ton of data in the system.

44
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,260
Having a lot of data can be harmful if you can't control it.

45
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,420
This is why they introduced a revolutionary approach to data organization.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,060
Instead of burying the data in folders within folders,

47
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,860
they allow users to work with a hierarchical filter trees

48
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,220
that are based on the same data you're storing.

49
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,340
This enables teams to organize information in more flexible or multiple ways,

50
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,660
helping to generate better reports and visibility into product and process.

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,580
At PractiTest, they believe that a tester's job is not to test

52
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,420
for the sake of testing, which is true for A-B testing as well.

53
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,540
But to create visibility and provide information

54
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:32,820
that will help the team release better products and do it faster.

55
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,740
For that reason, having a platform that supports testing is not enough.

56
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:40,420
So they put a lot of effort into their dashboard and reporting modules

57
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,540
to make sure anyone can get the relevant information they need

58
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,980
in a format that works for them and when they need it.

59
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,740
Overall, I was super impressed with PractiTest,

60
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:56,020
not trying to be everything for everyone and being some huge, massive.

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,740
I'm not going to throw any names under the bus here,

62
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,780
but one of those solutions that tries to do way too much.

63
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,860
PractiTest is straightforward, simple and very powerful.

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,460
Of course, having access to the data and using that to form your reports

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,900
and make your decisions is a great way to catalog your testing effort.

66
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,620
So check them out at practice.com.

67
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,340
That's P-R-A-C-T-I-T-E-S-T.com.

68
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,900
Thanks. And now back to the show.

69
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,340
My pact to not speak my policy,

70
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,820
my something to not speak at conferences in 2019 was tried.

71
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,020
A game company asked me to come speak at their internal conference in Barcelona.

72
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,780
It's like, oh, K-boy-no.

73
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,060
And the thing is, the thing is, it's like, oh, my God, I want to go to Barcelona.

74
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,420
I'm honored. They want to talk about modern testing.

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,340
I should go. I should go.

76
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:56,300
And it's not like I just this random like I want to I'm not speaking at conferences

77
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,560
and that's the way it's going to go is now, you know, months out from actually going.

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,880
It's like, yeah, sounds great.

79
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,200
But every time I do that, the week leading up to it, I think, why did I say,

80
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,720
yes, I don't have time for this? I don't want to go.

81
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,770
So I'm going to there's always more important things, too.

82
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,130
And I like conferences and.

83
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,950
So I had a little tangent in my brain that I wanted to reel it a little bit,

84
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,550
but I just taken a break for a bit.

85
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,630
I don't know if I'll make it all the way through the year without speaking,

86
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,310
but I'm going to give it a shot.

87
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,030
Someone. Well, you actually tweeted recently

88
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,790
that you've handed the mantle of test conferences back to Whitaker.

89
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,910
Yes. Would it? Oh, my God.

90
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,870
So our dear friend, I mean that truthfully.

91
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,470
James Whitaker posted a tweet how after leaving test conferences,

92
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,870
seven, eight, whatever it was years ago, he's going to do some again

93
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,670
this year and talk about AI machine learning and how they're applied to testing.

94
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,950
And the test community, oddly, I thought a lot of them didn't

95
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
didn't respond well to that. You watched the replies.

96
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,560
I did. People were people are still

97
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,240
and I'll get the phrase right here off of what I read on Reddit.

98
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,240
But the phrase is people are butthurt.

99
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,440
That that that James said testing was dead.

100
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:26,320
And my God, you would think 12000 people were in the audience

101
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,360
for his talk where he mentioned test was dead.

102
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,880
But no, it was star. It was a couple hundred.

103
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,460
And what was lost in that is the message that test.

104
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,740
Testors aren't dead. Testing isn't dead.

105
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,540
Test, as you know, it is changing enough for a lot of you consider it dead.

106
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,220
But God, I just it's just I the king is dead.

107
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,620
Long live the king. Test is dead. Long live test.

108
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,180
Yeah, I think the way the accurate way you described it

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,500
just a second ago is test as you know, it is dead.

110
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,100
Sure. Yeah. Right.

111
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,580
And we've been talking about that on this podcast for well over

112
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,420
the last year, exclusively almost.

113
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,660
Yeah, I mean, almost the whole time. Really. You're right. Right.

114
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:21,850
One of the interesting I went back, I think in 2013,

115
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,940
I commented on this after having a chat with Whitaker when he was still at Google.

116
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,380
It's almost if it's not dead for you.

117
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,660
What are you doing wrong?

118
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,740
Yeah. And because you're still living in also we're preaching to the choir

119
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,620
a little bit here because A.B. testing listeners kind of get it.

120
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,500
They've they've many of them have come to accept what we mean by principle.

121
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,180
Number seven, it's not about test being dead.

122
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,620
It's just like you may mature enough.

123
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,940
You may not need to dedicate someone to testing.

124
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,660
Testing's an activity. Yes.

125
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,700
Anyway, and consider the whole shipping system.

126
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,890
One thing interesting, and I'm going to forget names here of the three.

127
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,010
And by the way, one of the three dot slack dot com is

128
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,890
one of the proudest things that has come out of this podcast.

129
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:17,410
Yeah, I love it. And thank you, Percy.

130
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,930
Yes. First, kicking that off.

131
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,850
And thank you, everyone, all three of you who are in that channel daily

132
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,250
asking questions, answering questions.

133
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,250
It's fantastic. And just starting discussions that are interesting.

134
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,650
Someone pointed out. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yes. Oh, yes.

135
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,600
Have you learned about super tacos?

136
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,520
No. Yeah, I know.

137
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,880
I gave one out. How do you give a super taco?

138
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,440
So what I'm and wait, this is a joke here.

139
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,560
Oh, to be clear, what we're talking about, if you use slack,

140
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,040
there's a service called Hey Taco and Hey Taco gave us a sweet,

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,840
sweet deal on using their service on one of the three dot slack dot com.

142
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
And if your company uses slack, I highly recommend it.

143
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,280
It's just a fun way to give other people recognition.

144
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,720
It's freaking awesome.

145
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,760
So we've been giving each other tacos.

146
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,560
And then so that's the context of what we're talking about.

147
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,120
But I've never heard of a super taco, but now I want to know when you get

148
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:24,420
or give enough tacos, you have the ability to give out a super taco.

149
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,220
I have not been tackling enough.

150
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,460
I actually gave out the first official super taco.

151
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,620
That is fantastic.

152
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:37,580
To Chris Kent's for making the last weeks or two weeks

153
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,820
a week before last webinar.

154
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,940
So easy for me.

155
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,180
That's awesome. Yeah, it was how the webinar go.

156
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,140
I want to bounce back to conferences in a second.

157
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,500
But now that we're on webinar, we're going to go down that road

158
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,860
and then rewind back up to the top. Sounds good.

159
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,040
Webinar went well.

160
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,840
The thing that I so I have not unlike the podcast,

161
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I have not been able to re listen to my own the whole webinar.

162
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:19,180
I'm very clear now on how much I'm editing you do for the podcast.

163
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,900
And I greatly appreciate it.

164
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,140
I thought I thought you didn't notice.

165
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:31,500
No, this they're literally not exaggerating 50 minimum an episode.

166
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,290
To be clear, I take a bunch of my own out as well,

167
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,010
but not nearly as much as the Brit a master.

168
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,930
Yeah, I need to find a way to fix that because I can only

169
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,290
I've been listening to that webinar,

170
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,850
re listen to it and sort of 10 minute chunks

171
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,140
because that's as far as I can take it before I'm like, oh my God.

172
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,820
That's the problem with video with your video.

173
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,120
It's difficult to edit out the ums. Yes. Yes.

174
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,640
Toastmasters, I did a couple of sessions of it a long time ago

175
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,120
and that helped out a lot.

176
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,920
They have an off counter and they just count filler words.

177
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,130
What's the filler word?

178
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:19,450
Um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, um,

179
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,460
OK, those aren't getting edited out.

180
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,220
So anyway, uh, cool.

181
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,060
Yeah, recording available on it's up on YouTube or the AST website.

182
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,980
We should probably give them a little plugs and say, uh, spot.

183
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,780
You talk right now. Um, damn it.

184
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:38,510
Do you just search for Brent Jensen? Um, no.

185
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,430
Though that might work.

186
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:47,110
There are three Brit Jensen's now up on YouTube or at least three.

187
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,150
One's a jazz artist who I think is pretty good.

188
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,110
And one's a painter.

189
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,350
And now there's me with, uh, this webinar.

190
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,750
If you search for Alan Page,

191
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,350
you'll get a whole bunch of the Supreme Court Justice playing football.

192
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,750
So webinar format.

193
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,610
I was telling Chris beforehand.

194
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:17,240
Webinar format just freaks me out because it is nowhere even

195
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,800
remotely aligned with my style.

196
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,220
When I'm doing a presentation, I need, I need a sense of,

197
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,340
am I losing my audience or not?

198
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,100
It is definitely hard.

199
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,540
I've done a bunch of them and I'm a little better at them now

200
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,500
and just not caring or imagining, but it is hard to not get.

201
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,740
See, if you see confusion or I are nodding heads, those things help.

202
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:48,690
I can, I can tell if they're pretending my jokes are funny.

203
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,950
Most are. Yeah.

204
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:57,350
The thing I was thinking, though, next time I do a webinar,

205
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,880
what I could just do is I could just sit in my home, record it.

206
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,520
There's plenty of apps for that.

207
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,080
And then when it's time for the webinar, I just hit play.

208
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,410
Then I can practice it 10, 15 times and get it right.

209
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,280
Cool. Hey, speaking of webinars, the tangent road will return back to conferences.

210
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,920
But speaking of conferences, the I don't know if the dates are announced yet,

211
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,640
but Brent and I will be presenting something to be determined

212
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,960
at the next online test conference for Joel sometime in the summer.

213
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,200
I forget when it is, but we're going to do something

214
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,560
and we're going to figure out what that is at a later date.

215
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,380
Maybe episode 100. Maybe.

216
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,020
By the way, episode I'm never going to get back to conferences,

217
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,060
but it's something I want to talk about.

218
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,460
So I'm going back to webinars. OK.

219
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,860
And then I'll close on this very quickly.

220
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,620
And that is if you're the type that tries to fast forward through the banter.

221
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm sorry that we're still talking and not on.

222
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,140
This is important stuff, too. So you may like it.

223
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,100
It's interesting on the webinar as well.

224
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,380
So I don't know if you are how you deal with this.

225
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,420
So that content, right, even when I presented it, it was

226
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,300
it was heavily influenced by the Unity deck a year ago

227
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,260
when I presented for your team.

228
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:17,660
I modified it a great deal because of what I think the audience wants.

229
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,460
But the other thing, too, is I can't tell if I'm too high level

230
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,980
or too low level for the audience.

231
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,700
I get this is a space where for me, I've been babbling about it.

232
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,780
It seems like four years.

233
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,700
And I don't know how much of the audience is still at phase zero.

234
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,310
Right. I'm like, OK, do I go in deep on how to move data

235
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:46,750
from place A to place B?

236
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,870
Or do I just skip over that and say Google it?

237
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,430
That's actually a really good point.

238
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,590
One of the things one of the great takeaways from my time

239
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:59,070
in engineering excellence, right, studied a lot on how people learn

240
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,190
was you need to gauge the audience's level of experience.

241
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,990
And speaking in person, like a lot of my talks to start off with,

242
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,560
how many of you have blah, a little bit more information

243
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,320
than how many of you have blah, blah, blah?

244
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,480
And from a few of those questions at the beginning,

245
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,120
near the beginning of the talk, you begin to get an idea

246
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,200
of where you need to make tweaks later.

247
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,640
Yes, that's what I do.

248
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,200
So but without that, it's like, here's my wall of information.

249
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,800
Maybe it works. Maybe it doesn't. Good luck.

250
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,510
I'll see you on the other side.

251
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,830
Yeah, one of the most common questions I'll ask, like when I do

252
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,750
internal presentations, is how many of you have ever directly

253
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,060
worked with a data scientist?

254
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,780
Almost inevitably, every time someone raised their hand,

255
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,460
I'm the data scientist, the reason their hand for.

256
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:53,210
And so now I just turn it into a joke.

257
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:55,170
I'm like, ah, fantastic.

258
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,730
Then none of you are likely to know when I am lying to you.

259
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,730
Yes. And I can I can vouch for that.

260
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,570
I've heard I've heard Brent use that line. That happens.

261
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,890
Yeah. So back up the stack.

262
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,450
I think we're done with that. Conferences.

263
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:11,290
Can I go back to conferences?

264
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,090
So one thing on one of the three.slack.com

265
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,210
you can get an you can get the invitation link at modern

266
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,890
testing.org is someone who I've ever forgotten

267
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,650
posted a talk, a video of a actually I watched

268
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,290
a pretty good talk from JS conference, JavaScript conference.

269
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,650
And then Tony, I remember Tony because I met Tony.

270
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:35,010
If I met if I met you, I remember who when you say things, Tony

271
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,810
pointed out that he heard me say a lot of those things

272
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:42,530
in same things in Philadelphia at Test Bash a couple of years ago,

273
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:45,140
two and a half years ago.

274
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,700
Not that I'm not at all.

275
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,060
I mean, nothing I say is so new that I like, oh, my gosh,

276
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,220
somebody else is saying this.

277
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,220
But the cool thing is that the point I wanted to make that is

278
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,060
if there are dev conferences where people are saying

279
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,300
a lot of the things I'm saying, that is my next venue.

280
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,740
When I get back into speaking, I want to start speaking more

281
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:11,460
at developer conferences about modern testing, about quality,

282
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,790
about quality engineering teams and not do that as much

283
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,590
at test conferences.

284
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,710
Test Bash still has a place in my heart.

285
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:23,270
And I will probably be the only the only test conference

286
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,630
that I want to speak at again is Test Bash and online test conference

287
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:30,070
online stuff I'll do till the cows come home

288
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,910
because I can sit in my home where pants optional

289
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,310
and talk about whatever.

290
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,510
But as far as conferences to go to, I really like not just as a speaker,

291
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,830
but as an attendee, big fan of Test Bash.

292
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,350
But other than that, I'd like to.

293
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,470
My future plans are to see if I can talk about some of the things

294
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,190
I like to talk about and do it for a developer audience,

295
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,510
because I think the world is ready for that.

296
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,070
I think not the world is ready for me.

297
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,950
The world that the software development world is ready

298
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,630
for the things that I've been talking about because they're already

299
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:04,990
talking about them.

300
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,270
No, I think I think developer and or DevOps

301
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,550
conferences are actually the right place for it to be.

302
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,660
Yeah. Right.

303
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:19,780
So we should talk a little bit about the cliffhanger in ninety seven.

304
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,160
What happens after modern testing and postmodern testing?

305
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,320
Postmodern testing is the answer.

306
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,750
You are absolutely correct, Sir.

307
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,230
Brian Jensen. Thanks.

308
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,590
So I think it's in general, the answer is different for everyone.

309
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,990
And people worry about like, what if I do work myself out of a job?

310
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,790
My theory, my hypothesis is in my experience,

311
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,030
which I'll share a little bit about in a moment, is that

312
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,110
in the process of leading a team towards following modern testing principles,

313
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,170
there will come a point when.

314
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:59,530
Principle number seven, you may not need a dedicated testing specialist,

315
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,170
but along that way, you've learned a lot of other skills.

316
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,210
No skills are going to be different for every single person.

317
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,090
Talk about the T-shaped persona and breadth.

318
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,770
Well, hopefully, I mean,

319
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:15,060
if you just this is why we had the principle

320
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,220
or the not principle eight discussion.

321
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,740
Right. Hopefully, as you've as you've gone through,

322
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,100
you have also invested in in yourself

323
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,900
so that you're ready for a postmodern transition.

324
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,580
Yeah. And if you think about the things you need to do,

325
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,100
there's a lot of leadership exercise, whether you're an individual contributor

326
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,860
or in a management position, there's a lot of

327
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,710
demonstratable assets from your work.

328
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:47,470
People see if you're have led a team along that direction.

329
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,310
I would think that people will be looking for you

330
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,710
to do a bunch of different things.

331
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,350
I was joking with one of the dev managers in Montreal

332
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,270
this week, because I talk a little bit about what I'm doing,

333
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,390
but what I'm actually doing hasn't been announced yet.

334
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,510
So and it may or may not be by Monday when the podcast goes out.

335
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,670
So I'm going to speak a little bit in broader terms.

336
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,190
And we'll go into details in ninety nine.

337
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,270
But I was joking with one of the dev managers.

338
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,870
So do you know what you're doing next?

339
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,580
And the reason he asked that is more context.

340
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,780
We're doing a reorg.

341
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,300
We have a new general manager for our vice president

342
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,380
slash vice president for our cloud new cloud division.

343
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,520
And we're doing some reorganization as part of that.

344
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,880
As part of that, I am eliminating the remaining people on my team.

345
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,400
My team, I have gone from a high of just below 50 people

346
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,480
in my test organization.

347
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,760
Right now I have I just moved my last lead reporting to me

348
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:57,160
to another division and I have 10 IC reporting to me right now.

349
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,640
But as part of this reorg, I am removing all of them

350
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,680
from my org and dissolving my cost center.

351
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,620
Bum bum.

352
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,780
Some people may look at that and like I've had people go

353
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,060
what the F is wrong with you?

354
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,220
You're stupid.

355
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,420
People are power.

356
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,740
You need your organization.

357
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,740
I said and it's tough for me because I yeah having getting

358
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,020
rid of my organization is a scary thing.

359
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,300
But business wise and my priority is improving the business.

360
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,660
It is a more efficient way to run all of those orgs.

361
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,420
I have made sure I've done a lot of work to make sure

362
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,660
they're going to land well.

363
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,060
They're in orgs I trust.

364
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,780
I've done all kinds of handoff.

365
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,380
It's the right thing to do and it's going to work out.

366
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,300
So what does that mean for me?

367
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,540
Because nothing's announced.

368
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,620
Nobody really knows yet.

369
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,260
I've had a lot of discussions with my new manager about

370
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,700
kind of what the role looks like.

371
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:56,030
And the joke with one of the development managers in

372
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,670
Montreal was which was actually good to hear.

373
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,110
He said so what are you going to do?

374
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,310
And I said I don't know.

375
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:04,910
I mean I have some ideas but nothing's announced so we're

376
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,790
still working it out.

377
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,190
I'm probably not going to get fired because if you're fired

378
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,870
I will hire you right away.

379
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,630
So it's good to hear.

380
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,390
It's like it's like I've established that you establish

381
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,230
that credibility.

382
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,110
So I still defining what the role is.

383
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,230
You wouldn't be fired though.

384
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,830
Yeah.

385
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,350
Well who knows.

386
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:24,550
Laid off.

387
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:25,830
Yeah it would be laid off.

388
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,230
OK there we go.

389
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,350
We'll talk more in details later.

390
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,710
I'm sorry I thought when I made the cliffhanger three

391
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:35,390
weeks ago that a lot more would have rolled through but

392
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,670
a lot of things happening going on slowed things down a

393
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:42,430
little bit. But definitely in a much broader scope role

394
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,190
across the organization which is good not leading

395
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,540
testers most likely leading another part of the

396
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:53,340
organization and in a role where I can ensure that

397
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,140
modern testing principles continue throughout the

398
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,140
organization which is kind of fun to do from a non QA

399
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,620
lead test lead position.

400
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,830
I've gone through the stages.

401
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,830
It's not the same as seven stages of grief.

402
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,270
I went through nervous.

403
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,350
Oh my God this sounds really hard to excited.

404
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,110
Oh but I can do this too anxious.

405
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,230
I want to get started.

406
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,550
And then in limbo here for a while I kind of like like

407
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,870
maybe anxious and frustrated a little bit on come on.

408
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,870
Let's just move forward.

409
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,430
But it's all the detail.

410
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:29,430
So we kind of know what the role is as far as

411
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,270
position in the organization.

412
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,230
But as my manager and I have developed a bit of a

413
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:38,590
relationship figuring out well what other is

414
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,390
actually really good.

415
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,190
I've never had a position where or a manager where

416
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,910
we're not just looking at what do you what's the

417
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,870
role you're going to do.

418
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,790
But what does that role grow into and how do you

419
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,950
and we've even had the conversation because I've

420
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:51,590
done this with testing.

421
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,750
It's like what would happen if you if in this

422
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,750
role you worked yourself out of the out of the

423
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,710
out of a role not a job out of a role and

424
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,470
figure out what's next.

425
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,350
Kind of making sure it's all set up for those

426
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,150
things to work out.

427
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,630
So that's kind of and I'm sorry to not have a

428
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,230
great answer to the cliffhanger to kind of one

429
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,670
of those like soap opera things where you get the

430
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,990
cliffhanger then in the next episode you don't

431
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,910
really get the answer but you just kind of get

432
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,630
strong on a little bit more.

433
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:24,270
That's kind of what we're doing here just so I

434
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,030
don't because it would be awkward right.

435
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:29,270
If I said I'm doing this job and then I put

436
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,350
podcast on Monday people go people listen to the

437
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,310
podcast is the weird thing I've mentioned

438
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,150
before about unity is didn't happen at Microsoft.

439
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:39,030
People in my organization people I know listen

440
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,670
to the podcast in fact like not just testers the

441
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:46,510
developers someone pointed out like it comes up.

442
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,580
Odd it's kind of embarrassing for me because I'm

443
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,500
used to having a podcast that nobody actually see

444
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,900
often or or who has who whose opinion matters

445
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,380
of me.

446
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Here's the podcast.

447
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,060
Yeah nothing against the three your opinions do

448
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,660
matter to me but I'll just see a random direct

449
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,780
consequence like I'll be in a discussion talking

450
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:10,100
about some things we're doing and then some

451
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,900
random developer and another team will say oh

452
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,380
yeah Alan talked about that on his podcast and

453
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,860
it kind of freaks me out a little bit.

454
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,980
It kind of it's kind of awkward not like it's I

455
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,860
don't know why it's awkward anyway I've been

456
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,420
talking for a while any thoughts or reactions or

457
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,940
questions.

458
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,300
First off first off I would like to know the

459
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:35,020
name of the developer in unity that that in a

460
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,980
public meeting tells you hey Alan Brent would

461
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,060
not approve of that.

462
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,700
I'd like to know their name I'll go take them to

463
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,180
coffee.

464
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,300
Yeah I haven't heard that yet.

465
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,420
Not yet but now coffees on the line.

466
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,770
Well it's good you broaden that to how do you

467
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,330
get that guy Brent to shut up.

468
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,590
Could that be a question that would earn them

469
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:03,310
coffee. No OK no. So any any praise for what I

470
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,710
am trying to do is figure out a way that I can

471
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,630
use the podcast to continue to torture you in

472
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,390
your day to day work like. Yeah yeah yeah.

473
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,200
You can tell them secrets. I don't really have

474
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,260
any though. Alan hates tequila. Whatever you do

475
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,580
don't give him tequila. Right. No he does. He

476
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,380
hates it tremendously.

477
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,540
Yeah I get where Alan's coming from. You've got

478
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,740
to think about the business. The thing is is

479
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,900
while they're working through plans and I do

480
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,700
have a little bit more of a sense than what

481
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,820
Alan's describing of what is going to happen to

482
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,500
him. I'll tell him I'll tell you guys what I

483
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,380
told him which is dude that is sweet. I'm sure

484
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,220
it is scaring the crap out of you right now.

485
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,780
But once you get in it'll be awesome. It'll just

486
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,780
be a matter of time. Yep I think so. That's

487
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,580
exactly it. When I first got an idea the scope

488
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,500
of the role I was quite scared. I said nervous

489
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,060
but maybe scared is right. But I thought the

490
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,500
more I thought through it the better I felt

491
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:24,300
and the more I've I've talked to people in a

492
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,260
little different way. We'll be able to talk

493
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,020
about this a little bit more later but I'm

494
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,060
settling into it even though it's not official.

495
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,560
And what's really interesting is the reaction

496
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,080
from my team as I move them out of their QA

497
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,880
roles working for me and to working within

498
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,840
their dev teams in a specialist role. And also

499
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,800
keep in mind that these people aren't doing

500
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,960
test things all day. And in fact we just had

501
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,360
our we had these three times a year discussions

502
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,920
at Unity called three keys three questions

503
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,760
about what is your mission at Unity. What are

504
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,320
you doing and how are you doing and just kind

505
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,400
of talk about just a reflective discussion

506
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,640
around career development what's going on. And

507
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,360
as I talk to people the amount of leadership

508
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:13,840
and influence and building and their focus on

509
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,480
building a quality culture is like yeah we're

510
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,640
fine. And I get from the development leads

511
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,160
these guys work with I get nothing but praise

512
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,040
and the fact that most of them are doing at

513
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,800
the very least things that would be that would

514
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,520
fall into the DevOps category and some full

515
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,320
on writing features as well as their testing

516
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,680
work. The confidence that the teams have with

517
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,840
them. I feel really good. There's one person on

518
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,320
my team. I'm going to have another talk with

519
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,920
them today is a little nervous about the

520
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:51,370
change. But the thing is I'm not leaving the

521
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,290
org and the other part is nobody's nervous

522
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,010
about oh my God is Alan leaving getting fired.

523
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,290
They just they which is weird. I'd like a

524
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:01,890
little bit more concerned over my career

525
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:05,850
given all the turmoil but whatever. I think

526
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,890
they feel like I'll land somewhere good and

527
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,910
they're right. But really all those ICS on

528
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,470
my team only one is a little nervous but I

529
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,870
think once the change actually happens and

530
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,150
they realize how little things are actually

531
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,950
changing because my influence is still there.

532
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:29,110
I will still meet with the dev managers

533
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,230
around the org. In fact when we do hiring in

534
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:34,550
these places for hiring more people as a test

535
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,150
specialist or a primary test specialist they

536
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,190
all be involved in hiring and job descriptions

537
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,150
et cetera. So it will be it should be very

538
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,910
should be noticeable very little that I'm in a

539
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,350
different role and there's no more QA

540
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,190
organization in the cloud org. I want to go

541
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:55,710
to a mailbag question I totally forgot to

542
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,570
do our last mailbag show. We can't fit them all

543
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,330
in or I can I didn't just forget to put

544
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:10,020
something we could. I can't tell that's an

545
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,620
I don't have my glasses that Aiden Boyd

546
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,380
could be all Aiden Aiden Boyd. Sorry.

547
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,500
Question for you Brent. I'll answer to how

548
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,700
much weight would you say clear leadership

549
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,580
direction holds when it comes to growing a

550
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,060
quality culture. Oh I'll probably have an

551
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,020
answer for this too. I am fortunate enough

552
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,020
to work in a delivery team where I am

553
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,620
confident that with time and many robust

554
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,940
but constructive conversations we can move

555
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,940
ourselves up the scale for most of the

556
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,260
quality culture capabilities. However

557
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,400
despite the healthy relationships and

558
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,000
generally positive attitude towards quality

559
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,240
within the delivery team there are no

560
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,600
clear company goals or metrics that we can

561
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,080
evaluate ourselves against. Is this

562
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,880
something we should seek out in order to

563
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,120
give us a stronger drive for quality and a

564
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,220
clearer sense of direction. Yes. No. It

565
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,740
depends. No. This one does not depend.

566
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,820
However despite. All right. So I'm reading

567
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,900
at the same time I'm glad I loaded it up

568
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,590
because I would have remembered three words

569
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,910
from that. How much weight would you say

570
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:27,010
clear leadership direction holds when it

571
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:31,650
comes to growing a quality culture. How

572
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,950
much. What do you think clear leadership

573
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:41,140
direction means. I think a vision. As the

574
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,300
question evolves its goals I think he's

575
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:46,460
saying should leadership provide quality

576
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,660
goals that the team tries to achieve.

577
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,970
How much how important is that. Yeah I

578
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,350
kind of interpret. However let me go to

579
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,750
the next thing because I think I

580
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,310
interpret this differently. However

581
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,110
despite the healthy relationships and

582
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,750
generally positive attitude towards

583
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:04,590
quality within the delivery team there

584
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,350
are no clear company goals or metrics

585
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,150
that we can use to evaluate ourselves

586
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,350
against. So that's the thing that

587
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:16,400
bothers me because what I hear is it

588
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,200
sounds like he's in a DevOps role. Did

589
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,920
I do that right. Yeah I'm not certain

590
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,440
what role he's in delivery team he

591
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,890
delivers babies. Okay if you don't know

592
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,170
where you're going any road will take

593
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:37,710
you there. So yeah you need to have. I

594
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,230
am a firm believer that you need to have

595
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,510
both qualitative and quantitative

596
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:49,300
definition of success. Right. If you're in

597
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,800
a role or if you're in a team how do

598
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,400
you define success. How do you how one

599
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,160
of the things I believe as a business

600
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,480
leader is I'm morally obligated to inform

601
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,850
my management when they no longer need

602
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,210
my team and should get rid of it. Right

603
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:16,300
but to me it is it is a vision statement

604
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,620
it is a goal that helps you to be

605
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:21,540
well efficient lean understand success

606
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,340
failure these are all important. Well

607
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,460
let's go back to the leadership row of

608
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,250
my quality culture transition guide

609
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,010
where it starts off with there's no

610
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,320
leadership support and then leadership

611
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,920
drives quality via metrics and score

612
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,840
cards right to leadership sets

613
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,520
principles and a clear vision and

614
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,430
then the most mature level is

615
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,190
leadership can mostly stay the heck out

616
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,510
of the way because the team has

617
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,950
internalized all those things. Even

618
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,130
further I think the final step is

619
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:03,370
leadership agrees with the principles

620
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:07,530
and visions set by the team. Yes so I

621
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,050
think leadership needs to be involved I

622
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:12,210
mean you can have some overarching goals

623
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,050
it's easy to fall from that third level

624
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,370
to that second level. And I want to be

625
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,490
careful about talking about leadership

626
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,130
versus management here. Yeah. I think

627
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,210
we're talking about management. Well we're

628
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,090
talking about whoever's sitting the

629
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,370
vision for the team. Right. Having a set

630
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,850
of specific goals defined for everyone

631
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,770
in the company around quality everyone

632
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,290
must have 80 percent code coverage.

633
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,850
Those things those are more of the how

634
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,120
having a high level of code coverage

635
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,080
reduces some risk so that'd be a how

636
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,400
I'd achieve a leadership goal of we want

637
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,310
four nines of uptime this year. We want

638
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,150
to lose less than ten thousand dollars

639
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,030
on revenue due to site being down.

640
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,750
Whatever right. Those are high level

641
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,990
goals those things below those a lot of

642
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,710
those quality culture bits are the how

643
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,830
you achieve that. And that vision can

644
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,750
just also help you determine how much

645
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,670
weight to put into different aspects of

646
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,510
the quality culture. When another thing

647
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,190
I reading between the lines on Aidan's

648
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,470
post is you know our team has a good

649
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,390
quality culture. He doesn't say anything

650
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,630
about other teams but I wonder if

651
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,270
between the lines and Aidan you can chime

652
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,190
in on slack if I'm kind of reading like

653
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,790
our team has high quality culture

654
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,350
principles but maybe other teams don't

655
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,710
I think they don't because leadership

656
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,390
doesn't have any goals in place. I

657
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,510
don't know if that's the case or not

658
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,910
but I kind of felt that a little bit

659
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,700
and it can be painful if your team

660
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,410
takes a lot of time on the how that

661
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,650
quality culture putting a lot of

662
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,370
effort into learning and improvement

663
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,290
and trying to do everything much better

664
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,210
all the time and you have some other

665
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,210
teams that don't have those same values

666
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,490
it's very easy in a lot of cases to say

667
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,770
well this is a leadership needs to

668
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:56,970
establish some goals so we're all on the

669
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,610
same page which actually isn't a horrible

670
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,130
idea but it's not the only way to get

671
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,930
every team on the same page as far as

672
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,770
quality culture goes. Can you from your

673
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,610
experience can you generalize let's

674
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,970
say you take two teams. Mm-hmm. Would

675
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,570
you be how would you go about

676
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,790
enumerating let's say team A in your

677
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:22,130
opinion has a better quality culture than

678
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:27,420
team B right. Okay. What might be things

679
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,900
that you would enumerate like obviously

680
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,980
that's going to be a multi scaler or

681
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:35,380
multi valued thing. That's actually

682
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,740
largely why I created that quality

683
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,060
culture transition guide as a way to to

684
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,060
have a conversation not to score a team

685
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,140
because I hate score cards that I hate

686
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,860
maturity models because they're used to

687
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,700
score cards but I use that grid as a

688
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,740
discussion point to talk with the team

689
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,400
on how they approach quality and what

690
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,960
are some areas they may need to improve

691
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,840
and would and tied into areas of risk

692
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,480
it I use that as a tool a lot in

693
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,120
retrospectives as a place to discover

694
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,600
places where a team may want to improve

695
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,200
so that's I don't know if I answer

696
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,440
your question directly but that's

697
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,360
well ask ask me again in a different

698
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,480
way. So what I read from Aidan's

699
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,760
post is is hey there are no clear goals

700
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,710
or metrics here right and it's it's

701
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,950
because number one we're talking about

702
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:27,310
culture which is hard to measure.

703
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:29,950
Number two we're talking about quality

704
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,950
culture which makes it even harder to

705
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,780
measure when it comes to measurements

706
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,580
though what what people generally do

707
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,960
is they they want to get a sense if

708
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,640
we can't measure it concretely can we

709
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,840
measure it relativistically so that we

710
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,680
can learn from others I do agree that I

711
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,600
do not like scorecards of this sense if

712
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:56,520
they're going to be used punitively but

713
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,170
if they're going to be used as hey on

714
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,370
lever number one team a is better on

715
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,450
quality culture and lever number two

716
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,050
team B right it then it helps to

717
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,810
encourage knowledge sharing so that

718
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,930
both teams can grow together that yeah

719
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:20,530
trick is to measure it without creating

720
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,330
competition or wrongly using Hawthorne's

721
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:29,330
effect yeah I I would definitely solve

722
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,490
the problem via sharing and celebrating

723
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,570
success to be more concrete let's say

724
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,250
team a is fantastic at retrospectives

725
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,650
and every single sprint they pick one

726
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,170
or two things they want to improve and

727
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,210
they get better and I'm going to

728
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,650
celebrate that because I want to team

729
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,410
B is not doing that I want to see how

730
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,450
much that's helping them even if team B

731
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,050
is better overall and then team B may

732
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:56,130
have they may have put together a

733
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,770
fantastic suite of tools and checks

734
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,610
and their CI system date of the art I

735
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,210
want to share and celebrate that and

736
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,370
get team team a may go oh we didn't

737
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,210
know we had that problem but yeah if

738
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,730
we borrow this we can do that so I

739
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:12,250
want to actually leverage the strengths

740
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,970
of each team to make the other team

741
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,610
better I love celebrating success yeah I

742
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,250
think it's very motivating I don't think

743
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,370
to two agents questions I don't and I

744
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,170
completely agree by the way I don't

745
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,050
think this is something that you can

746
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,330
you can really succeed with with a with

747
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:35,910
a with a hard fast quantitative measure

748
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:39,270
this is does not contradict the

749
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,910
statement I would said just a few

750
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:45,810
minutes ago though because you do need

751
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,490
you do need that to help guide and

752
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:51,210
measure and and show improvement in a

753
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:55,680
in a in a real sense I'll tell you a

754
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,640
problem that I have that's related to

755
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,760
something that you just mentioned

756
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,320
retrospective so here in Azure we have

757
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,540
a big retrospective process not in the

758
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,140
sense that we talk about with a small

759
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,300
agile team you can think of it closer

760
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,740
to like a old-school post-mortem process

761
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,620
but that process says in certain

762
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,420
instances you are required to file bugs

763
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,220
to prevent this from occurring again

764
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,720
okay whatever the this is I'm off you

765
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,160
skating on purpose and I knee-deep in a

766
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,060
lot of these conversations the issue I

767
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,980
have though is from a data science

768
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,900
point of view I am trying to figure out

769
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,540
a way are we just telling people to do

770
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,770
activity or is there any evidence that

771
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,860
this activity is actually helping right

772
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,100
because we don't have so let's say you

773
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,500
have a monitor here's an example let's

774
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,590
say you had an outage and and it took

775
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,470
you three days to respond because you

776
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,230
didn't have a monitor for it your

777
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,230
customer actually got impacted and

778
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,520
called in now you go you build that

779
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,180
monitor but that three-day outage is a

780
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,840
one-in-a-lifetime event sharks slam into

781
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,200
something that caused power to go out

782
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,480
right and we didn't detect it right that

783
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,720
two months that they used to build that

784
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,360
monitor yeah so a quick story that I

785
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,880
want to get to the closing here is

786
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,540
that's a common problem in engineering

787
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,740
off often we will over optimize on the

788
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,180
edge case not just for monitoring I saw

789
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,780
it recently internally I'm not going to

790
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,820
tell any details but a bunch of smart

791
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,340
people got together to review how

792
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:56,340
something was going and they started

793
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,260
thinking of these bizarre edge cases

794
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,140
next thing you know a team is like

795
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,300
trying to write a bunch of code to

796
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,900
solve these bizarre edge cases it's like

797
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,190
stop stop stop stop stop no this is

798
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,790
never going to happen it would be why

799
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:16,230
don't we just prevent people from trying

800
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,190
to do this stupid edge case versus

801
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,870
trying to enable this thing that is

802
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,070
theoretically possible but will likely

803
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:25,910
very likely never happen in a million

804
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,830
gazillion years the the thing is it's

805
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,230
fascinating and to be fair I love

806
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,510
their thinking of edge cases because

807
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,470
that's that's that systems thinking you

808
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,750
know but you have to actually

809
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,310
think about it from a risk perspective

810
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:42,550
as well and once you know the edge cases

811
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:45,590
you got to think around okay how do we

812
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,950
generalize these things into a different

813
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,950
group like I like like the suggestion of

814
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,350
oh turns out if we turn off this whole

815
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:56,620
menu item all of these edge cases go

816
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,500
away yes there's a couple of feature

817
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,460
take backs but but you know no one uses

818
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,460
those we need to help the move from

819
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,500
testing specialist or risk specialist

820
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,420
we need people that can look at the

821
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,740
bigger picture that if I risk versus

822
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,900
think of new test ideas yes and actually

823
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,620
so multiple times on the podcast I've

824
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,580
detailed a bunch of insights I've learned

825
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:23,740
when I went to Bing okay there's when

826
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,940
you're in that space it's a game

827
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,540
changer testing does not make sense in

828
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,700
the context we're used to and Bing

829
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,260
everything changes every second oh my

830
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,340
god are you saying testing is dead

831
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:39,480
moving on oh my god here you here in

832
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,500
Azure there is a different phenomenon

833
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:51,510
edge cases suddenly impact thousands of

834
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:57,000
people because things are we are so

835
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,440
popular we have so many different

836
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:03,480
widgets running in the cloud and the

837
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:07,110
system is extremely flexible even the

838
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:10,430
case it only happens point one percent

839
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:13,940
of the time is a large number of

840
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,110
important things impacted yeah there's a

841
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:22,220
real problem there what I keep

842
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:26,220
thinking through is okay on I always go

843
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,920
back to ROI what is if we if we try

844
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,960
to define quality or our quality culture

845
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,880
we need to invest in terms of some sort

846
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,150
of return on investment and so yeah if you

847
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,190
can't measure return that at minimum

848
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:51,270
needs to be fixed in terms of metrics

849
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,310
and goals for a for a quality culture

850
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:56,590
sure it can be anyway yeah yes I agree

851
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:58,990
one last thing I want to talk about

852
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:03,870
before we go is the upcoming episode 100

853
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:07,930
of a be testing someday soon someday

854
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,770
soon about a month which will as my if

855
00:45:10,770 --> 00:45:12,450
I look at my math correctly when I get

856
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,010
the date exactly right but will also

857
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,410
remarkably happen very very very close to

858
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,690
the five-year anniversary of the AB

859
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,770
testing podcast of episode one which if

860
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,690
you go back and listen is a piece of

861
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:30,340
junk it's awful some people want to go

862
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,100
back and start at one for completion and

863
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,620
I tell you stop starting the 40s or

864
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,500
somewhere we could turn one into like a

865
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,220
two-year prequel and just reset the

866
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,940
nut up I am toying with the idea of a

867
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:49,660
call-in show for episode 100 I am going

868
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,540
to gauge interest among the three I'll

869
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:56,140
also ask on Twitter will try and get a

870
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,380
date set of definitely a few weeks in

871
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,940
advance I'll work it out with Brent we

872
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,460
do a little bit of a longer recording

873
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,420
time I think I can pull it off I'm gonna

874
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,060
do a little bit of technical work in

875
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:09,140
between but if you're interested in

876
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,220
being part of that show please ping me on

877
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,220
Twitter ping me an email ping me on our

878
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,660
slack team and we'll try and find some

879
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,980
times that work it'll be awkward if

880
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,740
like only one person dials in but I

881
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,300
thought it'd be fun give it a shot I

882
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:27,900
have no idea how it will work it's

883
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,780
probably stupid to do such a big

884
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,820
experiment for for such a milestone

885
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,660
episode but then I could just call it if

886
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,540
it fails I can call it 99 a if we're

887
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,780
gonna fail let's fail glory you know I

888
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,380
was talking to someone on my team

889
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,740
recently and he said the team's being

890
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:49,540
really paranoid very caught they're

891
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,380
being says being overly cautious about

892
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,620
releases and I said that team that

893
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,740
product they need to screw up more

894
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,520
and he nodded his head like is the the

895
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,280
test room a team yeah so they need to

896
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,680
the testing specialist who's actually

897
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,360
doing mostly DevOps work said you're

898
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,200
the team is just you're not learning if

899
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,240
you're not screwing up mess some things

900
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,880
up practice rollback don't be so darn

901
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,400
paranoid just f things up a little bit

902
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,720
and it got the message I mean it's

903
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,040
probably a little bit over the top but

904
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,760
but yeah we should screw it up just so

905
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:22,600
we can learn what works and what

906
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,580
doesn't yes all right man yes good

907
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,900

908
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,900

909
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,500
weeks talk a little bit more about my

910
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,100
new role if it's still not defined in

two weeks then well we'll be par for the

912
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,180
course I've been in limbo for a while

913
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,380
trying to get things finalized but

914
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,140

915
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,980

916
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,340
