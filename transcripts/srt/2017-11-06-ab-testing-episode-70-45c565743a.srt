00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,660
Good morning, everyone. Hello.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,820
Morning. Hey, there's someone else in the room.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,630
There is fire.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,180
Let's see what happens. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And I'm Steve.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,060
Welcome to ABS testing. Hey, ABS.

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,900
We're plastic. Abs. Abs testing. We will improve your abs.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,040
Steve Rowe is back for a return engagement on the AB testing podcast.

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,840
You last heard him on episode 46. Is that right?

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,600
That is. Thank you very much for bringing me back.

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,160
He has it framed on his wall, the digital bits, some ones and zeros framed in a gold frame.

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,840
It's a big wallpaper. It takes the whole wall.

12
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,600
Yeah, he bought that himself.

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,520
Actually, that's kind of a geeky, cool idea. I have a welcome mat with Tangentime.

14
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,760
I have a welcome mat with like welcome written in binary. But what if you just,

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,860
you could make some wallpaper. It could say you could put a book and just decode it to

16
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,940
ones and zeros.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,220
And have that be your wallpaper for your hex codes.

18
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:13,380
Yeah.

19
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,460
Now, then you could sit in there and you could get a table in the middle

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,620
and you could do on that table. You could build the new $800 Millennium Falcon from Lego.

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,940
There you go. It's pretty impressive. I saw it at the mall.

22
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,180
We were talking about the the Lego Millennium Falcon before we recorded.

23
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,170
So I had to bring it up.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,330
So I wonder what book would you pick and how big of a room would you need to put the whole book?

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,130
These are things that I haven't thought through yet.

26
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,890
It could just be with binary. It could just be a short passage.

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,570
You know what? It could even be a digital representation of my favorite picture.

28
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,170
It could be Lorem Ipsum.

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,220
Yeah, that's what it should be.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,220
That way you can mass produce it. We have to be custom.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:01,620
We're just making nice Lorem Ipsum generated into binary wallpaper ones and zeros.

32
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,780
Someone's going to take that idea and make a lot of money and I'm going to be mad.

33
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,300
Custom binary wallpaper.

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,940
Isn't that like the matrix screensaver in wallpaper form?

35
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,380
Oh yeah.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,100
Okay, so we have, welcome Steve. We have an agenda, right?

37
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,820
Theoretically.

38
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,380
Theoretically we have some stuff written on the whiteboard to get through.

39
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,220
Brent, why is Steve here?

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,100
He's our favorite guest ever.

41
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,580
He is.

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,900
Yay me.

43
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,740
That's true. That is true.

44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,020
He is our favorite guest ever. So we'll give him that.

45
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,020
So I think there are some other reasons. I'll see if I can guess since you're

46
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,620
unwilling to take the lead from me.

47
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,180
I think Steve knows a lot about applying data to quality and testing.

48
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,300
And I also think that Steve just gave a talk on a similar subject at Star Canada.

49
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,980
Yeah, one of the themes that we've been talking about a lot lately is more pushing

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,380
the test industry to get more and more active with their data.

51
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:19,380
Move away slightly or begin to move away from this prevention model and

52
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,690
using data to react and drive towards better customer quality.

53
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,530
So Steve had did a talk in Star Canada.

54
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,650
When was it? Last week?

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,370
About two weeks ago.

56
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,730
Blame Canada.

57
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:36,810
In Canada.

58
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,500
I am doing a similar talk for this unknown little company in Bellevue on Tuesday.

59
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,860
So Brent's going to this tangent time because Brent's all excited that he's on the guest list.

60
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:56,820
My entire team from around the world is descending upon Bellevue.

61
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,340
First people arriving amidst a flurry of snow today, arriving through the weekend.

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,140
We're going to spend Monday through Thursday doing a lot of work together.

63
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,300
We have a few external speakers coming in and most of my leads dried up.

64
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,660
So I had Brent come in.

65
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,580
Wow, scraping the bottom of that barrel.

66
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,740
And Brent's going to talk about applying data to quality.

67
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,580
And by the end of this podcast, he may be fired and Steve may be coming in,

68
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,940
but we'll just kind of see how it goes.

69
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,500
Just let me know.

70
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,060
Anyway.

71
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,700
Yeah.

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,460
My manager had a meeting.

73
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,740
He wanted to schedule on top of that and I'm like, no, can't do that.

74
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,180
Maybe I can do that meeting after all.

75
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,460
All right.

76
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,580
Steve knows about data quality.

77
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,620
Right? Were you going to set him up to ever talk or is he just going to sit there and say,

78
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,500
yep, and laugh at me picking on you?

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm like a little sidekick on the talk shows.

80
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,340
I just laugh a little bit.

81
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,300
Throw some jokes out.

82
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,020
Yes.

83
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,580
Steve is actually wearing a Robin costume right now.

84
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,660
It's a little awkward, but it's adequate.

85
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,420
It's actually no, it's actually for a game called hand of the gods.

86
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,070
So yeah, which is my new addiction.

87
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,210
So so Steve and I chatted briefly.

88
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:20,650
I thought that this was an interesting adjunct to what we've been talking about here.

89
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:29,210
So Steve, why don't you describe number one, what you went to start candidate to to present.

90
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:36,970
And then be interested to hear sort of what your take of Star Canada in terms of.

91
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:46,220
We've been talking here a lot lately around this idea of a modern test team versus a traditional one.

92
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,300
Love to hear your insights around what you observed along those topics at Star.

93
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,860
Sure. So I came to start a talk about using data in in testing.

94
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,060
Like actually a lot of the content that was that I presented was stuff we talked about back in

95
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,060
episode 46. If I actually went back and listened to that to remind myself of some of the good

96
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,020
ideas that I'd forgotten since then. So I talked about.

97
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,260
So are you saying we've talked about this before?

98
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,180
I am saying we've talked about this before.

99
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,980
Just checking.

100
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,780
Drink.

101
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,180
Yeah, exactly.

102
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:20,220
So I went to talk about how to use data in your testing and I kind of had to gauge.

103
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,860
It was interesting. I didn't know what audience exactly I was going to have to

104
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,220
at the conference. So I wrote up a set of slides and then throughout the conference as I

105
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,380
saw other presenters and talk to people I tweaked my slides to kind of aim at the right audience.

106
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,180
I didn't know.

107
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,580
By the way, I love that technique. I use that a lot.

108
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,260
It works pretty well. So they ask you for your slides like months in advance,

109
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,780
but you present your own copy so you can change them.

110
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,540
Actually, something I learned from our buddy James Whitaker is always change your slides.

111
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,700
Turn in your slides because they want them in advance, but change them.

112
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,860
And then you can say, oh, if you want to copy these latest slides,

113
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,820
you can download them from my website that drives traffic to your website.

114
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,740
Does it actually drive traffic to your website?

115
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,100
If you're James Whitaker, it does.

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,620
Oh, okay. I don't think I got much traffic.

117
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,660
I said you can ask me on Twitter and I don't think anybody ever did.

118
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,900
But anyway, so I was talking about using data in testing.

119
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,300
So I talked through kind of the history of testing, how we kind of went from manual testing

120
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,260
to kind of more automated testing. And then I'm moving to this more

121
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,380
data-driven quality or what you guys are calling modern testing.

122
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,500
I talked to that. I talked through ways to bootstrap your area into using data.

123
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,940
You know, use the data that's already in your log files, then add some instrumentation, et cetera.

124
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:33,900
So I talked through kind of all that and how you get to the point where you can start using data.

125
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,540
Because a lot of these people come from a background of very traditional, very manual testing.

126
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,820
And so they're not even at automated testing a lot of times.

127
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,100
And so it's quite a leap forward.

128
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,300
So I was kind of trying to introduce that topic to them and say, hey, this is coming.

129
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,940
You know, you should be familiar with this thing. Here's kind of what's going on.

130
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,420
The conference itself, there was an interesting kind of tension that seemed to be going on at the

131
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,900
conference. The big word in the air was DevOps, which doesn't mean quite what DevOps always means.

132
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,140
But it seemed to be more just a bunch of automation.

133
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,100
And so there was definitely people like I saw a talk, a very good talk actually,

134
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,260
on behavior-driven development, which was really more unified engineering.

135
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,820
And why getting your dev team and your test team together and having them start at the same

136
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:24,060
time is a good plan. And if you're in a box software prevention world, it's a great model.

137
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,700
Obviously, we think that we're moving beyond that model now. And that's insufficient for

138
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,980
most purposes now. But I saw some of that talk. But I also saw the whole,

139
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,460
ML is not coming to eat you talk. And I saw a discussion about how none of you are like

140
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,980
Netflix and none of you are like Amazon. And so you can't use any of these techniques

141
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:45,820
because you're all special snowflakes and have to do all your manual testing.

142
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,780
You know, and so there's this kind of, it was interesting.

143
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

144
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,460
Yep.

145
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,540
Can you add some clarity around like the themes you picked up or the argument around how ML is

146
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,060
not coming to eat you?

147
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,380
I can't actually. So the talk that I saw there was the conclusion was literally here's

148
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,220
an introduction to ML. And then the conclusion was I talked to my friend who's really good

149
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,220
at this stuff. And he said it's not eat, it's not going to come. That was literally his argument.

150
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,100
I was, I was boggled, but that was literally the argument.

151
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,040
Very, very statistical.

152
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,120
So there is an expert who says it's not coming. That was, that was the conclusion of the talk.

153
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,360
He didn't really quite describe exactly what ML was going to eat as far as testing. Like,

154
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,640
I think it's going to impact testing, but I don't think we're going to get rid of all testing

155
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,560
because ML can just, you just pointed ML algorithm at your app and it comes back and says green or

156
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:42,070
red. That would seem to violate the halting principle. So there are, and I'm going to

157
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:50,220
jump in because there is so much confusion mainly among testers. I'll say in the industry to be nice

158
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:57,500
around some around ML. I get everything from, uh, like what you said, it's not going to cut.

159
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,470
Nothing's going to happen. I could ignore it. It's fine to thinking it's magic.

160
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,230
I can just take my tests. I drop them into this ML app. I guess I say with eyes tweaked and rolled

161
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,430
and then the ML app spits out everything I need to know everything about my product is

162
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:21,190
high quality magic happens. And this, so I've heard both sides of that and DevOps is just crazy.

163
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,150
I've heard it's not that difficult of a concept to understand, but I guess it's been,

164
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,230
the word's been used in enough context that nobody knows what it means anymore.

165
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,270
Right. Well, I think there's, there's a, there's a spectrum as far as I can tell,

166
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,710
reading the literature, which is not respected by a lot of people talking. So there's a spectrum

167
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,710
of operations, right? How do I maintain my service? Right. So there's what they traditionally

168
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:45,510
call service ops, which is I have a bunch of people who are not generally programmers who run

169
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:51,020
around and try with scripting and manual work to keep the service running. Right.

170
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:57,420
I saw a post recently, um, from an unnamed tester talking about how the DevOps basically

171
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,260
paraphrased the DevOps concept was stupid because it just meant that dev and operations work

172
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,820
together and it should be called dev test PM ops or something. Cause everyone works together.

173
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,380
Yeah. Cause that really rolls off the tongue. Yeah.

174
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,820
It's not quite the point that's that happens. Yeah. There's just shut up.

175
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,220
In my reading DevOps seems to be more like what I perceive as the Amazon model, which is you don't

176
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,380
have much of an ops team. You have a dev team and the dev team is on pager duty all the time to

177
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,780
keep your stuff running. And I go even farther going into the world of rent and I, and I would

178
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,180
say it's a world that favors specializing generals and generalizing specialists. Well,

179
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,220
the better people that can do the operation stuff as well as the dev, as well as the QA and the test,

180
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,660
whatever you want to call it. I think the issue, like I think I find this dev ops thing, uh,

181
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:52,460
interesting because in the last few months I've seen a high spike in test leaders sort of

182
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,420
communicating or implying that that's the direction STEs are going. I think it's,

183
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,340
I think people are caught up in the buzzword. People are. And that's, that was,

184
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:10,150
that's my point. Like, uh, I think, I think you're right. Data science, uh, still today in a very

185
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:17,830
high degree is somewhat magical in terms of people's understanding. And I think DevOps is sort of the

186
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:26,150
same sort of thing. I think it's both of these terms have been blown up to some concept that's

187
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,510
not real in either case. Right. Well, we should finish the spectrum, right? There's the center of

188
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,710
the spectrum, which is what I believe Google uses, uh, which is called SRE or service reliability

189
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,630
engineering, which is basically you take a dev and you put them into the ops team and you tell them

190
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,990
how you have to spend half your time making the system better. In some ways, it's just like the

191
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,670
old world. You had your devs, which is your DevOps. You have your STEs, uh, or your software test

192
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,830
engineers, your manual testers, um, which are kind of your ops, your service ops. And then you

193
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,470
got SREs, which are kind of akin to your S debts. They're, you know, coding versions of

194
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:06,820
the service ops. Yeah. The, the thing I think about STEs moving into DevOps,

195
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,060
to me, that kind of in some aspects makes sense. They're not actually DevOps, but I see a lot of

196
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,700
executives saying, Hey, I want to have one of these things too. And what we are observing,

197
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:30,460
I think is an executive point of view that essentially STEs are nothing but manual monkeys.

198
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:37,500
And now we, we no longer need manual monkeys in the preventative world, but we do need them in

199
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,860
the service maintenance world. And I think that's not a terrible thought to go about, right? The,

200
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,020
the difficulty is this, I think that you, and I noticed this tension at star, you have a certain

201
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,620
number of people that come from kind of a dev background, right? Those are your traditional S

202
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,100
debts or even devs that are, that are doing some testing. And then you have people that come from

203
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:03,580
the traditional STE manual testing background. And though some of those people for whatever reason,

204
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,380
because they, they find it difficult or because they choose not to have no sense of how to

205
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,940
program, right? They have no sense of how to, how to do a dev skill. And so they're kind of stuck

206
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,380
in a world where they want to find another world that also requires them to have that same,

207
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,180
you know, kind of skill set. And without learning data science, which is a huge leap forward,

208
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,300
or learning to program Python, which is again, a very difficult leap forward for,

209
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,620
to do it competently for, for a certain group of people, they need to find a world to live.

210
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,780
And so part of star Canada was DevOps is the place you can go. And part of star Canada was

211
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,620
it's okay. ML and, you know, even test automation are not the right solution, right? The people

212
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,340
that are, there was literally a statement that said, you know, all thinking happens in testing and

213
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,060
not in automated testing. People who do automated testing aren't thinking was the implication.

214
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,100
Yeah, that that's Alan's favorite checking versus testing.

215
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,300
Stupid semantic arguments that mean nothing except for the people that invented them.

216
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,700
So that was out loud. I think there is actually an interesting thing that happens here because

217
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,940
it's kind of a semantic argument, but it's not right. And so I was telling Brent about this,

218
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:19,060
there's a, there's a logical fallacy called the mot and Bailey fallacy. So in Europe,

219
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,780
they used to have a castle on a hill, right? And that was called a mot, M O T T E, but it's just

220
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,940
a castle on the hill. And then around it, you had a much larger area that was fenced off. And

221
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,020
that's where everybody lived. And when the enemies came, you know, when the Germans or whatever came

222
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:35,620
to invade your area, you ran back to the castle and you defended your castle. And then

223
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,660
when you finally fought them off, you went back to your homes in the wider area.

224
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,260
This is a logical fallacy that happens a lot where somebody makes a claim to a large area. And when

225
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,020
you attack it, they fall back to a very small area and then assume that they've defended the

226
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,380
large area by defending the small area. And so I had a conversation with one particular gentleman

227
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,100
who was attacking the concept of automated testing, using this checking versus testing,

228
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,820
like check automated testing is only checking and nobody smart ever does that. And so I started

229
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,220
challenging him. He's like, Oh, no, no, test tools are fine to use in the appropriate place.

230
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,740
Very small defensive situation. But then as soon as you let him go, he was back to like all automated

231
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,380
testing is a bunch of idiots. Well, the world is changing. I think people like I think a lot of

232
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:24,710
people and we've not to digress even farther, but a lot of testers, they don't want the world to

233
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,270
change. They're digging in, they're afraid of change. Star and other conferences are good for

234
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,590
that. They can see what kind of changes may happen. But it's unfortunate they see both.

235
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,910
Like here's some changes that could happen. And the best people saying no, no, it's okay. Keep on doing

236
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,470
what you're doing. I think star would be better suited. And there was a lot of speakers here that

237
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:47,350
were this way. But I think more speakers should be here's how to move to the new world, as opposed to

238
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:52,070
here's a defense of your old world. It feels to me here's how to dig in and stay right where you

239
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,790
are because there's no need to move. You brought up the idea of specializing generalists and

240
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,470
generalizing specialists. I did just a few moments ago. And I actually think this type of stress

241
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:14,870
is cause when you have built your career around specialization and then that tombstones.

242
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:20,710
I agree. And the point I would make is you go to these conferences, I think if what you take away

243
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,790
is all I need to do is keep on doing what I'm doing because nothing else needs to change.

244
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:31,510
You've blown your opportunity of the conference. Your success anywhere in software, anywhere in

245
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,710
knowledge work requires that you continue to acquire new skills and learn new things.

246
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:43,450
It doesn't have to be, I learned how to write in Python, but it does mean like, Oh, I know how to

247
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,130
make my testing a lot more efficient by creating a teeny little shell script. It sets up a Docker

248
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,330
container with our server on it. So I can do some quick testing much faster than I could before.

249
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,290
For example, you need to, there's a hundred examples like that. You need to be able to

250
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:05,130
press F 12 in your browser on your web app and look at the traffic going on. And even if you don't

251
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:10,490
understand everything, understand like, Oh, that's probably bad. I should ask someone about that. You

252
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:18,710
need, you can't just do your exploratory human engaged. Don't call it manual testing because

253
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:23,590
it's, it kills a kitten. Yes. Every time you use the word manual testing, a kitten dies. I've been

254
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:34,260
told that manual testing, manual testing, manual testing, dog guy. So yeah. Uh, down from my soapbox,

255
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:42,500
blood pressure calming to use a logical fallacy. I mean, I can't, like the Martin Bailey is okay.

256
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,260
The Martin Bailey, right? The, that sounds like a brand of stout. It totally does. It totally does.

257
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:56,820
Or, uh, yeah. Uh, a Scotch beer. The thing I've, I've heard just over and over again,

258
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:05,160
is that sort of fallacy around the discussion of whether or not test is dead or dying. Right. Um,

259
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:14,490
I, sure. So, so because we can find one example and I would say the medical industry is the most

260
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:23,450
common, commonly used one in, in defense. Hey, if it's essentially, if it can be proven that at least

261
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:31,050
one test job in the entire world is not under threat, therefore all of testing is not under threat.

262
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:37,290
That's I think the Martin Bailey argument and it's wrong. Yeah. That very much is right. Like,

263
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,290
I think that all of testing is good. That's your Bailey. That's your large set. All manual

264
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,690
testing is good and you attack it. You're like, well, here's what it doesn't need it. Yeah,

265
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,210
but it's really needed for the medical industry. Okay. That's true. It's needed for the medical

266
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,410
industry. Therefore it's needed everywhere. And that's where the logical fallacy comes in. You've

267
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,250
only defended a small piece of turf and you're making a claim that you've defended a large one.

268
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:59,050
And then usually my, my counter argument to this is I, I point people, all right,

269
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:05,530
let's go to monster.com and look up cold ball jobs. Hey, looks like they're still around.

270
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:11,210
So we have what? Multiple millions. What would be our guest best estimate of,

271
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:18,490
of manual testers in the world right now? I don't know. Let's say 42, 42 million. It doesn't

272
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:22,170
matter. It's not a million. I definitely met more than 42 at, at Star Canada. So I think,

273
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,650
I think you're off by a little bit. So, so let's just say a million. I have no idea what that would

274
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:33,780
be though. It could be an interesting data question. 20, 30 years ago, about the same

275
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,060
cold ball programmers. Now go to monster.com and look how many of them are today. Yeah. They

276
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:44,820
still exist. Does that mean cold ball is a thriving business? I've been studying it at my

277
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,900
spare time. I think it's the future. Do you? Yeah. Really? Natural language programming.

278
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:56,260
I'm not sure I like the metaphor. Um, but no, I just feel like a lot of the, the fallacies come

279
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:04,840
from a, this bias. This is, I, I like what I do. I don't want to change what I do. So I'm going

280
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,400
to look for it's confirmation bias. I'm going to look for things that support the fact,

281
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,440
anything that support the fact that I don't want to change. I don't need to change.

282
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,960
Right. And that's, this is natural, right? This goes back a long time in history, right? We have,

283
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,720
when I impose a fallacy while I'm having another fallacy, is that fallacy inception?

284
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,440
It could be. Okay. Just check it. Anyway, go on. That's going to a really weird spot. Um,

285
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,540
so anyway, I mean, we have this, this story back in, I don't remember like the 1500s or whatever,

286
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,620
when they started coming up with automated looms, right? In order to do weaving and everybody who

287
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,020
had done weaving before was threatened by these automated looms. And so they started in some

288
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,580
towns in London or in England, they started smashing the looms, um, in order to defend them

289
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,740
because they were, they were bad for the human psyche and you know, and all that kind of stuff.

290
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,660
Right. And today we, the guy who ran that was named Ludd and we call them Luddites,

291
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,460
right? And that's kind of not been generalized to anybody who's against technology.

292
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,620
But really it's the same thing going on. Somebody's trying to defend their, you know,

293
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,380
their livelihood and make sure that it doesn't change, but you can't really stand in the way of

294
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,700
the freight train of the future coming. No. And, uh, maybe five years ago,

295
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,420
six years ago, somewhere back, there's a blog post on this. I did. Uh, I was driving into work

296
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,540
and there was a news article that Amazon was going to start use some robots to automate a

297
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,380
lot of their, uh, pick selection for shipping things and eliminate some human jobs. And

298
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:29,060
people were calling in just irate. They said, this is ridiculous. Taken away human jobs. You

299
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:34,340
know, this is, and I thought this is the same argument. This is stuff that is brain dead,

300
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,420
boring, easy to automate. Let's automate it. Let's use humans to actually think about

301
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,340
solving harder problems. When didn't Amazon just announced they have something like 500,000

302
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,780
employees. So clearly it didn't cost that many jobs. I saw an advertisement around it being

303
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:54,820
pick season now. And, uh, they, Amazon's doing ads on TV saying, Hey, it's pick season. We want

304
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,500
to hire a whole bunch of folks. They still need season because the robots can't keep up. It's not

305
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,340
doesn't make sense to invest in enough robots to, uh, optimize for peak season for pick season

306
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,140
for holidays. Peak peak. I think you're right. I think it's very similar in the world of,

307
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:12,980
of testing, right? Where there are things like Brent talked about medical devices and probably

308
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,700
planes and some other things where, um, you know, the, the, the economics or the situation

309
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,900
require that you go and do this kind of stuff. I don't think manual testing is ever going to go

310
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,660
away, but it's going to become more and more limited in where it is necessary to apply.

311
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:32,420
I agree. And then, and then to the people, um, who have neophobia, which is the fear of new

312
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:39,380
allows the fear of, uh, Keanu Reeves. I have that. Yeah. Different thing. Um,

313
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,860
those who have neophobia, like even in that world, when it shrinks and, and yeah, it's sure

314
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,830
there's going to be a world where manual testing specialists still have jobs, but it's going to

315
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:58,550
be the best of the best who have them. So I look at my team, Alan talks about working in unity.

316
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:07,350
So I have 40 people ish on my team. Uh, I, let me count in my head. I have one, two,

317
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:21,060
just one, Brent, just one, one, two, three, four, five. I think five are air quote STEs,

318
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,060
meaning they don't actually, they all know how to code a little bit into a lot. Uh, one of them

319
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:32,660
is a game developer. The value they, they are the best of the best, the value they, they're all

320
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,020
fantastic. Well, I respect the other people making, not just like pushing, like,

321
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,380
I don't want to equate the manual tester to, or the STE to pushing buttons, but they,

322
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,180
they're, they most of them function like little mini test managers for me. They're making sure

323
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,260
the whole product was put together, right? They're doing, they're doing all of the

324
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:55,060
organizational work for their feature areas. Pretty much, uh, they're keeping their features

325
00:24:55,060 --> 00:25:00,020
and products running. It's a, it's a, it's a not an entry level rule by any means.

326
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,140
Well, I think that there's, there's a difference between what that kind of, uh, manual tester

327
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,540
does exploratory kind of manual tester and what most manual testers, most of Brent's million,

328
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:14,260
actually ended up doing like most of the million manual testers end up doing the same thing

329
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,940
every day over and over again. And it really, it's not a whole lot different than pushing a

330
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,300
button and, you know, getting a piece of candy out of the bottom of it. Right. I mean, you're,

331
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,700
some people call them monkey testers and I don't mean to demean it, but I think that sometimes you

332
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,620
get put in that position where, where that's what you do. I was in a position at one point in time

333
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,820
where I spent, you know, all day running the same test that I ran the day before,

334
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,940
which are the same tests we ran the day before, just to make sure that the newest version of,

335
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,700
at this point, windows 98 didn't break. So let me dive deeper into, I get up on a soapbox again,

336
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:48,660
because it's fun is a big part of their job is managing not in traditional sense. I'll use a

337
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,380
different word, uh, dealing, communicating with people are on people around the team,

338
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:59,220
around the company to help unity product overall. You're talking about your, your five SCs. Yeah.

339
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,260
Yeah. They do a lot of communication, talking developers, talking to their testers, coordinating.

340
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:11,940
Uh, we don't have very many, uh, what are our PMs called product managers? I was joking with the

341
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,980
interview Canada this week. I don't know. I'm just going to call you a PM because I don't know

342
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,180
whether you're a product manager, a project manager or program manager. I don't even know the

343
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,500
difference in some cases, but we don't have very many product managers. So these SDEs do a lot of

344
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,620
that coordination, making sure the right things are happened, making sure the right people are

345
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,860
thinking about things. And the reason I bring that up is I do hear again, some of the digging

346
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,340
in my heels, uh, test is not changing. Don't worry about it. Don't worry. You worry your pretty

347
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:43,620
little heart. Uh, people, I hear them say comments like, uh, they're very much in this world of,

348
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,020
see how you can describe this without sounding too stupid testing as information provider,

349
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:52,340
which we've raked on before. They say, okay, you fat is a problem in your system.

350
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,060
That's all you have to do is report that it's at the management now to figure out what to do.

351
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,180
One thing, and this is even true at Microsoft, don't, don't pick on you too much, but

352
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,740
if you defer every little gripe you have to management to solve the problem for you,

353
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,620
like mom and dad, they're not playing right.

354
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,620
You have to play together nicely. It's my order.

355
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,260
They just be friends. Yeah. Uh, this is one of the places where,

356
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,220
I mean, in that particular one, this is one of the places where I firmly stand behind

357
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:31,580
ML is going to eat that job. Right. MML stats work. It doesn't take a lot of effort

358
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:40,180
to automate information providing in that regard. Right. Sure. The, there's going to be,

359
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:45,540
there's going to be some challenge around context sensitivity, but you have the right team coming

360
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:52,260
and put things in place. The PM himself can, can put that to add that additional context.

361
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,820
Do not need a full time man or a monkey to do it.

362
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,940
Yeah. And I don't think it's actually the ML is solving the problem for you. I think it's that we

363
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,180
can build tooling that allows you to self-service much better, right? Once upon a time, you know,

364
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:07,540
every executive in America had a secretary whose job it was to type for them nowadays.

365
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:12,820
Everybody who's even CEOs know how to type, right? Like we've made that job obsolete because we taught

366
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,820
it to the, you know, to the other person. I think to some extent there's a job of go get me the

367
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,220
data that I need or go find out how the situation is. And the more we can build tools to expose

368
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,740
that better, the more somebody in the PM job or the more somebody in the C, you know, the

369
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:30,420
manager job can just go find for themselves what that is. And they don't have to have somebody to

370
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:35,940
go interpret for them. I think there are a lot of unknown unknowns in this, in this growth path

371
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,540
where if you don't know anything about how the program works or how to write code,

372
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:46,020
you may not realize that this boring thing you do every day could be easily automated.

373
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:50,420
Where we've grown out of that world a little bit. And now we're into with this new world

374
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,660
of data and machine learning. Often we don't know, Alice is really hard to figure out.

375
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,020
I don't know how I'm, I'll just, it's just hard. I can't do it, but we don't know.

376
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,620
They don't know, or we don't know that, Oh, actually this is a problem that can be solved

377
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,580
given the right skillset and tools. So I think we're growing into the world where we need to,

378
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,580
or a lot of us need to figure out like when we have these hard problems,

379
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,660
there's actually a way to solve them where we might think there isn't a way to solve them.

380
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,060
And the thing that I think the rest of us have to be sensitive to is that this does,

381
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,060
when we make these easier to solve, we do displace people, right? There's a different

382
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,580
kind of job that takes a different kind of skillset. And so some people that were not

383
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:32,100
well suited before now become well suited. And other ones that were well suited to that particular

384
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,540
skillset are less well-suited to the new one. Which is another reason to be the specializing

385
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,660
generals. Cause as part of my job becomes obsolete, it doesn't matter because I have so

386
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:48,820
many other things I can do when you can only do one thing and that one thing becomes

387
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,500
not necessary anymore, you're screwed. But you did that to yourself.

388
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,900
Right. And that's why I think conferences like Star and other large test conferences have a very

389
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,300
big opportunity, which is to help people cross that chasm, right? Help them get the new skillset.

390
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,020
And there were a lot of talks that were attempting to go do that, but there was other talks,

391
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:10,180
even some of the keynotes that seemed to be more like, the sky's not falling, everything's

392
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,180
okay, everybody on the other side are idiots. You know, like there's no thinking involved in

393
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,500
automated testing. And so you don't have to move forward. And what they don't realize is

394
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,700
that if you go back to kind of the history of testing that I gave at the beginning,

395
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:26,180
and that we gave a lot of detail when we talked about it before, in quotes, I really drink.

396
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,300
When you go back to that, there's kind of a progression, right? You start at manual

397
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,780
testing and then you move to automated testing and then you move to, you know, potentially test

398
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:41,300
writing themselves. But then you move on to some kind of ML statistical based stuff that

399
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:46,100
tells you your quality. And they're kind of fighting the war between the first and the second,

400
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:50,900
not realizing the world's even moved beyond the second one. Like automated testing is not the thing

401
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,700
that I think is the solution for most people's problems today.

402
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,930
I don't disagree with that. Yeah. In fact,

403
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:03,770
that's actually an interesting insight though. That's what I was thinking through.

404
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,970
But let me, I'm going to interrupt because that's, that plays right into something I've told

405
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:10,490
my team before. And I mentioned here before is I said, I want you,

406
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:15,050
the people in QA roles on my team, I'm going to change their titles.

407
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:21,700
I haven't told my team that I don't follow that out or not, but I've asked them to write

408
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:28,500
fewer tests. Please stop writing so many tests, development team help them write more tests,

409
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:33,220
more unit tests, more integration tests. There's just so many other things I want to do other than

410
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:41,110
write any tests. Yeah. You're basically saying, Hey, look guys, very little value proposition

411
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:46,070
in you doing this work for the dev team now. Everybody knows there's more work to do than

412
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,470
they can do as far as choosing what to do, deprioritize writing tests.

413
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,190
And that doesn't mean that we're saying that tests are bad, right?

414
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:53,990
Right. Exactly.

415
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:56,390
Checks are bad. What we're saying. Shut up.

416
00:31:57,430 --> 00:32:00,630
But what we're saying is that automated tests are more efficiently written by the person

417
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,630
writing the code. Yes.

418
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,790
Yeah. No, but the insight I'm still puzzling through that I think Steve is absolutely right on.

419
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:18,540
Right. I think it's very literally what you're saying is that Star Canada, you observed traditionalists

420
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:26,060
fighting against the modernist testing. Modern guys are going, what the hell are you talking about?

421
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:34,150
You're holding on to 1996 principles and ideals. We've moved two decades beyond that.

422
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,470
We don't care about those problems anymore. Whereas the traditional are still going,

423
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:41,030
what are you talking about? Medical still does.

424
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,270
Well, we have a bit of a problem because our audience, the three people that listen to this

425
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:55,780
podcast all get that they all know that they need to be learning new things and trying new ideas

426
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:04,540
is how do we reach, how does the industry reach the other people? And conferences should be a great

427
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,580
way to do that. But I think you get out what you put into the conference and you have to go into

428
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:14,940
the conference with the idea that you will take away new ideas you want to try. If all you take

429
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,620
away is justification that you don't need to change, that's a frightening waste of time and

430
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,530
scares me. Well, I think it's difficult for a conference designer, right? Somebody's setting up

431
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:32,090
a conference to figure out what the right balance is. Because if you tell your audience that this

432
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,450
job is going away and this conference is designed around a particular job and now there's only

433
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,610
going to be a handful of you and so we're going to have one conference of 50 experts once a year,

434
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:44,570
that kind of makes your conference go away. And other people have conferences in other areas.

435
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,250
So it can be a little difficult to figure out what the right balance is. Your audience kind

436
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:53,050
of wants to hear their jobs okay. So there's a sense of I want to reaffirm what your current

437
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:57,450
beliefs are. And there's also a sense of I need to challenge. And so if you challenge too much,

438
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:01,130
you'll just cause them to reject you and go to the other place where they're being given

439
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,050
defense. If you're a star and you say, all right, we're going to tell you all that you need to

440
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:08,490
change immediately, this is all wrong, people are going to stop going to your conference,

441
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,770
they're going to go to whatever the other big testing conferences are.

442
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:21,820
So it's interesting. In retrospect, I see this trend ever since however long it's been. Six years

443
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:28,730
ago when Whitaker said test is dead, is that there's always one talk, one keynote at a

444
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:35,140
conference talking about test is alive and well. And so it's interesting that I think

445
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:39,380
that split might have started then where it's about here's all the way it's changing and not

446
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,220
going to be what it used to be. And the half talks going, no, no, no, it's still going to

447
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:48,020
always be the same as it used to be. This is what we need. Have you seen this obscure bug

448
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:53,060
I found in my flight tracking app where it gives me an error message that doesn't make as much

449
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,060
sense as it should. This is why we need software testers. Right now, I think that

450
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,180
the conversation is going on in the large, right? Because I saw a lot of people at this

451
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,860
conference that were responding back to whatever the last star conference was. I don't know if

452
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:09,350
it's star west or star east. West is in the fall. So west must have just happened.

453
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,590
So it must have been just west. And apparently the keynote at west was ML is coming to eat your

454
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:18,310
jobs. And so clearly that conference was definitely talking about at least some of

455
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:21,990
this modern stuff. And then this conference to some extent was some of the speakers were

456
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,670
a reaction to that, right? And so there was a very extreme statement made on one side.

457
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:28,870
And so that kind of engenders an extreme statement on the other side. And the reality is

458
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:36,140
probably as usual somewhere in the middle. So I've done this. It literally takes

459
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:46,540
30 seconds on Google Scholar searching for software testing and machine learning

460
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:58,500
to see what people are doing with ML in the test context and what they're succeeding on

461
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,410
and what they're failing on. And I will tell you, big hint, they're succeeding more than

462
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:12,890
they're failing on this front. It is for certain building up momentum. If you looked at the rate

463
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:20,250
which studies of these sort are coming in, you can see that they're rapidly accelerating

464
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:29,610
year over year. In my view, it is much like when Alan and I started this within Microsoft,

465
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:38,940
God, four or five years ago, where to us it was very clear, no, this is coming. There's nothing

466
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:46,620
that can stop this momentum. You can choose to put your head in the sand like an ostrich,

467
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:58,010
or you can heed our warning. I now feel like one of those men with the signs in the middle of

468
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,250
New York, the end is nigh, right? You got your little bull out on the street corner.

469
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,410
Yeah, I heard they're very effective. You could hear, you could heed our warning and start

470
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:12,330
prepping because there is still time. But I definitely see worldwide things starting to

471
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:19,980
shape up in terms of how we saw them at Microsoft just a few years ago. The test singularity

472
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,220
is literally just a matter of time, in my humble opinion.

473
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:30,330
I think that's probably over claiming things. I think that a lot of the AI ML people come out

474
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:34,490
and say, it's going to solve all problems everywhere. And I think there are limits to the kind of

475
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:37,850
techniques we have today. There was just one of the big pioneers, I forget the name I was looking

476
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,970
for it and I can't find it, who came out not long ago at a conference and said, back propagation and

477
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,730
what we call deep neural networks have a limit. And in order to get to the next level, we're going

478
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:49,530
to have to invent a new technique that's not been invented yet. So I think there's-

479
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:57,290
No, they're going to have limits, but I don't see a manual tester being the-

480
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,410
The solution? No, I don't either.

481
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:06,410
Solution to working around. And then so we see a momentum around testing effort being moved to dev,

482
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:12,170
what we traditionally classify as testing effort moving to dev. And then a large portion of these

483
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:21,130
hard thinking problems moving to AI. So then the question in my view is, sure, AI is not going to

484
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:27,050
solve everything. Those of us in the business know what it can do really well and what it

485
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:32,680
can't do really well. But what piece of the pie does that leave over for the manual?

486
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,160
Is it just pacemakers? Well, I think that the pacemakers are definitely a big part of what's

487
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,960
left for manual testers. I think there's two places where manual testing will continue to thrive.

488
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,320
I think one is in the industries that can't ship very quickly for whatever reason, either

489
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,800
the cost of getting it wrong is insanely high, so pacemakers, nuclear power, airplanes. And then

490
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,400
I think that the other spot are places where it's economically- your product is small enough and

491
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,400
has a short enough shelf life that it is not worth building an automated system for.

492
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,440
Or even small enough and doesn't matter if it sucks enough. I'm thinking of IT internal apps

493
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,040
and reflecting on my time at Microsoft using those that quality obviously isn't a high concern.

494
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,200
Think of a lot of web apps that show up on an iPhone or an Android or whatever. A lot of those

495
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,960
are a low cost, one or two person system. Building up a team to do data to understand how

496
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,760
this thing's working doesn't make sense until you get to a certain scale.

497
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,920
But I don't think those- I don't think that those are trapping that happens manually.

498
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,800
I don't think the teams that you're describing will go with the AI. I think it's more like,

499
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,200
again, there's two things that threatening the manual testing. Agile and AI. And I think

500
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:49,960
that small IT shop, they're far more likely to go, no, whatever testing skills our devs have,

501
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,480
that's good enough. Ship it.

502
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,920
Yes, I think that's correct. What I did see actually interesting at Star, I met a couple

503
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,480
of people that were actually devs from a traditional Agile dev shop who were at Star to try to learn

504
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,800
how to think like a tester. Which I think you'll see more and more people that need that skill set.

505
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,960
Yeah, there should be conferences more dedicated to that. Because I don't think

506
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:15,800
going to a traditional test conference like Star or STP is the best way for a developer

507
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,600
to learn more about testing. I think there could be a more dedicated conference. I think

508
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,280
the Agile conference is- what's the big one called? Totally spacing.

509
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,240
I don't know.

510
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,360
Anyway, the big Agile conference, like 20 concurrent tracks,

511
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,120
does have tracks on that. But I think that may need to wrap up.

512
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:40,630
One thing I want to point out and solicit information from you guys on is,

513
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:47,830
I'm actually going to Star East in May. I'm only giving a tutorial on tools for testers.

514
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:52,150
This is sort of an extension, the deep dive extension of my technical testing talk,

515
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:59,820
where I'm going to take four hours and teach a room of people or two people, whoever show up,

516
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:05,420
how to use things like Docker, some basic shell scripting, a little bit of PyTest, F12 debugger.

517
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,740
I'm wondering now, I don't have anything- and again, this is allotted,

518
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,140
this is going to get an overview in a couple hours. Is there anything on the data or ML side I should

519
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,340
shove a little demo in of?

520
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,620
The hard part is getting a world where they can bootstrap it. The hard part about data is that

521
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:26,140
it requires a big infrastructure. Now, there are things, I'm sure there's competitors to it as

522
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,060
well, but there's things like app insights from Microsoft over in the Visual Studio land, where

523
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,660
you can instrument your code and it automatically sends it to the backend and then you can use

524
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:38,300
it to analyze data. So showing off something like that would be useful, whether it's app insights or

525
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,500
whether it's one of the competitors.

526
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,660
New Relic is a competitor of that.

527
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:50,060
So is app insights available in versions of Visual Studio non-Microsofties like me can use,

528
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,340
or do I have to have the enterprise version?

529
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,660
I have no idea what the licensing for it looks like. I don't think it's actually-

530
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:57,500
I don't think it's Visual Studio, I think it's a separate thing that you guys-

531
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,300
Well, take a look at it.

532
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:58,700
I believe.

533
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,220
So it works well with Visual Studio, but it's an Azure offering.

534
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:12,330
All right, I'll take a look at it. I may just do some demos. We have a data pipeline that has a

535
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:16,650
tool called Presto on top, which is basically straight SQL queries into your data that are

536
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:19,450
pretty fast. So I could set up something like that.

537
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,930
So the advantage of app insights or one of those systems is that you don't have to create the

538
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:27,850
system for your app to talk back to the cloud. You don't have to create the system

539
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:31,610
like the database. You just basically, you put some instrumentation in your code and it

540
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,530
magically shows up in a database. And then you can query that database or even use their UI to

541
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:40,410
get visuals on it. And so the hard part is the infrastructure in between, right? There's the magic

542
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:45,450
between my code says, person click this button and something in the cloud knowing that the button

543
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,410
got clicked.

544
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,450
I actually think-

545
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,250
And it solves that problem.

546
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:56,570
The thing I've been thinking around on this topic is the way to enter into this if you're a

547
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:02,730
tester. And I've been thinking through, I'm quite overloaded at the moment, so I couldn't do this

548
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:10,970
probably until, begin to do this until Christmas. But I'm thinking a context sensitive training on

549
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:16,490
EDA for tester would be useful in this context.

550
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,050
For our audience, EDA is exploratory data analysis.

551
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,810
This is using graphs and charts to understand what your graphically,

552
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:26,330
visually what your data looks like rather than just coming up with summary numbers.

553
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,930
So one of the things I talked about several episodes ago, and I'm fairly certain that I

554
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:38,330
could do this, I could probably pull together a whole, at least an hour conversation on

555
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,350
analyzing histograms.

556
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,110
It sounds thrilling.

557
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,710
No, I know it would be boring as all hell, but-

558
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,470
Oh my God, I get some popcorn.

559
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:50,550
But histograms-

560
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,120
It's almost as good as the new Star Wars movie.

561
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,560
Are you going somewhere? Because I have things to say.

562
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah, go ahead.

563
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:04,730
Two things. I remember being in, you might have been there, Steve, early in the days of

564
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,810
Windows data science, there were a bunch of people got together weekly to try and figure

565
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:15,450
out what the hell it meant. And I remember at first, and it was part of the growing pains,

566
00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:19,770
not picking up on it. At first it was like, how can we recreate our old test dashboards using

567
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,130
data? And then I remember pushing-

568
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,730
What did the dashboards use before?

569
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,180
Using customer data versus test data.

570
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:30,580
Got it.

571
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:36,340
Because we need dashboards. And I remember pushing hard on the fact that I don't give

572
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,580
a crap about, I give a little bit of a crap, but exploring that data is much more interesting

573
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,180
because those insights are addictive and I want to get those insights being able to explore the

574
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,020
data. One thing I should mention, one point, different point completely is in talking,

575
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:55,620
I realized app insights, do the stuff, magic is done for you. I may just write a Unity app

576
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:02,180
because we ship what's called Unity Analytics. It's a server, a service customers can use,

577
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:08,260
which is basically that for you. In fact, we'll add app start, app stop, and a few other things

578
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:11,620
automatically for you. If you choose to just click the button for the service,

579
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,340
then you can add other things and get all kinds of interesting information and have it show up on

580
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,260
your developer dashboard. That's essentially the app insights paradigm.

581
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,060
Yeah, that sounds like a very specialized version of the app insights world.

582
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:28,740
Yeah. So I may do that. I'm trying to figure if I want how much of the tutorial I want to be

583
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,220
interactive versus demo, that would be a little bit too- I think actually if I'm going to do

584
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,220
anything with data, it's probably going to be demo versus interactive.

585
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,300
The hard part is getting enough, getting somebody to stand up enough site licenses or

586
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,820
whatever it is in order to let everybody access that data, right?

587
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,300
It's free.

588
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:49,110
But you'd have to have a lot of instances for them to come access it or something.

589
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,590
You could give them access potentially to a demo data source.

590
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:54,710
Yeah, I'll think about that.

591
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,990
But I think that's the important part. If you want to show it off, the hard part is not

592
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:02,310
connecting those two pieces. Let somebody who specializes in that do that. The part that the

593
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:06,070
testers need to learn is once I have the data, what do I do with it?

594
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,790
Well, the way I would spin it is-

595
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,550
How do I look at it? How do I interpret it?

596
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:11,750
That is useful.

597
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:19,050
How can I do testing via this data? How can I tell for a given use case or scenario,

598
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:22,570
how many people are successful doing it when they're not? What errors are they seeing?

599
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,120
Then you could talk through a lot of the problems, the fallacies that end up happening in there.

600
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,440
If you have two different populations, one's moving really fast, one's moving really slow.

601
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,480
If you just look at the average, you'll assume that everybody lives somewhere in the middle

602
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:40,680
where the reality is nobody's living in the middle. Or if it fails in a certain way,

603
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,720
you can have survivorship biases where everybody who fails stops using it,

604
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,760
everybody who doesn't fail keeps using it. Most of your users are successful,

605
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,560
even though most people who tried it are unsuccessful.

606
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:58,360
Yes. That's that path of insights I love to find out. You find a little bit of data that looks

607
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,200
interesting and you go, oh, I wonder why that is? Let me poke a little deeper. Oh,

608
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,200
well, okay. Now I know. One more question I want to ask. Oh, crap. I love doing that.

609
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,700
Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I think there is a space for the dashboards as well. I think you want to

610
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:19,140
understand, at a baseline, am I in general in good shape? And then what are the special questions?

611
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:25,300
I'm not entirely against dashboards. I just want to avoid what I think is maybe a natural progression

612
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:32,180
of if you say we're going to test using data now to replace your test automation dashboard

613
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,620
with a similar dashboard showing test from customer data.

614
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:46,540
I mean, that actually is a good start. I will say that's a good start. It is not a destination.

615
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,400
But just to see what the difference is in terms of the tool that you're accustomed to before,

616
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,000
and but now getting this data from a new source. So that means that people are going to be,

617
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:05,530
they're going to have an old process, but new data. So it should help move things forward.

618
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,610
But it's not where you should stop. I think you have to give people a path to the new world.

619
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,530
If you just say there's a new world and don't be in your old world anymore, go.

620
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,970
It's very disconcerting and people don't know how to move forward. Yeah. Give them a path.

621
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,650
That's an evolutionary path forward, not a revolution.

622
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:26,810
I agree. And a totally different situation, dealing with one fun challenge at work now where we

623
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:34,970
have a generic sizing. There's a team, not part of my team, who absolutely knows where they want to go.

624
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:40,650
I am not convinced yet they have any idea how to get there. So it's fun. I like it.

625
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,650
Yeah. That can be very disconcerting because it's very easy to give up or to go back because

626
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:48,970
you didn't get there yet. And so clearly it's the wrong place to go, which isn't necessarily true.

627
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:56,810
Well, it's been, do we even announce what number episode this was or were we too excited about

628
00:48:56,810 --> 00:49:04,970
Steve being here? We did not. I'm just that excited. We definitely were excited about Steve being here,

629
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:14,330
but this now closes out episode number 70. Episode 70. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And I'm Steve. See you next time.
