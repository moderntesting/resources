1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,230
Good morning everybody.

2
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,230
Howdy.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:15,230
Hey, I'm Alan.

4
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,230
I'm Brent.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,430
And we're here for episode 41 of AB testing.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,430
Woo hoo!

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,670
AB stands for Alan and Brent.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:29,310
It's also the name of a popular experimentation method of comparing two versions or treatments

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,760
of a product, website, etc.

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:40,890
Yes, and it occurs to me for the first time since we had this new drinking game, here's

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,010
something I think we haven't talked about previously.

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,730
We haven't talked about the fact that I just got back from not just but last week, I gave

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,090
my talk on experimentation and AB testing at Better Software.

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,610
I feel like it went pretty well.

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:54,170
I promoted the podcast.

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,530
Hopefully we have a new member of the three.

17
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,530
Hopefully.

18
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,530
Yeah.

19
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,770
Wasn't this one the workshop model?

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,770
Yeah, it was.

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,930
So tell me how it goes.

22
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm interested.

23
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,260
We talked about what it was, who was doing it, nobody, what they knew about it, nothing.

24
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,700
We played one of the games that I graciously was able to borrow from Ronnie Guevara, who's

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:21,030
done a lot of experimentation at Microsoft on how your intuition on which treatment is

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,150
better is probably wrong.

27
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,620
And then we emphasized a lot that data trumps intuition, so how to get that data, things

28
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,180
to do, ways to do experiments.

29
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,740
We talked a little bit about statistical significance and the math that goes into it.

30
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,140
We talked about designing experiments.

31
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,220
I even went and used Google Analytics to set up an AB experiment on angryweasel.com of

32
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:47,380
just two different web pages and show how, if you want to do very low scale AB testing,

33
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,220
it's how simple it is to set up.

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,940
And then we also talked about the architecture on how you would do sort of a flighting system

35
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,580
to do, not sort of, a flighting system or something to do experimentation on a much

36
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,580
larger scale.

37
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,860
Examples, we tried some things out.

38
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,180
We had a lot of discussion back and forth.

39
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,460
And believe it or not, there was enough details and nuance and all that.

40
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,260
We talked a lot about the caveats of how to look at the data coming in and different

41
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,860
things you can get from this, et cetera, et cetera.

42
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,860
That was kind of it.

43
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,600
That's one of my favorite discussions, the caveats.

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:26,400
Like Wikipedia has this fantastic link.

45
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,710
If you look up cognitive biases, it's like seven pages of individual biases.

46
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:44,030
And I go back and I look at that frequently and judge which of these am I committing today?

47
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,030
Have you seen whichtestone.com?

48
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,110
Treatment A, treatment B, guess which one's better, and nobody can get more than two in

49
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,870
a row right ever.

50
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,420
Whichtestone has pretty much one of those every day for around the industry.

51
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,420
Whichtestone.com?

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,340
Whichtestone.com.

53
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Very cool.

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
I'll be looking at that.

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,340
Yeah, it's a pretty cool site.

56
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,620
I get to my feed list and maybe it's not once a day, but it's multiple times a week.

57
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,620
Super interesting.

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,940
What I find is more fascinating or more not fascinating, where I get my most learning

59
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,700
from that, I go, huh, I wouldn't have guessed that.

60
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,740
But the comment section below has people that don't know what they're doing.

61
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,100
A lot of people who actually do know what they're doing who kind of helped me get some

62
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,060
insights I wouldn't have been able to get without them.

63
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,060
So it's kind of fun.

64
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,820
Something I find fascinating with, particularly Ronnie's explanation of the game.

65
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,820
Last time I saw it was a couple years ago.

66
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,660
And he does a really good job for the ones that he's able to address explaining why so

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,140
that you can learn where your intuition went into the weeds.

68
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,140
But that's very difficult.

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,580
One of the things I brought up is that experimentation and the framework behind, the framework you

70
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,340
use behind it will tell you which test won, but it doesn't really tell you why.

71
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,700
You can use data to get a good idea of what's why, but you don't know why.

72
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
Not initially, no.

73
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,180
You'll have to do a lot of extra digging.

74
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,980
But Ronnie has been using that deck for a long time.

75
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,420
Yeah, and he's modified it a lot.

76
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,940
He's some other experimenters.

77
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,500
I like the which test won because now I can get some non-Microsoft experiments.

78
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,420
They're more relevant, or at least more recent.

79
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,820
The final thing I got into, and I didn't mention in my previous shortened synopsis, is the idea

80
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,100
of building an experimentation culture where everything's an experiment.

81
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,820
It's a journey to get there, but when you get a team that has this idea of everything's

82
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:44,020
an experiment, it's a pretty fascinating place, a pretty fun place to be as far as software

83
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,580
development goes.

84
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:55,070
Yes, it aligns with Patrick's, Tess Pappy's presentation, where he was talking about ignorance

85
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,070
and knowledge.

86
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,070
Yeah.

87
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,630
And when you are able to create a culture of experimentation where you essentially only

88
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,640
value knowledge that is validated.

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,740
Yeah.

90
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,740
It is pretty cool.

91
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
It is cool.

92
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,740
It's really fun.

93
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,100
I always like talking about, with you, when I actually do stuff in the data side of the

94
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,020
world, just to show you I can dip my foot over there.

95
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,180
Y'all know that's ...

96
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,340
I try and prove to you that I really am a generalist.

97
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
Specializing generalist.

98
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,140
I have my specialties, but I don't mind dipping in deep in areas that I find.

99
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,500
Not only that I find interesting, but I think are critical to making good software.

100
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:46,410
So now you have successfully impressed me enough on this front.

101
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:55,070
Now what I'd like to see you get to, it is review time, so here's your next priority.

102
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,140
And that's use it.

103
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,700
All right.

104
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,260
Thanks, Brent.

105
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,580
And we can start with once a quarter.

106
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,220
There's a lot more.

107
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,820
We could go a lot deeper there, but I don't want to go too far off the books.

108
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,060
Hey, you mentioned I'm going to go back to ... Actually, I'll do a brief announcement,

109
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,700
and then we'll actually talk about the fact that it is review season.

110
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,400
I looked up my calendar, and just like, sometime in the last year, I put a date on my calendar,

111
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,100
so I would remember to mention it on the AB testing show, and maybe in a tweet.

112
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:31,640
But tomorrow, June 18th, which may be yesterday by the time you hear this, is the 12-year

113
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,420
anniversary of my very first blog post.

114
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,420
Congratulations.

115
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,780
I don't know if it's an anniversary we're celebrating, just more of a milestone, but

116
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,020
it was on the old MSDN blog site.

117
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,020
Actually it still exists.

118
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,620
What was the title?

119
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,620
The title of my ...

120
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,740
Hi, I'm Alan.

121
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,740
You know what?

122
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,740
I don't know.

123
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,500
I think the title was I'm Not a Blogger.

124
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,700
That was the title of one of my very first few blog posts.

125
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:07,330
The context was I was about to present at a embedded developers conference on how to use

126
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:12,890
the tools that we had written, the test framework we had written in Windows CE, so that ISVs

127
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:19,210
or IHVs, independent hardware vendors, could write tests for their drivers and their firmware

128
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,730
for Windows CE devices.

129
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,850
So, Wnts was still alive 12 years ago?

130
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,530
It feels like much longer than it was killed.

131
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:30,290
It was around for a while.

132
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,490
I ended up doing a bunch of those over a couple years.

133
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,490
So I wanted a place to be able to answer post conference questions and to post slides and

134
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,110
samples, et cetera.

135
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:45,450
So I started it for that and then eventually I said, I'm going to use this to actually

136
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,250
practice writing, learn how to write and be careful because then you end up writing books

137
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,890
and shit and life goes crazy.

138
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,210
But anyway, 12 years since my very first blog post, which was weird because it was

139
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,480
almost ... It was like a week after my nine year anniversary at Microsoft.

140
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,460
June, a time of many milestones.

141
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:15,310
I started blogging for exactly the same reason, improved writing, improved communication.

142
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:19,870
I would say having gone back recently and looked through some of my old stuff, I would

143
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,190
say I've achieved that but my pace is slow.

144
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:30,750
If you go to ... If you want a real treat, you can go to blogs.msdn.com, Wack Alum

145
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:37,840
P-A and the A-L-A-N-P-A. I think the actual URL has changed as they've gone through different

146
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:44,960
formats but my old posts are still there and it's like a child wrote them.

147
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Yeah.

148
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
All right.

149
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,440
And the other thing, first off, it feels like it's been 12 years since I've written

150
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,960
my last blog.

151
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:00,620
I've been working on one off and on for the last month.

152
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,820
It's hard to do all this writing and go to school and do work.

153
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
And stay employed.

154
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,780
And still know what my children look like.

155
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,820
Hey, speaking of staying employed, what do we call it now?

156
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,660
It's sort of reward, performance, feedback.

157
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:25,180
We separated at Microsoft the individual discussion on how you're doing with the rewards, although

158
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,980
they're still kind of tied just unofficially.

159
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,700
But it's time for rewards and I want to talk a little bit about how ...

160
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,780
I don't even know if it's unofficial.

161
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:39,260
Really what the thing is is that we're not allowed to talk ... Essentially, we're not

162
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:45,580
supposed to or allowed to talk about performance during the reward discussion.

163
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Blah, blah, blah.

164
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Exactly.

165
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:54,340
So, I'm on my fourth or so different way we review people at Microsoft and I want to

166
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,220
talk a little bit about it and the games people play and the tools I use to get around

167
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,220
that.

168
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
It's always an interesting time.

169
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,860
I'm a manager now of just a few people, but even when I wasn't a manager, I was always

170
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,180
invited to be part of these review discussions because generally my role is someone that works

171
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,180
across the org.

172
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,460
I have a good insight, I have a sort of an objective insight across the org on how

173
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,540
I know more people.

174
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:28,340
Given the job I do, I tend to know what more people do in the org than any of my peers.

175
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,900
We had our discussion last week and like every other discussion we've had about people and

176
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:41,470
any team at Microsoft over the last 10 or 12 years I've been doing this was ... It was

177
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,830
interesting and people played games.

178
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,870
For the most part, the right things happened.

179
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,150
But I want to talk about some of the games they play.

180
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,430
What games have you seen people play during these discussions?

181
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:56,100
Oh, I see all sorts of games.

182
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,030
You tell me one or I'll tell you one.

183
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:10,950
I will tell you the game I use most often and that is ... First and foremost, before

184
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,910
I go into that, you ever study the prisoner's dilemma?

185
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,510
Yeah.

186
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:25,460
It's the prisoner's dilemma that's being played out where there is really no

187
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,930
benefit to collaboration.

188
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:38,700
I'll say the best review discussion I've ever had was the last time I was a middle

189
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:46,260
manager and I was able to successfully convince my leads that for the review

190
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:54,620
discussion they are not to defend their people.

191
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,300
What they are to do is to put themselves in my shoes and assume that their people

192
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:08,340
are part of our business team and we're going to focus on what needs to be done

193
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,490
going forward.

194
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,210
And I'm simplifying here.

195
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,130
You're sure and you're being very philosophical about it.

196
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,050
But it worked very well.

197
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:25,890
The people started ... I remember one lead was like, hey, that person really needs

198
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:30,410
consistency on this, this and this in order to really get to the next level.

199
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,530
I have that work.

200
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,170
How about we talk about me moving that work to your team and you have that guy

201
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:35,810
do it.

202
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,010
It was very productive.

203
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,010
Okay, so let me ... I'm going to take over because you're not getting where I

204
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,690
want you to get to.

205
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,570
I'm about to go there.

206
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,010
Let me ... it took too long.

207
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:43,650
Okay.

208
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:47,730
I'll tie this into something else I brought up in my workshop.

209
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:53,930
I've read most of the Dan Ariale books on irrational ... why people do irrational

210
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,530
things.

211
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,210
I forget the names.

212
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,930
Irrational yours or something.

213
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,850
Predictably irrational is the first book.

214
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,010
Yes.

215
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,210
So there's a story in one of those books, I believe.

216
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,010
I didn't fact check, but I'm sure I read it there, where they did a study where

217
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,850
people went to a movie theater and they had two sizes of popcorn available,

218
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,290
a small for $3 and a large for $7.

219
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:20,050
Most people bought the $3 popcorn and when asked why, they all said the $7 seems

220
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,890
pretty expensive for popcorn.

221
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,970
It's too much.

222
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,410
Different movie theater or same movie theater, different night.

223
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:33,810
They had three sizes of popcorn, a small for $3, a medium for $6.50 and a large

224
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,090
for $7.

225
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,770
Most people bought the large and when asked why, they said because it's such

226
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,130
a good deal, it's only $0.50 more than the medium.

227
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,680
Yep.

228
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,520
Interesting the way the brain works.

229
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:54,200
So let me tell you a game I saw and two ways I know to break this game, but I

230
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,280
want to kind of hear what you thought.

231
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,480
So the game I saw played is very similar to that game where you take, as a

232
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,880
manager, you bring in the employee that you ... we have this rating scale that

233
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,160
goes from $100 is the middle and it goes down from there and up from there

234
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,360
from $0 to $200.

235
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,640
That's sort of your scale where we put people on for rewards.

236
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,040
Okay.

237
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,970
There is a person from one manager who is above average but not way above

238
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,730
average.

239
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,250
My ratings are usually right in line with where they come in.

240
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,810
So that's where they're seeing my peers as well.

241
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,130
In other words, you bully your peers into ...

242
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,730
No, no, no.

243
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,290
I hardly say anything.

244
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,710
But anyway, this person came in at $200.

245
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,870
This guy is a rock star, walks on water.

246
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,870
$200 is ...

247
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,950
Jesus looks up to him.

248
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,950
Something like that.

249
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,950
Got it.

250
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,990
And I immediately recognized it as the game.

251
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,270
Because what happens there is ... generally ...

252
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,270
It's the ... talk me ...

253
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,230
He's not a $200.

254
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,350
You'll talk me down to the value I want.

255
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,070
And I think he got talked down to a value above where perhaps he should

256
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,070
have been.

257
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,070
And then everybody just happens.

258
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,790
Like, okay, I feel better about this.

259
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,230
Same game, interesting way.

260
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,390
I have two ways.

261
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,830
One very good way I've done this in the past.

262
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,510
But I'm curious what you've done.

263
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,560
What do you do when you see someone playing that game?

264
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:21,140
So the last time I really had to deal with that particular game, the best solution that

265
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,140
I've had for that is ... you know what?

266
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,570
We're going to reschedule this meeting.

267
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:33,340
Each manager needs to come in balanced.

268
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,340
It's not a great one.

269
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,340
No.

270
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,860
It's a horrible thing because I do not believe that every team has to be balanced.

271
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,420
I think there can be better teams than other teams.

272
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,980
Oh, and I completely agree.

273
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:51,540
But what we do ... so once they come in balanced, then we have a discussion around who moves

274
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
up.

275
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:58,540
So this exercise works exactly the same or very similar to the previous bucket systems

276
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,580
I've had at Microsoft, no matter which bucket system it was.

277
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,060
You want to put, as far as rewards go, like who are they like.

278
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,420
So two ways I've fought this in the past.

279
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,760
I'll give you the actual one that works 100% of the time in this case.

280
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:19,790
One way to stop this game is that anywhere where there's a discussion or a discrepancy,

281
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:24,350
anywhere, whether it's by 20% or 60%, if there's a discussion in the room for even

282
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,770
a minute on ... I don't think that's right for that person.

283
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,000
That person drops to zero, not permanently, but they get dropped to zero and they're

284
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,720
left there until the rest of the discussion's done.

285
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,300
So what happens is ... this is another game too, but played a different way.

286
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,960
What happens is managers come into that room, putting people into the spot, into their

287
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,960
bucket where they don't expect to have any controversy.

288
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,560
Where there's controversy, those things go to zero, and then at the end of the

289
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,040
discussion where you decided where everybody else go, then you can play the is like a game

290
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,120
and put them in the right spot where they belong, not where they were put in.

291
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,880
So if you put someone in an obviously bad place, you force a hard discussion around

292
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,960
that person at the end of the conversation, everybody else has been agreed on.

293
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,200
That one works very, very well.

294
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,040
I have never heard that one.

295
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
That's really good.

296
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,720
You got to play it for managers, play that game.

297
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
That's an anti-game.

298
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,170
And you can even argue it.

299
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,330
You can say, hey, look, what we want to do is go quickly through the ones we agree on

300
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,690
and cue up all the discussion at the end.

301
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,370
Let me tell you about another game people play.

302
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,730
I'm going to talk about the fallacy.

303
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,520
Peak in May.

304
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:42,000
The peak in May game means, is because we do reward discussions in June, that what

305
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,120
you do in July, August, September, pretty much all the way to March or April, doesn't

306
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,240
matter as much as what you do in May.

307
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,560
Yes.

308
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,680
Oh, peak in May.

309
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,840
Peak in May.

310
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,320
I was thinking peak is in like, no, peak in on someone.

311
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,230
So how do you fight the peak in May game?

312
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:07,140
I take that one head on.

313
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,260
I go, OK, great.

314
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,770
He did a great job in May.

315
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,010
So remind us all what he did in the prior quarters.

316
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,330
I always ask, what were the results in the first half of the year?

317
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,050
That discussion comes up a lot.

318
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,970
When there's discussion around people, in time

319
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,530
there's like controversy, what did they do in the first half of the year?

320
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,050
Well, they had a really rough first half and blah, blah, blah.

321
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,850
I said, then they're not.

322
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:29,370
That's fine.

323
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,850
They had a great second half, but they're not 180 or whatever.

324
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,850
You have to take the whole year into account.

325
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,570
And that's more of a management issue.

326
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,650
And I tend to, I'm not like, I have the smallest team in our org.

327
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,690
But I've sat in, I probably sat in on more review discussions because I used

328
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,770
to sit in on other teams review discussions.

329
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,290
I probably sat in on more of those than any person in our org.

330
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,010
So I can tend to say the right things to make the right things happen.

331
00:18:54,010 --> 00:19:00,140
The other thing I think that is wise in terms of how you are presenting that question.

332
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,660
You said, what were the results?

333
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:09,670
Because I have seen over and over again, and it's part of the discussions generally

334
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:11,270
do around Agile.

335
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,330
Humans are built for relative, not concrete results.

336
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,250
So you could actually really get yourself a rock star review by tanking,

337
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:32,090
purposefully tanking the first half of the year so that, and then take your manager's

338
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:38,130
feedback to heart and rocket it up back to say normal.

339
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,090
And the manager is going to basically say, number one, wow, I really helped this guy

340
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,410
improve.

341
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,130
And look at the differential, even though the raw results at the end of the day was

342
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,110
nothing special.

343
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,190
Cool.

344
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,110
One final challenge to bring up in there here is the Microsoft, I think probably

345
00:19:56,110 --> 00:20:01,750
any company who has some Agile values in them, values collaboration and helping

346
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,150
others as being very important, especially at more senior levels.

347
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:07,150
So say I work for you, Brent.

348
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,150
Okay.

349
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:11,870
And I'm going to come to you and I'm going to give you, again, peaking in May,

350
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,590
I'm going to give you a bunch of information about how I've helped other people on the

351
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,430
team in hopes that you see that as a way to boost me up.

352
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,200
How do you know how much I've helped versus my peers?

353
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:30,790
Like say there's a group of 10 of us in my level band and you're trying to figure

354
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:35,550
out you have, results are more tangible and measurable, but what's intangible and

355
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:42,550
more difficult to measure is how well my influence or how much my influence has

356
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:48,630
helped the team get better, either through general leadership, coaching, diving

357
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,030
in and helping others, et cetera.

358
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,510
How do you compare what I've done in that intangible area versus my peers?

359
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,430
How do you know if I help more than someone else or as much or less?

360
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:06,450
The only way to really do that is a sucky way.

361
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:09,610
And that's peer feedback.

362
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,850
Our peer feedback system at Microsoft currently sucks.

363
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,010
Just to clarify that for the listeners.

364
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,690
The system is, I'm going to send out a list of, I'm going to send out an invitation to

365
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,520
give feedback to all the people I know who will say good things about me.

366
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:33,330
Oh, and yeah, because in addition, even if someone had something not good to say about

367
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,770
you, they're not motivated.

368
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:44,880
The last two review cycles, my entire team has gotten 100% strongly agrees in all their

369
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,010
peer feedback.

370
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,690
And I think people are like, well, I don't want to have a discussion with this guy's

371
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:55,400
manager, so I'll just do five, five, five, five, five.

372
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,960
What was the question I was asking?

373
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,890
Oh, how to deal with this.

374
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:06,760
The other general strategy that I see is it's the lifeboat game.

375
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,510
So when you're talking about collaboration against your peers, it's more about sorting

376
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:20,350
it by who pissed off others the most, because that's clearly visible versus who's

377
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:22,550
not always.

378
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,550
Not always.

379
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:29,110
I think there are many ways, plenty of ways for me to sabotage your career for the benefit

380
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,870
of mine without you knowing.

381
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,030
Oh, for sure.

382
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,270
Oh, the game of throwing people under the bus.

383
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,830
Oh, yeah.

384
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,710
Let me tell you what I've done to combat this in the past and in the end on this team.

385
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:47,160
But if I stick around, perhaps we will.

386
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,680
We don't stack rank anymore at Microsoft.

387
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,840
I should clarify this.

388
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,400
Managers don't stack rank their teams as part of the review process.

389
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:01,800
One thing, say I have, I'm the leader of a team and I have like 15 people or 20 people

390
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,040
or some manageable number of people in some level band.

391
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,430
I have a good idea of their output, but all the intangibles, as much as I pay attention

392
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,710
to them day to day, I want to get an idea of how much they help each other.

393
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:22,180
What I do is I have every single one of you stack rank that your peers and you.

394
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,700
So I'll do 10 for an even number.

395
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,460
I ask each of you to stack rank the 10 of you along with your peers.

396
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,420
So I get an idea of where you think you fit in and I get an idea of where you think

397
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,920
others are contributing to the team.

398
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,200
When I can, and this is a heuristic, I'm going to pull these things together and

399
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,720
look for surprises.

400
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,200
If I see one person consistently at the top, I go, and I thought they were pretty good.

401
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,320
I'm now, yeah, they are awesome.

402
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,480
And the rest of the team thinks they're awesome.

403
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:56,200
And that's actually very, very important to me.

404
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,360
The same, and I'll say anything at the bottom.

405
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,160
And then surprises are interesting.

406
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,760
That tells you where someone's playing the game.

407
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
Like if I think like Brent, I think you are the best person on my team.

408
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,160
And then I do this little exercise where I have you and all your peers rank you one

409
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,920
through 10 and you end up at the bottom of everyone's list.

410
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,200
I go, wait a minute.

411
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,400
Brent's nice to me, but I think he's an asshole.

412
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,040
And the opposite can happen too, because managers, again, through the same

413
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,720
irrational behavior, I can think I could have flipped the bit on you.

414
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,200
I thought, you know what?

415
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,720
I don't know that Brent's contributing.

416
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,680
He gets work gets done, but he says he's helping others, but I don't believe him.

417
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,920
And to get past that, it's anecdotal.

418
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
It's subjective data.

419
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,440
But when I see you show up at the top of everyone's list, it forces me to think,

420
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,760
you know what? Maybe I was wrong.

421
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,720
I got to I got to figure out what I'm doing wrong here.

422
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,080
There's a ton of value in that exercise.

423
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:56,680
And it tells you who's playing the game versus who is truly valuable.

424
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
I don't know about playing the game, right?

425
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:08,660
It's essentially what you've essentially done is is kind of created a source of

426
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,150
of data to help battle intuition.

427
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,590
It's a cheap way to handle the fact that our peer feedback system is pretty much

428
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,470
non-existent.

429
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:24,710
I have used that technique and the surprise situation where where you think

430
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,110
I was your rock star, but the rest of the group thinks I'm sucktastic.

431
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:36,620
I have found seven times out of 10 that that is an indication of a hero in the

432
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:43,500
org because heroes generally damn the torpedoes.

433
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,590
Yep.

434
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,270
Nope. I'm here to get things done.

435
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,390
The rest of you get out of my way or I'll stomp on you all on my way there.

436
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,650
Yeah.

437
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,250
So the thing I don't like is just to close on this a little bit is with a

438
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,450
lack of a peer feedback system, there's a little bit too much weight and

439
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:11,510
responsibility and error proneness of having the manager of a large team just

440
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,070
figure out without much data where everybody belongs, not just on output,

441
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,100
but output and collaboration and growth.

442
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:31,980
The people discussion that I went through for my team was much simpler.

443
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:45,490
We have a team of about 30 people and the goal was each manager went in with three

444
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,490
impact.

445
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,170
So you said zero to 200, I believe.

446
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,170
Yeah.

447
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,100
You can think of us as having zero to two.

448
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Okay.

449
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
Okay.

450
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:02,940
And we were encouraged to discuss business results and just simply listen.

451
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,220
So the decision is mine.

452
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:14,660
But the listening part is my peers tell me what they observe with that individual

453
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,340
that I'm not observing.

454
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,860
I don't have to change my score.

455
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,380
I can keep it the way it is.

456
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:25,860
But we go in with those three values and even our rewards were at those

457
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:33,710
at three distinct setting of the values and it will bubble up to my manager to

458
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:38,830
do the differentiation and then to his manager to do the differentiation.

459
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,430
Too complicated.

460
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:43,830
It's simpler than the system you've been going through.

461
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,990
It really is.

462
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,270
I just sit there and I talk about my guys.

463
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:53,150
So it's better for me to work for someone who can speak better of me

464
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:55,460
regardless of the work I do.

465
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Yes.

466
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,300
That's the lead I should gravitate towards.

467
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
Absolutely.

468
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,300
The one who likes me the most.

469
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,300
Alright.

470
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,330
Career tips from Brit.

471
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,250
No but that's a true technique.

472
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,250
It is.

473
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,250
Right.

474
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:17,180
The in these models right you have to be able to defend against if you're not the

475
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,740
most charismatic guy in the room you better have techniques to defend against

476
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,870
that guy.

477
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:29,510
So here's one gaming system that I would love to see how you've dealt with.

478
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,020
Yeah.

479
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:39,580
People say it the adjective only manager which is doesn't communicate results just

480
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,860
communicates spews out a chain of adjectives.

481
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
My guy is a rock star.

482
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,500
The developer says this is the best dude ever.

483
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
That sort of thing.

484
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,180
I know you've had you've experienced that guy.

485
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,420
I was reminded of our drinking game.

486
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,780
We've talked about this before drinking game because for a while at our people

487
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,140
discussion the description of everyone started off with he's a great guy or

488
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,460
she's a great she's a great woman.

489
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Great.

490
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:12,580
And it would HR rep stepped up to band that phrase from the discussion.

491
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:18,310
Alright I think we have time for a little bit of answering of questions.

492
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:26,730
So let me reach deep into the mailbag.

493
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,650
Always good to have a mailbag.

494
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:30,570
Steve Rowe.

495
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,730
Thornken.

496
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,730
Thornken.

497
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,210
What is Thornken?

498
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:43,670
I actually asked him of course he did and he said that was his handle when he started way

499
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:46,270
back in the day on BBS's.

500
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:47,270
That is hilarious.

501
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,550
And when he told me that because I spent a lot of time on BBS's.

502
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,550
Oh me too.

503
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,190
And I'm like I'm wondering how many of the three don't even know what the hell that

504
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,670
is.

505
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,390
But I was like is Steve old enough to have spent time on BBS's?

506
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,390
He looks young.

507
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:11,350
There used to be a paper a free newspaper called computer user or something in the

508
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,350
Northwest.

509
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:16,990
I used to pick it up and there were articles in there lots of ads for computers.

510
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:22,270
But in the back was a whole list of phone numbers of all kinds of different BBS's.

511
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,070
And I used to kind of go through there and try some out.

512
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,510
Some were really lame and some had stuff.

513
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,230
Then I found the friend of mine at Mittysoft.

514
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:37,550
My company before I worked at Microsoft found me I forget the name of the BBS but in

515
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:42,470
this BBS I could actually get to a thing called the Internet.

516
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,130
But this is this was I guess Mosaic was just coming around but I could go to Gofer and

517
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,130
search for things.

518
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:53,170
And search was so slow.

519
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,610
It was really bad.

520
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,610
But a memory.

521
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,290
So the reason I brought up Thornkin is Thornkin is Steve Rose's name on our Slack

522
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,290
channel.

523
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:10,430
One of the three O N E O F T H R E E at slack.com.

524
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,460
So anyway Steve asked a question.

525
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,660
You might you might think that gee I thought this was the mailbag thing and

526
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,580
they're just randomly talking about BBS's.

527
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,620
That's the way we roll.

528
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:26,980
Steve asked about what the role of program management is in unified engineering.

529
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,260
What functions do they serve and what what shifts to development.

530
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:34,700
Right.

531
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,100
It's part of that.

532
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:40,940
What what work that is currently on a program manager's plate that moves to

533
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:41,980
dev tangent time.

534
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Yeah totally forgot this at the beginning.

535
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,460
I'm very very sorry.

536
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,980
But speaking of unified engineering.

537
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,820
Yes I cheated on you.

538
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:54,390
Again it happened.

539
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,110
Sorry.

540
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,790
No I'm fine.

541
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,430
Yeah I I strayed.

542
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:01,270
OK.

543
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:03,230
But I had a good time and I do it again.

544
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,000
As well you should.

545
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,600
I was a guest on the testing show this week for their podcast unreleased at this

546
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:10,880
point.

547
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,440
So I'll mention it again when it comes out.

548
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Talking about I wasn't sure what it was about at first because Matt Heuser

549
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,880
referred to as concurrent engineering but he meant like combined engineering

550
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,560
unified engineering you know the phrase works it's doing the activities are all

551
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,680
happening concurrently.

552
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,720
And we talked about a little bit about that.

553
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:31,530
So unified engineering reminded me that I forgot to mention it earlier.

554
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:37,650
So shout out Michael Larson Justin Norman perzy is on the testing show.

555
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:42,970
And Matt Heuser we had a good little talk about as good a talk as you can

556
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:45,130
have at an even earlier hour than this.

557
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,680
Yeah if they record at eight their time that's five you know I did a 5 a.m.

558
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,280
Talk.

559
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,360
So answering Steve's question as if you thought we'd never get there.

560
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,730
Brent on a unified engineering team.

561
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:03,330
What the hell do program managers do.

562
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:16,790
The role of a of a PM should be essentially get more customers identify the

563
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:25,370
features the requirements the opportunities that will acquire more happy customers for the

564
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,450
feature set of that team.

565
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:28,050
That's it in a nutshell.

566
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,730
They they should not not be doing schedule management.

567
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:44,960
They may have a role in certain design functions but even then if you have a designer I

568
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,770
would prefer to go talk to those guys then to program management in a nutshell.

569
00:33:51,810 --> 00:34:00,360
They're there to take on the customer focus wing of software development.

570
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,120
I like the idea you brought up they don't own the schedule from an agile point of view.

571
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,970
Those familiar with the role of a P.O. product owner.

572
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:19,370
I think the there on a unified engineering team you could pretty much just look up any

573
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:25,250
definition of a product owner and be pretty well so that's you jumped way ahead.

574
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,530
I was going to talk about and it's good thing.

575
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:33,250
I was going to talk about schedule a little bit and what happened there and then I was going to

576
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,730
make a profound statement and say a profound question and ask Brent.

577
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:43,490
Do you think the P.M. role is moving to much more of an agile project owner role.

578
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,620
Yes product owner role and I think you're right.

579
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,700
I do my best to push it there.

580
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:54,020
I don't think it's moving there at least in my world it's not moving there.

581
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,700
So let me tell you in the Skype consumer org that's the role of the P.M.

582
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,180
It's a P.O.

583
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,540
We have product owners.

584
00:34:59,660 --> 00:34:59,860
Yep.

585
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,100
Like it like it.

586
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:09,500
My team is still a little bit in the old world of project management which is

587
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,500
interesting because I will tell you I don't have any problems putting laundry on the

588
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:13,900
table.

589
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,300
Love the product.

590
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,540
Love the team.

591
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,940
There comes a point when you're moving as we're moving where P.M.

592
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,540
in the old role tends to get in the way a little bit.

593
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,540
It does.

594
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,540
It does.

595
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,900
And and they should be enabling.

596
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:31,170
They are.

597
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,460
P.M.

598
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:42,700
is another function that of command and control that's still trying to keep itself

599
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,220
alive.

600
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,660
It is.

601
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:49,340
So I think our good friend Jim Moore once described the role of test or often

602
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,740
described the role of test as the remainder.

603
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,180
Dev do the implementation and coding P.M.

604
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:57,260
do the design and scheduling and the remainder is done by test.

605
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,980
Whatever and other you know Dev and P.M.

606
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,860
may pick up more of that but test does the remainder.

607
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:08,890
Unified engineering team the engineering team owns scheduling and

608
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,370
implementation and testing and quality and deployment etcetera.

609
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,050
The P.O.

610
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,620
you could think of as the new owner of the remainder.

611
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,830
No the P.O.

612
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,190
I like I like the idea of the P.M.

613
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,990
moving to the P.O.

614
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,710
Yes it's a distinct set of stuff that a P.O.

615
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,150
does.

616
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,350
It's not the remainder.

617
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:29,750
Right.

618
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:36,030
The pro the transitional problem is as bluntly we have too many P.M.s.

619
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:36,790
Yes.

620
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,630
So in and the we don't need as many P.M.

621
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,350
as we have for the P.O.

622
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:42,790
role.

623
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,140
So I want to have them pick up the remainder purely as job security for my

624
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,500
friends still stuck in that role.

625
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,260
Yeah and I'm going to say screw that.

626
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,260
I'm going to say screw that in the long run but that's that the reason I brought

627
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:02,100
up as the remainder is because there's a transitional period in similar to how

628
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,100
there's been in test where testers have figured out former testers have

629
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,780
figured out where to sort of belong in the new world and most of them have.

630
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,580
And I guess in the same way we had to go through it.

631
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:13,980
P.M.

632
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:15,700
should figure out where they belong in that world too.

633
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,670
I completely agree.

634
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,950
The I'll walk through.

635
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:26,910
So I first encountered this this this P.M.

636
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:37,780
drama about five years ago when when I went to Bing and as as I wrote on my blog post at

637
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,140
Microsoft the U.E.

638
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:50,720
trans transformation started in Bing literally just a month before I joined in one of the I'd be

639
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,960
funded several P.M.

640
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,160
is there and there was a period where they were confused in terms of what value they had

641
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,920
and then some started focusing on customer stuff and started succeeding on this but even

642
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,740
those guys felt that it wasn't going to persist right.

643
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,900
The because a lot of the data they were looking at so Bing's rich in data and a lot of the

644
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,340
data they were looking at was essentially which customers are were pissing off.

645
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,960
They were focusing on D sat not C sat and they're like I don't know what I'm to do

646
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,600
because we're busily building up all of these great data tools and shortly the dev will be

647
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,640
able to figure out what's pissing off customers readily without me.

648
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,860
And I'm like right.

649
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,300
And that's the way it should be.

650
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:50,340
But dev can't focus on what are the new opportunities that we have no code for.

651
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:51,530
Right.

652
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,970
That's what you should be doing.

653
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,930
That's you should be designing a B experiments.

654
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:01,930
You should be thinking through what are opportunities that we can either grow our market or

655
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:14,600
increase revenue from our existing market and use your quality intuition skills to

656
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,760
generate a list of opportunities that we can run through and test very quickly.

657
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,480
I agree.

658
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,200
I agree.

659
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,000
And so what that means it goes into Steve's third question about shifts to development or

660
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,760
shifts to the members of the unified engineering team is that there are some old some

661
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:44,300
skills some tasks activities some activities previously done by PM belong on the dev team.

662
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,820
And like you thought the devs didn't want to do testing they don't want to do PM crap.

663
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,500
It's more efficient for it to be there.

664
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:59,020
And it further to me it further emphasizes the need for generalizing specialists and

665
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,740
specializing generalists on your unified engineering team.

666
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,100
Some people are going to be good at different things.

667
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,900
Some people just want to be told what to do.

668
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,900
Some people want to help figure out what to do.

669
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,620
There is room for all of those.

670
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,140
In fact you need all of those.

671
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:19,100
You need a mix of skills and a mix of interests to have a successful unified

672
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,660
engineering team.

673
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:24,660
I think it's much more efficient when you start moving a chunk of that previously owned

674
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,320
of the activities when you move a chunk of the previously owned activities from PM

675
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,080
to a unified engineering team.

676
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,800
So I'm full behind that.

677
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,840
I don't know exactly how that transition happens because right now the unfortunately

678
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,080
in most parts of Microsoft the PM role is much about wanting to get their thumbs in a

679
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,440
lot of different areas and having that wide exposure.

680
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,960
The program management role is a lot about I coordinate I schedule I know you don't.

681
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,560
You know I think I think it's the next step.

682
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,280
I think it's in a team like Microsoft or organization like Microsoft or in a team

683
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,360
structure like these Microsoft orgs with it's not like we have like a one to one

684
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:14,080
PM to dev ratio but we I would say in general we have far more than we need.

685
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,680
I would and we need to think are far more and I think that's the next step in our evolution as a

686
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,120
company.

687
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,440
We made a lot of strides in evolution how we make software.

688
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,260
I'm across most orgs at Microsoft.

689
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,940
I'm very proud.

690
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:34,340
I talked to no assessment shout out.

691
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:34,940
Thank you.

692
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,420
Thank you.

693
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,540
Thank you again Noah.

694
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,500
Noah was at Etsy.

695
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,140
He helped.

696
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:45,540
He helped take Etsy from the sort of the shipping weekly monthly to continuous deployment.

697
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,900
He knows what he's doing and I talked to him about what we're doing wanted to get his feedback and

698
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:54,860
and I feel like we're actually making software like a real company on my team.

699
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:55,980
I'm very excited about that.

700
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,700
I like Oh my God we're doing it right.

701
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,580
We're getting there.

702
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,900
Very exciting for me.

703
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:07,980
And I think despite despite I don't want to throw all PMs under the bus they mean well but I think the

704
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,900
next stage in the evolution of engineering at Microsoft at least is to evolve that PM role into

705
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,500
something more supportive of a efficient unified engineering team.

706
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:28,710
One of the one of the PM's that I worked with a lot in being left teams four years ago and he asked me

707
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:38,740
to come in and help train up his current team on agile practices in particular Kanban and I met him

708
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,700
couple of months ago.

709
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,660
I happened to do a presentation for H.R.

710
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,340
And he was in the room and he's like dude we need to sync up.

711
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:57,500
I've gotten my whole 300 person org executing using Kanban.

712
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,100
And it's the happiest I've seen him.

713
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,100
Right.

714
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:11,800
It's the PM role when when they simultaneously do things let go of command and control and stay

715
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:18,760
consistent on maximize business value and customer value.

716
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,200
It ends up being a lot of work for them.

717
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,240
They keep themselves busy.

718
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,040
You're able to prune off the crappy folks and when we get rid of command and control right.

719
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,410
They become so in P.O. you know the role of acceptance testing.

720
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:42,190
So what is an acceptance test in a scrum model.

721
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,210
The P.O. does the acceptance test.

722
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,240
Okay.

723
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,260
Do they do any testing.

724
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:50,710
Sure.

725
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:51,190
No.

726
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,830
None.

727
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:52,750
None.

728
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,590
None.

729
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:59,590
This is something that is very the best acceptance test.

730
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,610
The product isn't even there.

731
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,460
So the role of the P.O. right when when you're doing agile the P.O.

732
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:20,260
Sets down and says these are the outcomes these are the use cases I want solved and then we'll generate a definition of done that is not the ideally not framed in.

733
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,860
No I get that.

734
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:22,260
Right.

735
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:33,820
Well so then the dev team wants to claim that they're done and so they do they sit with the P.O.

736
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:46,330
The best P.O.s will do a bunch of precision questioning around how did you assure that this fulfilled that requirement.

737
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,640
The worst P.O.s will open up the product and retested themselves.

738
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:59,220
The Intel has gone through that acceptance review and it's more of a precision.

739
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:10,820
Alan explained to me so this this particular situation the outcome was it needed to scale out very high.

740
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:11,580
Right.

741
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:18,180
And then let's say I mad it needs to scale out to end instances of whatever is important to your team.

742
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:18,940
Okay.

743
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,180
How did you prove it did that.

744
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:26,050
I launched a bunch of VMs and VMs and deployed and it was fun.

745
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,820
For how long.

746
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,260
Just like a minute.

747
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,540
What's right.

748
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,820
And so and so that is an end.

749
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:42,150
I don't struggle with that from the idea of like that's the right thing to do.

750
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:44,510
I struggle with that is those.

751
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,230
I was talking before about the transition from P.M. to P.O.

752
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,230
Most the P.M. I know can't become that P.O. it's a different person.

753
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:54,590
They can't.

754
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:02,050
There are there are several that that I am aware of that are working in most several others are.

755
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:02,890
Let me put it this way.

756
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,130
I think it's a difficult transition.

757
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:14,630
The thing I'm addressing because the one pattern that I saw in my last team when when P.M. started going through this thing.

758
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,160
That it literally was P.M. becoming the remainder.

759
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:24,050
And I I saw it from day one.

760
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:28,130
The the codependency loop being reconstructed.

761
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:35,220
Yeah I could see that and I would go to P.M. and say when you are signing off on this thing.

762
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,830
You should not even have the product in the room.

763
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:44,230
I see where you're coming from and there is an interesting parallel here.

764
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:45,910
A lot of teams at Microsoft.

765
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:52,710
When moving to the unified engineering they decided that OK most you testers are now data scientists.

766
00:46:53,570 --> 00:47:01,890
And some of them embraced it and and figured it out and became really good data scientists and a bunch of others just waving their hands around trying to figure out what it means.

767
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:11,410
I see the same thing happening in the P.M. to P.O. some will get it and embrace it and be excellent at it and there'll be a bunch more kind of way of their hands and figure it out what it means.

768
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:16,370
On my current team the majority of the P.M.s.

769
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:28,750
There are I would say it's 75 25 25 percent are still holding on with white knuckles to the old world but the majority of the P.M.s that I'm I'm working with.

770
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:40,320
They're coming to me and say hey Brent I want to I want to sit with you and see if we have the data because I have this idea for a business opportunity.

771
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,900
And I want to see if the data sort of aligns with this intuition.

772
00:47:46,960 --> 00:48:01,770
And for example there's there's one new feature that we're going to fund in Azure that directly came from me and this one P.M. working together and realizing that yeah it does look fine.

773
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:17,180
So he then I then pulled in a list of internal customers on Azure and he's now going through and doing a road show and testing out whether or not the internals.

774
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,460
I just said he was testing.

775
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:26,390
He's testing out whether or not this would be a valuable thing to those guys.

776
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,070
Remember Brent words have meaning.

777
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:29,590
They do.

778
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,550
They run a time.

779
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:34,670
Fun episode 41.

780
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:35,950
It was a fun 41.

781
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:38,270
Next one's up is 42.

782
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:40,230
All right. I'm Alan. I'm Brett.
