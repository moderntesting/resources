1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,350
Hey everybody, I'm Alan and Brent won't get his butt in his seat.

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,500
Oh, oh, wait, Brent's actually going to join us for this podcast.

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,940
Hey, Brent, how's it going?

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,260
And I'm Brent.

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,700
Yeah, what the hell? It's episode 23. Right.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,380
It is.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,100
Hey, don't forget to talk in the microphone.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,020
Twenty three. Michael Jordan's number, right?

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,190
Yeah, it's fine. I can. God dang, you're a doofus.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,830
How about you talk in the microphone?

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:37,830
And hello, here's the microphone.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,270
And then you'll be bigger and I will level it later.

13
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,750
Because I always have to because you seem to want to wander to and fro from the microphone,

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,270
even though you're just sitting in a chair.

15
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,950
All right. Episode 23. Michael Jordan's number.

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,310
More importantly, David Beckham's number at Real Madrid.

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,670
I don't remember what number he played with at Galaxy, but I always remember.

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,390
Beckham is 23 also.

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,710
I'm sure there are some other ones.

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,790
Twenty three. Can you believe 23?

21
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,140
And not once have I punched you in the face.

22
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:14,300
So one of the consequences that we now have, as as Alan has mentioned a couple of episodes ago,

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,740
that we changed the time of the day.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,420
And so now it's now I think the second or third time.

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,020
But you walk in and you're not prepared.

26
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,130
Yeah. Hey, you know what?

27
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,130
We're not going to hash this. We have this shut up.

28
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,250
You know, I'll be on time when we start to win in my building.

29
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,890
You know what?

30
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,050
We're going to have a discussion about that in just a minute.

31
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,770
Live. No, well, not live.

32
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,450
You know what it means.

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,770
We probably will.

34
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,610
We're going to get there.

35
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,650
So you didn't I say to the board to do one thing, which was to write the order up there.

36
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,730
And yet I see no numbers next to our list.

37
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,770
So I'm going to make it up.

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,330
I am becoming the product owner and I'm going to take over.

39
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,210
And if it's wrong, doesn't matter.

40
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,970
I'm in control top to bottom.

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:04,020
No, because number one on the list has to go third because it's not as exciting.

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,380
I don't think. OK.

43
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,460
All right. I'm product owner.

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,060
You shut up.

45
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,780
Hey, guess what tomorrow or today?

46
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,380
If if I actually get this done when I want to and get this podcast out on Friday,

47
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,540
June 5th, it will be exactly 20 years since my very first day at Microsoft.

48
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,900
Congratulations.

49
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,340
Twenty. How did this happen?

50
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,420
Oh, my God. Twenty years.

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,740
What do you mean? How did this happen?

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,340
Twenty awesome.

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,620
Twenty is down roller coaster years.

54
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,300
Some people could have those easy lives.

55
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,370
You have been a part of making history

56
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,650
and helping to change the company.

57
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,650
You know what? And you've experienced the roller coaster.

58
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,650
Shut up. Great. Shut up.

59
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,810
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

60
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,370
I never thought I would be here this long.

61
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,610
And guess what else?

62
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,590
You don't have to get going to be here this long.

63
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,670
This is no. This is where.

64
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,950
Brit, this is where we blow it because we already have a list

65
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,830
of what we're going to talk about.

66
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,790
So asking questions like guess what else?

67
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,110
Probably not the best way.

68
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,910
Wait, wait. Let me try.

69
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,660
Oh, Alan.

70
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,260
I would like you to start wearing pants to the podcast recordings.

71
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
That's not part of the.

72
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,060
All right. We don't really have a contract.

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,580
So I guess it's anything goes.

74
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,980
Hey, 20 years and guess what?

75
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,740
After thinking about it for a while and keeping my eyes open,

76
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,720
I have a new job.

77
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,080
I'll share a little bit at Microsoft.

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,040
I I found this job, which is that I've told Brent about it

79
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,640
a little bit so he can't act too interested.

80
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,120
But it's I think uniquely suited to me, which is

81
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,000
and some things we talked about, which is really cool.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,320
So I want to dive into that a little bit.

83
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,920
There's a Brent and I have talked about the efficiencies

84
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,480
that come with you to find engineering,

85
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,640
how you need generalizing specialists,

86
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,880
specializing generalists, especially people who really get quality.

87
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,720
I shouldn't butter myself up so much.

88
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,920
I found a team making a V1 product around collaboration.

89
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Tools. I'll just I'll stop there.

90
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,440
They have about 100 developers, unified engineering team,

91
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,880
and they want someone to come in and be the quality expert.

92
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,600
And no, this does not mean I'm writing all other tests for them.

93
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,640
Yeah. Because then I would just shoot myself.

94
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I mean, I actually enjoyed seeing people attempt that.

95
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,400
Not going to happen. Not going to happen.

96
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,600
Because the problem is, is that the people who want you to do it outnumber you.

97
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,280
No, it's everything from, you know,

98
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,360
Atlassian has this I read a couple of blog posts from Atlassian

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,960
a few years ago where they called QA quality assistance

100
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,600
and talked about the sort of role we've talked about where, you know,

101
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,280
coaching and mentoring developers are running good unit tests,

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,600
good code hygiene, et cetera.

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm really big and anal into code craftsmanship.

104
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,960
And I believe in broken window theory and keeping everything kind of clean.

105
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,840
And I don't know broken window theory.

106
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,680
Yeah, yeah, sure. You do.

107
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,240
Broken window theory.

108
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,280
If there's like an apartment building, this is

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,080
I first read about it in the pragmatic program, but I'm sure it's been around for a long time.

110
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,960
In fact, actually, I first read about it in the context of software development

111
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,360
and the pragmatic programmer. Great freaking book.

112
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,240
But the idea is that if there's a building like in a rundown part

113
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,520
of the neighborhood and one of the windows gets broken out,

114
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,720
if it gets fixed right away, it's going to stay nicer longer.

115
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,880
If you don't fix it, people are going to start breaking other windows.

116
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,800
And the metaphor for code is if it's like, why should I make this part?

117
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Why should I clean this up?

118
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,200
It's already kind of grody over here.

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,560
So the idea is in code and I'm really big into make everything right.

120
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,120
One of the things I noticed is like, hey, you know what?

121
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,240
We're not very consistent.

122
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,600
We're not the new team, which I haven't quite joined yet.

123
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,640
But I spent some time over there isn't really consistent on

124
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,430
comments on code chickens.

125
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,750
I thought, let's fix it up right away because I don't want to see,

126
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,950
you know, I want to know it's I want to be able to know

127
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,830
what's going on by browsing history.

128
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:00,270
And I think what happened there is a classic example that you mean

129
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,070
specifically, you mean not people commenting the code,

130
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,190
but actually people commenting the check.

131
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,470
Yes. Yeah.

132
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,350
I actually get value from browsing source history

133
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,670
and I get I get context for what's going on there.

134
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,470
And that's not accurate.

135
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,110
I don't want to dive into the whole why I like it and what it's good for.

136
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,230
But the point is, I think it's gotten to a stage.

137
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,070
This is a quick observation after two days on the team that

138
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,710
because nobody else does it, no need for me to do it.

139
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,110
And these things apply everywhere. Anyway, you've already started

140
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,190
kind of ish.

141
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,270
So my official start date because of Microsoft

142
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,590
and the weird things with our compensation model is in order for me

143
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,950
to get paid by my old team for the last year of work I did.

144
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,990
I can't I can't officially move until June 15th

145
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,410
with one of the model locks.

146
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,690
So don't give me that word.

147
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,250
Look, I got I got it all checked down.

148
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,490
They charge for check this.

149
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,850
OK, yes. I'm I'm spending probably half to three quarters of my time

150
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:59,130
between now and then doing what we should do all the time

151
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,850
at Microsoft when we change jobs, ramping down on one

152
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,730
while ramping up on the other. Yep.

153
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,970
So anyway, I'm going to back out of made a point.

154
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,490
Part of the job is just kind of being big on code quality

155
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,890
and code correctness.

156
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,450
I do believe that quality and care are two sides of the same coin.

157
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,050
So I'm going to help people put more care into code and check ins

158
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,290
and unit tests, et cetera, and do all the right things at the same time.

159
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,530
Also, I'm going to look big picture at

160
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,810
when there are people doing perf work, but I'm going to make sure

161
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:27,970
are we doing the right perf work?

162
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,930
Are we doing the right reliability work?

163
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,730
I'll have some vendors doing some exploratory testing.

164
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,570
I've got a chance to teach some E.T. for a while.

165
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,170
How are you?

166
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,210
I've been there a day and a half.

167
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,290
Don't ask anything too specific.

168
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,930
I'm making part of this up.

169
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,770
You're you're you're talking about a straight

170
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,370
strategy that you're going in with.

171
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,370
When you say doing the right work, what's your primary pivot for that?

172
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,240
It's the much of the discussion you talk about is that you you're

173
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,930
going in as a test centric or quality.

174
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,250
Now, quality centric.

175
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,810
Definitely more than the correctness sort of thing.

176
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,330
I think code correctness is because I have a passion around that

177
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:08,250
and I can for a team that hasn't done unit tests before.

178
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,690
Very well, very much unit testing.

179
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,810
And again, somebody I in my intro mail to the team, I mentioned this podcast

180
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,050
in hopes of picking up two more listeners.

181
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,170
The point is, is there's things that can do better

182
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,130
and I can help them do better in that area.

183
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,770
I don't think my new manager that's even on his radar of what he wants me to do,

184
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,210
but I'll do it because I think it's important and I think it will help.

185
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,410
I believe I'll draw I'll draw this with my hands for now, which is useless

186
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,410
for people out in the audience.

187
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,770
But I've been thinking of this sort of pyramid of software quality

188
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,690
where this long base at the bottom, I'm going to do it without with my hands

189
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,250
to see if Brent can understand it without the visuals.

190
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,130
So the measure at the base of this triangle or pyramid

191
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,610
is sort of the functional correctness, which is where a lot of testing

192
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,570
when I started 20 years ago, for example, where I spent a lot of my time

193
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:59,570
at the base of this triangle up a level from there, you have

194
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,730
maybe the illities belong there, the non-functional, you know,

195
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,370
whatever you want to call it, NFI, performance, reliability, security,

196
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,690
making sure you do the right stuff.

197
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,210
But you can actually run a lot of perf tests and run a lot of

198
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,690
reliability tests, et cetera, and do a lot of work there

199
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:19,450
without actually making software that's useful and has value for the customer.

200
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,490
Right. So that that top of that pyramid or the top of that triangle

201
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,610
is the things I'll probably spend the most of my time, which is in that work,

202
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,330
I'll look at is this useful?

203
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,930
Is it solving the right problems?

204
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,290
Even if the perf tests are passing, is perceived performance

205
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,370
for the customer good exploratory testing will fit in here.

206
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,010
I'll definitely ask people doing that.

207
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:43,410
And this is where also data analysis as well, both from a qualitative

208
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,050
and a quantitative aspect will come into play.

209
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,850
Are you officially stating that you are entering into the data analyst scheme?

210
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,050
I am officially stating that looking at because this is a web app

211
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,050
that will eventually be used by large numbers of people, that

212
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,690
knowing how to do effective data analysis and helping the team adapt

213
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,250
to the insights from that data will be part of my job.

214
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,050
And freaking testing.

215
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,130
So anyway, I'm pretty excited that the breadth of the role was much better

216
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,570
for me than some of the more in-depth things I've been doing recently.

217
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,130
I don't think I'll say this in my blog, but I'll put it in the podcast.

218
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,490
But I have said before that working on my two years in Xbox

219
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,050
was the best five years of my career.

220
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,450
Fantastic time. Oh, my God, that I work hard.

221
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,410
My two years in part of the operating systems group at Microsoft

222
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,510
were Project Astoria, cool project buried under windows somehow.

223
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,150
But my two years in the operating systems group have probably been

224
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,550
the longest five years of my career.

225
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,390
The direct manager I work for the team I work with.

226
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,510
Absolutely fantastic.

227
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,950
As we build concentric circles out from there, it's like just not.

228
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,750
It doesn't align with my passions, what I'm interested in,

229
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,550
the way I like to work.

230
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,950
But I didn't want to just go to a job to get out.

231
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,790
I wanted to find something that really like that was the right job for me.

232
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,590
So I took a long time to kind of what I call passively look

233
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,030
and last two things and.

234
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,820
And if you don't mind, I'll go ahead and tell a quick story how I got this job.

235
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,940
Yeah, I was passively.

236
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,900
I just won a Saturday. It was a Saturday.

237
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,700
But I'm just going to look at the internal job site

238
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,940
and take a look and see what's around.

239
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,860
And and on a whim, I had emailed Brent like a week before I said, hey,

240
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,900
I'm thinking of maybe being a manager.

241
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,460
He was like, I'd be a fine manager.

242
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,660
I'm thinking, oh, my God, I want to be.

243
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,860
So anyway, I thought I'd look at manager jobs and I was flipping through.

244
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,820
It's like, no, no, hell no.

245
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,740
And then I see this one which sounds like the hell no.

246
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,900
I don't. OK, it was probably one of my current group.

247
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,460
I don't know. Yeah, current division.

248
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,060
But I saw one. It was interesting.

249
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,220
It was it was a lot about quality.

250
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,580
And it's hard.

251
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,980
One thing about Microsoft now, if I shift to unified engineering,

252
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,900
a lot of teams, it's difficult to figure out who has which teams,

253
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,700
which job descriptions I could kind of leverage my passion for quality

254
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,900
and experience into. But anyway, this one, I read it.

255
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,140
And it's not like they want someone with a lot of quality experience.

256
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,460
And I didn't see much about actually managing a team in there.

257
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,380
I thought, well, this is interesting.

258
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,420
I'm not sure what they really want. It was manager.

259
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,340
Yes, under manager jobs.

260
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,180
And it was a Saturday.

261
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,780
I sent some mail. I got a reply that day.

262
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,260
Not that people should be working on Saturdays all the time.

263
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,180
It just happened to.

264
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,380
We set up an appointment for the following Thursday.

265
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,760
So several days from then in.

266
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:42,880
It turns out they wanted he put it as a test manager job

267
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,880
because he had an experience with the really good test managers of the past

268
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,720
or that kind of big picture thinking about quality, et cetera, et cetera.

269
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,320
But he didn't mention much about the team in there

270
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,200
because he didn't want a testing.

271
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,600
He wanted a quality guy who didn't want didn't care about having a big team.

272
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,440
I thought, well, hell, that sounds like me.

273
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,560
So I talked to

274
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,240
one of their dev managers on Friday.

275
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,350
That was in the three day weekend came up.

276
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,710
And then the following Tuesday, I talked to three more people

277
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,950
and I had an offer.

278
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,820
Wednesday or Thursday.

279
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:23,220
I recently we talked about this couple of several podcasts ago about my job change.

280
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,500
And we spent a lot of time talking about my experience of the new interview process.

281
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,980
Do you have a similar?

282
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,980
Yeah, this is really interesting because I've given a lot of feedback to our team on.

283
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,060
Let's get out of old school interviews.

284
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,300
And and it was great.

285
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,580
The way the interview loop went, it wasn't a loop set up by HR.

286
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,580
The guidance I got from my upcoming new manager was set up one on ones with these people.

287
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,180
And so I did.

288
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,580
I took care of setting up some time on their schedules.

289
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,500
And and I met with everybody and they asked.

290
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,140
This is weird.

291
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:08,380
They asked good questions that I felt like both allowed them to understand what I brought

292
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,980
to the table that would help their team and help me learn about their team.

293
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,500
And there wasn't a lot of like, why are you asking me how many golf balls could fit in

294
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,060
a bus or to reverse a linked list or whatever?

295
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,820
And whole coverage.

296
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:26,000
We actually we actually had conversations about crap that was relevant.

297
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,940
It was refreshing as hell.

298
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,820
You've gone through several other type of experiences.

299
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,460
Were those more old school?

300
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,820
So one of the things that you guys don't know is that this is something Alan and I

301
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,260
have been talking about for, I don't know, months.

302
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,120
It feels like right.

303
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,880
Alan has been as he was was doing he.

304
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,590
Alan's a capitalist.

305
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,270
Yeah, he is that good or bad?

306
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,230
It's good. All right. Great.

307
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,830
I'm yeah, I'll let it be was passively.

308
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,990
He's always interested in exploring a better offer.

309
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,990
And one pattern that he's talked about here on the podcast before

310
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:05,750
is he kind of has a preference to sort of change things up

311
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,590
for himself over a couple of years.

312
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,910
It's certainly come to that.

313
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,590
I've changed even when I've changed jobs in the same group, it's been about

314
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,270
every two years and he used to tease me about it.

315
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,350
I said, no, it's not like that.

316
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,390
And it's not like I it's weird.

317
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,830
It's not like I change the jobs on purpose.

318
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,510
Like two years I'm getting a new job,

319
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,070
but I'm always looking for the new challenge.

320
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,110
And it seems like I find the next cool thing about every two years.

321
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,470
I actually think it's just how the world runs now.

322
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,550
It could be. You know, I spent just over four years

323
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,430
in engineering excellence, but I changed jobs partway through.

324
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,870
I did two years as an IC, then two years as the director over there.

325
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,670
And then I spent 18 months in in link, a little shorter on my on my spin.

326
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,710
Two years, two years in Xbox.

327
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,390
And then I just followed my manager over to Project Astoria.

328
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,790
Two years there.

329
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,750
And I don't know, maybe two years on this team.

330
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,820
I don't know.

331
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,180
I when I went to my last team, I was fairly certain

332
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,780
I was going to be there five years plus.

333
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,220
But I only did just over two years.

334
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:08,820
Stuff happens. So anyway, lots more will come up from that.

335
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:13,100
There's I'm excited about all the sort of the stuff that's in my core.

336
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,500
I get to start doing some new things.

337
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,940
I get to start trying.

338
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,910
I think it'll be a good time.

339
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,910
Yeah, I'm looking forward to.

340
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,710
Oh, hopefully I'll be part of your communication chain.

341
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:26,030
You start getting into the.

342
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,670
Yeah, you'll have to be. You'll have to be.

343
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,710
And let me plant a seed.

344
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,470
We're not going to hash this out now and bore that and and further bore our

345
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:36,430
listeners. But one thing about this job, it's in downtown Bellevue.

346
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,830
So I'm moving about five miles away from branch.

347
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,430
So we got to figure out where and when to get a decent recording in and maybe,

348
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,510
you know, and how to actually meet.

349
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,550
I am not going to Bellevue.

350
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:50,230
Hell, you're not at 5 p.m.

351
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,990
That's true. I'm just making that super good.

352
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,430
The all right.

353
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,710
So I spent time working in Bellevue and and no, I understand completely.

354
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,040
So maybe I was going to say, I was going to say working in

355
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,000
in in the Bellevue branch of the Bellevue area for the Microsoft stuff.

356
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,080
Best work location I have ever done.

357
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,640
And if nothing else, I am indeed

358
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,680
incredibly envious of you for just that.

359
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:21,480
I loved working in Bellevue that much.

360
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,220
But going from Redmond to Bellevue, not cool, not cool.

361
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,460
We'll go back to mornings.

362
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,900
Maybe we'll switch and do like one in.

363
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,860
We'll figure something out.

364
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,060
But you and I can figure that out.

365
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,140
It's closer to your home now, isn't it?

366
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,460
Yeah, a little bit with traffic.

367
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,860
It's about the same commute.

368
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,500
We'll figure it out over time.

369
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,300
Anyway, yeah. All right. Be fun.

370
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,780
20th floor. Oh, 20th. Yeah, that's cool.

371
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,100
Yeah, good view up there.

372
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,540
Should be great. All right.

373
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,980
Oh, I wrote A.B. testing up there, but for that to tell you what it was about.

374
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,100
We're changing subjects, by the way.

375
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,180
OK, we're moving on.

376
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,100
Is this A.B. testing the blog or is that a slash?

377
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,740
That's I put a slash there.

378
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,660
Wow. Because guess what?

379
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Now we're getting contextual.

380
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,740
Do you remember the time?

381
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,780
Double entendre.

382
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,340
Do you remember that one time where I said I went in bank camp?

383
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,060
No, sorry. It's a movie quote

384
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,380
where I said I wasn't going to do as many conferences for a while.

385
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes. Well, I got a call. OK.

386
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,560
I got an email. Nobody nobody gets calls anymore.

387
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,120
You get an email or a text.

388
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,160
But inviting like a speaker dropped out of the Better Software Conference next week.

389
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,600
And I'm going to go down and give a talk on A.B. testing. Are you?

390
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,480
OK, I think.

391
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,560
And are you yet an expert on this topic?

392
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,320
Oh, actually, I would say I definitely know more than the layperson.

393
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,560
And I thought I haven't finished, you know, it seems like it'll be

394
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,800
some good research to help prep you.

395
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,600
No, no, no. I'm actually I feel pretty good about what I have.

396
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm giving a talk about inside the mind of the 21st century customer at Star Canada.

397
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,120
And I stole some of that.

398
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,960
But it kind of turns out, I think I kind of want to give half the talk on

399
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,840
houses for an A.B. testing talk.

400
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,520
I should give the talk twice. No, this is not A.B.

401
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,040
This is like a then I don't know how you describe this.

402
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,760
But I think I'm going to give half the talk on how awesome A.B.

403
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,280
testing is and the insights you can get, how much you can learn from it.

404
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,760
And the second half of the talk on how A.B.

405
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,160
testing is impossible to get right.

406
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,080
How you should never do it and trust the results.

407
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,530
And then the A.B. test, maybe we'll see what their takeaway is.

408
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:35,570
How long do you have an hour?

409
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,210
It's an hour. Yeah, that's it'll be interesting to see if people get it.

410
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,250
What you're doing.

411
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,930
I'm not sure I'm going to do it that way yet, but there is some emphasis.

412
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,250
And I can't tell I have the abstract from the person who was originally scheduled.

413
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,250
So I can't really tell what they were going to do.

414
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,250
But I think it's really important when you talk about A.B.

415
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,250
testing to go into statistical significance and figure out

416
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,050
what your sample size has to be to make sure you can really understand

417
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,850
and believe and talk about confidence levels and and Z scores, et cetera,

418
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,130
to be able to figure that stuff out. Wow.

419
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,410
I know shit, man.

420
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,770
I'm impressed. Hold up the Z score.

421
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:11,970
Boom. I don't have a memorize.

422
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,150
I have to use the little chart thingy.

423
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,820
Do you know P stat? I don't P stat.

424
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,060
OK, because that needs to be along.

425
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,340
Yeah, that belongs in the equation. You're correct.

426
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,500
The one thing

427
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,900
that's really critical when it comes to A.B. testing,

428
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,180
crafting your experiment is hard.

429
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,380
Yeah. And that's part of the second part of that second half.

430
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,420
Yeah. You know, your designers are going to come to you and say, all right,

431
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,100
what we want to do is change the background to a gradient fill,

432
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,940
reduce the banner and add one more icon to the top row.

433
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,660
And that'll be our experiment.

434
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,620
And your your job is the as the scientists go.

435
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:54,380
That is not an experiment.

436
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
Oh, that's an experiment. Well, yeah. A.B.

437
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,820
No, that's ABCD and Q.

438
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,610
I know it's a slash BCD. Right.

439
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,340
And yeah, it's really hard.

440
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,940
You really want to.

441
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,540
And we'll talk about the null hypothesis and making sure that you like

442
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,700
really what you want to do, and this is this is true in a lot of analysis.

443
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,500
If you want to prove that I mean, if you go in and look at the data

444
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,300
with the idea that it's a lot of opportunity for confirmation bias.

445
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,620
If you go and look at the data and go, I want this to show that this treatment

446
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,660
is better and and maybe if you look and you'll find it a lot of times.

447
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,940
But if you go and I need to prove that there is no difference between these.

448
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,380
No, when you can't prove that, that's when you actually maybe have some good interest.

449
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,740
So all those points I'm going to bring up, I'm not an expert.

450
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:43,090
Biases is is a brilliant topic for that.

451
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,810
Yeah. Last bit.

452
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,930
So it was a yeah, go on.

453
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,090
And there's another story that I'm reminded of.

454
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:55,810
There's another bias I'm trying to selection bias.

455
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,410
Mm hmm.

456
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,080
Have you ever heard the story about the World War Two airplanes?

457
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,400
I heard that airplanes.

458
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,840
They did go on.

459
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,600
And because even if I told you I heard it, it probably important

460
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,360
at this point for you to tell it anyway.

461
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,600
Fair enough.

462
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,560
Then I shall attempt to proceed to do that. Great.

463
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,480
Yeah, I heard that story.

464
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,280
OK, moving on.

465
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,240
We're going to tell me about the airplanes.

466
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Thus airplane story.

467
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,760
Now, so what happened at the NATO Air Forces?

468
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:30,370
What they what they were finding is that

469
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,250
the Germany was shooting their planes out of the sky

470
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,410
because far too many planes kept on coming back

471
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
are far too few planes kept on coming back.

472
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,280
I've heard this. I do know this story.

473
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,600
It's good, though.

474
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,080
And at this point, you kind of have to continue.

475
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,920
So continue. Yeah, I like it.

476
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,040
Well, so do you want me to give away the ending ending?

477
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,000
Spoiler alert.

478
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:52,560
I'll shut up.

479
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,280
So what they did is they

480
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,330
analyzed the bullet patterns of the planes that did came back.

481
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,330
Did came back.

482
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,730
They did manage to return.

483
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,090
Did have maybe came back ish.

484
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,860
Go on. I'm sorry.

485
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,220
Planes that returned.

486
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,180
They analyzed the bullet patterns of those planes. OK.

487
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,140
And they reinforced the armor in those sections

488
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,620
and they they noticed

489
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,100
that it was having no impact on the rate of decline.

490
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,760
I'm not going to say it.

491
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,720
Yeah. Go on.

492
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,840
I don't remember the name.

493
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,280
Do you remember the name of the guy?

494
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,240
No.

495
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
So there was one guy.

496
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,120
You might have told this story on the podcast before too, but go on.

497
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,720
There was one guy that

498
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,160
if I had prepared for it today, I would have his name.

499
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,050
We don't prepare that basically analyze what they are.

500
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,930
Are read through what they're doing and basically did a head slap.

501
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,740
You guys are being idiots.

502
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,020
I love saying that.

503
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,620
Because the planes you need to analyze

504
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,660
are not the ones that returned, but the ones that didn't.

505
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,430
Yeah.

506
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,160
That was my head slap. Yeah.

507
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,280
And there was a there was a recent adventure here locally

508
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,950
where something very similar happened.

509
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,390
A team, a partner team,

510
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,270
very much like these guys,

511
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,710
and they're getting into the data science base and real data science stuff.

512
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,590
And they they've actually several of the seminars.

513
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:31,430
They've talked about the work that they've done.

514
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,190
I haven't seen the latest results.

515
00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,070
I got I got to them before they started doing the initial ones,

516
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:40,810
but they were trying to do churn prediction.

517
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,740
OK, and I said, well, that's fantastic.

518
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,420
What are you defining as churn?

519
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,220
Well, when they stop logging in. OK.

520
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,290
Now, one of the discussions when you talk about churn prediction,

521
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,970
you talk about these statistics known as precision and recall.

522
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,020
OK, and I'm not going to go into it now, but the important one is precision.

523
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:12,000
And that's basically how well the algorithm predicts the truth.

524
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,560
Correct. OK, so you apply it to the old test data

525
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,680
and then it tells you how good you did. OK.

526
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,720
And they had a 70 percent precision on their algorithm.

527
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,840
I'm like, that's fantastic.

528
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,760
What features do you use?

529
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,480
Now, for those who aren't data scientists,

530
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,360
features in this context don't mean product features,

531
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,520
but it's essentially a fancy way of saying

532
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,600
what are the data points you're looking at?

533
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,080
OK, and he's like, oh, that's easy.

534
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,620
We just looked at logins.

535
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:49,060
And I'm like, OK, so you're using logins to predict logins.

536
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,090
So let me guess what your churn prediction has determined

537
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,210
when people stop logging in, they're going to churn.

538
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,610
He's like, yes.

539
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,660
I'm like, that's because that's exactly what you're measuring.

540
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,020
That needs a little bit more than a head slap.

541
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:11,180
Yeah. And I'm like, you need to go up a stack

542
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:17,200
and determine what are the actions other than login

543
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,760
that are likely to predict that the next session is they're not going to log in.

544
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,760
And so they have enhanced it.

545
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,490
They're still heavily using login, but they're now pivoting

546
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:33,330
their their turn prediction more around frequency and recency of logins.

547
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,730
So they've pivoted more towards a time series analysis,

548
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,810
which makes it a bit more valuable.

549
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:43,370
Anyway, I'm just like, well, of course.

550
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,250
But then I asked the important question, wait a minute.

551
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,450
How is your precision only 70 percent?

552
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,680
And they don't know the answer.

553
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,840
They didn't know the answer to that one.

554
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:59,600
Right. And which implies that people make a decision actually to to not come back.

555
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,150
But they're still following a normal login pattern.

556
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,750
Very interesting.

557
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:13,430
That both confirmation bias and selection bias are very seductive.

558
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,670
That they're there.

559
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,190
You want to be right.

560
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:26,840
And the I tell people if you're going to be in a data science space, especially

561
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,510
being right is what's important.

562
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,020
Credibility, the credibility of your data is what's important.

563
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:43,020
And even one instance of being wrong hurts you.

564
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,980
Yeah, a lot.

565
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,380
This is why communication communicating things in terms of confidence intervals

566
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,380
and and going through a structured way of designing your experiment

567
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:02,650
and getting it reviewed with the intent of telling people,

568
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:08,050
I need to make sure I am explicitly filtering out confirmation and selection bias.

569
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:13,570
This is why I think people rather than what I've seen done on some teams

570
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,690
where let's take all these people that used to do this thing and make them data

571
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,210
scientists is let's just let the people who know what the hell they're doing

572
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:28,020
or are committed to learning what the hell to do are doing this.

573
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:32,590
I think there's this gap between data science and data guessing.

574
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,320
That I want to that just it scares the crap out of me.

575
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,360
Yeah, I don't see a whole lot of data guessing, but if I did, I bet you it would be

576
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,320
wrapped under the shroud of what I do see, which is data puke reporting.

577
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,520
Yeah, as you see data puke.

578
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:59,000
But but for data guessing, I'm talking about the decisions made

579
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,640
with selection bias, confirmation bias.

580
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,640
Like I've I've I've I've I have some data and I made a completely wrong choice

581
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,480
about it because I didn't look at it objectively or apply some principles

582
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,760
around confidence, confidence levels, etc.

583
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,680
There's a couple of instance instances where I did.

584
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,160
So it's what's known as EDA.

585
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,920
Have I used that acronym before?

586
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,720
No, but you've certainly used a lot of weird acronyms.

587
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,920
EDA is exploratory data analysis.

588
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Oh, yeah.

589
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,320
If we were in dev, it would be XDA.

590
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,060
And that's probably what caused confusion.

591
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,420
Long story, not going to repeat it.

592
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:34,860
Yeah.

593
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,580
But it's a good one.

594
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,020
You should go back to that podcast.

595
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,820
Go search.

596
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,420
Hey, be testing for.

597
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,380
Hey, Brent.

598
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,380
STFU.

599
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,650
Yeah, I can guess what that means.

600
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,210
I'm moving on.

601
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,570
It's important to do exploratory data analysis.

602
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:51,930
And I did I did something very recently.

603
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,810
Like I can't talk about it here, but I did something very recently.

604
00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:03,820
And I have found what appears to be a significant customer, not only

605
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,780
a significant, but if the data holds true, it would be the single most

606
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:15,780
significant customer segment for the team that I'm on right now that no one

607
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,700
knew about or it would end up being the single most important customer segment.

608
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:24,060
But no one talks about it as if no one knows about it.

609
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,850
And it's primarily because how they're looking at the data.

610
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,730
They're not able to observe this.

611
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:34,060
Now, so when I walk people through the story and I show them the data,

612
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,560
I make it very clear.

613
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:42,770
Now I'm very excited about this and I'm very happy to share it with you, but

614
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:47,970
you cannot go off and explain it as truth because I have not gone through

615
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:54,050
yet and validated that this still holds true against the entire population.

616
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,890
I have a, I have a small sample set.

617
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,130
It holds true here.

618
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:04,900
I now need to test it against the whole sample set to make sure it still holds

619
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:10,310
true and if it does, then I'm going to start going through and understanding

620
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:15,940
a little bit more about this customer base because again, no one knows about it.

621
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,740
Would the, um, in this case, would the null hypothesis be to prove that this

622
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,520
customer segment has, is not important as compared to the others?

623
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:34,710
The whole, the null hypothesis would be, let's say my, the distribution

624
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:37,950
that I've drawn together, the distribution of this customer segment.

625
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:44,380
Uh, in essence is not important, is not significant.

626
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:44,620
Right.

627
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,460
Right.

628
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,260
I think I kind of said that.

629
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:47,740
You did.

630
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,300
All right.

631
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,700
Great.

632
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,940
I was briefly trying to think through the more data science-y way of doing it,

633
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,740
but I failed to do it.

634
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,700
It wouldn't time a lot of it.

635
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,140
Hey, guess what?

636
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:56,740
Yeah.

637
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,500
Guess what?

638
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:58,870
Red.

639
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,550
Oh, so close.

640
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,750
The answer is mailbag.

641
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,900
Oh, it feels good.

642
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,700
What has that been two months?

643
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,660
It's been a while since we've done a mailbag.

644
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,220
Yeah.

645
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:12,860
All right.

646
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,540
We don't really have one.

647
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,180
I just wanted to say that.

648
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,420
I'm kidding.

649
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,300
I'm kidding.

650
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,140
We do.

651
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:17,900
We do.

652
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:18,180
We do.

653
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,140
Um, a couple of things.

654
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,660
Always appreciate the comments, always appreciate the corrections,

655
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,020
always appreciate the snarkiness.

656
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:28,100
Um, one quick, or the help, like, uh, do you remember episode 22?

657
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,420
Yeah.

658
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,340
Um, where we,

659
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,220
Oh, yes, there it is.

660
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:31,580
Yeah.

661
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,860
I did Brent.

662
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,620
I had no idea how to say 22 in German.

663
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,140
Brent gave it a shot.

664
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,700
And fortunately our former colleague Ron Pilgrim corrected.

665
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,540
And I'm not even going to try and say it because my German is horrible.

666
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:47,900
Of course.

667
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,460
So now we know that.

668
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,100
Yeah.

669
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,620
Um, Hey, and then Matt helped us out.

670
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,300
We were talking about last time are, you know, people finding episodes.

671
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,420
We're doing a little bit of exploratory analysis on our downloads, et cetera.

672
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:06,330
And then sometimes, uh, there's a face slap comment, like, uh, your RSS feed only

673
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,290
shows the last 10 episodes and nobody knows the other ones exist.

674
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,930
So I changed the RSS feed to show all the episodes and we'll see if that makes a

675
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,650
difference, but anyway, great advice.

676
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,790
Was he just saying, Hey, this would add value to his life or was he saying,

677
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,030
he said, or was this a hypothesis for all the bad things we did?

678
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,110
It was a hypothesis.

679
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:30,070
Look, I started listening recently and I can only see back 10 episodes.

680
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:30,790
I didn't know the other ones.

681
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,070
You even have posts anywhere.

682
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:34,790
And I said, I'm using up all kinds of storage on my server.

683
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,350
Might as well show them all.

684
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,750
So we'll see if it makes a difference.

685
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,310
He said, he started listening the most recent and then worked backwards and

686
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,190
it didn't look like one was available.

687
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:43,910
Yeah.

688
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,460
But if there's only 10, the last 10, but we see one, two, three, four in the

689
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,580
middle, some five is the bottom.

690
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,780
I'm not saying everybody found them, but look, it doesn't hurt.

691
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,140
No, Matt, you're fantastic.

692
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,460
Thank you.

693
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,500
Love it.

694
00:33:59,740 --> 00:33:59,940
Yeah.

695
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,580
And you can tell Brent to STFU anytime you want.

696
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:09,990
And then, uh, there was a, a thread on Twitter that, uh, brand wanted to

697
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,190
talk about if I could find it.

698
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,310
Yeah.

699
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,510
I had made, uh, and I'm going to use this in one of my talks.

700
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:21,670
I forget which one, um, but we've all, many of us in testing.

701
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,030
I don't like to generalize have, uh, adopted the Jerry Weinberg quote

702
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,830
around quality where quality is value to some person.

703
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,580
Actually it's.

704
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,570
So you quoted him.

705
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,610
That is, well, no, no, you did it.

706
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:36,330
I get it.

707
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:36,890
Would you?

708
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:37,650
I am.

709
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:38,780
Go ahead.

710
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,180
All right.

711
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,820
Brent, I'm muting you.

712
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:45,620
So, and I believe that quality is value to some person that makes sense.

713
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,380
And there's all kinds of context around that, et cetera.

714
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:51,260
So I was thinking about the who owns quality question.

715
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:54,900
And, and then I thought I would twist that with that and make it my little

716
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,460
recipe and then Brent liked it.

717
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,740
And then discussion happened.

718
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:03,100
So if we were to say a quality is value to some person and some person is the

719
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,660
customer or the user of the software.

720
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:14,300
And, uh, can we ask who owns creating value for the customer quality?

721
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,140
So quality is value to some person who creates value for the customer.

722
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,300
The answer is the same.

723
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,020
It's still the whole team, but it sparked some interesting, uh, discussion.

724
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,860
Well, no, the answer, if you grow up in tests, it's the whole team.

725
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:28,570
Right.

726
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,730
If you grew up in dev, it's a fundamentally different answer.

727
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:38,260
I guess that's why I loved your, your value add to Weinberg's quote.

728
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,500
It's fantastic.

729
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:46,300
It's essentially a, but I'm not going to go into math, but I can't tell you the

730
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,900
number of times I have had the conversation around who owns quality, or

731
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,620
it wasn't the, a question mark.

732
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:59,580
It was an exclamation point and there was a finger shoved in my nose.

733
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,440
Right.

734
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,260
The, the, because quality from a certain standpoint, particularly this is why

735
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,020
we were talking about your job, right?

736
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:16,810
Cause I have now gotten to quality is only the, from the customer point of view.

737
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,570
Absolutely.

738
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,010
And, and when, so when we talk about, we used to talk about years ago,

739
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:25,850
then, um, we would talk about engineering quality or code quality.

740
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:26,330
Okay.

741
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,210
I don't use those terms in that context anymore.

742
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,570
If it's code quality, the term I use now is code correctness.

743
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,260
Quality is only the customer subject to point of view.

744
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,660
Now I'm taking back the word.

745
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,300
Ah, interesting.

746
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:39,980
Yeah, I like that.

747
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,700
That makes sense.

748
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Um, the, Oh, by the way, I don't own quality on my new team.

749
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,860
So just in case you were wondering that are good.

750
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,220
Well, so one of the, I'm the quality guy, but I'm just to make sure that

751
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,300
people understand what it takes to, to create value for the customer.

752
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,540
So Alan, it was actually interesting cause I'm, I am much slower on Twitter

753
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,220
than Alan is Alan had actually put a period after, after slower.

754
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:06,860
Fair enough.

755
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,860
Or Alan, I am much slower than Alan.

756
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:09,900
Period.

757
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,820
Also fair enough.

758
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,940
Um, so he had posted that like a week before I retweeted it, but me, when

759
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,260
I retweeted it, it created a tweet storm.

760
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,280
And one of the things that it ended up at one point in time, it was starting

761
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,120
to become a battle of cliche.

762
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,400
Right.

763
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,080
Because the obvious answer is who, well, whoever owns producing value to the

764
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,960
customer, therefore is the one who owns quality and the answer is the whole team.

765
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,600
And then there's one of my least fricking favorite cliches on the planet.

766
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,900
Well, if everybody owns it, nobody does.

767
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:55,020
And I'm like, no, everyone owns it and they need to be living and breathing

768
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,020
as if that is the only thing that matters.

769
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,380
And yes.

770
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:05,570
Anyway, I thought that was extremely interesting that the thread did go off

771
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:13,720
and am morphed into a data science topic where they talk about the D I K W.

772
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,120
Which is actually an old concept.

773
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,160
I don't, I don't like the D I K W.

774
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,240
Uh, would you please decipher?

775
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,720
Uh, it's, it's how to shit or data flows, how data flows.

776
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,800
Yes, exactly.

777
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,680
So D I K W is data information, knowledge and wisdom.

778
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,940
See that silent K that's that, that just, it makes, it makes it not work.

779
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,900
The silent K in knowledge.

780
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:41,860
Sure.

781
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:45,020
If it's going to be silent and knowledge, we should just call it D I W.

782
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,580
Actually.

783
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:52,740
So it's, it was interesting because literally yesterday, uh, totally

784
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,940
different contexts, I was having this discussion with another person who

785
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,580
was familiar with the D I K W pyramid.

786
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:06,660
The, the current practice is not to have the W it's D I K A.

787
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,680
And what's a action.

788
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:17,650
Oh, that the, the point of any sort of data process.

789
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,570
So I don't know how they define it here.

790
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,210
Well, they define wisdom is collective application of knowledge in action.

791
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,410
Yeah.

792
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,410
Um, let me, let me read this out loud.

793
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:36,690
Data is decisive objective facts about the event information, a message meant

794
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:38,730
to change the receiver's perception.

795
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,010
Yeah.

796
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:45,450
So that's different knowledge, experience, values, context, supply to a message.

797
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,890
And wisdom, collective application of knowledge in action.

798
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,290
Yeah.

799
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:57,040
So I like the word action better because the word wisdom is hiding

800
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,360
actually what you're trying to do.

801
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,000
You're trying to, to change a direction.

802
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,920
You're trying to change someone's behavior.

803
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:10,490
Um, and then the way they frame information is, is weird to me as well.

804
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:14,210
The data is just raw facts, no inherent meaning.

805
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:16,850
Whereas information is that data.

806
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,990
Contextualize semantic meaning.

807
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,550
You have data puke data, a bunch of data.

808
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:26,350
You have some insight into that.

809
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:26,670
Yep.

810
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:31,750
Or, or some ways of organizing that data around, uh, uh, business knowledge,

811
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:35,700
et cetera, that allows you to get some insight and from that you can take

812
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,420
some action to paraphrase the pyramid.

813
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,280
The, the way I describe, uh, it's not knowledge acquisition and action.

814
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,400
The way I describe information versus knowledge is essentially you've heard

815
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,600
the term street smart versus book smart.

816
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:50,960
Mm-hmm.

817
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,480
Okay.

818
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,400
Knowledge is street smart.

819
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,780
Information is book smart.

820
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,300
Yeah.

821
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,340
So you know a lot of things, but, um, you don't need to know a lot of things.

822
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,940
You, but you, the things that you do know, you need to know how they can be used.

823
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,220
Knowledge is about the few things you do know.

824
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,220
You know how to achieve a goal just because you know how doesn't mean you

825
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,390
do, and that's where the action is critical.

826
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:21,790
Now the nice thing, the nice thing that they put in there in wisdom is

827
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,630
they're actually trying to say, they're trying to combine sort of collaboration

828
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:32,270
and knowledge sharing along with actionability and that's valuable.

829
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,870
But I think when people read this nowadays, they go, oh, this sounds like

830
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,630
BS, the soapbox philosophy crap.

831
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,910
How is it valuable to my business?

832
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:48,510
Whereas if you frame it as the whole goal of a data science team is to,

833
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:54,630
is to understand relationships between variables for the express purpose of

834
00:41:54,630 --> 00:42:01,470
accelerating decision-making or actions, whether it be by a human or by an automaton.

835
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,430
Gotcha.

836
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:02,870
Yeah.

837
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:08,710
Anyway, we, we, we, we wandered a bit there, but I, one thing, just to bring

838
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:11,710
that back is one thing I do believe that shocking on AB testing.

839
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,070
I know.

840
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:12,950
We wandered.

841
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,350
So to bring that back to a point I just remembered I'm making in one of

842
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:24,540
my, I think my keynote at star is I believe that this sort of this pyramid

843
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,620
or, or whatever metaphor you want to use for using customer data to gain

844
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:33,180
knowledge and take action is sort of reconnecting.

845
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,780
I'm not saying sort of, I'm saying this done, right.

846
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,060
This is how we reconnect the tester or reconnect the engineer with the customer.

847
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,620
So then we lost a little bit through, you know, what we used to do with

848
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,980
Explorer charter testing and, and, and the STE.

849
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
I don't think we did.

850
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,020
Uh, maybe we in general, didn't I think, I think in some places it was lost.

851
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,700
Cause it was all about, it was, it was all about functional correctness or code

852
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:03,500
correctness, as you call it, and less about usefulness and value for the customer.

853
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:06,150
And I believe we can get that through data.

854
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,550
I, I wrote a blog several years ago.

855
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,790
Back when you used to blog.

856
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:11,990
Yes.

857
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,590
I was about to accuse you of that, but suddenly you started posting blogs again.

858
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:19,720
You went for like four months without anything, but then I realized I had to

859
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,440
get a blog out before I can tell you now that I draw just about everything I

860
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,600
blog about is, uh, drawn from my work or from things I see going on in the world.

861
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,920
I haven't seen a lot, nothing in honestly, no offense to the listeners.

862
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,320
There isn't anything that I haven't said that I look at that, Oh, hum,

863
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,240
ho, hum, ho, hum.

864
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,560
So I draw from my job.

865
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,120
My job wasn't that the things that I thought the things I could write about,

866
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,640
do you want to know how to, um, really cool crap about pulling a build

867
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:54,320
definition from Jason and then pushing it to a TFS through PowerShell.

868
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,760
Not probably for my typical right list readers, not the coolest thing.

869
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,520
So now that I'm kind of moving towards something else, I'm getting a little

870
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,320
bit more inspired, et cetera, I'll find some cool things to talk about.

871
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:09,880
Um, I expect, anyway, does you have anything else important to say?

872
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:16,780
I did, but, but, but I was actively listening to you and it, it, it disappeared.

873
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,580
Hey, guess what?

874
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:17,980
Yeah.

875
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,780
Uh, I think it's at a time.

876
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:20,220
Yep.

877
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:21,100
We're out of time.

878
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,100
Someone's at a time.

879
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,250
Oh, I do remember.

880
00:44:24,290 --> 00:44:24,690
Hold on.

881
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:24,930
Hold.

882
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,010
Oh, we're not out of time.

883
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,250
No, we're not out of time.

884
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,090
So in that blog, that's how, that's how we got into weeds.

885
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,250
So there's a blog on my site.

886
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:36,570
Worst podcast ever.

887
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:40,580
Yeah.

888
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:40,940
No.

889
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:42,220
Not going into weeds again.

890
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,140
Uh, titled test doesn't know the customer.

891
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:46,540
Okay.

892
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,580
And, and it talks about an experience I went through with one of my mentors

893
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:57,260
a while ago, where for those who care, go to my blog test doesn't know the

894
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,920
customer, read it, you'll see.

895
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:09,420
But one of the conclusions that I came to at the end of it, spoiler, um, is test

896
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,940
didn't know the customer and actually never did.

897
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:14,540
I agree completely.

898
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,660
One of the things I bring up a lot is, yeah, I, it kind of pushes my buttons.

899
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:21,980
When I see the, uh, um, I'm the customer.

900
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,180
I said, no, you're not, you know, who's the customer, you know, the customer is,

901
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,300
you know, who the customer is the actual customer, not you.

902
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,580
So I never heard that.

903
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,940
What I heard is I'm the customer advocate.

904
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:36,220
I'm the customer's champion and it, you know, bringing up visions of, of a

905
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,420
gladiator and I'm going to defend the customer's honor.

906
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,220
And meanwhile, the customer was like, what are you doing?

907
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:43,820
I don't get a crap about that.

908
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,340
Exactly.

909
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,260
None of that matters to me.

910
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,740
I'm reacting to your comment of reconnecting tests, which I think in your

911
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:55,900
audience is probably the right way to phrase it, but here we like to speak

912
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:01,420
the truth on AB testing and it's really actually connect test with the customer.

913
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,780
Not re not really.

914
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,390
All right.

915
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:04,910
Well done.

916
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:05,710
Okay.

917
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,470
Guess who I'm not.

918
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:12,530
Brent, which I am.

919
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:19,010
I'm Alan and, um, thank you for listening to episode 23 of AB testing.

920
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,090
And we'll be back to talk to you soon.

921
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:22,290
See you guys.

922
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:22,890
All right.
