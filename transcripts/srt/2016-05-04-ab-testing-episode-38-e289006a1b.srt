1
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:17,790
Hey everybody! Howdy! I'm Allan. I'm Brent. And we're back for episode 30. Ocho. The Ocho.

2
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:22,670
30-Ocho, Tronte-Ocho. Did I just mix two languages? I was close enough.

3
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:30,630
Okay. Tronte-Ocho version 38. AB testing podcast. Did you say 20-Ocho? Tronte-Ocho?

4
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:38,500
Tronte-Ocho? I don't know. Tranta. Alright, take 2, just kidding. Yeah. We don't have

5
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,300
time for alternate takes. No. So how you been, Brent? You know, I am under

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,380
caffeinated today. How about you? I just took the lid off my coffee, which Brent

7
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,860
prepared for me by hand by hand. He pushed the buttons on the coffee machine,

8
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,700
let the brown liquid pour into the cup and then brought the cup to me with

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:07,210
loving care. Oh, it's awkward. Awkward. So, uh,

10
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,290
hey, should we do a podcast? Sure. But you know what? We kind of,

11
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,570
we almost don't need to do a podcast because you know what our good friend

12
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:20,140
Percy did for us. I do know what our good friend, we, we, we last just, uh,

13
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,430
two weeks ago on our last podcast, we, um, Percy had asked, Hey,

14
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,550
what about a one of the three slack channel and live on AB test? We said,

15
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,230
sure. And then there were three, then we had the, um,

16
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,580
we have one, one of the three dot slack.com. Yep. And although somebody

17
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,780
pointed out there are more than three people there, there are never more than

18
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:52,220
three there at once. I have very important to note. Yes. The, the,

19
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,260
the reality is we have three listeners and is it entirely irrelevant?

20
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,660
Any facts that you may have to the contrary. Whatever. All right.

21
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,860
You know what we're going to do because for our, for two of our listeners,

22
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,890
hold on. No, I don't know where you're going. I know you don't.

23
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,800
I'm not done with number two. All right. Okay,

24
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,700
Brett finish your number two and then we'll go on. Thank you.

25
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,350
So Percy, thanks for hooking that up. It's fantastic. Uh, we had,

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,190
we're having some great discussions on that off offline. Uh,

27
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:37,630
if for some sick twisted reason, you can't get enough of the podcast,

28
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,390
that's a good way to a good place to go to get additional content.

29
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,550
It's actually a good place to go and say,

30
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,070
what the hell did you guys mean when you said blah?

31
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,270
That does seem to be a common thing. Good for clarifying.

32
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,670
Uh, Percy, uh, his Twitter tag is at P E R

33
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,350
Z E that's P E R Z E for our listener north of the border.

34
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,580
Yes. Uh, he is sort of our self appointed administrator of this,

35
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,620
uh, Slack channel. If you want to join, you're welcome to just self-appointed.

36
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,940
I second his nomination and approved.

37
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,140
Absolutely second his nomination as well. Uh,

38
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,980
laziness will win almost always with me. If you want to join,

39
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,340
just direct message him in, in Twitter,

40
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,510
your email account and he'll hook you up. All right. Yeah.

41
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,110
Are we done with our PSA for one of the three dot slack.com?

42
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:38,590
We are this episode brought to you by Percy. Yeah.

43
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,270
We don't really have a sponsor. So now you know what we're going to do now.

44
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,900
What it's been a long time since we did this. What?

45
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,060
You know what a two baggers. Yes. In baseball to double, right? Right. Right.

46
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,000
Right. Today it is time for not one well timed.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,860
Can you turn off your phone? Cheese. Not one, but two.

48
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:10,840
I think it's just one mail bag.

49
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,370
Oh, but two mail bag questions. Right. Two, two mail letter things.

50
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,530
Whatever. All right. So, uh, uh, the first one,

51
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,930
I guess you want to read it. Do you want me to read it to you so I can fix the

52
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,020
words you don't like yet? No, I got it. All right. It's from, uh,

53
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,220
this is the one from, uh, Nathan, right?

54
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,090
Known on the, uh, the slack channel as knit dog X.

55
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,880
Yeah. That's actually one thing I really am digging about the slack channel is

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,950
listeners are, are now putting their questions in one place.

57
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,270
So it's easy to find long gone are the five minutes we spent on the podcast

58
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,510
looking on LinkedIn or Twitter to find the question.

59
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,630
We'll still get some there. Yep. It's just,

60
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,910
it's just the loyal three that show up in the slack channel.

61
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,020
So Nitin says in a previous episode,

62
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,460
you mentioned how larger teams break up projects into seasons,

63
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,060
including the planning season or something. Uh,

64
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,510
just so that you know, we break them up into what we call semester.

65
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:31,130
So it's more of a, uh, university style, uh,

66
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,070
paradigm. Um, but continue on.

67
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:39,150
The VSTS team also mentioned this at build. To me,

68
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,150
it sounds pretty much the same as what Microsoft used to do with large waterfall

69
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,950
projects when seasons,

70
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,590
some S semester's were just called milestones.

71
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:55,710
How are seasons semesters and whatever other ways projects are split up time

72
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,630
boxed different than milestones.

73
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,800
That's a great question and I want to hear a great answer, Brent.

74
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,100
What do you got? Um, nothing, right? The,

75
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,020
the reality is I'm putting on my best Microsoft manager hat.

76
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm getting out my best puke bucket. Right. The, the,

77
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,540
the reality is the difference between a semester and a milestone at the end of

78
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,620
a semester, we expect full features to be shipped.

79
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,620
So the biggest difference, um, is just simply time compression.

80
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,330
So what used to happen in three years now happens in six months.

81
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,970
Uh, on how it is rolled out,

82
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,170
it really does depend on the team.

83
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,170
So some teams basically turn it into a mini waterfall model where the starting

84
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:02,250
in completes in six months. Others, other teams, um,

85
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:07,490
uh, take a different approach and a much more agile approach,

86
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,690
which essentially you start with a planning milestone.

87
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,330
The planning milestone is a planning milestone or planning semester.

88
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,530
It's not a planning summit. There is no planning semester.

89
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:23,130
He explicitly asked for that. There is no planning semester.

90
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,250
So when I worked on windows seven, for example,

91
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,910
we did six months pure planning before,

92
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,190
um, we started working on the code.

93
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:38,030
Thank you Steven Sanofsky for really emphasizing the power of waterfall.

94
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,780
Yeah. Yeah.

95
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,700
Didn't you follow that was six months of coding followed by 12 months of

96
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,240
stabilization. Uh, I think,

97
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,760
I think windows seven was a three year might've been whatever,

98
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,440
whatever, but yeah. And then, uh,

99
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,690
six months of DCR and I'm going to interrupt because I'm not hearing a lot of

100
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,500
differentiation between a milestone and a semester.

101
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,020
I think these are like some teams treated like a milestone teams that are more

102
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,180
agile, treat it more like a,

103
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,540
that the difference is is that in milestones,

104
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,060
you just be a check mark on the way to make sure some stuff was kind of mostly

105
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,740
done and kind of working so you could maybe deliver it to some partners or

106
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,740
beta customers, et cetera. And you're saying in semesters,

107
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,060
what the good teams do is make sure that instead of having a bunch of

108
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,990
the half done features, you have fewer fuller done features.

109
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,890
But is that it otherwise it's just two, two labels for, to me,

110
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,610
it's two labels to the same thing. It's how you approach the end.

111
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,720
The yes and no. So when I think of milestones, um,

112
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,960
the milestone model and a waterfall thing,

113
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,800
I think of things like test complete and co-complete and UI freeze

114
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,250
and all these sort of, uh,

115
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,690
alpha date, beta date,

116
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,740
all of these sort of intermittent dates that we would put in the old waterfall

117
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,670
process that were sort of checkpoints as you're talking about. Um,

118
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,190
the way, for example, my team does, does planning and,

119
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,070
and just want to be super clear, there is no planning semester anymore.

120
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,630
There the planning is expected to,

121
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,750
to be sort of the, the two to three weeks before the start of the milestone.

122
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,110
Is it, wait, you keep on saying milestone, but is it a milestone or semester?

123
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,030
Semester. So you are nailing down the fact that these are kind of the same.

124
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,700
One way to look at it is that it's just a,

125
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,260
a name replacement and I agree that you can look at it.

126
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,660
Milestone implies, um,

127
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,500
kind of like when you're driving, like here's,

128
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,540
here's a check that we've made on a way to something. Okay.

129
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,860
This is not that this, the,

130
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,220
what a semester is you start off a semester doing some lightweight planning that

131
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,460
says, this is our North star. This is our vision for the end of semester.

132
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,780
So planning's purpose in life is guidance.

133
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,400
Okay. So I get it. And, and to be clear to the listeners,

134
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,640
I am not playing devil's advocate here entirely because I have never,

135
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,040
I for one have never been on a project at Microsoft that used semesters.

136
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes. That term.

137
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,050
So you're saying that I think the difference is like,

138
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,810
I kind of go way back to windows 95 and like,

139
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,810
I want to think the oldest waterfall project I've been on,

140
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,810
but it had milestones and like every even numbered milestone was a beta release,

141
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,130
but there were really just sort of checkpoints and planning things like by M seven,

142
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,210
we expect these features to be in M eight will be beta two M nine is when we

143
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:54,210
finish up this, there was sort of a theme, uh, for maybe for each milestone.

144
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,970
But with semesters, it's like, here's what we're going to do for the next,

145
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,890
is it six months? Is it drew six months?

146
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,170
So here are the guiding principles for the next six months.

147
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,210
And that's a semester. And then you,

148
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,810
then you do some lightweight planning and do your work. Yep. So,

149
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,870
so the really, so you're agreeing. So I'm saying they're,

150
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,320
they're not the same, but highly similar.

151
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,360
They kind of accomplish similar goals, right? The,

152
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,520
the biggest difference in the,

153
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,520
and say the waterfall model is here in the waterfall model, these milestones were,

154
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,080
were really about showing progress towards the,

155
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,440
the, the ultimate shipping division. Whereas semesters,

156
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,360
it's not about showing project or progress. It's about shipping stuff.

157
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,050
Right. Um, the six months,

158
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,650
its whole purpose in life is to,

159
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,810
to have a cadence with upper management to see if we need to do things like,

160
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,650
uh, minor reorgs or minor shuffling to,

161
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,740
to reallocate towards what we know at that time is a better business

162
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,020
direction.

163
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:09,460
So the one key difference between say the semester model and the waterfall

164
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,810
milestone based model, the mile, the waterfall model,

165
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,460
what I from my experience,

166
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,460
the key vision for the goal rarely changed dramatically.

167
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,660
Yeah. And to be clear, it does. Yeah.

168
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,700
It's a lot of semantics here because milestones don't imply waterfall.

169
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,300
We associate them with our past as a waterfallish thing.

170
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,900
I believe in that's correct. Right. Um,

171
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,220
I'm kind of mapping it because I view this because he, his Nitten asked, Hey,

172
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,060
Microsoft used to blah, blah, blah.

173
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,060
So I'm kind of viewing it from my perspective in terms of how milestones were

174
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,420
managed back in the day.

175
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,440
Yes. And that's kind of what I'm doing too.

176
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,280
But I think you could treat milestones very much like you're treating

177
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,240
semesters today.

178
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,000
And I could also see a way that a engineering team could treat semesters very

179
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,840
much as we used to use milestones back in the day.

180
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,400
What I see, well, so, and then in, in that context,

181
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:21,880
so I can snap to your definition, what loosely are you calling a milestone?

182
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,660
What, what is a milestone in your mind? Um,

183
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,220
a milestone is a point in time,

184
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,240
which could be six months.

185
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,960
It could be another amount of time where we expect to have,

186
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,720
where we align towards a goal.

187
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,520
We align towards a goal that we think will occur on or around a certain date.

188
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,730
For example, a product may say, we may have a milestone.

189
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,530
We may have a public beta milestone and you know, in, in month,

190
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:55,250
you know, in January, we're going to have a public beta in, uh,

191
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,090
or a small, we'll call a small public beta in January.

192
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,890
That's our January milestone. Then in March,

193
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:04,060
we're going to have a expanded public beta. Um,

194
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,420
and then that can, we'll call that a milestone and we have things we need to

195
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,940
do around that. So there's some,

196
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,340
there's some rallying cries need to happen around that.

197
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,140
So if you're, if you're like, I'm just, this is not my product, but say I'm making

198
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:20,540
a, um, uh, app for iPhone and I'm doing my public beta,

199
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,740
there's things I have to do. Okay. Working back from that milestone,

200
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,820
I got to have the,

201
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,180
an account set up in the app store to make sure I can get that uploaded. Um,

202
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,660
I have to look at all the requirements for that and make sure I have work on

203
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,420
it, make sure that all those are done beforehand,

204
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,820
make sure I have ways to get feedback from my customers that I trust.

205
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,020
There's, there's a bunch of stuff we need to rally around for that milestone.

206
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,340
So those are the features that have to be done. And then as we go wider,

207
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,820
there's, there's other things that come into place.

208
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,260
I'm not going to list them all out, but if I have a goal,

209
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,060
a target for date and date, you know,

210
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,060
date M and date L or whatever, uh,

211
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,220
I can rally my work around that to make sure I'm prepared for that milestone.

212
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:05,480
So with that definition in mind, um, then there's,

213
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,610
there is a, I'll do an attempt at an important distinction because the way you

214
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,780
described it was in essence,

215
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,450
we have this sort of tactical goal and the purpose of milestones is to

216
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,650
synchronize the entire organization towards that goal.

217
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,810
I, I, I figured that out a little bit as I went along. So it doesn't,

218
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,250
it's not waterfall. It doesn't need to be,

219
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,770
we need to rally around some dates,

220
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:35,050
but the semester is not this is like at the end of the six months,

221
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,050
we're going to ship blah to N number of customers. It is the vision and our

222
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,050
strategy, our principles for the next six months are this is how we're going to

223
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,090
work. And then at the end of six months, we're going to stop reflect.

224
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,650
It's kind of like a, it's kind of like a macro retrospective. Yes.

225
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,210
You're going to stop and look back, see what you learn, what did we go?

226
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,490
What has changed in the marketplace since then?

227
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,330
Cause the six months changes a lot. Let's re-strategize,

228
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,850
let's adjust and then set a goal for the next six months. Yes.

229
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,170
So a semester. So I'm learning,

230
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,410
I'm this is actually me learning as we go through this. So now.

231
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,170
I'm sure it's so it will, much like in the definition you can talk about,

232
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,970
it will have goals enumerated,

233
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,990
but those goals will be in terms of customer outcomes delivered the versus the

234
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,130
milestone model, right?

235
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,050
Ultimately there's this customer outcome we want for the RTM and in a

236
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,930
waterfall model or a milestone model.

237
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,690
And these many milestones in between is about creating synchronization to get

238
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,810
the whole organization at the same place at the same time.

239
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,810
So we can move forward. That is not what happens in a semester. No, I get it.

240
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,770
Now what happens in a semester? Now I'm responding to Nitten.

241
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,850
What happens in a semester. Who cares about him? I get it. Fine.

242
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:54,580
What happens at the semester is so one important distinction between a

243
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,370
waterfall and semester model is that you do not expect nor do you generally

244
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:06,450
see all of the features delivered in the last month of a semester.

245
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:07,770
Yeah.

246
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:12,770
So you see them continuously delivered throughout the semester.

247
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,770
But the, the goals are customer outcomes desired.

248
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,780
Okay. I, you lost me a little,

249
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,780
I think you're a lot of times in the conversation is kind of set your in your

250
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,340
head. I think you see milestones, waterfall, semesters, agile.

251
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,500
And I don't know if you actually think that it's coming,

252
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,180
it's coming out in the way you explain it where I think it's sure,

253
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,140
where I don't think it's, it doesn't have to be the case.

254
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,620
It doesn't have to be the case. So,

255
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,760
so all of my present experience in a semester model,

256
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,240
it has been on service teams and a service team doing,

257
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:10,190
so I may be associating semesters service and agile all kind of lumped in

258
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,880
together, right?

259
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,000
But the whole point of a semester is to,

260
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,210
to generate new North stars every six months and to create a

261
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,560
synchronization point with management so that we can redirect towards the most.

262
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,280
In a way, when you compare even some people say six months, that's forever.

263
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,240
But if you look at some of the traditional three year shipping cycles,

264
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
a lot of Microsoft products,

265
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,160
one of those office had years ago and both of those ship more often now.

266
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,360
But if you look at how often they used to ship, you know,

267
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,040
actually stopping and changing direction every six months,

268
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,320
that would have been disastrous. Right? They couldn't,

269
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,200
the Sanofsky version of windows couldn't have even executed that.

270
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:04,770
Yeah. Let's decide what customers want three years from now and we'll give,

271
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,530
and we'll make that for them. And you know,

272
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,850
stupid customers that keep deciding the wrong things. I know.

273
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,320
Can you believe that they decide, oh, we don't, they say,

274
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,480
we don't like this. And I say, well, you're wrong. Right. Okay.

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,540
Nevermind. So I get it.

276
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,940
So if I got it didn't smarter than me. So I hope he got it too.

277
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,060
All right. We'll find out shortly. All right. All right.

278
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,020
Do you want to go on another mail bag? The next mail bag? Can I,

279
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,020
can I read this one? You please. Cause I read better than you. You do.

280
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,300
That was in, I know it was in the Slack channel somewhere.

281
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,720
What don't you do better than me, Alan? Seriously. Yeah. All right.

282
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,740
So, um, our, our good friend of the show,

283
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,110
Mr. Steve row, got that rhyme there. Yes. Yeah. Way to go.

284
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,150
Steve row from Microsoft. Way to go. He said, here's a question for your,

285
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,150
and he put it in capital letters, mail bag.

286
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:14,710
You have a lot, like lots of A's there, but he didn't do that. All right.

287
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,430
He said in a recent episode, and this is a whole new topic.

288
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,590
We should have had a commercial break there,

289
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,750
but we don't have any sponsors other than perzy and slack. All right.

290
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:30,650
In a recent episode, you mentioned that you were against V teams. However,

291
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,450
you also stated that you thought people should be coached and managed by people

292
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,530
who weren't necessarily the owner of the features they were working on.

293
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,090
And I'll elaborate on both of these in a second. That was me saying that, uh,

294
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,970
this sounds a little like a V team hypocrite for some uses of that word.

295
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,890
Can you explain the difference between what you do and what you do not want?

296
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,480
Um, lots of things. I mean,

297
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,040
let me do a even more annotated version of this. Um, yes, I,

298
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,520
in for the most part,

299
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,560
I don't like the way Microsoft has traditionally done V teams,

300
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,300
uh, which is let's get a team together that meets perpetually.

301
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,220
And yeah,

302
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:15,740
forever and with no stated outcomes,

303
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,540
they just get together and they, they, some stuff happens.

304
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,660
Some of those napkin.

305
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,460
Some people are in the V team because they want to be informed something like

306
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,420
a 10th or less stuff like wicked, like, uh, uh,

307
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,220
contribute to Wikipedia. It's like 1% actually do the work. Uh,

308
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,460
so that's the kind of V team I'm against. Um, and I,

309
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,580
is it however you stated that people should be coached and managed by people who

310
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,900
weren't necessarily the owners of the features they were working on.

311
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,100
Meaning I think, uh, even my team today,

312
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,680
uh, for the most part,

313
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,850
we have one manager as kind of risen above this traditional Microsoft

314
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,210
bucketing where a manager owns a feature area. We own this.

315
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,480
And I kind of liked the idea of a manager owns managing and coaching about

316
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,160
10 to 16 people. And, uh,

317
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,720
they work on what's important and there's a lot of fluidity. And of course,

318
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,440
there's expertise on the team and some,

319
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,680
some managers may take on particular types of work more than others,

320
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,880
but I really think that, uh,

321
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,240
you don't necessarily need to own a feature area on a single group of people,

322
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
uh, where that's really backfires.

323
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,200
That you see in some orgs that rhyme with Lindos, uh,

324
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,420
you see teams of a manager with three people and each of those has two people

325
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,580
reporting to them because it's they,

326
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,740
they've structured the exact like almost down to the detailed UI of the

327
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,780
product down to teams.

328
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,540
And, and structured the organization that way,

329
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,700
which I think adds so much overhead, uh, that it can hinder progress.

330
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,710
And again, windows is a big org. I'm sorry,

331
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,950
Lindos rhymes with Lindos could be windows. I don't know. Um,

332
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,070
doesn't work that way across the org.

333
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,910
Not making fun of Steve who works in windows.

334
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:12,310
I think his org is actually much flatter than other parts,

335
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:17,000
but it's just dry. See the, uh, the, the biggest offenders of that.

336
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,720
So anyway, um, I prefer larger teams.

337
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,720
That can be fluid and take on a different work. So those are different to me.

338
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,920
Those are different things. Let me address.

339
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,640
Brent is being very, very patient with me.

340
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,570
Uh, let me talk about the kind of V team I like,

341
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,850
cause I've already elaborated on what I mean by sort of the,

342
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,690
the team that's coached the manager is the coach and the, and the,

343
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,890
and the grower and the, and the manager of these teams.

344
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,850
I don't think you've defended yourself against

345
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,130
the accusation of hypocrisy.

346
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,810
So I think these are two different things. Okay. So, uh,

347
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:04,210
I will go back to the, the manager one if you want,

348
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,210
I think I've covered it,

349
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,690
but let me talk about the V teams that I do like.

350
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,250
And I know I've mentioned it on the podcast before,

351
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,290
but I'll bring it up again, which was,

352
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,210
which is what I like to call the world of Warcraft guide to project

353
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:20,760
management, which is in world of Warcraft, you,

354
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,120
and in many other, uh, sort of multiplayer role-playing games,

355
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:31,150
you, a group gets together to take on a common cause to do a

356
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,870
quest. You share the rewards,

357
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,030
which can be treasure or recognition.

358
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,070
And then you either take on another quest or disband.

359
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,100
That is how I think V teams should work.

360
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,460
A group of people should get together that have complimentary skills.

361
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,940
They may be project management, maybe technical, whatever.

362
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,940
They solve a particular problem. They,

363
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,660
the first thing a V team does is what problem are we solving?

364
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,940
They work till that problem solved. And then they either say,

365
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,300
do we have another problem we can solve together? And if so,

366
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,260
take that on, or they disband and go back to their jobs.

367
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:07,900
They don't meet forever and ever and have the 90% of the group be

368
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,780
informed. It's a group that gets together. They have,

369
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,620
they all work together towards a common goal.

370
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,780
And then they move on and take on other work or, or,

371
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,020
or another project together. That's the sort of V team I like.

372
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:23,530
As do I.

373
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,930
Not the traditional at Microsoft. Uh,

374
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,050
let's just get a team of way,

375
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,360
of way too many people together and you know, quote,

376
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,800
share information and talk and not really get anything done.

377
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,160
So one of the things that I think Steve is, is saying,

378
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,250
like in his mind, from implication, from his question,

379
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,340
in his mind, um,

380
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,580
people being coached by someone that is not their manager,

381
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,620
seems in his mind is the functional equivalent of a V team.

382
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,420
He's like, what's the diff? Oh,

383
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:08,620
and honestly I think the difference is like in your world,

384
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,140
a Warcraft model,

385
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,740
whoever spontaneously gets appointed the,

386
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,140
the leader of the quest,

387
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,630
isn't necessarily a people coach, right? Right.

388
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:27,100
Their job is to, to project manage for lack of a better word

389
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,390
towards the goal. Right. Um,

390
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:37,180
that's what I think is the primary difference.

391
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,660
Right. So there are, um,

392
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,690
I think he's reflecting upon different leadership models.

393
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,530
So you got the V team model where,

394
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,570
where you do kind of need leadership.

395
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:53,410
Otherwise you have a bunch of people running around, right?

396
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,570
You have to have something that pulls them into it.

397
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:59,890
Even the bad V teams I've seen have a leader,

398
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,480
but it's important that the leader, uh,

399
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,280
actually leads the group and doesn't just schedule their meetings.

400
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:08,990
Yeah. I've seen,

401
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,480
I've seen like the most horrible V teams I've seen is where the leader schedules

402
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,730
the meetings and because he's a leader, he's accountable.

403
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,530
Everyone else says, Hey, I'm, I am on this other thing.

404
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,130
I have a higher priority and so therefore only the leader does the work.

405
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,050
And so now he's scheduling a bunch of meetings and doing the

406
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,890
work himself. Um,

407
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,840
again, I think a good V team has to have everyone invested in the outcome.

408
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,200
So the first thing you do a good V team is what are we going to solve?

409
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:49,220
And often I've seen V teams meet and talk about the problem and realize,

410
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,620
in fact, I was on one last week where, um, I won't go into details, but

411
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,490
last week where watching Brent, uh,

412
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,370
answer his phone during the podcast. Hello.

413
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,890
So I met with the V team last week.

414
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,090
So here's what we got to do. And I, and I joined the V team late, uh, a week late.

415
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:15,830
And, uh, there was, they had a goal. Here's what we need to do.

416
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,230
And I said, can you just do this? And they looked at it and said,

417
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:27,380
yes. And I guess we don't need to meet anymore. So the, the,

418
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,260
if you find the solution that quick or sometimes even in discussion,

419
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,540
it would have been that the first week would have lasted even less long.

420
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,180
But sometimes if you, if getting that goal is key,

421
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,420
sometimes in discussion of the goal, you just,

422
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,580
you realize that you don't need to do anything. There's already an answer.

423
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,390
Yes. So, and that's, uh, many V teams would go, well, what else?

424
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,190
Immediately like, like, well now what do we do?

425
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,060
We should keep meeting and talk about this. But anyway, yeah, no, that's all

426
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,420
right. I think I've made my point about V teams. I like in V teams. I don't

427
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:04,940
like, uh, you were going somewhere with the parallels and,

428
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,060
and with leadership. Well, so what's your,

429
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,260
what's your view in terms of what you expect? So his last question, what do you,

430
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,620
what do you expect or what's the difference between what you do and

431
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,920
do not want as it relates to both the

432
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,800
topics of V teams and people being coached.

433
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,240
Okay. With V teams, what I do want is just to summarize,

434
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:34,360
what I do want is a team that works together towards a common goal and

435
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,800
then either disbands or takes on another goal.

436
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,160
What I do not want is a team that just gets together and, and meets and does

437
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:48,610
nothing. Yes. As far as managing a team, uh,

438
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,940
sort of the way I prefer, although I don't live in that world entirely,

439
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,050
I think people managers, what I, what I want to see,

440
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,250
I love the way you phrase that so I can focus my answer. Uh,

441
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,250
what I do want to see is people managers who aren't in love with owning a

442
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,610
particular feature set and structuring their team around that.

443
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,490
And instead have a group of people that want to leverage their strengths to get

444
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:17,410
whatever work done.

445
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,970
They can that comes their way that makes sense in the context of their product.

446
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,980
Meaning cause I saw, I saw confusion in Brent's eyes. Right. Uh,

447
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,460
I have horse.

448
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:33,060
So what I do want is say I'm a manager of a team of 10 people.

449
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,760
And we, we have some expertise in shimmery blue menus. Uh,

450
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,280
but we also have other things we can do.

451
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,280
And then my job as a manager is to know all the strengths and also growth areas

452
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,480
for my team. So rather than have us take on all the work and feature X,

453
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I very much like the model of it's Kanban like my team will take on like it

454
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,720
isn't just our Kanban there's there could, there's maybe we're not,

455
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,120
there's I have five peer managers.

456
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,040
So there's 50 of us together and with our teams of 10 and we can go to the team

457
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,920
Kanban and take on work and we may take on likely we'll take on most of the

458
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,720
shimmery blue menu work because that's where our expertise is.

459
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,400
But it doesn't mean we can't dive in elsewhere as that work becomes more

460
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,480
important. And in fact, uh,

461
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,520
we may be so far ahead on shimmery blue menus that there may not be any

462
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,680
more shimmery blue menu work to do.

463
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,680
So traditionally what a team could do would be to invest in enhancing shimmery

464
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,320
blue menus even more,

465
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,600
but that's not the most important thing to work on the products.

466
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,600
I want my team build to take on, uh, whatever is fits our expertise.

467
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,760
That's in that stuff that needs to be done to the high priority stuff.

468
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,000
So I'd rather look at that sort of team backlog and take on what's most

469
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,080
important and have my team be able to take that on versus a sticking and

470
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,840
uh, working on a particular area, even when that area may be done.

471
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,080
Um, that takes care of a couple of things. As you know, uh, see my team sucks.

472
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,820
Your team sucks.

473
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Well, yeah, they do. So we're awful.

474
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,660
I have a bunch of junior people and I took some hand me downs and they're not

475
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:19,050
performing very well. Uh, what it could happen if I just own my feature area,

476
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,650
it's probably going to suck and, and we can work on that.

477
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:26,810
But as I'm working on my team, getting them better, making them suck less,

478
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:32,290
uh, we're going to work slower through items rather than have my whole area be

479
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:37,050
behind. If we're working from a team, Conbon or a team, you know,

480
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,530
some sort of poll system from a team level, we're going to be taking items.

481
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:41,290
I think, okay, this is,

482
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,370
these are some good items for our team and we're going to work on those.

483
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,690
And we're going to be a little bit slower, but they're going to get done.

484
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,850
And your team rocks. Your team is like superstars. They're just like, Oh,

485
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:54,250
I eat code for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And they take some,

486
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,170
they're with quality of course. And you're taking items from the,

487
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,450
from the backlog and cranking them out and,

488
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,410
and moving them across the board.

489
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:08,290
And what happens is your solid teams take on the high priority items and the high

490
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,210
risk items, um, and work through them quickly.

491
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:14,970
And the teams that are learning, uh, can take other items still need to be done,

492
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,780
still important. Uh, and those get done.

493
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,820
And what happens is the whole product actually gets done in this model and is

494
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:26,980
of high quality, uh, much more often than in the traditional model where you have

495
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:32,260
some features that are overdeveloped and have too many shimmers in their blue

496
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,180
menus and versus, uh, and then you have like the team that was slow or some

497
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,620
people quit or whatever. And, and that whole feature is behind and sucks.

498
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,420
So that's why I like the fluidity of a model like this is cause it allows you

499
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,300
to work in a system like that.

500
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,020
Do you think Steve's question was no,

501
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,260
but I just was on a soapbox.

502
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,820
Fair enough.

503
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,340
So I, I come, this is, this is the AB testing.

504
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,180
We're not about answering the question directly. It's inspiration.

505
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:09,140
We haven't, Steve, you're my muse. Right. There you go. Um,

506
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:14,700
I take your question and go ahead and answer whichever one I feel like you

507
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,940
should have asked instead.

508
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,500
That sounds like a politician. Yeah.

509
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,980
Oh my God. Speaking of which,

510
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,340
I should, I should have phrased the answer is Steve,

511
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:28,140
let me tell you about my good friend, Henrietta Higgins one time.

512
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,380
All right. Um, I want to make AB testing great again.

513
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,650
Speaking of which, aren't you doing that sometime soon? What?

514
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:42,970
You're winter, uh, talk on AB testing. Um,

515
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:47,470
I actually finished my slides and everything. Yeah. Um, uh,

516
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:51,670
it's going to be in June. I also have a talk, um, next week,

517
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:56,870
the slides are, believe it or not started, but not done. Uh,

518
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:01,190
next week I'll be in Seattle at a Cordov in, uh, uh,

519
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,710
where is Cordov near the U district ish, revenge. Now I have to,

520
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,950
now I have to remember, maybe they moved. I should look before I go.

521
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,630
At a secret location somewhere in Seattle. Right. Oh my.

522
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,270
Um, so, okay, back to the,

523
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:17,750
really.

524
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,150
So there's two things I,

525
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:27,070
so I completely agree with the project model that the only thing I would state

526
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,460
differently is, um, for me,

527
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:38,860
it's not about importance, uh, going back to semantics.

528
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,530
Um, it's a, because words have meanings. Yes.

529
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,450
All right. Do I just want to say that. Um, it's about ROI.

530
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:54,500
So in, in the world where, uh, let's say there is a master

531
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,260
Kanban board and teams go and select from the master Kanban board

532
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:05,780
and that world, then what I want to do is sort of

533
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,210
pick the,

534
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:14,290
the highest ROI that I think that my team

535
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,380
can close on within the,

536
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,340
in a reasonable window of opportunity. Obviously,

537
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,260
if my team can't execute it and there's a tight window of opportunity,

538
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,410
my team shouldn't take this one. Um,

539
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,040
but I also want to look at the ROI for the team itself. So, uh,

540
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,540
in some teams and right now my team is,

541
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:45,430
is kind of in this place where we're really good at

542
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:50,190
executing and adapting and even picking up things that we don't

543
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,390
understand. So I just like, Hey,

544
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,310
whatever the highest ROI is, that's all I want.

545
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,670
And that's fine. That's cause that's about learning.

546
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,270
It's not about just like picking like the easy,

547
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,550
like I don't feel like my team's very good. I want to pick the easy work as a

548
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:08,030
manager. It's your job to give your team, yeah, the highest,

549
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,510
the most difficult work they can actually accomplish. And that's,

550
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,030
but that's true for growth, right?

551
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:16,230
Always put yourself on the steepest learning curve is the way you get better

552
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,750
as a steepest learning curve you can handle. Yes.

553
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,510
Right. Yeah. And if you're a little bit underwater, like,

554
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,230
I love being on the project where I'm not quite sure what I'm doing.

555
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:30,590
Cause eventually I know I can figure it out and you want to challenge your team

556
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,910
to do that. So it becomes, this is the,

557
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:39,030
a big difference is it requires a good manager to do this or a good people

558
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,070
manager. Uh,

559
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:42,870
Microsoft has a lot of managers who are good at the project management.

560
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:48,190
I own graphics. So my team does graphic stuff versus,

561
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,470
uh, and, and that's very much a sort of a project manager kind of role. Um,

562
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:56,150
where I want to see more managers who are the people,

563
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,870
managers and coaches who look across their team can figure out, okay,

564
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:03,590
I know the skills of everyone on our team and how they compliment and where

565
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:08,470
our holes are. So here's the, this knowing that's some work we can take on,

566
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,910
where I don't think a lot of managers, I'll say at Microsoft,

567
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,430
but also a lot of managers period necessarily know how to do that.

568
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:20,430
I think a lot of software managers are pure project managers and turn the crank,

569
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,670
what I call the traditional, uh,

570
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:27,150
turn the crank manager versus someone who actually knows how to

571
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,110
coach a team. And I would prefer,

572
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,110
organization of managers who knew how to coach their teams and grow their teams

573
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,110
versus just project manage.

574
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,310
I even would take it one step further. Cause in my view, you gotta,

575
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,070
if you're going to be,

576
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,550
if you're going to be an environment where you as a manager owns your project and

577
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,320
your team, right? Not sort of the models we talked about earlier,

578
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,280
where perhaps, uh, the,

579
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,720
the person you report to is solely responsible for people growth.

580
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,400
And maybe they're sort of these virtual scrum teams that are formed up that,

581
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,320
that drive through the project. Right. Um,

582
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,880
if you're going to be a manager that owns both,

583
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,460
then the way I view it is my responsibility is to grow my business. Okay.

584
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,940
So that means the value outputted by my team and my team's ability to scale,

585
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,180
to, to accomplish and pick up new,

586
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,740
the next set of value, the, um,

587
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,010
where was I going with this story? Who knows?

588
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:45,240
The in,

589
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,540
by taking this sort of point of view,

590
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,460
what that means is I'm,

591
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,820
I'm going after what is the most valuable thing.

592
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,820
And I'm also trying to reduce the cost to deliver,

593
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,580
right? So it's not just it's,

594
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,660
it's how do I deliver great projects and grow my team,

595
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,100
not one or the other. I, but,

596
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,700
I think, but there's another thing I want,

597
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,540
I want you to think about because this is something I've started,

598
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,260
I started writing a blog on this. Um,

599
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:29,910
probably we'll post it this weekend. Um, but one thing,

600
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,940
let's, let's take an aside for a moment. Cause there's also this product. Um,

601
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,650
sorry, you talked about the managers versus the leaders,

602
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:43,330
which in my mind is the project managers versus the people managers.

603
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:46,650
Maybe. So let's talk about goals.

604
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:52,260
Like one of the things I see a lot from these project manager types is this focus

605
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,400
on efficiency. And I'm curious,

606
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,800
do you see a difference between productivity and efficiency? Yes.

607
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,090
Okay. What is it?

608
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,380
Which one's more important if you can't have both?

609
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,570
I think you're preaching to the choir here.

610
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:13,410
I think productivity is more important. Okay. What is it?

611
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,530
Productivity is, uh,

612
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:22,250
how easy it is for me to get my work done. Okay.

613
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:28,600
Um, so it's simplification in some cases. Um,

614
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,920
whereas efficiency is, uh, how do I describe efficiency?

615
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,040
How would you describe efficiency?

616
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:40,250
So the way I described the two productivity is,

617
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:45,750
uh, how long, how,

618
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,490
essentially per a unit of time,

619
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:55,520
how many units of value can you ship? So product,

620
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,000
so if you think of productivity, like an assembly line,

621
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,400
if we are all working on cars, productivity, it last week,

622
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,440
we, we, we built two cars a day. This week, we built five cars a day.

623
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,520
We are more productive this week.

624
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,800
Efficiency is how,

625
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,040
what percent of your individual time is allocated?

626
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,710
Are you, um,

627
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,670
a hundred percent of your time working on something versus sitting around

628
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,800
waiting. The,

629
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,600
a lot of the times what I see is these project managers. Um,

630
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:43,690
this, this kind of goes into again, the assembly line. So on a,

631
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:46,050
on an assembly line model,

632
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:51,010
if I had a team of people who only know how to do one thing,

633
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,360
then I need to funnel work to,

634
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,500
to that person so that they're a hundred percent utilized.

635
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,560
But now if you, what'd you call it? The shimmery blue,

636
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,160
shimmery blue menus, my shimmery blue menus,

637
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,440
my standard answer for a standard example for anything.

638
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,750
So if you have one guy in your team that, um,

639
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,160
is the master of shimmery blue, right click menus,

640
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,360
and another guy on the team is master of shimmery blue buttons.

641
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,080
Um,

642
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,160
how do you rearrange the work so you can take advantage of these guys's

643
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,480
expertise? That's the other thing that I see these,

644
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:40,840
these project manager guys do because they, because they're like, Hey,

645
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,880
I can only take off of the backlog because I'm focused on efficiency of my guys.

646
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,080
I can only actually take the,

647
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,660
the item stacked 2050 that's that that's the only thing my guys can do because

648
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:01,500
it's inefficient for them to learn something new.

649
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,120
Yeah. Well, that's just stupid. Right. So I, you,

650
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,430
you were on a long diatribe rant, something there. Uh,

651
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:15,720
I want to go back to a point you made about, um, an hour and a half ago where,

652
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:19,510
uh, you, you're talking about, you have what you could have, uh,

653
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:23,520
now I can't remember. You said you want, um,

654
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,560
you want to grow your team or like, was it make a good grow your team or have a

655
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,640
good product or something? If you have a manage, so reflect,

656
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,160
refresh me on that. So I tell you you're wrong.

657
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,930
So if you are in an environment where you as a manager,

658
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:49,010
simultaneously are responsible for a team and a project or a set of features,

659
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,580
right? The, it's two separate things.

660
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,940
So that that's far enough because I am a firm believer, um,

661
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,420
both in concept and in practice that by building a strong team,

662
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:10,830
you will build a good product completely agree.

663
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,830
So I think you can over index on one.

664
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,350
You can't just lose sight of the other.

665
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:16,510
You got to make sure you give them the right work.

666
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:20,190
But I think if you have a great team, um, and not just that you've,

667
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:22,150
you've hired superstars, you've, uh,

668
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:25,950
a good manager can take a bunch of misfits and, uh,

669
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:30,390
get them to work together and enjoy their work and find their strengths and get

670
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,990
them and, and make a good product as well.

671
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,220
The great products come from great teams. You, I,

672
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:42,620
I think a great product built by a bunch of shit heads is, uh,

673
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,140
oops, PG ready. Just went up, um,

674
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:50,700
is not completely impossible, but nearly impossible.

675
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:55,120
Uh, it happens, right? The,

676
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,500
the law of probability say is if,

677
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,220
as long as it's non-zero given infinite time, it's going to occur.

678
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,780
Anyway, the point, the point I wanted to make there is please,

679
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,070
as manager, start by building that great team, the,

680
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,850
okay, there was stuff I wanted to get to, but we have like,

681
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:12,210
we have like three minutes left. So

682
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:16,970
I completely agree in terms of starting by building a great team, right? The,

683
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:21,850
the, if you can pick only one thing to

684
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:26,540
do and that's business value or establish

685
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:31,820
get earn the trust of your employees

686
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:37,420
and inspire the intertrust

687
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:42,330
between them. Um, working on that,

688
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:47,400
that trust I would say is more important than working on the business

689
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:47,880
file.

690
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,800
I completely agree. And there's, um,

691
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,760
I'm going to use some of the time and talk about that because, uh,

692
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,630
with trust, um, trust is the, is the basis.

693
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:02,100
It's like the base of the pyramid because with that, then with that,

694
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,140
can you can have,

695
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,940
if I don't trust you and I have a conflict with you or heated discussion with

696
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,380
you, uh, it's very easy for me to take that personally and,

697
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,060
or, and, and do you have an effect to my work?

698
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,780
Cause like, I don't want to argue with Brent again,

699
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:19,060
but with trust we can talk about whether we can have a

700
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:23,340
argument about the best way to implement shimmery blue menus.

701
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,500
And at the end of it,

702
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:29,020
we don't dislike each other any less cause we have trust in our

703
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,100
relationship. And at the end,

704
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:35,340
what we probably have is a better design than we would have had if we were

705
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:38,020
just passive, kind of like, okay, whatever you want to do is fine.

706
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,420
Trust in, in, in this trust is the basis for, for a conflict and conflict.

707
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,380
I don't think it's necessarily bad when you have trust behind it.

708
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,700
It's actually very good when you have trust behind it.

709
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:52,380
Cause that's where good, the good things come out of those conflicted

710
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,460
discussions.

711
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,220
So negotiations, arguments, debates, whatever you want to call them. It doesn't,

712
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,500
it doesn't matter to me,

713
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,940
but trust makes an important distinction

714
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:10,730
between are you arguing about who's

715
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:13,410
right or what's right?

716
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,970
Yes. That's a good way to put that. Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you.

717
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,210
That's a very good point. I think we should close on that one.

718
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,770
Fair enough. All right. Uh, I'm still Allen.

719
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:28,500
And I'm not. We'll see you next time. Thank you. Bye.
