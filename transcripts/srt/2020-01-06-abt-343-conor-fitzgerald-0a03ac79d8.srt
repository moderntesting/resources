00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,030
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything.

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,550
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,110
Let's get started.

5
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,110
Happy New Year, everyone.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:28,870
We're here on New Year's Eve and today for the 343, I'm joined by Connor Fitzgerald.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,870
Say hi, Connor.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,310
Hi, Adam.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:35,870
And to all three, the other two listeners, of course.

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,630
Yes, and the other two listeners, of course.

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,630
Good.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,630
Well, I'm excited to have you here.

13
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:49,950
I have probably said this before on this podcast, but being able to listen to the stories of

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:57,230
people who listen to the podcast and have tried some or all of the modern testing principles,

15
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,630
it's fun for me.

16
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:02,790
And I'm just touched by the amount of feedback we've gotten about these and people are really

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,790
enjoying these.

18
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:07,710
So thank you for being the latest volunteer for this thing.

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,030
The pleasure is all mine.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,310
I'm glad to be here to listen to these podcasts quite some time.

21
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,390
So it's a absolute pleasure to be interviewed by you today.

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,390
So thank you.

23
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:21,070
And as you can tell from Connor's accent, he is from the South Eastern America.

24
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,070
Just kidding.

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,790
Where are you from, Connor?

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,270
I'm from Cork, all the way down the south of Ireland.

27
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,790
I had a coworker.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,550
What was I forgotten his name?

29
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,390
Someone I talked with a lot at Microsoft from Cork.

30
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,310
Yeah, very similar accent.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,260
Oh, it's escaping me.

32
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,140
Brent knows him.

33
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,700
Brent actually introduced us.

34
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,980
But so never mind.

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,150
Tangent number one completed.

36
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,710
So let's get started.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,830
Why don't we do a good warm up question today?

38
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,870
Tell me all about your life, but limit the limited to your testing career and your

39
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,940
current role.

40
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,100
OK, perfect.

41
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,860
So in the last 15 years, I've been working as a tester.

42
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,180
So this is my 15th year.

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:13,400
And I guess some stuff that you might find interesting or I might flip through a

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,240
couple of different things.

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,400
So the various titles I've had as a consultant as the lead manager as well.

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,640
Industries wise, I've worked in finance.

47
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,360
So things like hedge fund, insurance, banking, a little bit of fraud prevention

48
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,240
at one stage as well.

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,160
And then I've been telecoms as the other major area I've been in for a number of

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,760
years, which was working with embedded systems like Intel and also working on a

51
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,400
platform for telcos as well.

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
The likes of Vodafone would use that particular platform I worked on.

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,160
Then companies wise, I've kind of tried all the different sizes.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,720
So I've worked on a startup for somebody who was essentially out of their

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,760
living room. And that's where we used to have the monthly meetings.

56
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,400
Worked for mid-sized companies all the way up to enterprise, like I was saying,

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Intel. And also when I was in consultancy, I was on site with companies like ING.

58
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,320
Location wise, we chatted about Ireland already, but most of my experience

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,720
actually being in Ireland, so Cork the last number of years.

60
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,200
But I actually started in Shannon in County Clare in the west of Ireland and

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,030
also did a stint in Dublin on the east side.

62
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,670
And I did a year in Sydney.

63
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:23,030
So when I was doing a round world trip a number of years ago, stopped off in

64
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,150
Sydney for a year to replenish the funds before I continued the second part of that

65
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,030
trip. And also as well, I suppose I've been lucky to travel quite a bit as well.

66
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,590
Places like London, Bangalore, and you'll be glad to know Seattle as well twice in the

67
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,990
past. So the most current role then I've been working with Popolo for the last

68
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,590
three years. And I've been working there as a senior software tester.

69
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,790
Previously been working as a manager and I kind of flipped back to being

70
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,750
probably more of a hands on software tester.

71
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,850
So Popolo then is a mid-sized company based in here in Cork.

72
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:02,570
And often people like myself who work in Ireland work for American companies and the

73
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,570
satellite offices is here.

74
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:10,090
So Popolo is actually reverse of that where it's a Cork company started here as a

75
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,250
startup and is a mid-sized company now.

76
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,090
It's a really interesting space.

77
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:18,930
It's very different to any of the industries I've worked on before because it's

78
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,770
internal communications or also can be termed as employee engagement.

79
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,290
So the Popolo platform allows large firms to plan, target, monitor the impact of

80
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,730
internal communications all in a single platform.

81
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,410
So what that means is like to see you have a company may want to send out an

82
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,250
email or maybe mobile content to all the employees or subset of employees.

83
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,730
And then they want to get some analytics to show what were the most popular posts

84
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,570
where people actually reading the content and then they can do things like

85
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,050
basic campaigns around that.

86
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,050
So like say they want to increase awareness around something and they can

87
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,770
maybe match that into an email campaign as well.

88
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,690
So it's been very interesting working the space last three years.

89
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,300
So the last 18 months I've been working with two teams, a mobile team and then

90
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,500
a content team.

91
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:13,290
So just kind of working with those two teams, working from the idea phase to

92
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,850
the customer rollout phase all the way through.

93
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,010
So whatever that involves workshops, planning sessions, facilitating bug

94
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,130
bashes, joining and impairing or mobbing.

95
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,050
And also the teams do a level three support.

96
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,010
So essentially it's level one or level two customer support can figure out a

97
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,290
problem or fix it.

98
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,970
Then it comes to us and we'll root cause it and resolve it as quickly as we can.

99
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,930
And it's been really interesting working with those two teams.

100
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,970
One team I've been working with for three years, ever since it started.

101
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,410
And the second team I've been working with for 18 months.

102
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,890
So from the very beginning, and it's really interesting to see those teams

103
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,050
mature and change over time.

104
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,970
And it's been excellent journey today at any rate.

105
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,510
It sounds very modern tested ish.

106
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,990
So is your role sort of a, it's, am I kind of reading between the lies that

107
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,230
you're working with teams, is it sort of a internal consultant kind of role or

108
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,950
coach, or how would you describe the role you have?

109
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:10,830
Yeah, that's interesting.

110
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:11,030
Yeah.

111
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,790
Like how would I describe, I describe myself as a tester, but I guess

112
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,150
other people who would have done the role, maybe would have called themselves

113
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,590
more of a coach because I'm working with two teams.

114
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,350
I'm trying to influence them.

115
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:27,070
So often I'd probably turn myself more facilitator.

116
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,910
So what I'm trying to do is influence the quality on, on both teams and kind

117
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,550
of folks very much on encouraging communication and collaboration, which

118
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,470
isn't that difficult because the people I get to work with are excellent that

119
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,750
way. So, um, I call myself a tester, but I guess I could call myself a

120
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,590
coach or maybe some sort of a test facilitator maybe.

121
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,910
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

122
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,270
But, uh, the, what you call yourself doesn't matter, but it's the role

123
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,750
and what you do, and you can't, of course, can't hear it, but I'm not nodding

124
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,070
my head quite a bit because it's very similar to what I've done and what

125
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,070
I've been doing for years.

126
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:09,230
It's just sometimes you can cause a lot of change just by asking the right

127
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,150
questions and you mentioned facilitating and that's the bulk of what I do.

128
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,590
I get people to talk with each other.

129
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,910
I get them to pause and think and ask the right questions and think about

130
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,790
what they're doing and it ends up making quality improvements or process

131
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,510
improvements or just some, or I should phrase it though that facilitation and

132
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:32,230
asking those questions accelerates the achieve in the shape of a quality.

133
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,620
Indeed.

134
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,300
I fully agree.

135
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:34,700
I love that.

136
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,600
So very cool.

137
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:42,240
And this is yet another example of you've, well, I'll loop back to, I'm

138
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,320
not gonna put words in your mouth.

139
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,040
So I'll ask another question instead.

140
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,080
Okay.

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,240
Plenty of words to put in your mouth, but obviously you didn't yell no.

142
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,360
When I said this sounds very modern testing-ish, but what led to your

143
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,000
interest in modern testing?

144
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,280
I guess it starts like a lot of the listeners, the interviews so far and

145
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,680
from being a conference is on speaking to people who also enjoy modern

146
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,710
testing, they say they got to the point like myself, there must be a better

147
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,230
way to test or even simply there must be a better way to develop software

148
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,150
and deploy software.

149
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,890
So the majority of my early career was very traditional testing.

150
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,770
So you named traditional testing and I was probably doing it.

151
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,970
So test plans, test scripts, waterfall.

152
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,980
In all honestly, when I reflect back on it, I was probably the bottleneck

153
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,900
or safety network teams, very certification focused.

154
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:48,530
I did my STQB exams, but the big turning point for me was I worked on two

155
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,320
projects that failed.

156
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,800
The first probably wasn't such a large one, but the second one I've been

157
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,080
working on for over two years.

158
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,320
And when I saw that second project fail, it really was a catalyst to find a better

159
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,960
way of doing things, even probably just beyond testing or quality, but even how

160
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,720
you deliver software from start to finish and how do you make it successful.

161
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,840
And there was one particular company that I worked with, which was actually the

162
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,640
Seattle based company that I was working out at the Cork office for.

163
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,560
And there I saw what success looked like.

164
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,440
And to me, culture was the key in that company.

165
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,600
There was a lot of collaboration, communication was at the heart of everything

166
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,740
we did, for example, instead of writing a big, huge test plan, I'd write a

167
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,660
one page test plan and then the test team and the people who were going to

168
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,580
develop the software reviewed that test plan with me.

169
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,060
And then that just drove a lot of how we did our testing, things like that.

170
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,060
There was a DevOps culture there probably before a lot of companies were doing

171
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:51,340
that and a concrete example of that was that we began to release software

172
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,100
for the first time.

173
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,700
So prior to that, I would have tested the software development team and then

174
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,220
somebody else would have released the software, but we took responsibility in

175
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,220
that company for releasing the software to production.

176
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,140
And we had the, what I term, torturous use of automation and tools.

177
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,580
So we looked at what was the critical things to automate and what were the

178
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,660
best tools to use.

179
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,660
And also that was the place where I began to learn about Bug Bash, to use

180
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,500
Bug Bash and in a way begin to learn how to facilitate.

181
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:26,270
So I guess that was a way of, I'd seen how possibly it could be done.

182
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,310
But I needed to kind of pat it, like, learn, lead out a path for myself.

183
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,910
And a journey it took was that I began to read about context-based testing.

184
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,950
Now I know we don't talk about schools of testing anymore, but I just simply

185
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,990
read an article in context-based testing.

186
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,990
And that led me on to probably what I think is the best book I've ever read

187
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,950
on the topic of software testing, which is lessons learned in software testing.

188
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,130
That didn't turn into the rapid software testing course, which was led

189
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:58,210
by Michael Bolton, that was at Test Bash Manchester 2017.

190
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,460
And because Explorer testing was such a big part of that, then that led me

191
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,060
onto the excellent book, Explorit.

192
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,300
And then I got to the point where I was starting to look at the

193
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,020
wider context of quality.

194
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,580
You know, like I was saying, testing just not as an activity, but you know,

195
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,500
testing as an activity rather than a rule, I mean, sorry.

196
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,140
And then that's when I encountered modern testing and I've been playing

197
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,300
around with a lot of the ideas before I'd ever seen the modern test

198
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,540
and principles like a lot of the listeners say, but when I encountered the

199
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,180
principles, it was the fact that it was so clearly articulated by Brent

200
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,340
and yourself, and it was quite obvious that you'd put a huge one to

201
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,900
talk into it.

202
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,580
So I particularly love the deep dive of the modern testing principles.

203
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,700
I think it's episode 67 to 93.

204
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,700
Well-remembered.

205
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,860
You go into real detail in those episodes.

206
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:54,820
And I just want to read, and for any listeners don't just stop at 93,

207
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,460
of course, to some great episodes after that time before, but that's where

208
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,660
the real deep dive occurred.

209
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,700
And yeah, I've just loved it.

210
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,020
And then I suppose just, you know, began to think then how could I apply

211
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,260
modern testing in my role and began to talk to others about how they were

212
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,820
doing that, I guess.

213
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,020
Yeah.

214
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,900
But it's been a journey over maybe three or four years and it's been

215
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,180
interesting once at least.

216
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,720
Yeah.

217
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,080
It sounds like, and so much to unpack there, so many things I want to poke in on.

218
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,960
It sounds like you had kind of, like a lot of people had kind of been doing

219
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,320
something very modern testing-ish before you discovered the principles and the

220
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,520
work that Brent and I have done on the topic, which is cool and great and

221
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,480
probably the way it's going to happen more often.

222
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,740
One thing, and just to reiterate, and you know this, but maybe the

223
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,180
listeners don't know, but Brent and I, we didn't write these from scratch.

224
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,100
Like we're going to make a new thing.

225
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,820
We just, really the principle started off as let's try and, we had been

226
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,180
talking about modern testing for a year or more before then.

227
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:04,650
In fact, we had our, I think our debate of the modern tester, modern test

228
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:08,810
manager versus a traditional test manager was somewhere around 57 or

229
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,050
60 or somewhere in there.

230
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,530
And we had been talking about this concept of modern testing, which again,

231
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,450
not that modern, nothing to do with testing.

232
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:20,930
It's about building a quality culture and quality Oregon and

233
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,130
accelerating the delivery of customer value.

234
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:25,410
We had been talking about that for a long, long time.

235
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,970
So when we wrote the principles and iterated on them and got them,

236
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:34,490
finally got them right, the process was just writing down what we had

237
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,970
already, trying to document what we had already been talking about.

238
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,970
And they've kind of stuck.

239
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,650
I'm actually, it's one of my, the pieces of work in my entire

240
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,450
career, I'm most proud of because these just make sense.

241
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,570
Then you mentioned also a DevOps culture.

242
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,610
And one thing I've noticed is I spent more and more time in DevOps and

243
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:58,970
coming from the modern testing background and doing DevOps roles and being

244
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:06,390
in running DevOps teams is that a DevOps culture and modern testing

245
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,110
have a lot of overlap as well.

246
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,500
I mean, DevOps DevOps is a lot about accelerating the

247
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,780
achieve and shippable quality.

248
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,630
So it's, it's, it's fun to see that come up and more and more we see,

249
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:22,390
we're seeing testers speak at DevOps conferences.

250
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,510
Lisa Crispin and Abby Bangs are, are both speaking at a delivery

251
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:29,230
conf in Seattle next month.

252
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,430
And probably if you've heard the AB testing end of year

253
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,990
extravaganza, I think that was 112, maybe 111.

254
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,150
I can't quite remember.

255
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,670
I listened to it.

256
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,750
I predicted I'm probably just going to do one conference again,

257
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,310
this year.

258
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,230
Probably it very, very likely will not be a test conference.

259
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,910
It will be a dev conference to make it back to or dev or probably even better.

260
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,510
If I could start going into the DevOps tour of duty, it might be kind of fun.

261
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,620
So lots of overlaps there.

262
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:06,580
And then one other thing to unpack is it's a two part is I love that

263
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,340
you've mentioned all these books and classes that sort of the lead your

264
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,700
own opinion of testing.

265
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,980
And that's what I tell people is if you get all your information about testing

266
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:23,580
from one place, you are going to have a sort of a skewed view of the testing world.

267
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,780
And what I like from you is you have pulled in information from all kinds of

268
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,020
sources, uh, you've read different books from different authors, taking classes,

269
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:37,060
and you've used those to form your own opinions about how testing should be

270
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:40,140
done or how quality should be built into a product.

271
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,260
So I applaud you for that.

272
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,450
And then the one book I wanted to drill in on was, I think an underrated book,

273
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,450
not read by enough testers, especially people moving in the test coach roles

274
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:57,960
is Elizabeth Henderson's explore it book, because not only is it good, a good

275
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,400
book on exploratory testing, but it talks about coaching developers to do

276
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,520
exploratory testing and stories about that.

277
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,200
And that to me was maybe not directly, but definitely subconsciously.

278
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,000
One of the things that told me I could, that it was, so when that came out,

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,340
I don't think I had, if I remember right, I was still working on the

280
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,020
Xbox team when that came out.

281
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,180
I'll have to look up the years.

282
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,540
Uh, my whole, my whole life, my, my history of life is what was I working

283
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,500
on at the time this event and history happened?

284
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:37,340
So that's how I remember years, but it wasn't until after I left that

285
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,500
team that to my next, every job I've had since then, I've been in a role of,

286
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,340
or at least part of my job was to coach developers how to test.

287
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:49,140
So definitely some influence from that book and how they recommended.

288
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,260
So thanks for bringing that up.

289
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,300
Yeah.

290
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,260
Cause I think I'm the same.

291
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,380
It's the, when I started to talk to developers about exploratory testing,

292
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,300
initially I didn't think I had the correct language or approach to do,

293
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,740
but after reading that book, there was so many examples I could bring to them.

294
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,740
And every time I brought an example from that book to developers, they found

295
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,580
it incredibly interesting and it was something they could add to their testing

296
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,380
skillset, which was really interesting for me.

297
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:15,800
Yeah.

298
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,680
And just the idea, like so many of the testers, when I came to Unity, uh,

299
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,600
I'll back up a little bit on my previous teams.

300
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,840
I did a lot of bug bashes with teams and sat with them in a room and,

301
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,040
and tested things together.

302
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,440
And we do some learning from that.

303
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,750
But when I joined Unity as a quality director or a quality manager,

304
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:38,030
QA manager for the first time in a long time, I took a little different

305
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,390
approach and encouraged them to pair test as much as possible versus being

306
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,630
the bottleneck because there would be some knowledge transfer that would happen.

307
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:51,350
And I'm blown away by how much just getting in a habit of pair testing

308
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,590
changes together will help developers learn how to test.

309
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,540
And in fact, one of the best people on my team that was really good at

310
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,460
pairing and, and making sure that he would say, I don't need the tests that

311
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,140
you've done, you do diligence or help them test when they needed it.

312
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,300
That team no longer has or needs a dedicated testing specialist.

313
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,380
That pairing really, really helped.

314
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,460
So again, glad you're doing that.

315
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,260
How they recommended.

316
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:19,460
Oh, thank you.

317
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,700
Principal seven in place.

318
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,980
So yeah.

319
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,580
And you had mentioned a little sub question here, not on our list, but

320
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,460
when we wrote the principles, we thought number seven, of course,

321
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,340
would be the most controversial, but it ends up it's not because teams,

322
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,220
it isn't the get rid of testers principle.

323
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,420
It's the, you may get so good, you may not need a tester principle,

324
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,900
but you're working a lot with data in your current role and the,

325
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,860
the data principle isn't the controversial one.

326
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,740
It's the one where we say that the customers are the only ones

327
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,940
that can evaluate quality.

328
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,100
People don't like that.

329
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,220
So what's been your experience with that principle?

330
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,300
It sounds like you've probably touched a little bit on that at Popo at Popo.

331
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:06,250
Yeah.

332
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,490
So like principle five round customer, was you like the only one who's capable

333
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:14,410
to judge the judge and evaluate the quality of the product essentially as.

334
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:15,610
Yeah.

335
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,810
What's been your experience with that?

336
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,030
Yeah.

337
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,550
So I guess one thing.

338
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,150
Sorry, sorry.

339
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,830
Not one of your prepared questions,

340
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,550
but I'm curious because of your background and the company you're working at.

341
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,950
Oh yeah, sure.

342
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:34,030
So like, so we've probably matured more as, as teams around this like,

343
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:39,150
so the first thing they're working with over three years, we've probably learned

344
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:44,050
to over time, more and more to engage with the customer as early as possible.

345
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,770
To the point that we got pretty good at finding beta customers to work

346
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,650
on new features with to ensure that we were going in the right direction.

347
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,730
But based on some of the successes there, we actually started to look at

348
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,410
if we're doing major bug fixes and it was important to maybe a couple of customers,

349
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,090
we asked them to come on board as beta customers and that's worked really well as well.

350
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:12,660
So they're often giving us really early feedback about how the fix is going to work.

351
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:16,700
And sometimes it can be different, which is an infrastructure, things like that.

352
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,300
So they're often giving us a really good quality feedback.

353
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,940
And so because we're just working maybe with five or six key customers,

354
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,460
sometimes we can get solutions to very good standard before we roll it out to everyone.

355
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,500
And we can also give feed.

356
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,260
We can get things in place for the support team as well.

357
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,300
So that they know what may be coming based on feedback from customers.

358
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,580
So that's been really good.

359
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,460
And with the second team, I was working with the mobile team.

360
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,740
That was really interesting because we went from the idea of

361
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,780
we're going to have a mobile app to a sale in six months.

362
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,140
So again, there we were highly engaged with a number of customers.

363
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,660
Again, it was around approximately six customers who worked with us

364
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,860
to develop that mobile app.

365
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,700
And the feedback we got from the customers was invaluable.

366
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,980
And it was really a partnership.

367
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,580
And that's really the thing.

368
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,980
If you can find customers you can work with who know things aren't perfect,

369
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,500
but you're iterating towards something better.

370
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,540
And they can have an early influence on that product.

371
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,420
Great things can happen.

372
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,740
So I've seen on both teams how engaging with the customer

373
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,820
and the importance of the customer.

374
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,100
And I think, for example, five actually links back to one.

375
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,060
Because if you're going to make money, you have to...

376
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,540
People are going to have to pay for it,

377
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,700
whether it's like they're going to upgrade or they're going to buy something new from you.

378
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,620
And internally, you can run things past people and they'll think it's great.

379
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,220
But it's not until you get in front of customers

380
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,340
that you got that feedback.

381
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,900
But also, there are people who have to sign the dotted line

382
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,900
to say we're going to pay money for this.

383
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,180
So I think five and one to me are very highly interlinked.

384
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Yes, yes. And one of the things...

385
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,220
And honestly, we realized this a little bit after the fact,

386
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,180
after we had been vetting them.

387
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,780
In fact, it's probably we realized it while we were doing the deep dives

388
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,460
is how much they support each other.

389
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,660
There is some intertwointment,

390
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,420
which I guess we're just trying to capture the things that we believe

391
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,140
are the driving factors of modern testing.

392
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,820
That makes sense.

393
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,220
But I'm pleasantly surprised how well they work together.

394
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,400
Indeed.

395
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,960
So how else have you used modern testing in your current role?

396
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,200
Well, I wrote down a couple of examples and I'll share a couple of with you

397
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,200
and then maybe you can dip in and out of the ones that maybe you find interesting.

398
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,200
Sure.

399
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,880
And so one thing that I was thinking about

400
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,560
was that the key thing is to accelerate the achievement of shipability.

401
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,280
So one thing I did one of the teams recently working with the team lead

402
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,500
was we use a tool called split and split is how we manage our feature toggles.

403
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,700
So I took it on as a mini project at one stage

404
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,420
to review all the various feature toggles we had in place.

405
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,980
And what spurred this was after read and accelerate,

406
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,940
I wanted to figure out once the software is committed,

407
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,180
like once it's merged and it's ready to go,

408
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,340
how long does it take to get rolled out to production

409
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,500
and actually get into the hands of customers?

410
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,020
And what I kind of started to figure out that is if I could track the status

411
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,020
of different feature toggles, I could track where the code was

412
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,940
and how long it was taken to get the customers.

413
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,060
And through that, by tracking the status of all the various feature toggles,

414
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,580
we started to realize that there were some feature toggles we got rid of.

415
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,540
There was some instances where, you know,

416
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,060
software could have got out to customers sooner.

417
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,940
And some instances like where stuff was ready for rollout,

418
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,740
it's just because sometimes you're managing a lot of them.

419
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:48,300
So based on my learnings from that, I shared with the department,

420
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,620
we do concept of show and tell and Wednesday mornings

421
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,780
where we share ideas like this.

422
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,780
And other teams then got interested in this topic as well

423
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,140
and began to track their feature toggles in more detail as well.

424
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,420
So it may seem like a simple thing to keep track of your feature toggles

425
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,020
and where they are, but it really plays a critical part of accelerating,

426
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,260
you know, the achievement of acceptable quality and also, I think,

427
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,960
really interlinks with the book, Accelerate as well.

428
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,840
Yeah, I that's I had some flashbacks on my last project at Microsoft.

429
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:26,400
We had we had feature toggles in place and they if you don't watch them,

430
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,880
they can create some tech debt.

431
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,880
And I frequently, I won't say constantly, but frequently had to go follow up

432
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
with toggles that have been around for months sometimes like, oh, yeah,

433
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,360
we're not going to ship that. That was an experiment that failed.

434
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,800
We'll take take the toggle out.

435
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,960
There's a we had a culture of shipping all the new features behind a feature toggle.

436
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,480
And then once it was done and ready for wider use, we turn that toggle

437
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,040
basically on by default or remove the toggle.

438
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,480
But we if for whatever reasons, I'm sure it was the implementation

439
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
or what are the other culture.

440
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,440
But we kept a lot of the old ones around.

441
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,600
And we had a massive list of these feature toggles.

442
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,440
So tracking those is a good idea.

443
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:14,040
And I'm it sounds like I'm pretty excited about the company you're working at,

444
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:19,000
because not only doing some things that may feature flags certainly aren't

445
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,200
brand new or elite, but

446
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,080
they're so powerful, such a powerful tool to use to release safely.

447
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,800
If we look at testing is one thing we could do to reduce risk.

448
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:38,000
But another big lever we have in the services side is the operability

449
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,880
having safety in the way we deploy, the way we monitor, the way we observe

450
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,560
and the way we can roll back.

451
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,800
And so it's exciting to hear.

452
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,400
It's exciting to hear that you're using tools like that.

453
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,720
And it sounds like also your team works together really well.

454
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,480
You mentioned earlier looping in support

455
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,640
so they know what's coming up.

456
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,320
It sounds like a good company.

457
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,580
Oh, yeah, it's really excellent.

458
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,060
I can do as culturally of companies I've worked with, it is the best I've worked with.

459
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,620
So it's it's, you know, when Sunday night comes around,

460
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,340
you look forward to going into work on Monday morning,

461
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,100
which is a nice thing to be able to say.

462
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,740
I like that. That's probably one of the reasons I left Microsoft

463
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,900
is I wasn't excited to go to work anymore.

464
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,220
And I am again, even though most days I work from my home office,

465
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,900
which is about 20 feet from my bedroom.

466
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,220
So it's I don't have to maintain my excitement to go to work for a long.

467
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,580
Very good. Did you have another example?

468
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,110
Yeah, there's a couple of more there.

469
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:42,950
Like I put a conscious effort in moving away from being a bottleneck

470
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,550
and a gatekeeper and focusing more on whole team testing.

471
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,790
So I particularly started to use Kanban to tackle the acceptance

472
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,390
to bottleneck that a lot of people encounter.

473
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:57,390
And probably more books there to probably influence that was Kanban

474
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,750
in action, which I think is probably the best book in Kanban.

475
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,750
The goal, which I'd read a couple of years previously,

476
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:03,790
and then only started to use.

477
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,710
And then, of course, the work of Janet,

478
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,190
Gregory and Lisa Crispin had an influence in that.

479
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,990
So it was just beginning to use, you know, the Kanban principles

480
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,990
to see that the acceptance cue was the bottleneck

481
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,030
and that I was probably being a gatekeeper there in the early days

482
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,270
of the first team.

483
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,550
And then we began to share the responsibility of that acceptance cue.

484
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,990
We began to do things earlier.

485
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,190
And we actually started to move to the point that we started to pair more

486
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:29,790
and mob more, so we kind of started moving early towards one piece

487
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,310
workflow for a finish where in both teams now they pretty much mob

488
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,830
the whole time, which means there's only one item being worked on

489
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,910
at any one point in time.

490
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,230
And of course, then you get all the quality benefits from that.

491
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,150
So, similar to the future toggles might only seem like a small thing,

492
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,350
but I think more people, if they learn about Kanban,

493
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,550
I think it can have a huge impact on quality.

494
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,860
Yeah, I and you know, for listening to the show that Brent and I both

495
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,540
massively prefer Kanban as a

496
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,180
project tracking method over Scrum and its variants.

497
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,460
I can do a whole other podcast telling you why, but we'll save that for another day.

498
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,020
Maybe Brent and I should talk about that.

499
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,780
Why we prefer Kanban?

500
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,460
Yeah, if we haven't already, it's probably come up in bits and pieces.

501
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,340
I don't know if you saw over the weekend, I reread.

502
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,860
Actually, I've forgotten what day it is because I'm on vacation,

503
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,820
but sometime in the past few days, I reread Shape Up, the book by Basecamp.

504
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,230
It's an e-book about how they do project estimation.

505
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,390
And I'm not a huge fan of the book, but this of my second read through.

506
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,030
I found a couple of gems I liked and one about project tracking,

507
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,430
but one in the end of the book, it's it seems how they relevant

508
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,390
to what we're talking about.

509
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,750
And I tweeted it, but I'm going to read it out loud also.

510
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,270
Therefore, we think of QA as a level up,

511
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,950
not a gate or checkpoint that all work must go through.

512
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,790
We're much better off with QA than without it,

513
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,510
but we don't depend on QA to ship quality features that work as they should.

514
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:05,220
And I, as you and I know, there are some testers that still like being the gatekeeper,

515
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,180
but I really liked that phrasing of that.

516
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,620
They're not the bottleneck.

517
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,100
They definitely having that test specialist can add some for almost every team

518
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:19,340
can add some extra oomph and extra quality and find some of those edge cases.

519
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,020
But they don't let that person be a bottleneck, which I think is great.

520
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,100
And elsewhere, elsewhere in that chapter, they said that they have

521
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,100
the time of book was written.

522
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,340
They had one QA for their entire engineering team.

523
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,460
40 or 50 people.

524
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,700
So I think it's I like that ratio.

525
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,870
Excellent. That's a really good quote.

526
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:41,630
I think it fits well.

527
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,710
Any other examples you want to go through before we wrap up?

528
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,030
What else?

529
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:49,110
The developers do the majority of the testing now.

530
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,150
They did a majority of automation.

531
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:55,750
We had SRE team join us and that's had a big effect in observability.

532
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,470
So we do a lot of monitoring and alerting now.

533
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,550
We use synthetic tests.

534
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,030
And another tool that we start to use a century as well to get our JavaScript

535
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,270
errors, which has been really cool.

536
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,390
We're very much into learning.

537
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,790
So we're doing retros all the way through and we've ensured our retros.

538
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,670
Postmortems is a new way of us learning.

539
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,350
We've been in the know it about six months and they've been working really well.

540
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,490
And what else?

541
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,530
We use analytics.

542
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,370
So we try to use analytics to start to figure out

543
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,450
should we be using something or not?

544
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,530
And then again, use analytics at the end to figure out if something was successful

545
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,850
or not, and we try to use analytics to remove features as well as possible.

546
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,450
And I am smiling and nodding my head so much.

547
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,450
This is what an amazing gig.

548
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,110
Yeah, no, it's really good.

549
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,670
And yeah, I think I covered the customer engagement parts already and yeah.

550
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,950
And the pairing and mobbing we discussed already as well.

551
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,190
So yeah, where possible try to do it.

552
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,510
Often like in conferences, people go away from a conference talk

553
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,350
thinking they're not doing things right.

554
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,830
And often maybe in a podcast, sometimes people think I'm not doing all those things.

555
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,710
But I guess day to day, this is over three years.

556
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,150
I've been trying to do these different things.

557
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,510
They've been small experiments, some things work, some things haven't.

558
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,870
And it's just trying to do, you know, best effort all the time.

559
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,110
We don't always get a race and we don't always do all these things perfectly,

560
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,070
but it's very important for people to know to.

561
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,830
It's important to try things, have those experiments and see what works

562
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:24,710
and just do your best to keep to the principles, I guess.

563
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,750
Everyone's at a different place on their journey.

564
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:33,060
And there is a good reason why one of the principles is to be a driver

565
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:38,100
for continuous improvement and just get a little better all the time.

566
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,100
Retro's and Brent and I have both said how much we love retro's

567
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,540
because even if you just do one improvement from a retro that you have

568
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,780
every two weeks, I mean, that's not even enough in my opinion,

569
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,900
but that's 26 improvements to your process and your product over the year,

570
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,660
which isn't horrible, but then think, oh, we can spread that out.

571
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,140
And it would be silly to do that little.

572
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,980
We should do each team should do a retro.

573
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,060
Maybe she should do it every week.

574
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,620
And those improvements add up, those tiny improvements add up.

575
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,580
And you end up building a lot of great stuff.

576
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,740
You think about what's slowing us down.

577
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,020
What do we need to keep on doing?

578
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,500
What can we stop doing?

579
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,780
However you want to format that discussion and great ideas come out of it.

580
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,780
And also it follows some lean practices of everyone has a voice.

581
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:32,860
You get everyone on the team involved and anyone can have ideas for how to improve.

582
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,180
Yeah, definitely. Like lean is a great thing to learn about,

583
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,940
I guess, as a rule, you know, as a rule of thumb to learn about,

584
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,780
you know, the likes of Toyota and how they became successful.

585
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,860
Because, you know, like you're saying, you know,

586
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,900
in the lean startup and books like that, there's so much to learn there

587
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,420
because I know you lead to yourselves is that a lot of that is the groundwork

588
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,820
for a lot of the seven principles. Yes. Yes.

589
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,820
And then I was just just made this connection.

590
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,820
But Toyota with with everyone being empowered

591
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,700
and anyone can shut down the assembly line,

592
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,860
it is a precursor to whole team quality.

593
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,020
And when I was listening to what you were talking about,

594
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,140
you truly have whole team quality.

595
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,540
As I mentioned on the podcast and probably elsewhere,

596
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,620
I read an article a while back where someone said,

597
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,380
I really believe in whole team quality.

598
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,060
It's so important.

599
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,460
In fact, our tester, our developers write unit tests

600
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,860
for almost everything before they give it to the test team.

601
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,460
I think that's not whole team quality.

602
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,140
What you're talking about, Connor, that's whole team quality.

603
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,420
Everyone, everyone cares and everyone's doing their part.

604
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,180
Mobbing is about whole team quality, one feature at a time.

605
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,140
Getting everyone to talk to each other about what's going on with the product.

606
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,300
That's whole team quality.

607
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,620
So it's it's I think it's a good example.

608
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,370
Thank you.

609
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,080
This has been I say this to everyone, I think,

610
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,040
but I love hearing the story.

611
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,200
I don't think I've smiled this much in one of these so far

612
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,720
because there's so much I like and so much I'm just excited

613
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,680
that you get to be a part of.

614
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,800
It's a little bit of jealousy.

615
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,080
You may have a lot of people wanting to move to Cork and join you.

616
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:13,230
But I know it's a small company, probably not hiring a lot, but they're very, very exciting.

617
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,390
Thank you very much for being for volunteering and and being here

618
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,030
and sharing your stories and giving me a lot of help to the community.

619
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,030
I sometimes and popular actually growing.

620
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,590
We got an investment this time last year.

621
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:28,710
So if people do want to the Cork and want to do work in Buffalo, get in touch.

622
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:33,390
All right. And I know we can get ahold of you on Twitter at Connor F.

623
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,670
And I'll put that in the show notes.

624
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:39,380
Any other blogs or any other things you want me to link to a blog?

625
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,140
I can't find Connor Fai as well.

626
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,180
So pardon those blogs as much as I'd like to.

627
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,900
Maybe in the near I try to blog a bit more, but that's you'll find some of the blogs

628
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,620
there on software testing and I do a little bit of blogging on public speaking.

629
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,060
There, too. All right.

630
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,180
I will put it in the notes and we'll get this out probably in the next week or so.

631
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,780
So congratulations being the first ABT 343 of 2020.

632
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,980
That's a lot of numbers and letters, but I think everybody understands

633
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,140
and have a have a good evening.

634
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,060
Have a good new year and we'll talk and interact with you soon.

635
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,480
Yeah, have a new year to take care.
