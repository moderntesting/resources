1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
So my name is Matt LeRae and I hate writing tests. And so I thought it would be super ironic

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,800
if I started a company that was in the testing space.

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:19,390
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:24,830
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, Agile, and anything else

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,070
that comes to mind. Now on with the show. Hey, everyone. I am Alan. I'm here with Brent.

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,550
Brent, say hi. Hi, everyone. And we have another guest. We have Matt. Matt, say hi.

7
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,590
Hey, nice to meet you. Hey, welcome, Matt. I know

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,310
what Matt does and where he works, but give us the intro bio, Matt.

9
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:48,430
Yeah. So my name is Matt LeRae and I hate writing tests. And so I thought it would be

10
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:54,590
super ironic if I started a company that was in the testing space. And so the name of the company

11
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:02,510
is SpeedScale. And we use automated traffic replay to validate your software. So you don't

12
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,710
have to write tests anymore. And that's what I do for a living nowadays.

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:12,750
Can you say that sentence again? Because I don't think on the podcast I have heard a

14
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,310
sentence that I love more. Say it again. So I hate writing tests. And so the sentence is,

15
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:27,150
I'll say multiple sentences, is because I'm so lazy and I do not wish to, you know, like write,

16
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,670
like do integration tests and like end to end tests and all that. We came up with this idea

17
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,550
of recording production API calls, like using it's like a like a distributed wire shark,

18
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:45,310
basically, we take all the traffic, then we massage it into incoming test cases. I mean,

19
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,990
we call them test cases, but it's really just incoming user transactions. And then we take the

20
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,270
other half of the traffic, the traffic, and we turn it into automated mocks. So that means like,

21
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,390
let's say your service depends on the x, you know, Xbox Live API, or, you know, depends on Gmail or

22
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,430
something like that. Our service will read what happens in production, and we will pretend to be

23
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,230
any of those API's so that you can do like an integration test without actually building an

24
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,190
integration test environment or writing tests. And we do that by like recording like wire shark

25
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,870
recording what's actually happening. Love it. I'm ready to go into Q&A already. Love it. Love it.

26
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,430
Love everything about it. Love, love, love. So let me before you go into Q&A, I want to

27
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,390
talk about why this is important for our, I want to actually add some context. And also I want to

28
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,790
point out, this is the quickest ever, ever in the history of 164 episodes, the A.B. testing

29
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,830
podcast. We've actually got to a conversation about something substantial in the first three

30
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:52,110
minutes. And I am not kidding. Oh, yeah, we had this other agenda. So, uh, no, no, no, no,

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,470
no, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet. I'm going to go on often in the, the testing world. And there's

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,950
these different bubbles of where people are. And I talked to Matt a little bit before you got here,

33
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,510
right around generalizing specialists and how we sort of saw the move to agile working.

34
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:15,310
I think a lot of times people write tests. Um, there are teams and this hurts my soul that we

35
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:21,230
have teams dedicated to nothing except writing automation and usually writing some UI automation

36
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,590
and not being smart about it or converting manual tests to automated tests, which is again,

37
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,310
just this is smart. This is like, let's take some stuff we already have

38
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,390
and let's turn it into something that's actually even more valuable.

39
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:39,230
I'm going to let Brent ask his questions, but I know Bing did something like this a couple

40
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:43,070
of times too. We had a little bit of things that Microsoft had a little small scale. Like,

41
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:47,390
let me do some traffic replay to try and try and see what Bing would look like if it doubled

42
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:54,030
from 5,000 to 10,000 users. Oh, there's, there's a, yeah, there is, there's a lot on, on sort of

43
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:01,150
traffic replay shadow environments is another thing where, where essentially you have a separate

44
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,470
environment where your, your, your proposed code is deployed. And then you just automatically

45
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,510
clone the traffic across both environments. There's a lot of techniques here. I don't know.

46
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:20,590
Like I, I think now around, okay, what are the frameworks within Microsoft that's really

47
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,020
helping to emphasize this. And I can't think of a single one, right? And it's because it's hard.

48
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:34,580
It's hard and it's hard to make it generalize. And so when, when teams reorganize, things get forgotten,

49
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,940
people like, Oh, that was interesting, but we'd have to spend 18 years to port it. It's hard.

50
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:46,370
So great. If, if Matt and team have, have essentially, have you, are you solving this

51
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:53,170
through a SAS play or do you, do you have to install libraries from your team? Like,

52
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,650
Yeah, good question. So the, so first thing I'll say is it is really hard. It's harder than I

53
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,210
thought it would be. But fortunately, as my co-founder says, I really enjoy pain. I really

54
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:08,930
enjoy the suffering that comes from solving this problem. It just, it just fulfills me as a person.

55
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:13,730
But it is actually really hard. But, you know, it turns out there's like, once you get past a

56
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,930
few heuristics, a lot of it isn't actually that difficult. When you get past like,

57
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,930
re-signing, you know, JWT's or JOTS or tokens, authorization, authentication, you know,

58
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,810
you get into like, being able to change fields and database queries. A lot of the problems like

59
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:36,450
an 80-20 rule, but it is a SAS play, which is the original question is a SAS play. Although we are

60
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,370
able to take it on premise later, but right now, because we're kind of small still, we're,

61
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,450
we're keeping it in house so that we can see the data and we can figure out what those heuristics

62
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:49,650
and patterns are, as new ones come up. But yeah, it's SAS for now, the number one thing people always

63
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,330
don't like is sending data to someone else, right for this. And so we have a data loss prevention

64
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,930
thing we do, which is basically like it's like a masking engine. It's just a little,

65
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:07,890
little bit smarter, because it'll, it'll find the same, like not allowed like PII data, it'll say,

66
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:12,930
Hey, if I see Alan over here on an inbound transaction, and I see Alan going to the

67
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,170
database, I need to replace both Alan's with the same, excuse me, redacted information,

68
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,650
so that it'll play back correctly. And so it's like, if we're mocking it, we're pretending to

69
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,650
be the database, the database, meaning speed scale, we'll pretend like we know who Alan is,

70
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,690
you know, back and forth. So without knowing, right? Without what? Without actually knowing.

71
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:39,570
So you probably, you probably are hashing the detecting and hashing the string and then using

72
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,530
that renaming the mallah, the backward string hash.

73
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:54,770
Okay. Are we going back to the useless stuff at the typical part of the humor went right over your

74
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:01,010
head as usual, Brent. It, it, it did. Do you guys know what a Wiseman score is from the show,

75
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,050
Silicon Valley? I remember the name of it. Remind me and I'll remember it. So it's,

76
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,250
it's something they made up for the show, but actually is a real mathematical formula. Like

77
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,170
it actually works, but they made it up for the show. And it basically is a way of ranking

78
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,850
compression algorithms by how they'll play. Of course, of course. Yeah.

79
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,010
Middle out's the best, right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Middle out's the best. So my running joke

80
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,330
with my, one of my co-founders is the first time we did this like data loss engine, uh,

81
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,010
or first time we, we, you know, we're sending this data around, we ended up, uh, writing a

82
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,130
negative Wiseman score compression algorithm, which if you look at the math and how that

83
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:37,970
works, it means we caused it to get a lot bigger. So that's, that's a, that's a computer

84
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,490
science first. Um, our compression algorithm made everything bigger. And the way

85
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,810
you got to start somewhere, you got to start somewhere.

86
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,410
So if you just start with decompressing the raw data, then, then you'll go in the right direction.

87
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,890
You know, I'm going to take that back.

88
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,130
What you want to do.

89
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,330
Perhaps suggest not.

90
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,250
Some other unsolicited advice, take all the parts of the,

91
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,930
just take the parts you don't need and delete those smaller

92
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,450
or, you know, just, you know, every, every other bit, just drop, drop those.

93
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,170
I'm sure it'll just be fine. 50% compression right there. Yeah.

94
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,130
You didn't need them anyway.

95
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:25,570
Yeah. It's the extra parts that you get from my Kia, right?

96
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,170
One of the things that we've said on the podcast years ago, years and years and years ago.

97
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,610
That's before I had a beard.

98
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,050
Now, one of the things, one of the things that, that we talked about here is,

99
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,410
is one way to sort of merge. This was at a time where people were still trying to get

100
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:53,090
comfortable moving from on-prem to the service space. And they were sort of duplicating their

101
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:00,450
test cases. And they felt that tip meant moving my test suite to the cloud and then

102
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:08,770
monitors and tests were the same thing. And so one of the things, one of the things we talked about

103
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:17,170
here is, yeah, really in this new world, you should be able to use, say, local automation,

104
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,370
to sort of drive traffic, which I think you're improving upon that, but use local automation,

105
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,930
to drive traffic. And one of the things that we proposed was essentially,

106
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:34,210
but change your validation side of the suite. That your validation should be able to use your

107
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:40,370
existing telemetry and not specific validation steps to identify whether or not you have,

108
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:47,250
let's say, a regression or even a live site type incident. Your thoughts on that and how

109
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,810
was SpeedScale advanced sort of those thought processes?

110
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,250
You guys, I don't know if you know, if you guys know where it came from. You remember the phrase

111
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,130
pets versus cattle? The Kubernetes folks talk about this a lot. Have you guys ever heard that?

112
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,810
No, I'm not a warrior.

113
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,330
I heard it from Kelsey Hightower, but he credited someone else. I don't remember who it was.

114
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,530
And follow Kelsey on Twitter. Kelsey Hightower is awesome.

115
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,650
That's where I got it from, is on Twitter. Yeah, he's awesome. He's full of knowledge.

116
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:16,530
But anyway, what it basically says, when you go to these cloud environments,

117
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:24,530
you generally, you stop keeping these carefully curated servers. And instead, like a pet,

118
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,210
we just love them, and you dress them, and you give names, and you teach them how to say certain

119
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,450
words and whatever. And eventually, you go towards herds of cattle. And they're all going to eventually

120
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:38,210
be, you're not really naming them, you're just kind of keeping them corralled or whatever.

121
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:42,690
And if some of them get lost, it's not that big a deal. And so the kind of the idea is,

122
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,290
if you take that to the world of testing, cloud testing, if you lift and shift your entire

123
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,930
testing suite from the old thing you were doing, and you move it over to this cloud environment,

124
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,090
you're not really getting any benefit. You might as well stay on boxes or bare metal or whatever,

125
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:02,770
you know, VMs or whatever it is. And so that's, you're kind of hitting at the heart of what made

126
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:07,570
us come up with the idea is like, or, you know, the problem is, I want to treat all this stuff

127
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,010
as cattle, I want to treat it like it can be blown away, and it's no big deal. And how do

128
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,010
you do that? Well, what if I just record a new version out of production every so often,

129
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:19,730
you know, like, so what, you know, like some of our, like, we'll do it for like every hour,

130
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,930
for instance, we'll just say, you know, every hour, we're gonna get a new copy of this stuff,

131
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,090
like a certain sections of it or whatever. And then, you know, reproduce that and bring it back.

132
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,970
And so, so yeah, that's the idea is to bring that automation back to it. And then the other

133
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:38,110
thing is, I, I don't know what you guys experiences like, but I've never been able to

134
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,470
keep up with tests, like handwritten tests, even the best handwritten tests or mocks.

135
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,670
Have you ever seen, you guys ever seen that work? Where like it stays up to date,

136
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:52,030
and it's not a huge burden on people? Only in places where we have like five unit tests.

137
00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:01,070
Seems like there's some downsides to that. Yeah, just, just, just a little. Yeah.

138
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:09,950
The maintenance cost is ginormous. This is one of the places where Alan and I, for example, we were

139
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:19,150
just like, no, handcrafted UI tests should just be banned, just outright banned. And then Alan,

140
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:24,510
I don't know, what is it, but a year where you did, did some deep thinking on this and you're like,

141
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,670
Alan shifted. We spent most of our career going, yeah, recording playback, they're stupid.

142
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:38,190
Because they're just a bitch to maintain. Yeah. But if you get rid of the bitch to maintain part,

143
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:45,070
then they become pretty fantastic. Yeah. Just to, to loop, uh, Madden on our thinking, um,

144
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,510
the record and playback stuff now has a little bit of ML built into it to adjust for when things

145
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:56,590
move or whatever kind of work. And even if like your selenium test is going to eventually fail

146
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:01,630
this stuff, eventually, no matter how clever you write it, it's, you spent hours or weeks on

147
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,230
these tests, they're eventually going to get stale and not work. I would rather just do the record

148
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:11,070
and playback because you can ha if you need that UI test to verify some logic you shoved into your UI,

149
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,990
use the record and playback test because it's smart enough to keep working for a long time.

150
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:19,070
And when it finally stops working, you can take five minutes and create a brand new one from

151
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,430
fresh data. Yeah. And that people don't like me. Well, you two like me saying that there's some

152
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,910
people that don't like that approach. They go, they're holding on to their test automation job,

153
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:35,790
writing selenium all day. Like it's the, I just don't get it to me. It's not a, it's factory work.

154
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:40,110
Basically it's not, it's not, it's not, it's not the love. It's not the kind of pain I'm with you,

155
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,110
Matt. I want, I like to live in pain. Other people to live in pain, just me.

156
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:52,270
Yeah. So I'm, I'm far less masochistic, but, but I will say that if it's easy, it's not fun.

157
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,070
True. Or if you don't learn true. Right. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. It was,

158
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,070
I was thinking through another scenario on, on that we were just talking about it. It's

159
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:09,470
already escaped me. Sorry. I do want to ask you, Matt, do you have a, an example ready nearby of,

160
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,270
uh, a handcrafted cart, cart guitar? Yes. Yes. Actually,

161
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,110
Brent is just changing. Yeah. Just, just, uh, just,

162
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:23,630
Brent, while we were talking, Brent decided to read the little bio of that from the website

163
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,550
and now wants to take our podcast in the completely fricking different directions.

164
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:36,030
So it's, it's AB testing. It's not just a testing. Uh, it's ADHD testing.

165
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:39,870
You skipped over the bullshit part of the podcast. So I'm going back

166
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:46,110
like ever, ever since I saw his bio, I'm like, yeah. So that was something that I was actually

167
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,110
thinking about picking up as a hobby. And then I got a bunch of instruction books and I'm like,

168
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:57,230
oh, this is going to take for goddamn ever playing guitar or carving guitars.

169
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:04,320
Why don't I show you? Yeah. You gotta play, right? It's hanging on the wall. Oh.

170
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,720
And, and our listeners can't see this, but just live vicariously through our words.

171
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,000
Beautiful. What is the, the, the wood you used?

172
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,760
So, uh, this is a, this is like a mahogany, a thin mahogany. Um, I actually bought from a kit,

173
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,960
so I don't, I think it's maple. So, uh, I'm not, I'm not an expert on that. Uh, but I carved this,

174
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,120
uh, by hand, the speed scale logo, as you can see on my shirt, speed scale, nice. And then I,

175
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,920
it was my first experience carving wood. And then also do you, do you play speedy scales?

176
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:43,600
You know, I, I used to play quite speedy scales. Now I sound, uh, more like I belong

177
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,080
in like a, like earth wind and fire cover band or something. Like I'm not, uh, it's more of like,

178
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,520
let the singers do their thing. I'm not so much a great guitar player.

179
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,400
There is absolutely zero wrong, zero with an earth wind and fire.

180
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,280
Wonderful music. Just not like super guitar music, you know?

181
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,800
I, I dream of being able to be at that level.

182
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,520
Yeah. It was funny. I was, uh, I was watching stranger things, uh, you know,

183
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:14,320
in my copious free time. And, um, and they have that, the scene, you may have seen it right where

184
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,600
the, the, one of the guys plays master of puppets. Yeah. Eddie. And I felt like I was like,

185
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,640
it's been 30 years and I'm finally cool. Finally. Everybody, the song was 30 years note. Everybody

186
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,080
hated that song, you know, whatever. We were like the weird people, but now people know what it

187
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,360
is. I do want to point out because I have, uh, so many things I've forgotten in my life

188
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,120
and Brent's right. The bullshit parts here. I remember the eighties so well, just so well. And

189
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:49,840
that, oh shoot, what year is it? 86 86. It's set on spring break of 1986. That whole, uh,

190
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,920
stranger things. And that's no spoiler there. Master of puppets was released in the beginning

191
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:05,040
of March, 1986. So that meant Eddie learned to shred on that song with no tab, no internet

192
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,280
in less than three weeks. Impossible. No.

193
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,380
Just want to point that out for the cup, for the, for your continuity. And I don't think that

194
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:23,020
spoils anything, but yeah, where were we, right? Oh, oh, um, so a couple of things I want to talk

195
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,500
about. Um, I would like to learn a little bit more about how you learn to hate testing.

196
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,900
Yeah. Uh, so I've been, I worked in the observability space or what we call monitoring

197
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,940
back then for 15 years. It actually started with satellite monitoring. So it was, it was

198
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:47,020
a great job out of college. Uh, and I would go around the world and install monitoring systems

199
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:52,220
for earth stations. So that's like the intent on the ground part of satellites. And then also

200
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,820
fiber optic cables. So as a 22 year old, I would go out to these fiber optic cables that would span

201
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,420
like run out into the ocean and sit on the beach and install software. There were worse things in

202
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:11,020
life back then. So, uh, but yeah, so then I got into, uh, I was very fortunate to get

203
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,660
into a company called Wiley technology that was bought by CA. Um, it was a, the first sort of

204
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,220
APM vendor, which meant, you know, back then what it really meant is like tracing,

205
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,220
uh, one of the first vendors that did tracing metrics, it didn't do logs, but, um,

206
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,740
and, uh, got to kind of learn about how big enterprises, uh, tried to solve problems in

207
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,460
monolithic systems. Um, so I don't know how care how much everybody's interested in the deep

208
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,060
technical bits, but like Wiley was one of the first companies that did something called

209
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,340
bytecode instrumentation, which was you would be able to look inside of a running Java process

210
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,020
by losing, like sticking little hooks everywhere. It was almost like, you know,

211
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,180
like putting timers everywhere, right? Without anybody noticing. And so, you know,

212
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,340
that was great for a monolith because in the monolith world, you know, like getting a stack

213
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:01,260
trace is like King, right? Like that's the, that's as like, as good as it gets,

214
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,620
especially if you can get a stack trace with timings, like a flame graph over time. Right.

215
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,860
And so we got to do that. And it was, it was fantastic. Cause it was like, all these

216
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,260
folks were struggling with this stuff and you'd walk in and you'd be like, here,

217
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,300
just install this and they'd be like, yeah, I don't know. No, no, no, trust me,

218
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,180
install it. And they would install it. And they'd be like, I can't believe it. I was like,

219
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:23,180
I know exactly. It's amazing. Right. And so we have to do that. And then I kind of watched

220
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,580
some of the transition into microservices and that kind of changed things for me

221
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,580
where it wasn't like getting the stack trace and the flame graph was what was important.

222
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,380
It like inside of a process, it was more like the problem moved to the, to the between the

223
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:45,260
processes. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. No, no, no, no. I was just guessing. Like that's,

224
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:51,260
that's the nightmare I'm dealing with every day, day in and day out. It's, it's essentially

225
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:58,620
the problems are in the no man's land between components and therefore teams and therefore,

226
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:06,770
right. Trying to figure out how the components are fitting together. And more importantly,

227
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:12,370
how they're not is the problematic aspect. Please. I'm enthralled by your story. Please continue.

228
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,530
So when that happened, what, what you needed in a monitoring tool changed. And I think that

229
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,730
kind of gave rise to observability, you know, and I kind of stayed in that world for a while.

230
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:26,130
But you know what, like, and I think a lot of like a lot of attractions being made there,

231
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:29,730
some of the new, like the new monitoring tools are amazing, right? The new observability tools,

232
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,890
what they can do, open tracing, they're open telemetry and, you know,

233
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,570
more broadly, they're putting that into the core libraries now in a lot of the ghost stuff

234
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,450
and in Java as well. And so like out of the box, like, let's say you're running Istio,

235
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,170
which is a service mesh. And I don't know if everybody knows what a service mesh is,

236
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,690
but it's, it's like the networking layer on top of Kubernetes. I'm oversimplifying,

237
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,370
but otherwise this will be a five hour podcast.

238
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,570
We'll do a whole other three part series on what a service.

239
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,050
No, we won't.

240
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,530
Like if you turn on some of the observability stuff where it generates spans, which are like

241
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,530
where the hops are, if they generate, if you turn that on in some of the service meshes,

242
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,810
and then you use the default libraries, right, you get a pretty good view of what's going on,

243
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,890
actually, you still need commercial stuff. You know, you still need or not answer commercial,

244
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,970
but you at least need Prometheus and all that, or Jaeger zipkin to go and like,

245
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,730
put stitch it together for you. But it's kind of an interesting new world to me. And I don't

246
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,250
claim to be an expert on all the newest and latest and greatest, because I'm busy with

247
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,690
speed scale, but it's a pretty, a pretty interesting world. But it sounds like you

248
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:40,050
guys have been doing a lot of work with that. So what's your, what's your take?

249
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:45,090
I want to talk a little bit about Istio. If, if you can get it up and running,

250
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:53,940
it's, it's, it's a little fickle. There is just a massive amount of information and capabilities

251
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:58,740
in that there's so much you can, it's, it's a kitchen sink of stuff. Yeah. But this kind

252
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,700
of gets a little bit into the another question I wanted to ask you about. You got all the way

253
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,180
here, although, although I don't know, ever know if I heard your story or if I heard why you hate test.

254
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,300
Oh yeah. So, um, uh, I was, I was always in like engineering leadership and then I did a

255
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,460
stint in technical sales for like seven years, but I did like, you know, in general leadership.

256
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,740
And, uh, the, the thing I hated about testing is like being serious for a second is everybody

257
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,940
hates the testers and they're the ones who, who keep you from lighting yourself on fire.

258
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,540
Right. Like you're like, okay, I love this code. It's going to be great. It's awesome.

259
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,060
I'm ready to send it to production. And then the tester goes and says, Hey,

260
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,180
I was messing with this thing. And then it burst into flames and you're like, yeah,

261
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:40,580
you did something wrong. And they're like, no, no, I didn't. Right. Uh, and so, but then everybody

262
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,620
hates that, that function anyway. Right. Because it seems like it's a waste. And then the folks

263
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,460
who were doing it are sitting here writing all these, like you said, the end-to-end Selenium

264
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,420
tests or whatever they've got, maybe it's postman they're just like trying APIs and it's just

265
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,740
toil. It's like the definition of developer toil, like just sitting there just grinding.

266
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,300
And so what got, you know, I watched all that happen and it was usually about 30% of my team.

267
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,740
Uh, and maybe that's cause the products I worked on, but, uh, it was about 30% of my team was just

268
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,660
testers. And I thought, you know, this is just inefficient. Everybody hates it. Right. As

269
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,820
engineers, we just hate doing it. Uh, we hate, like we hate the bad news that comes from it.

270
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:18,820
So I said, you know, can we, can we, can we automate this thing? You know, and the cool

271
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,820
thing was we went and started speed scale is you were talking about Istio a little bit,

272
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,580
but it's, it's the whole Kubernetes ecosystem. Like the whole container management thing

273
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,580
like makes it possible. Now, like when I said distributor and wireshark, you can actually do

274
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,220
that now. And even like five years ago, I don't know of a way to do that at scale, like, you know,

275
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,980
at any reasonable scale, you know, to, to do a distributed work. I'm sure somebody can build

276
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,260
something. I'm just saying it was like, it was way hard and it's gotten a lot easier because

277
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,580
everybody's been pioneering shout out to link your D to not just Istio, but link your D as well.

278
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,820
You know, um, those folks, but, uh, um, you know, they're kind of pioneering it. So anyway,

279
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:56,980
that's linker D less finicky, less finicky does a little less little, little smaller. Well,

280
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,340
yeah. Well, I have a customer and I won't name them because they will get mad, uh, but I have

281
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,220
a customer that says, uh, uh, a friend who says, uh, I said, do you use list, you know, like Istio,

282
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,460
like in anger, like in production, cause a lot of folks just play with it and pre-prod he goes,

283
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,140
he goes, yes. He says the only way to use Istio is in anger. So, uh, that's the only.

284
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:21,620
So that could be on a t-shirt. So this all leads me to a question I wanted to ask based on,

285
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:28,340
um, just some leading up to this podcast is a long time ago, I used to do a lot of debugging in

286
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:35,060
windows and I was part of my job was to, we ran these stress tests overnight and I was one of

287
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,300
the people who got to go connect to everyone's debugger remotely and poke around, see what was

288
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,540
going on and either debug it myself or find someone else to bring in. And I really enjoyed

289
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,660
it and it was hard. And like Brent said earlier, it was hard and I was learning, so it was fun,

290
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,290
but man, as confident and as good as I was feeling at that when it comes to debugging

291
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,770
microservices, when, as Brent was talking about before, when the problems happen in the hops in

292
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:05,330
between and trying to reconstruct what's going on as things go from service to microservice to

293
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:11,970
microservice, man, it's a, it's a, I'm good thing. I'm management overhead now. Cause I

294
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,210
probably just pull my hair out all day trying to figure out what to do there. So, so, uh, I think

295
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,570
you have some, it sounds like you have some experience or thoughts or like to hear like,

296
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,530
one, maybe expand a little bit on the challenge and then talk about like how you get better at

297
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:32,110
it. Okay. Sure. So, okay. So the, the, the thing that, um, so in a, in an observability suite,

298
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:37,550
there's like two big areas of things you need, right? And again, I'm oversimplifying. There's

299
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,430
a million little things, but like in categories, one is you need deep visibility and you're going

300
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:46,270
to get deep visibility. The easiest one is you're like, you're going to turn on the log monitor.

301
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,990
Every turns on the monitor. The next thing you're gonna do is you're like going to turn on

302
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:53,870
stats D and you're going to get some metrics, right? Uh, CPU memory, something put out of your

303
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,590
application. Those are like the two easy things to start. If you're really, really, uh, you

304
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,670
know, like dedicated, maybe you'll get some traces too, but that's un, you know, more unusual.

305
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,910
Um, and so you kind of start there. That's like the beginning of deep visibility. Now,

306
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,710
the better deep visibility you get, the more, the more you get into each of the individual boxes in

307
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:17,870
the microservice diagram. So I'll give you an example. Uh, you, are you guys familiar with

308
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:23,790
EBPF? You heard of that technology? I have not. Okay. So extended Berkeley packet filter,

309
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,190
and it's like giving Linux a super power. Like if you're running Linux and they're also

310
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,710
reporting into windows as well, like you're mentioning, uh, you know, being windows debugger

311
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:39,470
and what EBPF lets you do is view the inside of what's going on in the kernel with low overhead

312
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:47,070
and an excellent security model. So you can go and see inside of an SSL payload as the kernel

313
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:50,990
sees it. Like if you instrument like open SSL library, which almost everybody uses or most

314
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,990
languages use, you'll see the HTTP transaction going back and forth inside of it. And so that's

315
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,150
like the ultimate deep visibility. Right. And so there's, there's a good product that they're

316
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:05,550
called contain IQ. There's a pixie, which is an open source project. That's really good.

317
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,630
And you'll look at how they did everything. Um, but anyway, that EBPF, so that's like going deep

318
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:14,110
into these things, right? Okay, that's cool. So you want deep visibility, right? The problem is

319
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:18,110
the deeper your visibility, the more data you get and the more unintelligible it is.

320
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:21,950
It's impossible to understand. And what you'll see with that, at least I saw with all the,

321
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,470
the big enterprises is, uh, the, the alert storm, or as I like to call it, the can filled

322
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:32,910
with coins that's just shakes all day long. You know, you know, the alert thing, it's just like

323
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,790
alerts go off. Nobody knows what they mean. So what you end up having to do is create some sort

324
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:44,270
of correlation and analysis engine to go and make sense of that thing. Right. And so what I was

325
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:48,830
going with that about microservices is in the old days in monoliths, the value was all about

326
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,710
looking deep, you know, like, like EBPF and all that, and that's still valuable.

327
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,830
But in the microservices world, it's all about the correlation engine is how good are you at

328
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,670
getting signal from noise? And I think you do some ML work, right? So I don't know if

329
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:07,870
you have some thoughts on that, but, Oh, it did. My, my team is, is deep in that space.

330
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:16,670
But a lot of the code that we're working on, how do we put this? So Microsoft as the,

331
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:22,110
as the stepwise transformed, a lot of the things that we did is we basically lift and

332
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:30,270
shifted server code and kind of turn it into service code. Yeah. Right. And, and we're still

333
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,430
in some places, you know, buying down that technical debt and, and, and converting

334
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:42,270
things into microservices and picking it up. Right. So we were at a point right now. So for example,

335
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:50,350
there is a non-trivial open telemetry migration that's underway. It's going to still take

336
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:59,470
multiple years to finally close. But yeah, we, we, there's a lot of tedious work in,

337
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:08,190
in, I view it as tedious because every, every team has produced their own telemetry. We get called in

338
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:16,590
to, to do anomaly detection along the telemetry. So we have to, we have to do everything that you're

339
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:24,510
talking about and, and, and do it kind of manually from a, from a data science way. And each project,

340
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:30,750
because it hasn't been sort of normalized or curated into a common schema is, is basically

341
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:36,190
starting from ground zero all over again. It's painful. Thankfully, that's one of my sister

342
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,270
teams working on that problem. My, my, my problem is more in the, in the, in the customers,

343
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:51,310
customer space, trying to understand what causes customers to retain or, or leave. But those two

344
00:29:51,310 --> 00:30:01,630
worlds are very quickly merging. And so that's, that's one of the problems I'm trying to work on

345
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:08,750
is essentially, all right, when we see this type of, let's call it signature as a, as a sort of a

346
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,670
call flow pattern from the combination of the customer and the platform, can we translate that

347
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:21,230
to an expression of a problem, say that a customer might, might do in their support case report,

348
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:27,550
right? That type of correlation is kind of what my team focuses on. Can we figure out which of

349
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:36,350
these patterns piss off our customers? And do more of those, right? Another, just sort of practical

350
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,470
example. I love to hear Matt, your thoughts on this. This is, I will try to anonymize this phrase

351
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,590
the most I can. So part of biggest part of my org is just platform engineering. I've made a

352
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:53,950
statement to one of our big service owners that, well, two things happen. One is we'll have

353
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:59,150
incidents, operational surprises, and we spend, I think more, well, in my opinion, more time

354
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:04,110
than we should trying to figure out exactly where the problem is. The result of that is when I

355
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,510
talked to the owners of our, some of our bigger services, I will say, and they won't argue with

356
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:14,910
me. I say, I guarantee you right now, something is broken in your, in your microservice architecture.

357
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,910
Something is not working as it should. We may know tomorrow. We may know next week. We may

358
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,710
never know. It may get fixed by something else, but we just don't know. And it, it all just is

359
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:29,230
making my case for observability or, and how it needs to improve. So that statement is probably

360
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:35,470
true for most microservice architectures, probably in production today. Something's broken now.

361
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,230
It's what's, whether you know or not is the challenge. Yeah. Well, the old days you'd say,

362
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:45,550
what changed, right? Everything. And it isn't even that we can have stuff change. It's a

363
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:50,830
little break and nothing changed. Nothing, no code changed, not nothing changed, no code changed.

364
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:53,710
I'm going to give kind of an abstract answer because I've worked a lot on this at previous

365
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:59,310
companies, right? The, but like my thoughts on it are kind of, all right. So in the old days,

366
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,910
and this is like updating your thinking for like the new world of microservices or, or

367
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:05,710
the new version of microservices, because if you remember long ago, we've, we've done,

368
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,390
you know, if anybody remembers service oriented architectures, we've done some of this before,

369
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:14,270
but in the past, but with microservices architectures. So there's two key things

370
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,190
that give you superpowers, right? For, for finding problems to, at least in my experience,

371
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,550
and I'm always interested in what you guys think, but the first one is, is you need a set of

372
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:29,470
heuristics that tell you what normal is. And so, and that usually is applied to metrics or log

373
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:34,830
patterns, usually not always, but often, right? And so the simplest version of that is like,

374
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:38,030
you know, it's like baselining, like automatic baselining algorithms, right? There was like a,

375
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,790
there was a great company called app dynamics that kind of pioneered this long ago of like

376
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:46,990
finding like dynamic baselines. Okay, cool. That's good. The problem is in microservices,

377
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,550
that's it's two variable things change too much because your load balancing, or your, your

378
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,150
replicas are scaling up scaling down, like depending on how sophisticated your system is,

379
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:59,550
stuff's changing constantly. So a basic baseline is not going to cut it, right? But you have to

380
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:03,550
come up with some system for understanding normal. The second thing, I think this is the part that

381
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:09,790
people don't understand as well is you have to come up with a graph of dependencies that is

382
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:16,270
continuously updated, and that that influences the normal model. So, like well says like,

383
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,430
in the old days is really easy because you'd say, Okay, well, I have a database and I have, you know,

384
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:24,830
I have two or three services, and then I have the user and the load balancer and few little things.

385
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:29,550
And then if I go, if the graph goes down, right, like that's kind of like horizontally, the graph

386
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,990
goes across graphs goes down, and I go into the servers and the VMs and the networks and the

387
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:36,750
containers and all the other stuff, right? And you could come up with a pretty good idea of that,

388
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:40,670
right? The issue that comes in now is that with microservices, like, I don't know,

389
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:44,510
have you guys ever seen the Death Star diagrams that were popular a few years ago, where they

390
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:49,790
basically, you know, it's like, yeah, like Netflix has them. And other folks do as well, you, it's very

391
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,830
hard to keep that graph up to date. And you can't hold it in your head anymore. At least, I don't

392
00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:00,590
know, you can't reason about it anymore. So you need some tool that will, whether you build it,

393
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:04,510
or you buy one or whatever, you need some tool that will figure out what normal is statistically,

394
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,910
and then something that will go and overlay that with the heuristics derived from the graph model.

395
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:13,470
And then you start to get somewhere of actually hunting things down, where I see the noise

396
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:19,330
generation happening is where people have one or the other and they're disconnected. So, you know,

397
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,490
I'm talking like state of the art, right? Now, now that there's an alternative to that is you get

398
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:30,050
into I mentioned Netflix, right? Netflix has a lot of consistent, incredible volume, but a lot of

399
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,530
consistency in the kind of workload, right? Like, it's the stream. So like, that's a different

400
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,610
problem. And they have genius people who solve that problem differently. I'm talking the average

401
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,730
enterprise that has a lot of weird shaped objects that they're trying to fit together

402
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:45,810
into an online bill pay application or something, you know? So yeah, Netflix has a different

403
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,570
quality of problem, I think. But so anyway, I talked a lot there. So I'm going to stop talking.

404
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,010
No, it was I had some good flashback there. Everybody used to debug stuff, which can get,

405
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:59,250
you know, it's multi-threaded stuff. And remember taking a lot of notes on a pad of paper,

406
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,010
just so I can remember context and try and it was too much to hold in my head.

407
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,730
But I could, I could write some cues that would help me remember what a value was on

408
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:13,170
some stack and some other thread or something without scrolling up and losing my train of thought.

409
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,890
And I don't have enough paper to do that for microservices.

410
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:22,930
You have to have a system that doesn't. I absolutely think it's, so I've not heard it

411
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:29,170
described so simply. I think that's super elegant. I think one of the things that is

412
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:35,570
sort of inspiring the thought process in my head right now is to what degree

413
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:43,890
are we kind of in this weird, awkward space because people are artificially holding on to the idea

414
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:53,010
that it's understandable, that the complexity of how software operates, that, that, oh, if we just

415
00:35:53,010 --> 00:36:00,050
do this, we'll be able to understand it. And I'm now wondering what, what additional advancements

416
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,170
would happen if we just let go of that idea.

417
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,250
I'm certainly guilty of it. I look at our production system. I know what's wrong. No,

418
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,890
you don't Matt. No, no, you don't. Because it's, it's like, it's too complicated to hold in your

419
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:17,330
head. Even our system as a startup, there was 99% invisible. One of my favorite podcasts,

420
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:23,010
I think it, I think it was that one. They, a pencil, a simple pencil. And this is something

421
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:28,770
I think about all the time. Just a simple wooden pencil. There is actually no one that can

422
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:37,490
make those anymore. There's nobody, there's nobody that knows how to build it all. Everything is sort

423
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:41,810
of, there's one person that knows how to build the erasers. There's one person that knows how

424
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:51,540
to assemble the parts together. But the pencil has kind of been something where no one by itself

425
00:36:52,500 --> 00:37:03,260
can build it from scratch, from raw material. Yeah. And I find that concept fascinating because you

426
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,500
can hold a pencil, you can look at it and go, it seems like something I should be able to build,

427
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:12,860
but no, no, you, you can't. Now you, now you take something to something more abstract,

428
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:19,500
more complicated, like microservices. How do we even find out which microservices are calling

429
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:25,660
which other microservices that goes to your dependency call? Okay. Well, or how about,

430
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,580
how about circular circular dependencies in a microservice architecture?

431
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,740
So let me just interrupt there and say, that's a solvable problem. We've solved it. We've,

432
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,780
it's pretty easy to build from the little show how your services interact. Then you look at this

433
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,100
big mess of a tangled spider web and you go, okay, now what? Well, then you have to filter

434
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:49,420
at Y workload, right? This particular thing, whether it's like a particular kind of trend,

435
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,420
like user request or something or whatever, you know, you have to zoom in, you know, whatever,

436
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,340
but you're right. It's a big ball, ball of ball of wax. I mean, it's a big, all yarn. I mean,

437
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:05,900
it's a big ball of yarn or wax. It depends. You know, you got me thinking a little bit

438
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,260
Brent with what you said is that one of the things that happens when you go to these

439
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,780
distributed architectures is that software development is like really hard, at least

440
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:18,060
is hard for people like me. So like, it's very hard for some of us, right? And microservices makes

441
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,420
it very easy to build software. But then then what happens is all the complexity moves over to

442
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,860
Allen's team, the operation platform team, all those guys, it takes all the complexity away,

443
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,780
like it makes it way easier to build the software and much way harder to run it.

444
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,460
Because like you said, there's no pad of paper, it's too complicated, too many parts.

445
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,100
But the development teams love it, because they're like, this is great. All I have to

446
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,540
worry about is my own little thing. And it's polyglot. And I only worry about my little,

447
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,140
you know, my little loves, I can circumscribe my concerns. It's like, yeah,

448
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:48,060
but now you have a different set of problems. You know,

449
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:56,780
no, it's easy. It's easy for you to produce. As long as you ignore that, you know what,

450
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:01,900
the over time, the amount of time that you're spending actually writing new code versus

451
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:09,900
going in debugging log streams slowly, well, maybe not slowly, increasing. I don't know what

452
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,900
the common term is. But for example, in my organization, the DRI, is DRI a common term,

453
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:23,020
a designated person to go investigate? The designated responsible individual.

454
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:30,620
So if your service is out, I assume you, Matt, have some process to handle who's on point to

455
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,900
go investigate live site issues, right? That's the, we use the acronym DRI here.

456
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:43,500
When you slowly discover, so you're an executive, Matt, if you were to find out that 50% plus

457
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:53,440
of your engineering team is being spent on just DRI duties, right? You kind of go, well,

458
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,880
okay, great. It's easy to produce code, but that's not where the cost is anymore. The cost is in

459
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:06,800
the maintenance tax on shipping the code. And the issue is, okay, no, we got to stop thinking about

460
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,080
shipping as code is a singular thing. We got to think of it as, okay, how are we going to maintain

461
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:18,880
it? When some random team reports to us that our random microservice, which then calls into 18 other

462
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,840
random microservices, how do we know where the bug fix is supposed to check in at?

463
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,560
Yeah, right. That's kind of the problem today. Today, in my view,

464
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,000
I want to rewind the stack a little bit pre-brand or I may just delete

465
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,440
Brent entirely from that section. I'll think I can figure it out later.

466
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,880
One thing you mentioned is like, you're right. My platform team makes sure you have all the stuff

467
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,560
it's easy at your service running. But also 15 years ago, I was worried about building testability

468
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,760
into products so they could be easier tested. Now it's, I make sure that people can build

469
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,760
observability into their service from the beginning and make sure like, just try and give

470
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,920
them, here's this nice paved road to walk down. If you do this, here's where you start.

471
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,720
And if you do this, you're going to be happy for a long time. A lot of risk is gone.

472
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,080
You know, the observability is there. We're going to give you basically the equivalence of

473
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:16,880
stats D or something. And we use Prometheus and some things on top of that. And we're going to

474
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,760
just give that to you and show you how to get started there. And you're going to be in good

475
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,480
shape or you can kind of go walk off in the weeds somewhere into your own thing and good luck.

476
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,840
Yeah. You got me thinking a little bit of a little tactical thing or not tactic,

477
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,200
what little things, but tactical things like we're going to standardize the monitoring stack,

478
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,360
at least to a basic level. You can do crazy stuff if you want to. Like that has so much value.

479
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,280
I'd say actually, uh, Christine Spang at Nylus, she's one of the founders of this company,

480
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,520
Nylus, she said something at a conference that stuck with me is one of the biggest

481
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,760
bangs for the buck in a microservices architecture is to simply put correlation IDs

482
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,240
that traverse every microservice, just simple, like a header, you know what I mean? A header

483
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,280
always there. And then the first thing the logging library does is print it with every

484
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,320
log message. If you just do that, your microservices architecture is like way easier. And

485
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:09,360
I think that Google did something, some of that with dapper, they all went, of course,

486
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,760
way more advanced, right? Or whatever. But like you said, it's like just a few little things can

487
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,120
make it a system so much more observable. Nice. So Matt, I saw from your LinkedIn that you,

488
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,360
uh, went to school in Georgia. Are you still in that part of the country?

489
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:27,520
I actually moved to the Bay area and, uh, okay. But you moved back. Yeah, I did. I moved back

490
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,280
actually right before COVID. I moved back. I like to tell everybody that it was my pre,

491
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,320
foreknowledge of what was going to happen in the world, like a month later, because I moved

492
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:40,320
back like a month before it all hit. Uh, but that's not true. That's not true. Uh,

493
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,600
that's just the way I tell, um, uh, actually I moved back to Atlanta because my, my, uh,

494
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,400
I went to Georgia. I met my wonderful wife who is definitely the brains of this outfit in this

495
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,360
house. She's the brains of this outfit. And she, uh, uh, she wanted to be near her family and her,

496
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:00,800
you know, uh, her family. And I'll tell you with COVID changing the landscape, even post,

497
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,360
I mean, I don't know if we're post COVID, but it's, you know, it's died down.

498
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:08,160
We may never be post COVID. Exactly. Um, but with it being less top of mind for folks,

499
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,760
you know, it's the, the environment's changed a lot. Like, uh, in Atlanta, it's, uh, there's a,

500
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,960
there's a startup scene here and there wasn't when I left, when I left for the Bay area,

501
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,920
you had to go to the Bay area. If you want to be taken seriously, that's, it's true.

502
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,720
Atlanta has a, not just startup, Atlanta has a growing texting. Yeah. You,

503
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,680
yeah. Callenly, like I have employees in it in Atlanta. We're building up a whole

504
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,560
new development center there. Once a month, I bring up, I bring up a topic to my boss.

505
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,480
When are we getting an office in Atlanta? It's a great place. You should come here.

506
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,080
It's awesome. Uh, the great, one of the great things that Atlanta is you got Georgia tech

507
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:48,080
right here and you got UGA, which is a pretty good engineering school. Georgia tech is a great

508
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,960
engineering school and it's kind of an untapped resource, right? And so like you said, Microsoft's

509
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,280
got a, uh, you know, building, you know, across the, you know, over the, over our major highway

510
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,640
here, 75 Google's here and I think Amazon is expanding their presence. And you know, the,

511
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,880
there's other thing is that there are real legitimate startups. So like, if you think about

512
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,800
like where you get ignition and a tech scene, I don't claim to be an expert on this, but like,

513
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,320
you know, we're like the fire starts to go a little bit. You need the big companies with

514
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,000
all the really smart people, you know, learning best practices, how to do stuff,

515
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,520
the Microsoft's, the Google's, the, you know, all those different folks. And then you need

516
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,800
kind of like the money, right? Frankly, the, you need the VCs and the money. And then you need

517
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,120
kind of, you need just a few people who've gotten that taste where they've had an exit,

518
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:34,800
like full or not an exit, but at least gotten big, like full story or Calendly.

519
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,400
Again, these are not, they're not huge companies, but they're unicorns. I mean, they're, they're

520
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,480
doing pretty, you know, a sales off pin drop. There's, there's some, I'm here and then you

521
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,360
get a taste of that. And with those three combos, people start to go, Hey, you know,

522
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,720
I could go do this. You know, why, why would I be the next Jeff Jeff Bezos or whatever,

523
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,760
you know, Bill Gates or, you know, it's like, I could do that. And so it's pretty exciting

524
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,280
time here. And then when you get enough of these startups and then with attrition, so to start,

525
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,920
start crossbreeding and creating new things, it then starts to take on a, its own spirit of its own.

526
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:14,080
Yeah. The VC, the VC thing, that's probably the biggest blocker. I know Bay Area. I mean,

527
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,760
it's just chock full riddle with, with tech VCs. I don't know. Maybe, maybe start doing something

528
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:25,840
with Coca-Cola. I'd be something to get it growing. I'll say there's a story from Reed Hoffman in the

529
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:31,680
Alliance. He talks from LinkedIn talks about don't have the world anymore of where we work for one

530
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:36,240
company for 30 or 40 years and then retire people change jobs. And I think change people

531
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,800
changing jobs is actually a good thing. I survived to Microsoft for so long for two reasons.

532
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,440
One was I changed jobs every 18 months or two years, something I always denied to Brent until

533
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,040
he proved me I was, he was right. But also for the first big chunk of my career at Microsoft,

534
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:56,400
there really wasn't another place to go. There wasn't a lot of, or the kind of the level I was,

535
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,800
there was, wasn't a lot of other tech besides Microsoft, but now you can bounce all over the

536
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,840
place. Atlanta, same thing. There's a, there's a place for you to grow. And I think there's

537
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,640
value. I think it's good when someone goes from one company to the other. You don't have to

538
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,640
worry so much about, Oh my gosh, we lost all year. Everything we trained you on we lost. Well,

539
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,120
you still got value from that. And cause it's a light, it's a partnership. And I think Atlanta

540
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,880
is ripe for that. And just, I've met so many smart people from there. I'm just excited to watch it

541
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,800
grow. And I want to get the darn unity office in Atlanta ASAP. JR, if you're listening, do it.

542
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,720
Come on down. It's great. The weather's not so great right now. That's the one thing I miss

543
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,200
about the Bay area. I'm going to, I'm not going to lie. It was, my car said it was 98 degrees

544
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,000
and I'm pretty sure that's because it got so hot that the thermometer broke.

545
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,920
Yeah. My, my car said 98 degrees here in Seattle today.

546
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,120
Okay. Well, there you go. Yeah. It's, it's starting close to that right now.

547
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,960
We don't, we don't get the Atlanta humidity though.

548
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,040
No, Atlanta's got great weather most of the year, but yeah,

549
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,240
there's a few months where it gets a little rougher, you know, but hey, it gets away in the

550
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,200
East Bay and California too. So, you know, it's all right, then I, this was actually before we end

551
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,800
here, anything else you want to add about the company? Anything else you wanted to shout out

552
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,640
today? Are you, are you on Twitter regularly? You want to give a handle there? I can include

553
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,920
or anything like that. I'm not on Twitter that regularly, but it's Matthew LeRae.

554
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,920
You can find me, you can find my company on Twitter, speed scale,

555
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,200
Inc. You can, yeah, LinkedIn, Twitter. Yeah, that's good.

556
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,520
All right. Our listeners generally like to stalk people that come on the show. So it's good to

557
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,640
give them a few clues to start with. Okay. Then follow me on Twitter because I, I, I definitely,

558
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:39,680
I definitely post there regularly as of the, all the time. I'm religious about Twitter.

559
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,560
As of today. Yeah. Right now. I'm going to post right now.

560
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,440
All right. Thank you again for being on, being on our podcast today. Hope you had fun. It was very

561
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,880
informative for me and man, it got my head thinking harder than it normally does on a Friday afternoon.

562
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,640
So thank you. So actually before we close, like for, for our list, Brent with one more

563
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:09,280
tangents with our listeners, like what's the ideal customer to come and engage with speed scale?

564
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:13,600
Right. Obviously you have expertise around Kubernetes. So if you're on containers,

565
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,960
you're doing microservices, come talk to us. Yeah. Yeah. What's your pitch?

566
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,320
So we help all companies of all sizes, right? Here's the thing. If you got like three,

567
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:28,480
one of three problems, right? Let's say you're trying to move to a container system like

568
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,320
Kubernetes, you're trying to migrate there or you're trying to learn about it. You should

569
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,600
talk to us because we will help you not like, like have the quick way to test, to validate

570
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,760
your software and test it. And so if you're making that migration, talk to us. The second

571
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,680
thing is, is if you are fed up with your cloud spend on your, in your, like your integration and

572
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:53,200
development test environments, come talk to us because our little mocking engines, right,

573
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,840
are super efficient, too super tight. And they can replace huge tests, integration test environments

574
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:01,600
with tiny little containers. So if you want to save some money on that, give us a shout.

575
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,080
And the third thing is, is that if you, if you hate writing tests, then you're,

576
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,320
you're definitely our people. And if you're all three, yeah, that's even better. Yeah.

577
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,600
Perfect. Thank you. All right. Thanks everyone. All right, everybody. This is Alan. I'll see you

578
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,000
soon. Goodbye. Thanks everybody. Thanks, Alan. Thanks.
