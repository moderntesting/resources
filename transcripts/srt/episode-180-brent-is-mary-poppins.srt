00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,420
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,850
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:23,650
I thought I'd just be quiet at the beginning and see if Brent said anything.

6
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,650
I was ready.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,650
I know.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,650
Hey everyone.

9
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,090
Welcome to the ABC testing podcast.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,530
Our special guest chat GPT is not attending today.

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,370
Um, maybe next time, maybe next time, but always for there for inspiration.

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,690
I was surprised someone actually grabbed one of my quotes out of the podcast and tweeted

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,530
it something about your chat GPT is my collaborator, which it is my friend.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,170
Unfortunately in my life and where I'm at in the world and post pandemic chat GPT is

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,870
likely my best friend.

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,730
And you can take that to be just about as sad as it sounds.

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,290
I got a couple of things.

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,050
Maybe before we get into that, um, is there anything new, exciting?

19
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,890
Oh, let's talk about in terms of, in terms of friends, are you still employed?

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,010
I am still employed.

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,010
Awesome.

22
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:24,020
Um, I will say that one thing that's interesting on that one, uh, not surprising to you

23
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:32,060
in some regards to GPT is a great ally friend to, to data scientists and everyone around

24
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,060
the world.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:41,660
Uh, but if you are running a data science team and you specialize in NLP, GPT also represents

26
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,860
a great threat to your value proposition.

27
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,340
I always be prepared to find a new value proposition.

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,340
Nobody's.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
Oh yeah.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,340
Yeah.

31
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:56,620
I mean, I've been hearing about jobs going away due to computer programs, whether it's

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:05,020
automation or AI for as long as I've been in tech, yet people seem, most people seem to

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,820
remain deployed and move and shift as needed.

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,500
The thing I'm doing right now, I'm kind of dumb with AI.

35
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,380
I'm kidding, but I'm speaking on behalf of our listeners.

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,620
It's going to move hot and fast, right?

37
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,180
Our listeners, you should expect to hear about it for a while because things are, are still

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,140
going very hot and fast.

39
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:38,060
But for me, I kind of treat this very similarly to how I did, how I treated it when we made

40
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,980
the last transition and probably the one before that.

41
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,980
No.

42
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:49,270
So I kind of think of it very similarly to, to discussions we knew and I had when it

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,870
was very clear to both you and I, right?

44
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,350
That no, like the metaphor I use is, is test is like a chicken that just got its head cut

45
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,350
off.

46
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,480
From afar, it doesn't look dead, but it's dead.

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,480
Right.

48
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:12,000
We, we saw, we noticed that the momentum is now unstoppable.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Test is going away at Microsoft.

50
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,600
We both predicted this very accurately.

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,810
I don't remember your situation in particular, but I do know that.

52
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,810
That was fine.

53
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,810
No, I mean, in terms of, so I predicted it and I remember predicting it and saying, oh

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,650
yeah, it's absolutely going to happen in the next three years.

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,570
Welcome to episode 23 of the AB testing podcast.

56
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,170
Right.

57
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,050
I was wrong on that.

58
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,530
I mean, my prediction was correct.

59
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,530
Not that much.

60
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,730
But it happened in one year, not three.

61
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,730
Yeah.

62
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,370
And, and I'm kind of feeling the same thing right now.

63
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:57,230
So very similar to what I did in test as I started investing myself and my team in a direction

64
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:09,130
where we are still strong, but doesn't try to live in a world where GPT doesn't succeed

65
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,690
in mastering NLP.

66
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,130
Let me, I don't, I don't want to have this conversation yet again.

67
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:19,890
I will talk about the metaphor and it, it is very similar.

68
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,690
And what happened when companies moved away from having dedicated testers and were very

69
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,010
successful on it is that those that.

70
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,570
Grasped on to the moving car when I'm, my metaphors are going out the window here,

71
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,570
but those who survived and did very well and thrived in that change were the ones who

72
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,690
embraced the change and figure out, okay, we're trying to move faster.

73
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,930
I'm going to figure out how to help the team move faster, accelerate the achievement,

74
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:54,650
shippable quality, the people who are just, just, I just want to do algorithms all day

75
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,130
and blah, blah, blah.

76
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,210
It's really kind of a fixed mindset, right?

77
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,730
Same with the old testers fixed mindset, digging their heels in.

78
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,570
I do one thing.

79
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,090
I do one thing only.

80
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,570
If you embrace it, if you use AI to enhance what you do and what you do is an AI,

81
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,810
you bring value to the team using ML and AI tools.

82
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,050
You can still do that in a different way using some of these tools to help you

83
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,050
embrace it, lean in, have an open mind, and you'll be successful.

84
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,650
And this is true across any one of 50,000 different similar transitions.

85
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,650
People, I mean, you can go back in business magazines back to the fifties

86
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,170
and you'll find people saying, ooh, business automation is going to get rid of

87
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,330
the need for blah.

88
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,290
And it did kind of, but what it did was it enabled people to do really cool things.

89
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,090
I remember back in 1997 or so, driving to work, listening to KISW before it

90
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,370
turned into a crappy station and someone called in and was like, hey, I'm working

91
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,010
it wherever and we have some mechanical machines coming in.

92
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,650
I'm going to take my job away.

93
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,450
I heard that and I heard, yeah, you can look at it like that.

94
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,570
Yeah, I was going to take my job away.

95
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,970
What's really going to happen is that it's going to give you time to do

96
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,690
something more interesting than moving part A from shelf A to shelf B all day

97
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,050
long. So anyway, let's talk about something far, far more interesting.

98
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,690
Okay.

99
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,880
Let's talk about me.

100
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,400
I just kidding.

101
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,560
I thought it was a good transition.

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,360
I'm going to go back and forth between old job and new job a little bit.

103
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,080
I already have people on, I should get to my new gig, my NBC Universal gig here

104
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,280
in a second, not go too deep into it, but I already have people, including my

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,410
boss. Well, I'm not sure what's worse.

106
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,250
Brent interrupting me with the NBC chimes or Brent talking with his hands

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,050
completely covering his mouth.

108
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,450
I'll let you all figure it out.

109
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,090
So many people, including my boss, listen to the podcast.

110
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,450
Got to be careful what I say.

111
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,170
My boss is on your new team.

112
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,130
Yeah. And don't and Steve, turn the mic off.

113
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,810
He just a raging idiot.

114
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,210
I'm kidding.

115
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,740
He's actually really good.

116
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,580
I should, I should drop a link to his blog sometime, which I'm on the podcast

117
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,380
sometime now. Now I was going to give him an idea.

118
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,260
Oh God. Anyway, but before you get there, so Steve,

119
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:32,730
Steve open invite anytime you are welcome on the podcast.

120
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,330
So unfortunately I read in the news this week and then a bunch of people

121
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,610
reached out to me.

122
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,170
Actually I saw, I found out about it.

123
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,180
Unity did its third round of layoffs in a year.

124
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,980
So they had cut from about 8,000 now down to about 7,000 employees in a year.

125
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:56,100
Do some math, figure out that, or that percentages it's a, it's 12.5% whatever.

126
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,940
And so that's tough.

127
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,060
And all the management books tell you everything you study says,

128
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,820
you got to do the, if you have to do layoffs and there's lots of studies

129
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:11,340
that say layoffs don't even do much for the bottom line, but do one deep cut.

130
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,340
These three semi deep shallow cuts is, is really rough on my routes.

131
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,580
I feel really bad for my old employees, but then they did a thing I kind of want

132
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,620
to talk about a little bit and that one of the things that, okay,

133
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,370
here's a weird thing.

134
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,930
When I decided I was ready to look for a new job,

135
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,810
I was ready for it to be a six month, the 12 month search.

136
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:37,430
Cause I wanted to be picky and there was a bunch of things I wanted.

137
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,060
I wanted a manager. I liked, yes, Steve, I like you.

138
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:44,980
I wanted to people I liked working with Steve, please don't tell the people on the

139
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,660
team. I like working with them and I'm ready for that yet. And then three,

140
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,460
I wanted a product that I'm interested in.

141
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,460
And the cool thing working at NBC universal is I get a chance to learn really

142
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,940
a whole new technology, not in the, in the stack or the stack site enough.

143
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,980
Yeah. But I get a chance to learn a little bit more how broadcast media

144
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,900
works, just kind of interesting. By the way,

145
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,780
I was in Los Angeles for a couple of days this week.

146
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,460
Steve took me on a golf cart trip around the back loss of NBC universal.

147
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,060
I drove through the set of the good place and wisteria lane,

148
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,180
we're just for housewives was and saw that we're the Bates hotel from psycho.

149
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Lots of cool stuff. Anyway, rewind the stack. And I wanted after working at a

150
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,980
globally distributed company and many, many time zones of work and sometimes

151
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,660
doing two of the same meeting in a day, which I didn't mind it.

152
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,180
I liked it. I like engaging with the team,

153
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,100
but it was starting to burn me out.

154
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,820
We talked about that a few times ago.

155
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,780
The other thing I wanted was I was getting beginning to get some push to go

156
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,420
back to the office at unity. They wanted to go, well,

157
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,180
let's get the leaders to go in three times a week. And I remember our,

158
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,620
well, so they use his name. I won't use his name. A,

159
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,180
a people leader at unity who I don't have a lot of respect for due to

160
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,580
previous, the previous interactions with him to unity came into the office.

161
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,580
One day, first time I'd ever seen him in the office to ask us if we'd,

162
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,580
he might've been even been on zoom to ask the leaders in the Seattle office.

163
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,220
If we start going in three times a week. And I told him,

164
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,180
I've been coming in three times a week out of me being a little sick of home

165
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,300
for a long time and hasn't made a difference. I don't think this is going to

166
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,140
happen.

167
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,820
Gave all kinds of feedback on how none of the teams were in one spot and

168
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:30,180
blah, blah, blah. And it was just weird.

169
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,380
And that was some part of what I wanted to do when I joined a company was join a

170
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,540
team that was largely or fully remote and our engineering team,

171
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,980
although some people go to offices, if they're near one,

172
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,220
it is basically fully remote, which is no,

173
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,340
there's no requirement to go to the office. It means I get to work.

174
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,060
The times when I have a meeting,

175
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,620
when there's that weird hybrid thing,

176
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,500
when you have all your little zoom or teams windows,

177
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,780
let's come back to that too. And you have person, person, person,

178
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,660
whole group of people is really, really rare. It's generally,

179
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,060
I've maybe seen it once. So it's one person. So anyway, that's really cool.

180
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,900
So all those things just kind of came together very quickly when NBCU contacted

181
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,260
me. I got all the three P's of people, the person, the product.

182
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,660
I got some of the, the sort of intangibles I wanted around fully remote work.

183
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,500
And it all kind of worked out much quicker than I had planned.

184
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,580
And here I am a couple of things to drill in along the road.

185
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,900
There is, oh,

186
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:29,300
the reason I brought up unity is not only the layoff 600 people,

187
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,620
but in the same swipe of the knife,

188
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,140
they said that everyone at the company, this is heck, this is hurt.

189
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,780
I haven't heard it from unity leadership. I've heard it from people reaching out

190
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,660
going, Hey, this sucks.

191
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:44,020
What do you think is that they're requiring people to go to the office three

192
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,380
days a week from now on, actually starting at some date in the near future,

193
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,540
which I think I'm curious to hear your opinion on this,

194
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,100
maybe compared to Microsoft, but I think I'm, I was going to say horrible.

195
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,580
I think it's kind of idiotic unless they're trying to get people to quit.

196
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,580
What Microsoft is still full.

197
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,180
Can you, you can still be fully remote at Microsoft. Is that correct?

198
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,820
Oh yeah. It's, I would say right now,

199
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,460
Microsoft is going in the opposite direction of that.

200
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,540
The, um,

201
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,340
please don't come in. It's cheaper for us when you work at home, right?

202
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,860
Well, they're never, they're, they're not going to mention it that way.

203
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,150
Right. I, my career, I, I,

204
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,430
I fill in the parts that people say quietly. I say the quiet parts out loud.

205
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:38,180
What is happening is certainly we,

206
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,180
it's it's public that Microsoft is not renewing the lease on any of its

207
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,060
lease buildings. Correct. Right. So that's public.

208
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,820
What we can also see is there is a,

209
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:55,820
there is a large sentence. Like I can look, as you know,

210
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,820
I come into my office every day and I have been doing so for the last several

211
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,820
years, all but one month of COVID and parking lots empty.

212
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,260
And so there's some rationale to,

213
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,460
to Microsoft being able to do that. Yeah, of course.

214
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,060
I would say Microsoft could look at,

215
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,780
they could turn into a lease or at least some of their buildings to other people

216
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,500
at some point. I'm not sure the security implications around that,

217
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,780
but that could be done. I think across the campus,

218
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,580
my gut is that there are buildings,

219
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,820
a whole bunch of buildings, no more than a quarter full.

220
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,460
For sure. I,

221
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,500
I would be surprised if there's any building that's a quarter full.

222
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,020
Yeah. The one thing though, team cohesion,

223
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I would say certainly I haven't discovered the secret to it.

224
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,590
I do miss team cohesion. I miss the work benefits.

225
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,660
I miss the personal benefits of having the team there and working together.

226
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:09,500
Do you remember once upon a time when I asked you like a question,

227
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,780
a yes or no question of does Microsoft require people to go back to work?

228
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,860
So the answer is no. It doesn't, no. And here's the deal. I think,

229
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:21,380
you know, I don't know what's inside of you news executives minds. Uh,

230
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,620
but there is, I get where they're coming from a little bit.

231
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,020
There's something that you get when people are together that you don't,

232
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,940
that many teams don't generally get when they're all in their homes.

233
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,300
My goal, what drives me and what I'm,

234
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,620
I think I'm making some progress on it.

235
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,020
What I'm always thinking of as a manager is how do I do that?

236
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,860
How do I build team cohesion?

237
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,700
How do I get a team to work together when they're not all hanging out one place?

238
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,680
I think what has happened over the last,

239
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,080
has it been 25 years since COVID hit? I can't quite remember.

240
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,110
I've lost track of time. So in the last, uh, three or 25 years is that we have

241
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,790
meetings and maybe even more meetings,

242
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,870
which is odd because there's two things we screwed up on.

243
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,270
One is in our meetings, all we ever talk about is work.

244
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,390
I shouldn't say we as too big of a generalization.

245
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,190
If you don't change anything,

246
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,750
you have zoom meetings or teams meetings and all we ever talk about is work.

247
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,730
We never get fun or can we just talk about stuff? Can we goof off together?

248
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,890
So one thing to do is make it,

249
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,290
we had a discussion in the Slack group this week about the same thing.

250
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,210
What do you do about remote teams? One of the three.slack.com,

251
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,330
you can go to moderntesting.org and get a link.

252
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:43,530
I will try and keep it up to date. It's not up to date.

253
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,410
You can yell at me, but don't always talk about meetings.

254
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,170
There's things like take the first five minutes of every meeting just for people

255
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,970
to either show up late or just have hallway talk, whatever,

256
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,170
but also is focused on async work.

257
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,290
Not every decision needs a meeting.

258
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:02,970
Not every design needs a meeting.

259
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:08,220
Collaborate as much as you can asynchronously and just embrace,

260
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,900
like embrace the fact that we're not all getting back together and focus more

261
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,900
on it. So where many organizations I feel have failed here is giving managers

262
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,580
and teams the education because they don't know it's all right.

263
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,100
And there's so little experimenting because they're driving people to get stuff

264
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,980
done to get, uh,

265
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,700
give people a chance of being successful in a fully remote world.

266
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,340
I think a lot of times people haven't done that.

267
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,700
So if the managers to figure it out,

268
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,420
the managers don't try to figure it out.

269
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,700
If they don't think it's their job to figure it out,

270
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,900
it can get really boring really fast.

271
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,420
The issue as I see it,

272
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,860
I do wish my team would come in more often in terms of,

273
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,140
of the, the requirements.

274
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,020
So why don't you require them to come to work three days a week?

275
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,260
Yeah. But then that's not going to work.

276
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,060
That's a real question. Tell me why it doesn't work.

277
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,340
I understand the rationale around unity making the decision, right?

278
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:05,300
The benefit they're trying to achieve. Unfortunately, uh, and I,

279
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,020
and I know you agree with this.

280
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,580
The way they approached it is going to guarantee they don't achieve the

281
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,300
benefits they were seeking.

282
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,580
Yeah, it's unfortunate.

283
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,100
Right. It's no, you have to,

284
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,500
if you want that the benefits of that you get from the team being co-located,

285
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,060
you either have to completely pull the sweat, right?

286
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,780
Very similar to what you were just saying before, right?

287
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,140
You basically do an Elon Musk type of thing and you're like, Hey,

288
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,820
from here on out, everyone is required back at work every day.

289
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,060
Right. And then yeah,

290
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,060
you're going to go through a difficult period and then people will renormalize or

291
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,820
you have to create, you have to make,

292
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,060
you have to create a motivation or an incentive such that it's their choice and

293
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,660
they would prefer. Yeah. Carrots versus sticks.

294
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,500
Exactly. If you're going to do a stick, the stick has to be,

295
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,300
has to be, has to hit hard and fast and then be over very similar to the

296
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,460
layoff situation. But if you're not, then it's got to be in the carrot.

297
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,620
Although I would prefer a cupcake carrot suck.

298
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,980
So one thing I put a pin in, I want to talk about.

299
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,140
So I have a whole bunch of stuff about work we could talk about,

300
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,060
but let's see, you know, we used to do this session like Alan at Unity.

301
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,220
What have you learned? We'll do a little bit here in a moment.

302
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,380
But one thing I got to tell you, so remember,

303
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,220
it's such a different situation from when I left Microsoft to Microsoft.

304
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,260
I was on this really toxic team, so I was really bitter about it.

305
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,140
And I give you a bad time about it a lot, but you told me Satya is making it

306
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,140
better. And I actually do believe you decide to be giving you a bad time.

307
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,340
I wasn't going to use and I still haven't used the Bing chat thing you suggest

308
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
to me, but I didn't use it because I don't run windows because who does.

309
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,860
And but I found out they make edge for Mac because the Bing chat thing only

310
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,300
works on edge. So I'm going to try that out sometime.

311
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,140
I heard from one of my new directs that edge on Mac isn't so bad,

312
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,660
so I'll give it a shot. So the difference is that Unity is like,

313
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,540
my team was fricking awesome. I really, you know, it's a bunch of people.

314
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,420
I still really miss and I'm it's unfortunate in that situation.

315
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,540
Any of my anger at Unity is towards our executive leadership.

316
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,900
Just good people. It's just in some unfortunate circumstances.

317
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,860
But as I've mentioned on this podcast before,

318
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,660
other than visual studio code and my Xbox,

319
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,420
I did not use a Microsoft application from the day I left Microsoft it during

320
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,820
my entire run at Unity. And I'm very happy about that.

321
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,970
I didn't really miss it. So here I am working at NBCU and damn it,

322
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,130
if they don't use Microsoft apps,

323
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,850
I spend a chunk of my day on teams calls now and it's not so bad.

324
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,770
What the, what are you doing?

325
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,010
Brent is looking at me as tongues like, okay, so, uh,

326
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,890
okay teams, it's all right. It's all right. It's a little flakier.

327
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,210
Like sometimes when my camera dies, it's a little flakier,

328
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,610
but they're doing okay there. I'm not, it's, it's better.

329
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,770
I think they've replaced all the leadership on teams since I left probably at least

330
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,090
once. So it's doing all right. Uh,

331
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,770
the other thing is office apps.

332
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,290
They just feel cluttered to me.

333
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,980
Like you've been, you've been used to the Google version.

334
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,980
Yeah. And so they do and they don't.

335
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,980
So the apps feel cluttered. I spent, oh my God,

336
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,140
how much time trying to use PowerPoint the other day and it hurt.

337
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,260
I'm going to go back to keynote. Uh, I can't do it again.

338
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,940
Just trying to find where commands were and looking up things on the web.

339
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,540
It's just, I think to me, PowerPoint is just awful.

340
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,940
Word I kind of like Excel's, you know, good. Um,

341
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,140
I don't use most of the features of it and, and, but it's, it's,

342
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,460
I can handle it. Outlook on Mac is lacking.

343
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,740
That's a good way of putting it. So what I found is for, uh,

344
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,060
mail and calendar, I don't know if you do,

345
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,500
I don't know if the, what the outlet client for windows is like,

346
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,820
but for Mac it's not good. So I use,

347
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,620
and I'm pretty happy with just using the web web version of Outlook and calendar

348
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,860
and I'm, and I'm pretty happy with those. It's, you know,

349
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,780
it's not my favorite, but I'm making it work.

350
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,220
But here I am after six years of making fun of all your Microsoft crap.

351
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,180
And now I got to use it every day. Cause we all have to pay our penance.

352
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,380
I don't know what to do. It's,

353
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,320
it's you'll renormalize in, in no time.

354
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,520
I remember when I finally, when I finally gave up on the windows phone,

355
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,720
right? I'm like, no, I'm going to support our company.

356
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,880
And I finally gave up on windows phone and it took me maybe 15 minutes with the

357
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,920
app store on, on my, on my Samsung,

358
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,080
Android obviously. Uh, and I'm like, yeah,

359
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,400
that was a poor decision. Yeah. That was a poor decision.

360
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,000
Windows phone is a great story about Microsoft.

361
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,690
Windows phone was actually a really good phone. Uh,

362
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,450
the way it was set up, it was a good phone UI. It was a good phone.

363
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,370
Microsoft's ego got in their way.

364
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,100
That wasn't Microsoft's ego was bombers ego.

365
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,700
The bomber years were pretty devastating to, to,

366
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,500
to Microsoft. The, as a phone, the Microsoft phone was very, very,

367
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,940
it was actually really good.

368
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,460
The frustrating part of the windows phone was there were hardly any apps available

369
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,900
for, that's what makes phones is the apps. And not only that, but if,

370
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,740
I don't know if you recall this, but a lot of times when I shipped over to Android

371
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,940
and started re-installing my apps on Android, same apps, a lot of them,

372
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,820
plus some new ones, cause it had, you know, a hundred times as many, uh,

373
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,460
some of the apps that I'd use forever on windows phone and use on Android,

374
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,220
they actually had more features on Android. It's like, Oh my God,

375
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,540
what have I missing out on? And I've been using Apple phone now more.

376
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,780
I have Apple phone for work and an iPhone also called an iPhone. Yes.

377
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,620
And same as true as there, the,

378
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,900
the iPhone has maybe not as many apps in the long tail,

379
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,580
but there's a lot of apps that are iPhone only.

380
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,420
And some of the apps have more features in their Android counterparts.

381
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,060
I remember, I remember playing with Linux in the late nineties,

382
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,820
mid to late nineties at Microsoft and me saying out loud and getting laughed

383
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,820
at was Microsoft should make a windows 95 shell from Linux and they should have.

384
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,820
And I said the same thing with windows phone in the early 2000s,

385
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,820
we should write this shell to run on Android.

386
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,350
No, that ever happened because nobody listens to me and whatever,

387
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,230
but I honestly think imagine this. What if windows phone,

388
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:29,870
that shell ran on Android OS?

389
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,150
I think it'd be a very good phone. I think that I liked that tile approach,

390
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,910
but who knows? I don't know.

391
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,030
Yeah. No, the, uh, I don't see you said you have an iPhone or so on Android.

392
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,070
There's this component called the, the launcher. Are you familiar with that?

393
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,310
Yep.

394
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:52,310
It's kind of the thing that defines the sort of look and feel of the whole

395
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,990
thing. Well, there is this thing called the Microsoft launcher for Android.

396
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:04,710
And that is one of the top rated launchers for all of Android.

397
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,470
I don't currently use that's the,

398
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,190
that's the launcher I use just because of,

399
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:16,310
I really like how it organizes.

400
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,790
Yeah, that's interesting. My apps amongst everything else. Uh,

401
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,070
there is a launcher we, you could, you, and then maybe even this one,

402
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,470
I just may have forgotten it,

403
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:31,910
but there is a launcher where you can scan Android to look like the old windows

404
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,110
look. I believe it. Okay. Yeah. Oh well. I mean, but now it's for free.

405
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,430
Microsoft could have made some, could have done a little bit better.

406
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,830
I don't think it made money. They could have gained some customers.

407
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:47,230
There was a time I also said that, uh, Microsoft should stop. Here's,

408
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,310
here's the other suggestion I gave a little more out there. Take all the,

409
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,830
oh my God, I have so many stories about windows phone developers,

410
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,550
but the one thing I said, stop developing windows phone,

411
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,710
take all of those, whatever it was, like 400 developers working on it,

412
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,110
have them all right. Apps for Android and iOS will make more money that way

413
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:11,150
than them windows phone. I still think I would have been right,

414
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,550
but no. And I remember when I worked on Arcadia,

415
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,310
the stupid science project to make Android apps run on windows phone,

416
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,550
which is actually super easy.

417
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,790
I remember biting my tongue and sometimes laughing out loud when I'd be in a

418
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,950
meeting with these, these developers that worked on windows phone,

419
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,870
remember windows phone as far as I'm concerned was a complete nutter flop.

420
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,720
Uh, it was, I think we, I think if I recall,

421
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,640
not as much as Ken, which you've had stories on,

422
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:40,080
but I remember being in these meetings and those developers,

423
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,400
we, because a bunch of those folks moved over to this Arcadia team and those

424
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,960
developers were so,

425
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,120
this is the thing that Microsoft had I'll say had at the time,

426
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,680
maybe different now, bomber years. I think out of the bomber years,

427
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,400
it was expected that to get ahead,

428
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,720
you must have a very large ego and show it off daily.

429
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,960
I remember so many times those folks would say,

430
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,440
we try to make a decision. They say, well on windows phone, what we did,

431
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,960
and I'm thinking now I wanted to say out loud,

432
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,160
whatever you do on windows phone, whatever you did,

433
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,040
let's do the exact opposite. Let's everything you did.

434
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,760
Let's do the other thing and see if it sucks less.

435
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
You're like, thank you for your feedback.

436
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,840
I just facepalmed, rub my eyebrow off and, um,

437
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,160
waited for the drugs to kick in. Oh my God.

438
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,480
But you remember that ego. So here's, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

439
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,840
And you can let me know what it was like in Microsoft now. And oh my gosh,

440
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,280
I get to work with Microsoft people now because of Azure and GitHub,

441
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,040
which is kind of Microsoft and other Microsoft things we use.

442
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,280
It's not kind of Microsoft. I know. Well,

443
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:51,610
it depends how the acquisition goes. Sometimes Microsoft, it depends.

444
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,410
Sometimes you leave stuff alone for longer. I mean,

445
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,730
is LinkedIn is Microsoft kind of, it's still pretty separate.

446
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,650
That's it's the windows organization is

447
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,730
still pretty set. Okay. Fine, fine, fine.

448
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:12,050
The point I wanted to bring up is other than those execs who happen to come from

449
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,770
Microsoft via Amazon, Unity was great.

450
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:18,530
There weren't egos getting in the way of good work. It was easy to do good work.

451
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,450
I noticed the same thing at NBCU. There aren't, Oh my God,

452
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,810
I have to tell you this as I hate that Steve listens to this podcast,

453
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,430
but I'll get over it because one great thing he did,

454
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,450
and I may have mentioned this before,

455
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,330
he set me up with like 30 people to go talk to.

456
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,410
You know how you always give the new hires people to go meet.

457
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,170
He gave me a massive list and 90% of the people,

458
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,970
no matter what their level were said, if you have any questions,

459
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,530
anything at all reach out anytime. We'll help you out. Imagine that.

460
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,770
Imagine me meeting a bunch of Microsoft execs back in the day,

461
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,330
maybe 10 years ago in that time. And how many of them would say that?

462
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:02,170
None. So that's the difference that I really, really like. I like working.

463
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,690
I mean, this isn't a hard, this is a little bit of a tautology, maybe.

464
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:08,530
I like working with people I like.

465
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,450
Yeah. I think you mean more than that though. I don't,

466
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:18,650
I don't miss that old model. I really don't, right? I kind of like,

467
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:23,850
I do like the fact that the more of the in point micro service service model,

468
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,740
the world that we're in right now has,

469
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:32,340
has almost killed the bet the farm mentality,

470
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,220
which bred these egotistical bastards who,

471
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,740
who would win arguments back in the old days when,

472
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,740
when no one had the data to dispute it, they would stand up.

473
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,260
I have been here for 15 years and they leverage BS background stories.

474
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,940
Yeah. Yeah.

475
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,660
I don't know.

476
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,460
Programming and cobalt or you were still waiting in the bed. I'm right.

477
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,020
You're wrong. Go back to school.

478
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:08,460
Yeah. And the thing is with, with the way the world functions now, yeah,

479
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:12,340
those people aren't really surviving as well as they used to.

480
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
Cause that wasn't the case. Remember when I left,

481
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,820
it was a weird place where Microsoft was growing up.

482
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,940
We had all these people that had been there 20 years or so just,

483
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
but who weren't,

484
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,500
who were still trying to do things the way they were 20 years ago.

485
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
And the one of my, that was one of my frustrations.

486
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,300
Yeah. And, and rightly so.

487
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,420
And I won't,

488
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,980
I won't look you in the eyes until you they're all gone. Right. Um,

489
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,660
the ones I've been paying attention to, I'll tell you,

490
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,900
there's only two of them left. It used to be like 20 and,

491
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,220
and right now the ones I'm paying attention to,

492
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,980
there's only two left because I will not mention names.

493
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,940
What are their initials? F U Frank.

494
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,360
All right. Okay. So you won't tell me, um, culture's getting better.

495
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,680
Culture is good here. I like working with people. I like, uh,

496
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
have we talked about anything at all substantial yet?

497
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Uh, we briefly talked about chat GPT.

498
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,260
I repeat my question. Yeah.

499
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:20,140
We, we, we talked about forced office

500
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,000
attendance. All right. Okay. That's a bad thing. Um,

501
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,560
and I do think, right. So,

502
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,710
so the thing is like you, you, uh,

503
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,950
the in-person and personal connections are difficult to

504
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,710
quantify, but invaluable.

505
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,070
Let me just maybe set up and discuss a little bit. Um,

506
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,790
I'm going to talk about where I'm at and what I'm doing.

507
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,460
I think it may set up some different discussions.

508
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,100
So those of you that have been listening to the podcast for a very, very,

509
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:55,540
very long time, know that when I first joined unity,

510
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,060
we would spend some chunk of time in the podcast. I would talk about, again,

511
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,540
this podcast is just two guys talking over beer,

512
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,300
although I'm drinking water and Brent's picking his nose and just talking about

513
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,100
what's going on in front of people.

514
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,860
That's the whole premise of the podcast in the first place. We don't,

515
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,740
we have vague agendas, but six years ago at unity,

516
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,380
we talked about what was going on in the team, what I was thinking,

517
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,660
what I was learning, what the metaphors I was seeing,

518
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,980
the cool stuff I was discovering.

519
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,100
I think we can do a little bit of that here while I figure stuff out.

520
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,900
So one cool thing that happened,

521
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,180
I did not have direct reports up until this week.

522
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,940
So I spent my first month or so without direct reports.

523
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,020
Well,

524
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,180
I met a bunch of people and figured everything out and learned the projects and,

525
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,160
but at this point I have a team. I know what work needs to get done.

526
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,840
Not going to go details aren't important. When you work on stuff, I, you could,

527
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,720
it's, if you work on an infrastructure or a platform group,

528
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,760
it's the stuff you imagine it's things around cloud optimization and migrations

529
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,800
from tool X to tool Y. That's what we do. Very, very, very high level.

530
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:03,160
So I'm at the stage now where it's, which I really, really like.

531
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,920
It's working with a team to teach them, not teach them,

532
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,680
working with a team to help them learn how to deliver more consistently.

533
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,080
And you and I have talked about this a lot.

534
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,440
This lines up well with the modern testing principles,

535
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:20,920
which, uh, as an aside that I don't want to get into,

536
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,680
but it's a long story, but, uh,

537
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,320
our buddy James Bach added a bunch of comments to different articles on a website.

538
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,720
That's about this to launch officially at soft launched about to launch next week.

539
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,920
There'll be a blurb on various social media from me,

540
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,880
but he replied about modern testing principles. And guess what he said, not,

541
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,320
not my post, somebody else went, another one of the three posted them and he

542
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,160
said, Hey, these aren't modern. These aren't about testing at all.

543
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,120
We should call these modern delivery principles. Yes. Yes, we should.

544
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,840
But, uh, I read

545
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,320
me toad. All right. Well, call, I, I,

546
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,560
I kind of agree because it prompts the discussion.

547
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,760
So welcome to the discussion, James. I think in one of those replies,

548
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,280
he actually makes the point that I saw him made somewhere else,

549
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,040
saw him make somewhere else, which I couldn't find last week,

550
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,640
which is that he cares about testing and not quality.

551
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,920
And that's fine. He can do that. So anyway,

552
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,480
we're going to learn modern testing principles, modern delivery principles,

553
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,720
which is let's figure out, I mean, it's really agile and lean.

554
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:31,000
How can we deliver? How can we be transparent about the way we deliver?

555
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,920
How can we be accountable?

556
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,840
How can we begin to build up safety in our organization? How,

557
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,640
and then going back a topic or two,

558
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,400
how can we work effectively together,

559
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,720
even though none of us are together and it'll take time.

560
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,760
I think that safety part, especially it's going to take months.

561
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,800
You never get to a point where you go, yes, I've flipped the switch.

562
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,840
This team is now psychologically safe.

563
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,840
It is a spectrum that all you can do is try and move forward on all the time.

564
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,880
So we'll work on that. The normal stuff.

565
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,800
I'm trying to get the team in place to execute, uh, just made,

566
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,280
just had someone accept an offer for a director reporting to me,

567
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,640
working in the tool space. I'm excited about that.

568
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,710
We'll get them ramped up when they start. So just in the forming stage,

569
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:24,150
I guess. So it's fun and a lot of work to do a lot of just a lot of people to learn.

570
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,470
And you know, which is hard because as all three listeners know,

571
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:34,630
I don't really like people, but I like it when people are successful.

572
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:39,270
So I sacrifice my dislike of people to help people be successful.

573
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,470
And that's kind of where we're at now,

574
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:44,270
but we should probably some things we should dive into at some point,

575
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,590
but Brett, you haven't changed jobs in a long time.

576
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,950
What do you think about all that? What do you think about like diving into the,

577
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,590
Oh God, I have to do five projects. I'd never thought about before with,

578
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:57,390
with a huge number of people I've never thought about before.

579
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:58,750
How do you feel about that?

580
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:04,030
So I am doing the former all of the time. That's, I thought about it.

581
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,350
You're right. The,

582
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,830
I am now in the job that I have been in for the

583
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,580
longest continuous period in my entire career. So new,

584
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:19,980
new people, new people, new team that actually might be nice.

585
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:25,300
So I've been on the team now for the longest I have in my entire

586
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,420
career, eight years, right?

587
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,180
Previous to that I was in exchange for five and then up until then really a max

588
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,760
of three, right? I kind of, I, I found it more,

589
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,720
I kind of viewed myself more like Mary Poppins. All right.

590
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,680
I kind of solve this team or the, what I can hear is time to go to someplace else.

591
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,120
But in this, in the team I'm on right now,

592
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,560
we are changing direction as a, as a, um,

593
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,960
all the time as a data scientist, right?

594
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,040
My job is to, to answer the, the,

595
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,760
the questions the business has now.

596
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,960
So I'm constantly having to adapt.

597
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,080
And unfortunately sometimes it ends up being an interrupt,

598
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,040
which I'm trying to remove because that has a negative consequence on the,

599
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:19,150
on my team itself. But we're,

600
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:24,150
we're constantly doing new new new projects. And, and as I mentioned at the

601
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,390
start of the podcast, right?

602
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,390
GPT is representing a non trivial threat to a set of services that my team has

603
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,230
done for a long time. And so it's always exciting. Like I,

604
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,910
I called it a threat, but that's,

605
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,750
that's not the perspective I'm taking. Anytime change happens,

606
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,350
there's always opportunity. You need to look for it,

607
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:49,750
which is what I'm doing. And I'm starting to converge on it and starting to get,

608
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,390
um, other attention, which will,

609
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,710
which will result in new interesting work.

610
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,030
So I'm curious cause I, I, I,

611
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:03,110
I don't know if you give a good answer. It wasn't really the question I asked.

612
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,950
Okay. I mean, you kind of justify, you do what you do. It has some overlap.

613
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,590
I think it's worth calling out and my, um, my,

614
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:16,590
my boss sometimes asks me if I'm ready to run away screaming and I sometimes

615
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:21,590
feel, but not really feel like it. A role like this is as I've talked to some

616
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:25,750
other folks about it is kind of not for the faint of heart.

617
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:30,430
Brand new team, lots of stuff to, a lot of things to do,

618
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,870
a lot of legacy to move past,

619
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:38,150
a lot of things to learn. It's kind of a role. I love,

620
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,580
I love to start from scratch, but I don't think that everyone does.

621
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,460
No. So I have never been afraid.

622
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:50,980
It's quite the opposite. A lot of people were like, when I,

623
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,140
when I become the head of a new team,

624
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,980
I love it internally. I love it.

625
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,810
When one of my leaders comes to me and says,

626
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,760
Brandon, I hear what you're saying, but that won't work here. I love it.

627
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm like, Oh yeah. You, you, you remember that you said that.

628
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,040
I'm a change agent and that,

629
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,440
that type of world is where change agents are like, okay,

630
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,320
there's a team that starts to change.

631
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,560
Have you ever done like a puzzle hunt or one of those kinds of things or even a

632
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,560
puzzle room where you, you know, there's a way out and actually you're,

633
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,560
and you're pretty confident because you've done one before maybe that you can

634
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,400
get out.

635
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,400
You don't know where to start and like my blog posts from a few weeks ago on

636
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,160
angry weasel.substack.com. You just start,

637
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,760
you find something,

638
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,820
you look at it and you figure out if it's a clue or not.

639
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,550
And maybe you come back to it later,

640
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,350
but that's kind of the organizational challenge. You look at things,

641
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,510
you trust, but verify you question,

642
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,510
you figure out if the smoke alarm was actually a fire and you just kind of poke

643
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,590
around till you make progress. And again, in a puzzle room,

644
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,750
you may be stuck. You may think you're stuck,

645
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,070
but you look back into the progress.

646
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,830
You'll, we must be getting somewhere.

647
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:12,590
You know,

648
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:17,590
we must be getting somewhere because I can see tangible progress I've made on

649
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,710
figuring stuff out. I just need to make a few more connections and I'll get into

650
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,350
the next room and start over again. I just made up this metaphor on the spot,

651
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,270
but I think it kind of works. And I like that.

652
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:30,470
I like not knowing where to start, but knowing,

653
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:35,710
but feeling at least semi confident that I can get to the end state and then

654
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,550
make a new,

655
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:42,750
to the end state and then make a new and then make a new end state,

656
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:46,830
but get to the end state. If I just begin and move forward.

657
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:52,430
The thing that I think is awesome about fresh eyes and right in this case,

658
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,950
your fresh eyes and your leadership, right? The thing,

659
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,390
old eyes,

660
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:05,230
the thing that's awesome about fresh eyes is you have not yet learned what can't

661
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,550
be done. Correct. It's all in front of me. And then the,

662
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:18,910
the combined that with a team that has learned what can't be done.

663
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:25,420
But if you remember way back in the, the 12 monkey story, not the,

664
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,740
the movie, but the one with the ladder where,

665
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,380
where there's a cultural thing set up and people are doing things that they

666
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:35,140
don't even remember why they're doing it that way anymore.

667
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,380
They just know it can't be done. They don't know why.

668
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,340
That's where someone with fresh eyes can can go, well, why are we doing this?

669
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,980
We don't know. Well, then let's just stop.

670
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:51,620
That is one of the reasons why I'm just, I think I told you,

671
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,530
I told you on this on the, on the podcast before,

672
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:59,290
like there was a team I was on years ago. It reminds me of this.

673
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,210
There was a team was on, I joined the team.

674
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:06,770
This was in the old school and they had shipped three products and had had their

675
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,620
build verification tests pass in six years.

676
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:18,640
And I'm like, what a bizarre problem. I was excited.

677
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,560
I went to my manager. I'm like,

678
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:25,600
I would absolutely love this problem because build verification tests are so

679
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,280
simple.

680
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:32,250
I'm kind of puzzled as to what your team,

681
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,770
what this team did to even make that possible. Right?

682
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,250
Yeah. I'd be, I'd be intentionally curious also. Yeah.

683
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:43,970
It's really hard to do this. I'm convinced of that.

684
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,970
It is much easier to get BBTs to pass them to go six years and have them not

685
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,850
pass. I would think so. So yeah. All right. Um,

686
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,080
let's call that a day, man. Cause I gotta go.

687
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,400
I do too. All right. Well, once again, I am.

688
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:04,600
Brant Jansen. No, I'm not. I'm, I'm Alan. I'm Brent.

689
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:10,210
Now we got it straight. Yeah, whatever. It's me. I'm the old age. All right.

690
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:13,130
See you man. It's like next week. Bye everybody. Thanks for listening. Bye.
