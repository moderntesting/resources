1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
To me, that's how you approach understanding and acquiring knowledge is one way is when

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,080
something causes you cognitive dissonance, you don't just chuck it away and call it bullshit.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,160
You try and figure out where that idea is coming from and what could make it true for

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:25,710
this other person in their context. Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,390
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,590
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now on with the show.

7
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,670
Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Alan.

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,660
And it is time for the AB testing podcast and happy new year. Holy crap. Happy new year, Brent.

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:55,580
Happy new year to you, Alan. Have you enjoyed 2023 thus far?

10
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,170
Yeah, 2023 has been good. Yeah, we can get into my 2023. It's been actually really good so far.

11
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:12,160
You know, nothing exciting, nothing new calendar. I wrote my five for Friday today. I remember to

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,200
put the right year on there. So I'm getting you after, you know, 57 years on the planet.

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,840
I've learned not all of those writing, but I've learned to I've learned that the year changes

14
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,580
once every 365 days or so. That's my big accomplishment. I don't know how's your new

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:39,170
year so far. You're 57. Man, you're old. Oh, I'm practically dead. Practically dead.

16
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,050
No, I knew you were older than me, but I didn't know that much.

17
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:49,580
No, I turned 57 in December. I think yes, I did. You did. Yeah. Yeah.

18
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,620
It's easy to do the math now because, you know, my daughter is a teenager who is almost exactly

19
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:03,870
40 years younger than me. If I forget how old I am, which is when you get this old, you do

20
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:07,390
sometimes have to think about what year is it and do the math. I just have to remember,

21
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,820
I know how old my daughter is. So I just add 40 to that generally works up for nine days out of

22
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:21,660
the year that works. That actually works for me and my daughter as well. Her birthday is New

23
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:32,780
Year's Eve. She just, the Jensen family household successfully added another teenager to society

24
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:41,500
on New Year's Eve 2022. So she's now 13. And in just a couple of months, I turned 53.

25
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,740
There you go. The math that's 40. Yeah. There's your trick for the year. Yeah. So episode 172,

26
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,100
I'm hoping, I'm going to work backward here. I'm hoping we have a few new listeners this time

27
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,740
because I want to talk about something I did to close out 2022.

28
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,860
Yeah, your clickbait post.

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,200
No. So I must give context and tell a story. I'm sure our listeners have seen this and

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,680
rolled their eyes and done their thing. But I'm hoping there's some people that I made mad.

31
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,520
We can really go back to the beginning here because oh my God, I didn't. Let me tell you

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,480
what happened. I was in Toronto for New Year's Eve with my son. We're up to Toronto for the

33
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,640
weekend. Had a blast. He was like sleeping in the afternoon as 19 year olds do. As a lot of our

34
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,360
readers know, I used to blog a lot. I stopped blogging. I have started blogging again. And I

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,630
did a post a couple of weeks ago where I said I'm just kind of talking about like what I've been

36
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,750
doing. I haven't really done testing in a long time. I know a lot about testing. I care far more

37
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,830
about quality than I do about testing these days, which apparently is a minority opinion.

38
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,350
But I made a comment in there about something like the usual thing we've been saying on this

39
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:13,550
podcast for seven years. Most software teams do not. You'll say all here. I will say most

40
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:20,030
software teams do not need dedicated testers. And then someone on LinkedIn said, can you elaborate

41
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:26,420
on that one? I said, great, I'll do a post on that. So I did. I sat there on my son was sleeping.

42
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,420
And let me explain my writing process. Do you understand the amount of editing and

43
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,620
structure and content and storyboards I do for my blog posts? I sit down, I write them

44
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:47,140
stream of consciousness and I press post. That is my, I will read through it once for edit. So

45
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:55,020
there was, but it's really, if you listen to this podcast, there's nothing new. And if you remember

46
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:01,820
back to the origins of the AB testing podcast, seven years ago, eight years ago, almost eight

47
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,500
years ago in April, right? Yeah, Brent and I were noticing things changing and testing

48
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:17,150
and, and how software was delivered. And we have not once we don't go out and preach like this

49
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:23,630
is the way it should be. We're telling you what we're seeing. More than that, we're telling you

50
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:31,540
what we're seeing. Number one, number two, in many of the things where we're seeing it,

51
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:42,420
we've experienced it. And in both of our cases, we're like, oh my God is usually when you when

52
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,580
you think that the grass is greener on the other side of the hill, you get there and you go, no,

53
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,060
no, it's just as green or maybe, you know, less green. But this was one where certainly

54
00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:00,260
my opinion is, and I think yours as well, that the grass was definitely greener on the other

55
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:07,810
side of the hill. Yeah. Maybe, maybe too metaphorical. But like, I, I remember my,

56
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:16,830
my blog post at that time, right, this is the time where you were still here at Microsoft when

57
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:24,990
I made the move, but when I moved into Bing and officially, you know, sold out and joined the enemy

58
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:32,000
and became a dev. And with all my perspective on quality, like I remember it like yesterday, like,

59
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:42,930
oh my God, I am now actually delivering quality, actually now. Whereas before I had told myself over

60
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:52,620
and over again, that that I was delivering quality like I had Jesus, nearly 15 years of reviews where

61
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:01,780
I was required to articulate how me and my team delivered quality. But then I realized just after

62
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:09,180
a few months in that team, oh my God, I was so freaking clueless. It's the order of ignorance

63
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,940
that got into play for me. You don't know what you don't know. And then suddenly I was in an

64
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:20,450
environment where I learned what I didn't actually know because I was so spun up in this,

65
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:26,210
in the Emperor's fancy new clothes that I had believed that I was wearing.

66
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:34,590
Yeah. Also, you know, we've seen, and we watched this happen at Microsoft and we saw this happen

67
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:43,140
in the industry. We watched lots of teams make this move to not have dedicated testers on the team

68
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,400
and really, really screw it up. And we wanted to recognize what are the flavors of that? What are

69
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,750
we seeing? Blah, blah, blah. So we can try and help people, just trying to help people navigate.

70
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:00,190
So I wrote, I'll summarize the article. There was, I made the statement and I explained.

71
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,950
And as a reminder, before you continue on, as a reminder, I will remind you,

72
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,670
because I have read the, what you're talking about, I've read the comments. And I will remind you

73
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,440
that we have a large number of people that have already thanked us for the transition. So we have,

74
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,520
don't let the haters bring you down, man. No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not. But what's really funny,

75
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,000
what I, as a couple of things I find funny about this experience. And of course I didn't write it

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,960
as clickbait. I wrote it because someone asked me to and it makes sense. I was just kidding. Giving

77
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:47,920
you, I know, I know, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. Okay. What I find really funny is

78
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:55,250
in the original, I included a paragraph that says something to the effect of when I make this

79
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:59,570
statement, some people say, yep, that makes sense. We do that. And some other people say,

80
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:06,130
it's the dumbest thing they've ever heard. And I'm harming the craft of testing and sure enough,

81
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:12,290
predicting the future. I was right. So the article in summary and sorry. And the thing is,

82
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:20,800
I don't know about you. I don't remember you ever seen this. When, when in particular,

83
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:31,260
Agile first came out, right? I was right there with that crowd. 100%. I'm like, wait, you want to do

84
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,820
what? I was still a test manager and they were saying, yeah, we're going to skip code and we're

85
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:44,540
not going to document. And what I interpreted it as is, okay, my peer in dev wants me to still be

86
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:51,500
accountable for, for quality, still be accountable for achieving the timelines. But what he's

87
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:58,580
proposing to me with a very serious look on his face is, uh, he and his team is going to do

88
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:03,700
whatever they want, whenever they want. And we should just adapt to it because that's Agile.

89
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:12,880
And I'm like, Oh, this is, this is going to go really bad. But hindsight, 2020 was at that point

90
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:22,610
in time because I had just begun that journey. I had not learned how to do it in that model.

91
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:32,370
Right. We were so reliant on, on the structure and the separation of concerns between individuals.

92
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,450
Anyway, it's too early for me. You're still in the, the setting the stage. So I'm not going to

93
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,690
go on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks man. I'm gonna have to chop this up, put it in the right order.

94
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:48,880
It's like that. Have you heard about the series kaleidoscope on Netflix? It's like eight episodes

95
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,560
and you can watch them in any order you want. Okay. That's I'll do that with the podcast. Um,

96
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,440
so anyway, I talked about, like to me, I think there's two things that have to happen

97
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,240
and they're complex things. I didn't go super deep, but I explained them well enough. I have a strong

98
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:13,440
feeling. A lot of people who left comments on LinkedIn did not actually read the whole post

99
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:20,610
because they just ignore the, I mean, I don't, are they skim departure? I don't know. So to me,

100
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,970
I think two things have to happen. There's probably a lot more things, two big things though,

101
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,810
to not need dedicated QA on your team. There was one person who said, well, they talked about all

102
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,410
the other things they do besides QA. If I wasn't there, they wouldn't get done. And I said like,

103
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,570
you're not, you're not doing dedicated QA now. I don't get it. Uh, one is the developers have

104
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:51,120
to know how to test and I have given talks on this so many talks. I have now taught hundreds of

105
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,750
teams and thousands of developers how to test. And you know, my experience, I can only tell you my

106
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,310
experience. My experience is that developers can become very good testers, very, very good testers.

107
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,030
And honestly, when they own, I mean, you know, from Forsgrind that when developers own the

108
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:09,790
automation, there's a correlation with quality that does not exist when your testers write the

109
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,310
automation and people say, Oh, they, they, they can't just write automation. What developers will

110
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,910
do once they own the automation and once they know a little bit more about testing is they

111
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:27,230
design far more testable code. They build, they go, they thinking about how they're going to test

112
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:34,910
it because they have to do it. It, it works. I've seen it work with over a thousand developers. I know,

113
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:42,510
I know they can learn and I state my experience and people say, I disagree. Developers can't test

114
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:48,270
said, how can you disagree? You could say my experience is different. So anyway,

115
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:53,710
so that's the first step developers have to be able to test. You can coach, you can help them,

116
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,030
but if you don't want to have dedicated testers, you need developers to own the testing.

117
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:01,150
The second thing you need before you interrupt there and go back to the beginning. Actually,

118
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:05,550
do you want to comment on that one before I go on? Yeah, it's, I can tell you look like

119
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,550
either that or your, or you move to the bathroom. It looks like you have to take a big old dump.

120
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,710
Brett changed his camera angle. I was like, like, yeah,

121
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:18,780
it was briefly considering showing you what that face looked like. Um,

122
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:27,500
the, no, you should continue the dump comment. Maybe one, maybe flush my whole comment.

123
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:33,660
One flush your whole comment. One devs have to be able, devs can test. They need to own testing.

124
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,460
That's it. That's the part of it. But a lot of people stopped there and thought, well,

125
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,380
my devs don't want to test or they aren't a good, they're not as good at it. Like there's

126
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:49,420
another half to the damn post you didn't read. The other thing is you need fast feedback loops.

127
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,180
You need the fast feedback loops you get from understanding customer data on how they're

128
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:02,140
using your software. The reason that it is more inefficient to have dedicated testers

129
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,420
because they're getting in the way of a fast feedback loop.

130
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,460
Brent's drawing on the whiteboard, but I'll see what it is in a minute.

131
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:14,260
I don't have paper. I'm just making notes. I'm trying to let you talk.

132
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,780
Okay. Okay. All right. I got, I got, I'm gonna stop looking at the video. Shouldn't do that.

133
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:26,020
This is a, yeah. So fast feedback loops, which come from data and people didn't read that part

134
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,620
or they read that and said, you're making the customers do all the testing. No. And what

135
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:39,540
really pushes my buttons on this is the group digging their nails in. And again,

136
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,100
welcome to the conversation. I am so glad some of you were so mad and think I'm stupid because

137
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:52,660
that's what I expected. Uh, but in my opinion, the lack of critical thinking from some of these

138
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,900
people, like I'm telling you, I have seen this work and I've seen this work for years and years

139
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:06,510
and years and you jump in and say, no, it doesn't work. It, it makes no sense to me.

140
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,510
Like when I, when I hear something I don't agree with, like when I think something stupid,

141
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,490
I don't immediately dismiss it. I will take some time to try and figure out, okay,

142
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:22,510
somebody believes this in what situations could this be true? To me, that's how you approach

143
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:28,590
understanding and acquiring knowledge is, or one way is when something causes you cognitive

144
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,190
dissonance, you don't just chuck it away and call it bullshit. You try and figure out where that idea

145
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,990
is coming from and what could make it true for this other person in their context. And that was

146
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,670
missing from a whole bunch of the haters. And I just, I don't get it. Were they so,

147
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:52,670
maybe they're just so, so mad. They threw out, they just went into fight or flight brain thing

148
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:59,150
and they just were mad and they wanted to lash out versus actually apply some thinking to what

149
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,870
I was saying. So that's the part that kind of bummed me out a little bit.

150
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:07,470
Now, and that for sure happened. The other thing that I think happened here,

151
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:14,590
and I'm not certain how it, how it did, right? But there's something that I call, uh,

152
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:22,990
Jensen's law of politics and that is he who is defensive loses always somehow in all of this,

153
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:30,270
you are, are being put into place where you had to defend your point of view, right? In my view,

154
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,390
I'm just like, I'm now laughing it off when someone says, okay, well, Dev can't test.

155
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:42,510
I'm like, yeah, you know what, dude, prove to me they can't test because I now have

156
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,590
11 years of experience that is a hundred percent contradictory to what you're just saying.

157
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:56,690
And if you say, well, Microsoft ship, well, great. But you know, me and my stock price

158
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:03,410
does not align with that statement. Right. But my company is providing value to the customer.

159
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,780
Go back to principle five, where a lot of the same folks mad at me for what I wrote.

160
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,580
I did not mention the modern testing principles directly, but

161
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,500
I do believe that only the customer could evaluate quality.

162
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,900
Absolutely. And here's another one that I think we might want to take on head on.

163
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay. Ellen, you're just making the customer test. Okay. Here's my response.

164
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,960
Yes. So fucking what?

165
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,200
Right. Well, they don't know what it means. I mean, number, number one, number one, as you know,

166
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,120
we're not, but here's the thing. That's that argument leads down to some defensive path.

167
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,840
I'm like, look, I'm not going to play semantic battles with you. So what if we are? What's the

168
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:55,360
harm? Right. Google, Google got to number one because guess what? They had their customers test

169
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:04,860
and they found looking at the data streams that, oh, we have a bug here. And what they optimize

170
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,740
for is the minimization of the time that customers in pain. Yes. They optimize for,

171
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:18,140
okay. Once we, we have to have the engine in place to identify where we're, where we are

172
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,700
having negative impact to the customer. Number one, we have to have that quick and fast.

173
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:33,180
And then once we identify those, we have to create and a fast engine to get repairs out.

174
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:39,340
And over and over again, you find a bug in Google's assets, right? Come back two

175
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:46,700
later, try two weeks later, try that case again. Oh, not even two. Sometimes more likely two

176
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,650
minutes or two hours. Not two minutes, two. All right. Depends on what you're doing.

177
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,850
Because it could be an auto rollback, but you said it quick and fast. How quickly can we understand

178
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:03,970
if customers are successful with this thing? How quickly can we understand if customers are

179
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:10,290
hitting an error case? I don't think people really grasp the power of these fast feedback loops,

180
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,810
which have been talked about. I don't know when the DevOps handbook came out. That was

181
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,770
somewhere 10 years ago. I have a copy. I'll go look it up in a second.

182
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:23,250
But I will tell you, I will tell you, just straight up from my own experience,

183
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:31,490
it wasn't until when I went to Dev and it wasn't until I had been doing

184
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:41,200
Kanban with sort of continuous releases and had put my whole service on the floor that I learned,

185
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:49,280
oh, oh, oh, right? Because with a scrum or a waterfall model, you put everything on the floor,

186
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:56,880
everything's dead. Like when I first did scrum, we did a big, complicated scrum, took two weeks,

187
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,240
screwed the whole pooch. We completely failed on integration. It took us three months to undo the

188
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,800
two weeks worth of work that we had done. But with Kanban, we put everything on the floor and

189
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:16,540
guess what? Revert one change. Hey, everything's back online. When I realized the power of that

190
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,540
and experienced it, I'm like, Oh my God. Okay, that is why they say this.

191
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,420
Yeah, I'm with you.

192
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:31,100
It is super powerful when you when you stop trying to do it theoretically. And even even more

193
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:40,940
so stop trying to do it vicariously. It's give it an honest try. And you're gonna I truly believe

194
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,140
you give it an honest try in your, I don't know, 80% chance to immediately align with us.

195
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:53,260
One thing I did, I think I hinted at pretty well, you know, I don't go back and read my read it.

196
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,500
I write it, I read it once again, make some edits, and then I post it on look at it again.

197
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,500
So one thing I think I made, I did add a few edits afterwards for clarification. But

198
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,980
one point I think I discovered, I want to get your opinion on, because I actually haven't said

199
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,020
this before explicitly. In the post, I brought up like maybe medical equipment or NASA, maybe they

200
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,340
needed a dedicated tester. But it wasn't really because I think a lot of things that you do with

201
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,420
medical devices, and a lot of things you do with rocket ships, do not need dedicated testers, but

202
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,140
depending on simulations, etc. But my hypothesis is the point I brought up

203
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:34,820
is that it comes down to feedback loops. When you and I first started at Microsoft are,

204
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,580
you know, we did betas, but things shipped very, very slowly.

205
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,510
Yes.

206
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,070
Years.

207
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,750
Yes.

208
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:48,590
The slower your feedback loop is, I think the more need you have for a dedicated tester,

209
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:53,550
because you don't have a pro... Here's the proxy there trying to cover up for the fact you have

210
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,750
a crummy feedback loop.

211
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:04,110
No, since that... Oh my God, that's 100% correct. The test team, number one, I'm going to stand by

212
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,270
the number one value proposition of a test team. Hopefully, this is not true worldwide,

213
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,630
but I'm fairly certain it is. Number one value proposition for a dedicated test team

214
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:23,470
is to be the scapegoat for the org. Okay, that's... I 100% stand by that. It's essentially

215
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:29,790
so that my awesome developers have someone to blame when it goes to shit. Okay.

216
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:40,350
The second thing in a non dysfunctional team, then the number one value proposition of a test team

217
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:48,670
is to be a heuristic for the fast feedback loop that you would get if you were a service

218
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:56,590
or in production or things along those lines. Okay. But in that context, a test team

219
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:05,330
is an educated guesser. Okay. Yeah. They're a guesser. And this is the reason for principle number

220
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:11,330
five. I'm the customer. I'm pretending to be the customer. They need me. They need me,

221
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:20,610
Brent. They need me. And certain teams, they may be well trained and they may be really solid in

222
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,170
their craft, but here's the deal. At the end of the day, it is still just a guess.

223
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:34,290
The value comes from the customer. It does. And it's this angle, that little revelation around,

224
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:39,730
because I started reading The Ways of DevOps again from DevOps Handbook. And I thought, oh my God,

225
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,890
this is... And somebody a long time ago had mentioned the overlap between the modern

226
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:49,170
testing principles and The Ways of DevOps. So go check that out if you haven't. Principle number

227
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:55,410
one, our priority is improving the business. You improve the business via fast feedback loops.

228
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:59,250
The faster you can get feedback on whether you're building the right thing or whether customers

229
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:04,850
are getting value from it, if you can get that on an hourly basis, why wouldn't you want to?

230
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:11,460
Why are people happy? I mean, when you ship on a monthly or a yearly basis,

231
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,940
you're guessing customers are going to like that. And if they don't, and you have to wait another

232
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,900
month or a year to give them something they like, you're going to be out of business.

233
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Well, if you have competitors, right? When people come to me and say, oh, well,

234
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:34,420
you're allowing your customers to test for you. Okay, great. If you're a competitor of mine,

235
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:42,990
I hope that you are not. Because, and these are speeches, I know I've given repeatedly,

236
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:48,830
speed wins. Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:56,290
A couple other things to bring up from that, that whole comment thread. And I did not even attempt to,

238
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:02,290
I put a few replies in there, but I just not even replied to most things. There were two things.

239
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,780
One, I called this out in something else we haven't talked about. I thought of in my

240
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,060
stream of consciousness blog post is a lot of full-time feedback. And I'm not going to

241
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:18,100
have to do that. But I think a lot of folks in the current testing community, or what do they call,

242
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,610
what do they call themselves now? Not schools, communities, factions, one of the tester factions,

243
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,330
they bring up this idea of critical distance a lot. I don't know which one of the, the,

244
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,410
the bolt in their box, I brought it up, but they think you have to have critical distance. This

245
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:39,170
is, this is the thing people bring up when they say that developers can't test. They don't have

246
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:47,650
the critical distance to do this. And I found that to be a bullshit. They, they test very, very well.

247
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:54,190
And then I don't think so. I don't believe a tester, this dedicated tester, the testing mindset,

248
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,910
air quotes, gives you that critical distance. If you want critical distance,

249
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:05,470
you're going to get that from the customer. In fact, I think it's my comeback to critical

250
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:10,430
distances. If you think it's important and you're, and you're convinced it has to be there

251
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,790
and, and shut up with your, you're making the customers test you. Yeah. Yeah.

252
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,830
They maintain, maintaining Brent, imitating a whiny, a whiny person,

253
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:26,430
a customer can provide that critical distance. Critical distance is, here's what I'm going to

254
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:33,950
say. I am going to translate critical distance. Critical distance is bullshit cycle babble for,

255
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:41,970
for an accurate fast feedback loop. Yeah. Okay. When I translate it in that way,

256
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,530
and I have a similar thing for tests or mindset, I don't like their definition, obviously,

257
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:55,330
the people that are publishing this thing. But to me, critical distance is you must have

258
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:05,410
something in place that you have confidence in that will tell you your shit does in fact stick.

259
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:15,500
Okay. That's all critical distance is. It's, it is some objective measure. Okay. Now what you and I

260
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:25,260
are basically saying is in this current world, you don't always, you don't even mostly need

261
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:33,980
another human being in your same team sitting next to you to do that. Now, there's a lot of studies

262
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:40,500
around pair programming that shows that, that there's a value add on this one, right? But,

263
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:51,730
but, uh, in my view, the relationship of between a dev and a tester should be very, very, very

264
00:27:51,730 --> 00:28:01,570
similar. It's not an exact match between two devs pair programming. Yeah. I agree. Because it's, it's,

265
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,210
in fact, in a lot of the talks I've given, I talk about teaching developers to test.

266
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:16,290
One of the things that I've seen work a lot is the best way to teach developers how to test is

267
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:21,260
pair program with them. Bring your testing mindset to a pair programming session.

268
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:30,540
To me, critical distance is nothing more than a trustable objective feedback loop. Okay. And that

269
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:37,500
can come from all sorts of things, including my customers testing for me and to be snarky,

270
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:47,280
like to me, critical distance could also be, uh, one centimeter, right? It's the thing that I

271
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,360
find offensive about this called this concept, this concept of critical distance

272
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,400
is the way I interpreted the framing. And I hope I'm, I'm, I got this wrong because the more and

273
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:10,190
more I read, right? I, I, I am potentially committing the same crime where I have a

274
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:17,150
preexisting point of view and, and I evaluate against that. And it just continues to blow up

275
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:22,510
in my mind this wrong point of view. The concept we've talked about before, but when I look at

276
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:28,190
critical distance, the way I walk away from it is that it's around knowledge siloism,

277
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:36,270
that you get objectivity from siloism. And in this world, anything other than proactive

278
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:42,080
knowledge sharing, I am at a point where that is offensive. Like it's insulting,

279
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,160
but that's where I go. I go to a very emotional place. Knowledge sharing where knowledge workers

280
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:55,540
knowledge sharing is absolutely a key to success. People working together, not separation. I can

281
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:01,220
do a similar rant on test or mindset or a similar translation. Cause I, I spent some time thinking

282
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:06,160
about that. This is well, do you want me to go into that now? Or do you have other things that

283
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,720
you, Oh, no, no, you can do whatever you want. I have just one comment I want to share

284
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,200
from the article. We can get to that whenever. Keep going, man.

285
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:22,560
Test or mindset. I sat down and thought about it. Number one, test or mindset. The first question is,

286
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,120
is there such a thing? Now, when we are evaluating, is there such a thing?

287
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,480
I think we got to look at it from multiple different lights, right? Back in 1998,

288
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,950
I would have absolutely argued there was such a thing, right? You, the number, and I think

289
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:48,960
you would have as well, like the number of testers that we interviewed, some people fit the bar.

290
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,600
Some people didn't, right? They didn't have a structured approach for this. Today,

291
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:03,460
I actually see a similar problem, but it's implementation is fundamentally different,

292
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:13,570
right? When we've talked, I don't know, back in November about AB testing the technique,

293
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:24,720
not the podcast, right? And I will absolutely tell you, there is, there is number one, a mindset to do

294
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:36,530
AB testing correctly. The experiment design, it's not hard, but it doesn't take much to get people to

295
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:46,800
do it right, but they almost always do it wrong initially. And it does take a structured mindset.

296
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,940
But here's the thing. It's absolutely trainable.

297
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,240
I don't know if you recall two years ago, I wrote an article for a test project called the test,

298
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,900
the testing mindset myth. I made the same art. It just doesn't exist. It's crap.

299
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:16,740
Now it's age old arguments, right? Are testers born? And right. And I am, I am that some are

300
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:24,820
yet. Absolutely. Some are, but in general, the answer is no. In my humble experience.

301
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,620
Yeah. Again, not, that's probably my last testing post. My next post coming out tonight or tomorrow

302
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:38,420
is really into the designing experiments part, maybe not that deep, but, but talking about that

303
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,180
half a little deeper into that half of the article that nobody bothered reading or didn't

304
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:49,140
understand. I'm surprised from the comments. People just do not understand. They're so far into

305
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:56,180
their echo chamber of their echo chamber of all the traps of testing the old school,

306
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:04,100
wherever they are, if they just, they're not exposed at all to how you can use data to

307
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:08,180
understand and telemetry, whatever I call it, remote measurements, metric, et cetera,

308
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,180
to understand the customer's experience. Somebody was in the comments thought I was taking like

309
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,980
customer PII or, or if I was paying for the customer data, I said, no, it's not that kind

310
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:24,990
of data. I don't know who the customers are. I just know their experience, but one, I did get one.

311
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:33,920
I'm trying to figure out which of the last, last half, but the one thing, the way instead of being

312
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:41,360
judgy or, or even getting close to being judgy, you, you, I'll, I'll just repair or paraphrase

313
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:51,890
what you just said. You don't fully under stand number one, why they, why they seem unable to

314
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:59,010
leap over the hurdle. Number two, what exactly is the hurdle? Right. It may just simply be

315
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:05,330
experience experience. Right. Um, which is kind of what I suspect.

316
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:11,090
Well, I don't know. I'll re I'll rephrase it. It was experience that,

317
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:15,570
that flipped my bit and solidly. Yeah.

318
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,080
I was going to read a comment. I'm not going to, because I don't want to call anyone out.

319
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,040
Everybody's entitled to their opinions and I'm okay with people calling me wrong or, or

320
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:35,360
it, in some cases, just going off on the fact that all my arguments are weak and not based in reality,

321
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:40,940
et cetera, et cetera. Uh, I'm just sharing again, going back to the AB testing podcast.

322
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,700
You know, that was based on sharing experiences and I talked to, I mean, here's,

323
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,860
this is the problem of me posting something on LinkedIn. Some people start attacking like,

324
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:56,300
Oh, Ellen, you're a VP at unity and unity software has bugs. And yeah, it does. And we

325
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:03,660
also have dedicated testers because the feedback cycles are slow for the, for the editor. Yeah.

326
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,580
So what it just, I'm telling you what I've seen. I'm telling you what Brent and I have

327
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,260
been talking about. It works. I've given talks on this stuff. I give talks on this. And like you,

328
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:21,140
people say, makes sense. Thanks for putting a name to this. Thanks for, for observing this.

329
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,100
Really. We're observing this world going on around us. So I just get a little surprise

330
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:33,860
when I share observations and experiences and people say, no, those are wrong and your data's

331
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:42,290
weak and you do. And you're harming the craft of testing. I just, in regards, Alan, Alan,

332
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:48,370
Alan, here's the thing. Like in some regards, we might be harming the craft to test it.

333
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:55,090
Okay. And you know what? If that's the sacrificial lamb necessary to improve

334
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:03,570
the craft of delivering quality, I am okay. Yep. Me too. I talked to someone else today,

335
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:10,690
this week, another company, just a brief chat. And I didn't even know I wrote, let alone wrote this

336
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:16,770
post, but in conversation, I brought a fact, like I said, I don't think that most teams need

337
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:21,490
dedicated testers. Is it someone or another company that's not Microsoft or unity? They

338
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:27,760
said, yeah, fully agree. No pushback. No. What do you mean by most? No. Define what you mean by

339
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,240
dedicated tester or other crap. It said, yep, makes sense. No, but your article, your article,

340
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:44,270
I wish we had a sense of like, I know our, we talk about the bubbles between the traditional

341
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,430
and the modern. And I know when we started it, the bubble was relatively small and I'm fairly

342
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:56,430
certain the bubble is not only large now, but even larger than the traditional bubble.

343
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:03,710
Yeah. I think it may be. Can I prove it? Nope. Nope. Well, actually, I'm a dentist.

344
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,230
I think a lot of the haters who may not read something, anything else on LinkedIn got there.

345
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:15,630
It's this weird concept that I saw happen in my post as well as a couple times to other people's

346
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:23,630
posts in LinkedIn, in Twitter and everything. It's this concept that Merit gave a name to.

347
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:31,340
It's called snitch tagging. Oh, yeah. So this idea that when you talk about testing,

348
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:40,500
you need to tag in the two leaders of the, I'll call the traditional test faction and

349
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,260
tag them into your post. I will tell you right now that I have told Michael Bolton that his,

350
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,860
and he didn't descriptive, I said, you're targeting your business at people who have

351
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:58,020
done very little testing. And he did exactly there. There is so much turnover in that

352
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,940
traditional test world. If you go to star, they ask how many of you have been testing

353
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,260
for less than a year and three quarters of the hands go up. And at that level,

354
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,420
when you are brought in to learn testing and you are at a company, you don't know what they're

355
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,140
doing and they have slow feedback cycles. You absolutely need the things from Bach and Bolton

356
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:19,940
to get started. They don't have bad views on testing. They're just views that are outdated

357
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:27,900
compared to what you and I are seeing. So we have this sort of mutual respect between the three of

358
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:38,350
us. I, Bach, 10 years ago, I was, you know, his big thing is if he loves to debate and

359
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:45,660
he loves to like, let's get on a phone call and hash this out. Not a phone call. He's actually

360
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:51,100
super nice. And he, I think he, he's a little pompous, but he knows his position. So we had

361
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:56,540
our phone call 10, 12 years ago, whatever it was. And, and we're all on good terms. Just, we,

362
00:38:56,540 --> 00:39:02,940
we do well at staying out of each other's lanes. So I think Bolton got snitched tagged and he

363
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,500
didn't even jump into the thread because we just, we stay in our lanes from each other. And I also

364
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:13,100
don't go to their blog posts or their Twitter posts. And, and I, like I have, I have Bolton

365
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:19,020
because I, I have nothing interesting I want to hear from. He's muted for me on Twitter. So I

366
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,020
don't even see repost of his stuff for replies. And then we just avoid each other. So Bach got,

367
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:32,740
got tagged in and he replied in there, but he did it in a very, I mean, he didn't say a lot. He

368
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,500
was, he was nice in putting down my work. So I didn't worry about it. But this idea though,

369
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:47,600
that, I mean, this is what really scares me and makes this, this, this faction feel like a cult

370
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:53,760
because it's happened to somebody else. I know on LinkedIn over some sometime late December,

371
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,960
this idea that if you say anything controversial about, not even controversial,

372
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:05,310
say anything about testing that people will come tag the folks in to say, do you approve of this?

373
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,790
Basically, what do you think about this? It's happened for years. And I think,

374
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,540
I just think it's the dumbest thing ever, but I think that's what brought a lot of,

375
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,060
cause then it's the changes, the algorithm shows up on more people that follow them's

376
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,300
feed and they come in and tell me I'm dumb and don't know anything. But yeah, I don't care.

377
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:28,220
Because I'm, because again, it's not a right or wrong. This is what the whole podcast is about.

378
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:37,660
It's what we see. Yeah. Yeah. I see one of someone we used to work with even did a response

379
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:42,060
blog. I'm not going to read it on air. I'm curious about it.

380
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,340
But you're thinking that someone else posted on LinkedIn and it was, I don't know who it was.

381
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:52,220
I can't remember, but they mocked me. They tagged me into a post and mocked me a little bit saying

382
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:59,840
if some of the effect of, if you're one of the dedicated testers that Alan thinks we don't need

383
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:04,000
come to this community thing and I'll show you what we really do. But that was pretty funny.

384
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:12,500
No. And to me, I mean, that one's, that one's easy for me to sort of just laugh off,

385
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,700
right? Because I'm like, okay, I understand where they're coming from.

386
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,580
Right. And I used, I used to hold that opinion until I learned otherwise. So

387
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,660
you don't know what you don't know. That's the thing that I don't know keeps me sane.

388
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:43,340
I have too much experience on both sides of this coin to ever go back. And that's the sad reality.

389
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:51,340
And I am probably locked into that. Like at this point in time, locked into that in a

390
00:41:52,300 --> 00:42:01,020
familiar rational standpoint, but no one is ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever going to convince me

391
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:09,260
to go hire a tester for my team. And I ship services all of the time. Right. That days are done

392
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:15,580
over. No mas. Because I know so many other ways to mitigate the risk.

393
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,660
Yeah. And I just, there may be other reasons, right? There's certain criteria.

394
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:28,620
If you have a government contract, they will make you provide the test results.

395
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:36,700
If you are shipping, shipping product in the old school fashion. First off, I'm curious as to

396
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:43,020
understand how or why you're doing that. Even now, Wi-Fi chips, shipping, forget everything.

397
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:53,100
So even if it's an IoT powered screwdriver, you can still ship updates. I don't know why you need

398
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,460
an IoT screwdriver, but that's irrelevant to my story. Yeah. I'm just simply not going to go

399
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:05,180
back. And I'm kind of, I freely admit I'm closed minded on this in terms of that direction. Now,

400
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:12,460
someone comes to me and says, Hey, Brent, I think I have a definition of postmodern testing. I'll be

401
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:19,740
honest. I will just because I know me and my behavior, I'll probably react very similarly

402
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:25,820
to how I did when Agile first rolled out. I might probably be right there with these guys and go,

403
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,660
no, this is wrong because of theoretical bullshit that I haven't any experience on.

404
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,060
Now, I would hope that I'm older and wiser and that I wouldn't do that. And it would sit down

405
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:43,890
and say, okay, explain to me how would this happen. But this sort of bullshit theoretical proof

406
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,240
that then I keep going back to, well, you're making the testers or the customers test.

407
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:01,340
Well, if you hold as a standard that your job is to prevent the customer from seeing bugs,

408
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:06,140
then yeah, that's like the number one principle thou shalt not violate.

409
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:13,390
Right. But when you when you change it to a focus on quality, your standard changes.

410
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,830
Yeah. And you really see, I mean, one thing that comes out in that discussion, and by the way,

411
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:29,410
I got a whole bunch of Twitter and LinkedIn DMS with more scathing and more matter content that

412
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:35,570
I won't read for privacy reasons, but off the charts that explains your comments on Slack at

413
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:39,490
the time, because I went and looked at LinkedIn and I'm like, okay, I'm not really certain.

414
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:45,410
I could very clearly see we've worked together. Why very clearly see you were upset,

415
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:51,650
but I couldn't see why. Yeah, there's a lot of people reached out to me privately to tell me how

416
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:58,210
wrong I was and how and again, I'm just sharing stuff I've seen. So what I would do is just

417
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,670
reply to them, Alan and say, what's your proof? What is your actual proof?

418
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:08,510
I choose to not and you'll see this on a lot of the people really trying to attack me

419
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,790
versus the topic. I just did not engage. Fair enough.

420
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:20,430
So what really comes out if you look at those and I wanted to paste all of the comments into

421
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,630
chat GPT and have it summarize, but it was too long.

422
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:25,150
Oh, okay.

423
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,990
Well, I yeah, but then I had it was it was a pain in the butt. I didn't do it,

424
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:31,390
but someday I'll do that. I'll figure it out. That's why it needs an API.

425
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,070
And but one thing really comes out is what we talk about a lot. Maybe last thing worth

426
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,390
mentioning for we cut off here is maybe not go too deep into it looking at the clock,

427
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:46,750
but the people against me are really, really, really into testing.

428
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,430
Talked about the test craft and how important testing is.

429
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:56,430
And I just found that interesting when I care about quality so much.

430
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:02,590
Testing is to me part of development. It's definitely part of quality,

431
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,590
but it is not my main concern. A lot of these folks.

432
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:12,190
It's just an interesting you and I have both made this jump in our last seven,

433
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:17,870
10 years of we're passionate about quality. We want quality for our customers.

434
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,310
Not like we don't believe in this stuff because we don't give a crap about quality.

435
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:27,550
We just think there are more efficient ways, massively more efficient ways to reach quality.

436
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,910
Other than a whole bunch of testing by people dedicated to doing that,

437
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,270
slowing down our feedback loops.

438
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:41,230
Yes, it's essentially it's interesting that particular insight around.

439
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:47,980
So on the podcast is the first time where I sort of ever in my mind equated these concepts.

440
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:57,420
Which is essentially a dedicated tester is a heuristic for a feedback loop.

441
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,360
Yeah, that's what I discovered in writing this article.

442
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,600
So that's my new thing.

443
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:14,930
And number one, it is a heuristic, which means there is a strong chance that it's incorrect.

444
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,480
Or maybe not a strong chance, but there is.

445
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,320
Heuristic by definition are a guidance that can be incorrect.

446
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:32,480
Correct. It is still feedback, but it's not necessarily prioritized feedback.

447
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,880
Right. Whereas the feedback loop that you get from the customer telemetry as an example,

448
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:47,300
is neither. It is both prioritized and it is not a heuristic.

449
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,960
Now, the third condition is depending on how you've implemented that feedback loop,

450
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,280
it can be slow and it can be fast.

451
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:05,180
So the speed, I say it has a potential of being the same on both sides,

452
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,380
but generally with the techniques people use using today,

453
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,860
the speed is much faster on the customer side.

454
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:20,700
It's a lot easier to get a fast feedback loop in today's world than in the old 1998.

455
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,220
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

456
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:27,870
It wasn't until, you know, well into the 2000s were downloading updates

457
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:29,710
or downloading things with the thing you did.

458
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,640
Right. All right, man.

459
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,000
I got to go. You got to go. Everybody got to go.

460
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,680
All right. All right.

461
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,360
Everybody. Yeah. Yeah.

462
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,920
I think we're good.

463
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,760
Are you emotionally okay?

464
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,880
No, I'm totally good.

465
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,400
Should we fake hug it out?

466
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,080
No. Oh, all right.

467
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,080
No, not even through the camera.

468
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,000
Okay. Fair enough.

469
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,800
All right, everybody. I'm still Alan and he is still.

470
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,300
The other one.

471
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,220
The other one. Yeah. The B to my A.

472
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,820
All right. We'll see you next time.

473
00:48:58,820 --> 00:48:59,620
Bye.
