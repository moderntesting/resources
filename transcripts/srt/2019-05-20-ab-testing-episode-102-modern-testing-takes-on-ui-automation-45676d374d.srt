00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,710
A B Testing, the modern testing podcast. Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,150
I am mindless agile robot. I must iterate.

3
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:26,690
As we talk about software engineering, software quality,

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,890
leadership and whatever else comes to mind. Now on with the show.

5
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,310
I don't know how to start. Hey guys, welcome to AB testing.

6
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,260
It's episode one or two. How about that? That's pretty good. Uh,

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,500
there's something significant about one Oh two. Where, where is one Oh,

8
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,740
does one Oh two exist in pop culture anywhere? That number.

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,610
Um, I am absolutely the wrong person.

10
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,430
That's right. You are pop culture ignorant.

11
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,890
You want me to look it up? No, no, I do not want you to do.

12
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,570
Cause just before, just before, at least you're not asking Cortana.

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,170
So let me, okay. Or big speed. Oh my God. Whatever.

14
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,170
My echo understands me pretty well. My phone. Okay.

15
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,930
Google understands me pretty well. Cortana on my damn Xbox.

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,780
I don't know what the hell Microsoft because all that ever happens is

17
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,680
I never asked her to do anything, but every once in a while,

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,560
she'll just chime in while I'm watching TV and say, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,500
I didn't understand you. I didn't say anything.

20
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,820
And then I try and tell her to do stuff. And it's like,

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,560
I'm ignoring you. This is like me in high school trying to date.

22
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,410
I wasn't talking to you. I said, I wasn't talking to you either.

23
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,210
Alone. You're harassing me. It's like, I, bye.

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,010
I'm going to go back to my room and play video games,

25
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,770
which consisted of at that point in the,

26
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,810
in the early 18th century was the football game.

27
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,610
Now people were thinking now Madden football, the kids today. No,

28
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,690
it was the little little LEDs you went that you moved up and down to avoid hitting

29
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,450
the other. My best friend in high school had that game and I spent hours on it.

30
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,890
Oh, the kids today. So just before we started recording,

31
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,490
we were talking about Brent was, and we're going to spare you from this.

32
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,090
Brent was singing radio Gaga and he says, have you seen that movie?

33
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,210
And yes, I saw it opening weekend. I bought the Blu-ray the day it came out.

34
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:42,690
Not only am I and was I as a kid, a huge, huge queen fan,

35
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,170
the movie while it took, cause I knew so much of the history of the band,

36
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,090
it took way too much artistic license and how the story was told.

37
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:57,810
But the acting that Rami Malek was just amazing as Freddie Mercury.

38
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,170
And then the point I wanted to bring up is on YouTube,

39
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,170
there is a split screen side by side showing the Rami Malek and band.

40
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,770
A live aid concert alongside the original live aid concert.

41
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,530
Oh my God. Not just everything, everybody,

42
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,770
everybody in the band.

43
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,530
They made John Deacon look so eighties Deacon throughout the movie.

44
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,250
But yeah, that side by side,

45
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,810
the whole band and credit to directors, producers, everyone involved, coaches,

46
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,330
everyone that got them to do that. That is just amazing.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,360
That story, I too adored Queen growing up.

48
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:46,990
And then there is another angle where the Freddie Mercury story resonates with me.

49
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,850
So my eldest is gay.

50
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,410
And so I think about these sort of things all the time.

51
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,110
All the time, like as a father, you go, wow,

52
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,180
I wish society was not quite the way it is because he's going to have a tougher life.

53
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,380
It does make your life harder as a result.

54
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,540
And there's nothing I can do to help him. Right? It's rough.

55
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,500
Yeah. Well, on that note. Yeah.

56
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,180
But no, that's the,

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,380
but I hear that a lot from friends who have gay children or just, it's just,

58
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,380
it's tough. Anyway, on a more serious note,

59
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,660
let's talk about things that are pissing me off. Oh, we already,

60
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,620
oh, we actually,

61
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,180
we should probably check in and see how things are going.

62
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,740
I'm busy in my new job. It is awesome. I'm liking it a lot.

63
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,040
How you doing, Brett? Oh, I'm, I'm, it's review season.

64
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,960
That's all it is. Oh God. Yeah. No, it, I'm so sorry.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,980
It doesn't end for another month. Yeah. Okay. So good luck with that.

66
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,460
That goes back again. And then. All right. Um, I recommend alcohol.

67
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,500
Uh, yeah, there will be lots of that this weekend. Yeah.

68
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,900
And before we forget and get onto the meat of the show,

69
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,740
I would like to mention that Brent and I will both be,

70
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,340
we'll be co-presenting a session at the online testing conference,

71
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,960
online testconf.com on June 6th at,

72
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,520
well it's June 5th and 6th. That's the OTC. That's the OTC.

73
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,720
Our talk is the 6th. Our talk is the 6th at 11 AM Pacific,

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,760
but you should go to all the talks because it's free. It's online.

75
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,460
Pants optional. It is really cool. Yeah.

76
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,540
I think Lisa's in this one too. There's a lot of good ones. And in fact,

77
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,500
I have a call today, uh,

78
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,780
with someone else that I'll remind me to talk to you about this.

79
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,620
Cause I have it yet.

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,940
I have a call later today with someone else who was presenting an OTC about

81
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,420
potentially being a guest on this show. Nice. All right.

82
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,900
Nice. I want to.

83
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,270
That's better than the answer. You go, no, no more guests. We've tried this.

84
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,100
No, well, we all know, we all know.

85
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,100
We stop when we've,

86
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,220
when we do multiple guests and we're realizing that we're not actually

87
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,300
learning how to do guests. Thus far we are, we've learned a great deal.

88
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,300
So now I know how to have a guest. I think.

89
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,220
So much easier. It's only one person,

90
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,980
but the a podcast just doesn't have a good ring to it.

91
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,100
A testing. Yeah.

92
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,100
Testing. Yeah. A testing. A testing podcast.

93
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,260
It kind of gets rid of the theme. So yep.

94
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,420
We're stuck with each other.

95
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,010
Despite the fact that I managed to anger most to

96
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:03,860
all of my Twitter followers this week. Did you catch that?

97
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,740
I did. Yeah, that was fun.

98
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,860
Oh, they were coming at you in so many different angles. So,

99
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,140
and this has happened to me before.

100
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,260
And if you don't run the Twitter, I will catch you up.

101
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,140
I don't even know where to start because I have so many rants related to this.

102
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,140
So this is going to be very disconjointed.

103
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,580
I should have come in with an outline of making my points in the proper order,

104
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,700
but we're going to kind of ramble through it. You know what?

105
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,260
I don't think that should have been the case. Right.

106
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,140
That even an outline or that I shouldn't.

107
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,300
Like there's one comment I'm thinking of was like, Oh,

108
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,860
that was irresponsible. Yeah. Let me, let me get to that.

109
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,060
And you know what you were ranting. Screw that. No, no, no.

110
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,460
And I don't think I was. And, and, but the whole thing.

111
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,700
You don't think you're irresponsible or ranting?

112
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,700
I don't think I was irresponsible. Okay.

113
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,820
And I think this stems from a much deeper seated

114
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,780
problem in the testing community.

115
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,260
So let me start with how I angered the masses.

116
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,330
I was talking to a colleague about some UI automation he was working on and he

117
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,170
wasn't really working on it.

118
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,810
What he was working on was I wrote some proof of concept,

119
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,130
you animation tests.

120
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,770
I'll get back to those later and a year ago and he was going to dust them off

121
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,150
and get them running as part of CI very basic. And then tests.

122
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,270
It's something I did a proof of concept to see if a particular tool would work.

123
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:39,390
It did a year later. My tests all ran, except for ran with no errors.

124
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,310
A year later, active development. Yay. Alan with one,

125
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,580
one error due to a, uh,

126
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,740
a redesign that changed the name of the selector. Okay.

127
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,820
And the redesign, that part of the,

128
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,900
that part that those elements on the webpage removed from angular to react and

129
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,660
he was telling me that react, uh, does some weird things with selectors. I said,

130
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,540
yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure they do because they're stupid.

131
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,940
We talked about data IDs, et cetera. I went to look up some things, uh,

132
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,820
just to see if I could find some quick tips.

133
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,790
And I came across this blog post,

134
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,190
one of the many gazillion blog posts talking about how they've used selenium

135
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,150
to solve their quality problems.

136
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,670
And someone was wrote this code and was very proud of it.

137
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,750
And I just did this and this, and this was great.

138
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,230
And this is how you should do it too.

139
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:37,110
And it was some selenium thing where you'd find the element by CSS selector.

140
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,790
And the selector was this ugly string of HTML because that's the best they could

141
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,910
do. And I said something to the effect of reason

142
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,070
34,986 why I hate selenium.

143
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,830
People write code like people write code like this and are proud of it.

144
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,070
And in many ways I do hate selenium,

145
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,750
but I learned from the internet that I am not freaking allowed to hate selenium.

146
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,440
I had no, why not? Well,

147
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,480
well, unless you want people and actually I gained like 10 followers from that

148
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,040
tweet. So I'm not sure what happened. Apparently,

149
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,880
you know how people follow Donald Trump?

150
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Because they just want to be a firsthand witness to the train wreck.

151
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
I'm assuming that's where my new followers came from.

152
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,120
That one other stupid things I say.

153
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,300
So I got a whole bunch of your,

154
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,420
well I got a whole bunch of twitsplaining.

155
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,420
Is that what it's called? When they explained to me that, oh, well you,

156
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,260
this is just a bad selector. This is bad code. Please don't blame the tool.

157
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,500
That's the nice version.

158
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Angie Jones who I love and respect told me I was irresponsible,

159
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,340
but she did say for someone of your stature.

160
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,980
So I think there's some respect in there too.

161
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,580
I don't think I was irresponsible. Jim Evans,

162
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,900
who's a fricking hero in the selenium community,

163
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,970
he has put so much work into trying to make web driver work for,

164
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,410
especially for IE. I believe he's done some selenium work as well.

165
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,170
He and to give him credit,

166
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,010
he apologized and backed off on this tweet.

167
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,010
He tweets like this are why I consider quitting contributing to open source.

168
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,370
So, well, that's a little bit of an overreaction.

169
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,010
Be backed up. I guess he's taken some heat on other things as well.

170
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,090
People told me that I got a lot of twits.

171
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:35,210
I never got much what's blending,

172
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,090
twitsplaining on using better selectors.

173
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,010
Like here's how you do it.

174
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,770
Well, you need to go to the developer and tell them to give you a data ID.

175
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,290
So you can write a proper selector.

176
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,380
And then I thought, well, all this happened.

177
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,100
And then I thought,

178
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,620
if I'm going to go to the developer and ask them to write a better selector so I can

179
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,220
write my silly UI automation test and then somebody else,

180
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,220
and I'm all over the place here, somebody else, like you will,

181
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,340
that's not testable that way.

182
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,980
You need to get the devs to write testable code,

183
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,300
which brings me to my point of if you have to test at the UI,

184
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,620
if the only way for you,

185
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,540
you to test this application is through the UI,

186
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,100
it's not fricking testable.

187
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,010
Yes.

188
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,660
And nobody gets there is, and this is where the rant goes.

189
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,100
So my problem isn't directly Selenium,

190
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,060
but I'm going to come back to that.

191
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,020
My problem is Selenium.

192
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,580
You know why?

193
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,380
Because Selenium is good.

194
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,540
Selenium is easy, fairly easy to use.

195
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,460
Selenium is used widely to automate UI,

196
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,940
which means you have a bunch of people and I've written UA automation and it is

197
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,980
very, very difficult.

198
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:50,180
I'd rather go write a Blu-ray decoder.

199
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,180
Me too, especially.

200
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,300
You don't know how to code yet,

201
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,780
but here take this Selenium and automate a bunch of UI.

202
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,340
So much wrong with that one.

203
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:00,980
It's hard.

204
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,880
And there is a whole community of people out there making money,

205
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,560
consulting, writing Selenium tests.

206
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,360
There's this idea of an automation engineer, which is, and I don't,

207
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,240
I'm sorry, I've made some of you mad, some of the three,

208
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,400
but if your whole job, and actually this probably isn't true for the three,

209
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,880
but if your whole job is to write UI automation,

210
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
I am so, so sad for you.

211
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,680
You're telling me, I love it.

212
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,240
I love it.

213
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,760
It doesn't, I can't even think of the right analogy that won't make you hate me anymore.

214
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm working it.

215
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,160
We are, and I'm going to get over my rant here.

216
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:34,920
You can jump in.

217
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,200
I'm not sure how to not repeat myself over and over and over and over.

218
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:46,580
But the problem stems from the industries over infatuation with UI automation.

219
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,060
It is, and I'm going to go off for a minute and then I'll let you speak.

220
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm going to hold on one second.

221
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,020
Hold on one second.

222
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,740
I'm holding, I'm holding, I'm turning red.

223
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,140
Steam's coming out of my ears.

224
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,220
There is a phrase that you use.

225
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,940
I forget it.

226
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:03,900
You say MT is the cure.

227
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,080
Modern testing is the antidote for traditional software testing approaches.

228
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,560
Okay.

229
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,180
Now, primed with that, continue your rant.

230
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,070
Because I'm already going to, I'm already going to tell you,

231
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,310
we have been working the solution for this for a long time.

232
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:30,230
I know we have, but when I get responses like this, it reminds me how far behind a

233
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,910
chunk of the industry is we, and I'm not saying don't write UI automation.

234
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,110
All I'm saying is it's a last fricking resort.

235
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,430
You write UI automation when that's the only way you have to verify that

236
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,990
something's working is through the UI.

237
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,630
It should be rare.

238
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,870
You have to write UI automation.

239
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,230
Yeah.

240
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:51,750
You know what?

241
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,190
I'm going to actually say it stronger.

242
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,030
I'm going to say, don't write UI automation.

243
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,550
I've, I said this 10 years ago now in a blog post, it stopped writing.

244
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,590
Every time you, you give it, people don't get, it should be the exception.

245
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,790
Exactly.

246
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,990
That's why I'm so pissed about.

247
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,030
So Brent, I don't know where you are on second amendment rights.

248
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,350
I'm which one's that one?

249
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,260
Is that the gun one?

250
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,340
No, that's the gun one.

251
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,580
Brent, do guns kill people?

252
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,070
No, people do.

253
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,630
People with guns kill people.

254
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,110
So you hear all the time is selenium shitty.

255
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:37,090
No, the opposite is good, but people with selenium are often shitty.

256
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,570
And by I don't mean, and I'm attacking the person in that case.

257
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,410
That's not what I mean.

258
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:49,210
What I mean is 99.9% of the people using selenium are doing it in an asinine

259
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,610
method, whether it's their crappy coding, whether it's their approach to

260
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,370
automating everything to the UI.

261
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,010
I don't care what I automating the UI is the exception.

262
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,770
You do it when you screwed yourself.

263
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,290
That's the only way you have to test it.

264
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,410
And people will argue, give me all their snowflake edge cases on why they

265
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:09,970
have to automate the UI and how Alan, you just don't get it.

266
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,090
You don't understand where the industry is.

267
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,530
And if that's where the industry is, I don't care.

268
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:15,770
Cause that's, I don't want to live there.

269
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:19,330
I want to live in the modern testing world moving forward where we do things

270
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,530
in a way that accelerates the team and delivers customer value more quickly.

271
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,490
Yes.

272
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:26,210
Damn it.

273
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,210
No, no.

274
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,570
Um, you and I have seen it over and over again.

275
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:38,400
The thing there, there, I was actually thinking this morning on the drive in.

276
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,980
And I wonder, I'm just thinking through, do we actually have this in the

277
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:57,010
principles because there is sort of a principle zero, which is something,

278
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:03,920
something, something, right?

279
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,320
I don't know what that is.

280
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,960
It's important.

281
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,640
And it's the single most important thing.

282
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,150
Right.

283
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:19,440
It's we talk about thinking Brent was going to calm everything down.

284
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,960
No, no, actually.

285
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,840
I mean, I had prepped coming.

286
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,000
I think my warning to you yesterday was enough cause I had prepped coming in

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,480
expecting to poke you all this, this podcast, but no, I'm a board.

288
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:43,750
Um, here's one thing about tools, tools and automation when used correctly

289
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,230
are fantastic.

290
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,350
Oh, and let me interrupt for a second.

291
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,190
I got a lot of that.

292
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,030
Any tool can, I heard this over Twitter.

293
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,550
Any tool can be used incorrectly.

294
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,180
Yes, I know that.

295
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,540
Thank you.

296
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,860
Actually, I'm going to disagree with that because I think when it comes to tools,

297
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,380
one of the most important things to close the loop, people will do things

298
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,660
like produce selenium and then go, Oh, look what we've done.

299
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,420
And sure, they've unlocked a great deal of value.

300
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:22,230
But tools, one of the things tools do is it enables lesser trained people to

301
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:29,700
succeed at the same level of highly trained people previous to the tool.

302
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:30,720
Okay.

303
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Are you able to follow that?

304
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,920
I actually was able to follow that.

305
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,680
Fantastic.

306
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
Which is weird.

307
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,400
Now, I can't guarantee you listening.

308
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:49,090
If it reduces the friction around enabling positive outcomes, if the tool has not

309
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:56,920
been designed as such, it also reduces the friction around negative outcomes.

310
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,950
So it allows you to very quickly produce gold and crap.

311
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,510
And if you're not trained or the tool doesn't prevent you, you're going

312
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,270
to go down that path.

313
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,040
There's a big rich topic, GDPR.

314
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm sure you've heard these.

315
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,240
Oh, terms.

316
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,120
Yes, I have.

317
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,480
Okay.

318
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,920
It is chock full of lawyers speak.

319
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,640
Yes, I've read it.

320
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,000
Okay.

321
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,160
You put 10 experts in a room, you will walk out with 11 interpretations.

322
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,080
Okay.

323
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:41,420
And then you try to roll it out to engineers and they are given choices.

324
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,580
If you store the user ID, you have to build up this infrastructure to enable a user to

325
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,660
come in and delete things.

326
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,340
Just as a simple example, like any user that says, delete my data, we have to be

327
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,180
able to delete the data and well aware, well aware.

328
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,430
Now, so what people do is they say, well, screw it.

329
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,750
We're not going to collect any user information.

330
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:09,960
Okay.

331
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,130
Okay.

332
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:16,990
Because that is the easiest way to implement GDPR.

333
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,070
If you don't have user information, then you don't have to do anything.

334
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,910
Of course, that harms the business.

335
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,220
Yes.

336
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,140
And maybe, and this is zero principle.

337
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,020
There is, uh, I was going to say critical thinking earlier, but there's

338
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,700
some systems thinking as well.

339
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,540
You have to realize, Oh, actually it's, there's some, I don't know how we fit this

340
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:39,980
in here.

341
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:47,400
Uh, there's, there's a systems thinking aspect to empty or our job and

342
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:53,210
accelerating the business is looking at the making decisions based on the big

343
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,570
picture, not the short term, right?

344
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,450
And maybe that's covered elsewhere, maybe not, but that's what's missing when I

345
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:05,130
see people infatuated with UI automation as they're solving a short term problem.

346
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,010
And again, we have to, because our, because whatever reason.

347
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:10,170
No.

348
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,170
And, and, and the thing is, is I will just tell you in my head right now, it's

349
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,330
loosely connected, or I don't want to spend the podcast trying to prove it to

350
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:26,290
myself, but I actually think UI automation is another manifestation of the

351
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,810
dysfunction loop that we talk about all the time.

352
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:38,140
We have consultants coming out and, and how can UI automation and we know from

353
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,970
experience that UI automation actually is an entrapment.

354
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:52,410
If you do not spend, I mean, you come in and you go, Oh, look, you, I don't

355
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,090
know, I'm Asian.

356
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,490
It makes your life so much easier.

357
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,450
Look recorded script.

358
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,090
Oh my God.

359
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,250
Consult comes in recorded script.

360
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,810
That's yeah.

361
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,010
You can create a great demo that plays well for the executive.

362
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,650
And then six months later, the executive wonders why 50% of their resources

363
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,410
are constantly updating automation.

364
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,420
Yes.

365
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
And we've been through that loop.

366
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,500
Let me just, uh, I have multiple peeves to get to, but along those same lines,

367
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,580
every day I get at least one of these and it's, I don't know where they

368
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,020
got my email address, but I get one of these good morning, Alan.

369
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,180
I tried reaching you many times, but could not get your attention.

370
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,300
I would like to set up some time to discuss software testing services, test

371
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,740
automation, implementing agile and DevOps seamlessly with you.

372
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,220
And I just never reply because I don't care.

373
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,680
Yeah.

374
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,960
I, I, I get those actually, I get those for data science and

375
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,360
I still get them for tests.

376
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
I do not know why I get it for tests.

377
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,720
I have been out of tests for almost a decade.

378
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,560
Yes, it is not.

379
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:58,760
Yeah.

380
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,800
Anyway, I test hasn't been in my LinkedIn profile, my Twitter

381
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,660
profile for year, at least a year.

382
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,260
And it's no longer at my job title.

383
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,980
So let me talk about, cause I want to bounce back to this.

384
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,490
The last time it weaves some stories together.

385
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,610
The last time I angered the Selenium community, cause this isn't,

386
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:19,170
isn't the first time, believe it or not.

387
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:25,570
When I was as a year ago, when I was prototyping these tests, just, uh,

388
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:30,020
we had a, what I wanted to do as a leader.

389
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,620
So often I'll just, I'll just bootstrap something here.

390
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,940
The proof of concept.

391
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,620
I don't have time to write a lot of code.

392
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:40,340
Uh, when I get my hands dirty, I want to do things that are important,

393
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,460
but not critical.

394
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,700
I mean, I don't want to be known to be blocked on me.

395
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,500
So doing these little projects of whether it's analysis tools or I'll

396
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,740
write some new animation, whatever.

397
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:55,700
Uh, we had a website I wanted to write some new animation for, and it was

398
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:01,140
angular and the de facto test framework for angular is protractor, which is

399
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,980
a wrapper around Selenium that uses some, it's just, there are a gazillion

400
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,180
wrappers around Selenium.

401
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,620
I started writing a test in protractor.

402
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,300
I got halfway through it.

403
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,820
I thought, I can't do this anymore.

404
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,700
I can't, this, this code's the way it's ugly.

405
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,180
The way I have to do weights, I think is ugly to synchronize rather than

406
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,820
sleep, so you just wait for things to appear and you have to verify

407
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,700
everyone as it surely is a better way.

408
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:29,340
So we would, so it's an event driven sleep.

409
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,140
Is that what you're saying?

410
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:33,020
No, no, rather than do a sleep, it's an event driven sleep.

411
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,900
It's wait for object.

412
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,100
Okay.

413
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Every UI animation tool has these things, but you end up wrapping

414
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,380
everything in this wait for object things and it's, I get it, but.

415
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,460
And I understand cause I've written a lot of you animation.

416
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,740
I've written enough UI animation to know why I hate it.

417
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,500
So, so there, so anyway, I got halfway through.

418
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,940
I said, I can't do this.

419
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,660
I can't write code like this.

420
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,180
I can't say somebody here, this works and give it to them.

421
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,620
So I wanted to check out some of the other things that were out there.

422
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:05,020
So I looked at cypress, which I like, uh, didn't love, but then I checked

423
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:13,470
out this thing called test cafe, which, uh, I thought was much, much easier to use.

424
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,430
Uh, the, the code, I could be more compact.

425
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,230
I'll let you look at it yourself.

426
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:19,750
I will not.

427
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,110
And okay, that was for the readers, not for you.

428
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,230
So anyway, I wrote these proof of concept tests and test cafe.

429
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:32,550
And I posted something to the effect of, uh, just spent some time with test cafe today.

430
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,150
Uh, so far I'm liking it a lot more than selenium.

431
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:42,390
And I might've said for some, you know, and oh my God, sparking wars.

432
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,030
I cannot believe the people who told me everything that was wrong with test cafe,

433
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,430
which boils down to this.

434
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,150
Basically they called it.

435
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:52,390
I don't know if you remember when selenium ID was out.

436
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:59,950
One of the reasons people didn't like it is it does what test cafe does is that

437
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,070
rather than interact with the, with the, uh, the object model, it injects JavaScript.

438
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,470
So they go, Oh, once you, once you inject JavaScript in your page, it's not the

439
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,950
same page that customers see.

440
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,830
So it's different.

441
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:16,850
And I thought, really, that's your worry.

442
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,930
But what happened was I did my development.

443
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,650
Well, so it is different.

444
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,090
Yes.

445
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,050
And I don't care.

446
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,890
I mean, again, I'm right.

447
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,530
But I'm what degree, right?

448
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:27,850
Sure.

449
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,610
Page loading times don't use this technique.

450
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,090
No, no, no, no.

451
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,610
Right.

452
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,330
So, so anyway, what happened was I did my development and again,

453
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,490
the tests are running a year later.

454
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:46,870
So there's that, uh, also I developed the test using Chrome.

455
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:49,030
I thought, well, one of us runs under Firefox.

456
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,390
I just changed the command line.

457
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:50,790
Oh yeah.

458
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,190
It runs perfectly under Firefox.

459
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:52,430
Wow.

460
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:52,950
That's cool.

461
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,990
How about Safari?

462
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:56,510
Damn, it runs there too.

463
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:01,510
Let me tell you my experience in a previous job, I'm sure as it's all been fixed

464
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,510
since then, except for every time I ask anybody about it, Selenium works

465
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:11,280
wonderfully as long as you're using Chrome, my cross browser compatibility,

466
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,080
my experience using complex websites was that we eventually got our

467
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,440
automation to work on Firefox.

468
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,880
We never got it to work properly on IE or, uh, and, and again, credit to Jim

469
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,800
Evans, I think probably IE is much better.

470
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,160
This was three years ago last time I tried this.

471
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,290
So I'm sure it's much better, but I'm fine with injecting JavaScript into my

472
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,570
page, if it gives me cross browser compatibility.

473
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,410
And then as I'm looking more into this, I see a school of people saying, well,

474
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,850
you don't really need to test cross browser.

475
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:41,570
They're close enough.

476
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,890
You can just test on Chrome.

477
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,370
It's fine.

478
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,940
And it's like you're justifying away limitations in the tool.

479
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,300
So I don't, you know what?

480
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,900
You know what?

481
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,740
If that's true, then, then I'm going to go back to, you know what?

482
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,500
No UI automation at all, which is where I'm going back to.

483
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,820
For me, cross browser testing is one of the places where Selenium is a fit.

484
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,420
Right.

485
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,940
Oh, yes.

486
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,620
But you have to be, it takes effort again.

487
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,340
I have it.

488
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:16,300
And to be fair for the people who are sending in hate mail, uh, to the show,

489
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,300
uh, that goes to Alan at angry weasel.com.

490
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,380
Please write an all caps so I can filter appropriately.

491
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:24,460
Wait, wait.

492
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,220
You have an email filter for all caps messages.

493
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:28,860
That's pretty cool.

494
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,780
Not yet.

495
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,420
Not yet.

496
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,420
But I'll, I'll read, I'll read them all and, um, probably reply to none, but I'm,

497
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,380
I'm, I'm glad to take your hate or on Twitter.

498
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:42,940
Uh, cause apparently that's where I receive a lot of my hate messages.

499
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,700
Uh, DMS, cause my DMS are open.

500
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,380
Oh my God.

501
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,300
You should see the DMS.

502
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,140
Hating Alan only makes them stronger.

503
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,620
And, and the hate is the explaining on like, they're telling me how to write

504
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,700
better code because I highlighted this shitty code on the internet.

505
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,220
Anyway, where was I before the hate mail?

506
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,020
What were we going to hate me about?

507
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,060
Oh, I just realized I just came up with an acronym that you're a sith

508
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,060
software integration testing hater.

509
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:14,020
And the more you send him hate, the stronger he becomes.

510
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,420
Yes.

511
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,620
Yeah.

512
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:16,980
Yeah.

513
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,660
The hate mail is, uh, I'm sure that writing cross browser automation is much

514
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,980
easier than my experience again.

515
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:24,940
It was three years ago.

516
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,220
The last time I worked on this, that's great.

517
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,940
And I was, and you will tell me how awesome it is.

518
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,420
And I heard about being in a second and that's great too.

519
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,540
But the, honestly, I still really don't give a crap about UI automation.

520
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,630
When I was in Bing, I just did like, I, um, so I used,

521
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,230
it and it just worked.

522
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,830
But I really don't know anything about it, but we did use Selenium quite

523
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,470
effectively to do cross browser.

524
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,140
And when I was in Bing, which is now got close to 10 years ago.

525
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,460
Yeah.

526
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,940
I wonder if the challenge for us was, uh, angular and, or the protractor

527
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,860
wrapped her around it, but maybe, but, but anecdotally, when I've talked

528
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,180
to people who use Selenium and brought this up, they say, Oh yeah, yeah.

529
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,060
Definitely works best on Chrome.

530
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,500
When an angular come, cause I actually, I don't remember having

531
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,220
angular conversations when I was in Bing.

532
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,180
Wasn't around back then.

533
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:25,660
Okay.

534
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,230
Diving in here and say, well, Alan, you talked about test cafe.

535
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,390
You can't totally hate it.

536
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:39,570
Uh, again, I'm talking about two or three UI tests or two or three scenarios

537
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,930
covered by UI tests for a very large website that's largely tested elsewhere.

538
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,650
I'm not saying don't write you animation.

539
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:51,530
I'm saying I kind of saying that, but well, while, while Brent says don't do it,

540
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,970
I'm going to say it's, it's, it's the last resort.

541
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,610
It's when you can only test things.

542
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,090
And I, I did it reluctantly.

543
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:02,690
I'm just going to say, don't do it because the people who know why I'm saying

544
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,610
that we'll know how to execute the exceptions.

545
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,130
Right.

546
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:07,810
Right.

547
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,290
And that, and that's the difference.

548
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:13,970
That's the complete, that's the opposite approach of these people who are hating

549
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:19,620
me on Twitter is that one and I'm picking on selenium because selenium is the

550
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,460
de facto standard for web automation, hands down and I'll, I'll, I've used test

551
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,420
cafe and had success.

552
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,460
I'm sure it has other limitations because I haven't used it extensively and I

553
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,460
never will because I never want to see it used extensively.

554
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,180
It's a last resort when you, when you want to do a tiniest little bit of UI

555
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,580
automation, cause you know, the exception.

556
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,500
I can't even keep my thoughts straight.

557
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,460
Cause I'm so angry about this whole thing, but there's a,

558
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:48,940
there's a lot of people that make their living writing UI automation every day.

559
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,020
And that's great.

560
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,460
I'm glad you can get paid for that, but

561
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,860
are you, I'm not,

562
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,500
I'm always happy when people can pay their bills.

563
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:58,820
So that's great.

564
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:01,890
I'm just like, you know what?

565
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:07,850
No, that's, that's too, I have a metaphor, but that's too harsh.

566
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:16,040
I actually think it's, I might even be able to weave an argument that UI

567
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:23,180
automation, given how testing is in the culture, given the empty stuff that we're

568
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:30,230
talking about, I think I could make the argument that UI automation is immoral.

569
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:36,630
So I'm, I got a lot of feedback from various consultants writing, you know,

570
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,940
who, who as part of their consultancy, right?

571
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,260
You animation for their clients and they say, well, and they give me like,

572
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,060
oh yeah, we, we're very smart about this.

573
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:52,060
And I work with my clients on testability and yes, you want to test at a lower level.

574
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,260
And then blah, blah, blah.

575
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,820
And I can picture me someday as I figure when my kids are done with college, I can

576
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,780
quit my regular jobs and do some part-time consulting.

577
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,820
That's part of my, that that's, I think my life plan at this point.

578
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:11,140
And I can imagine me going to a company and I'll probably get called in for some

579
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,980
quality consulting because that's in my past.

580
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,340
And I'm just imagining this life in me, but I'm, I'm picturing this scenario.

581
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,340
We didn't need all that set up.

582
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,620
They say, Hey, what we want to, can you help us with this, with this web

583
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,660
automation we want to do?

584
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,380
And I say, no, and never call me again.

585
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,020
You're dead to me.

586
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,730
I don't want to work for people like you.

587
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:39,010
I would suggest perhaps you instead of a strike one, you're out, maybe go to

588
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:39,730
strike two.

589
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,250
Yeah.

590
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,050
Luckily it's a few years away.

591
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,330
I could work on my negotiation skills, but I just, I just thinking that is not

592
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,850
something I ever want to do.

593
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:50,970
Could I do it?

594
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,730
Yes.

595
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,770
Would I hate myself for doing it?

596
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:54,250
Definitely.

597
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:54,650
Yes.

598
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,380
And that should be, that's what you should respond with instead of the other

599
00:33:59,380 --> 00:33:59,860
message.

600
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,620
Well, again, I have years to work on this.

601
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:09,260
My job here is to help your business and what you just asked me to do.

602
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,780
I know we'll harm your business.

603
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,140
So no, I won't.

604
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,500
Here's an alternative.

605
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,620
I would suggest that's, that's what Alan, the consultant should work.

606
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:19,860
Yeah.

607
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:23,620
I, again, I got years, but I go back to principle water and our priority

608
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:29,030
is to improve the business that brings in that systems thinking, because

609
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:32,270
we have to look at that and go, this is, I get why you want this.

610
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,870
It's buried in lean in the, in number two with lean thinking as well.

611
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,030
Cause if you follow, if you follow lean.

612
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,310
No, lean is like one of the principles of lean is measure the whole.

613
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,760
Not H-O-L-E.

614
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,120
Yeah.

615
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,760
I know it.

616
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,640
I know what you mean.

617
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:54,440
And I think again, going back to root cause is one is the, the massive

618
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,240
infatuation with UI testing.

619
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,960
And I think unfortunately it's still a big chunk of the industry where the

620
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,840
dev team air quotes and the test team, more air quotes are siloed separate

621
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,800
organizations and with stuff thrown over the wall.

622
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,160
And that's not modern testing.

623
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,240
It's not the world we want to live in.

624
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,760
No, actually.

625
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,040
Yeah.

626
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,120
Did you just say no, actually?

627
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:16,440
Yeah.

628
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,440
Maybe.

629
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,120
Cause that was cool.

630
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm going to highlight that.

631
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,920
I'll put a little bit, put a little reverb on that.

632
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,800
No, actually.

633
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:24,600
Yeah.

634
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:25,870
Nope.

635
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,890
No, I'm, I mean, probably that's okay.

636
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,730
That's what party already been doing that.

637
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,410
That's what editing's for.

638
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,010
We're good, man.

639
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,820
Um, damn it.

640
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,340
I got, I got to leave some of that in.

641
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:49,100
Uh, uh, so anyway, I hope that I don't know if I've explained myself

642
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,980
around my comments or if I've just put more fuel on the fire, but I

643
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,420
stand by all of that and again, I, I have to hate Selenium a little bit

644
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,530
because it has enabled these things to happen.

645
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,300
So I know it's not Selenium.

646
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,020
And I know people have worked very, very hard on it.

647
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,780
And I know people work really, really hard.

648
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,580
And it's not like they're incompetent people.

649
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,300
Good people are doing good work with these tools, but the problem is they're,

650
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,820
they're solving a problem.

651
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,260
They're solving the wrong problem.

652
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,580
The problem is the problem.

653
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
Definitely isn't that we need more UI animation.

654
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:28,580
Right.

655
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,760
It's, it's what they're doing is you said it actually, there's

656
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,640
no way to make it better.

657
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,360
They're solving the wrong problem.

658
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,440
And they're solving the wrong problem very well.

659
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,320
Right.

660
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,920
Um, and that's a really good way of putting it.

661
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,200
You're really, I'll use that somewhere.

662
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:54,480
So as you know, I played a part in creating an automation infrastructure.

663
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,640
Uh, I almost remember the name, some Greeky stunning name.

664
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,560
That's Perseus.

665
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,280
Yeah.

666
00:36:59,400 --> 00:36:59,920
Look at me.

667
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,280
It's patented.

668
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
It is still in operation today.

669
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,240
Sorry.

670
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,640
And I invented it in 1998.

671
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:09,640
Okay.

672
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:17,710
Now I wrote a blog about this and I realize, so at the time I was like,

673
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,870
Oh, this is a problem.

674
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,270
And I solved that problem and I did it very well, but I realize

675
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,870
that's the wrong problem.

676
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,340
What I did was.

677
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:35,600
Reduce the friction around the organization going in the direction that

678
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,800
they wanted to go, but they shouldn't have wanted to go.

679
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,910
It encouraged it.

680
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,630
It encouraged.

681
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:53,300
Dev pushing quality downstream because we now in, in exchange had such a

682
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,500
rich automation system.

683
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:01,100
I've heard multiple stories where dev just wrote code, didn't think about it.

684
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,810
We'd submit it to the test system, come back a half hour later and

685
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,850
then fix the test cases.

686
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:09,450
Yeah.

687
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,810
It's like, they're, it's like, I automated the safety net.

688
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,130
It's like an extra warning level on their compiler.

689
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,210
I don't have to, I don't have to think about quality because the test

690
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:23,170
told me if I screwed up and I made it really easy for, for them to.

691
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:27,130
I enabled thoughtless behavior.

692
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,460
So I'm wondering, I'm an interrupt before I forget my thought.

693
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,460
Cause I'm old.

694
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,180
I'm wondering if there's a term in lean or elsewhere for when this concept of

695
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:40,700
solving the wrong problem really well.

696
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:46,230
And someone can help me out on what that is, but that's, I'm scared to ask Twitter.

697
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,110
They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll twitsplain it to me.

698
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:52,470
I'm thinking in, in, uh, in medical terms, right.

699
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:56,650
It's, it's solving the symptom, not the problem.

700
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,050
And there's some clever, witty things.

701
00:38:59,050 --> 00:38:59,450
Yeah.

702
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,290
And I, and I guess it is that maybe it is.

703
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:07,450
Just that, but I like this idea of solving the wrong problem really well, which is what

704
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,490
the people who are experts in selenium I think are doing.

705
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,820
And they're going to be mad at me for saying that, but I fully believe that.

706
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,420
Now we'll tell you that.

707
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,980
We're actually taking it.

708
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:21,820
I mean, it does occur to me that with MT, this is the first time it really has

709
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:28,760
occurred to me with MT, we, we are potentially, um, that's another aspect

710
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,860
of traditional that accidentally we're taking head on.

711
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,460
Cause it's dumb.

712
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,580
Right.

713
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,260
It's inefficient.

714
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:50,100
Why does selenium, why does UI tests and exists because test or dev

715
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,500
doesn't create testable code.

716
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:58,100
And we have to go through the top layer in order to cover the whole thing in the

717
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,500
end.

718
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:58,820
Right.

719
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,570
And because of that, now why is that?

720
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Because that's not what they're paid for because there's a separation

721
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,000
between testers and developers.

722
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,520
Yep.

723
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,160
Right.

724
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,120
And then given, given those worlds, yeah, selenium makes sense.

725
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:18,860
But I'm like, no, get rid of those worlds.

726
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:21,180
That's not the world we think the industry should be in.

727
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,460
No, I, I, you know what?

728
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,690
And I get it that it exists.

729
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:29,410
The developer is responsible for their own integration testing.

730
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:36,860
I can guarantee you any developer worth their salt will not test this at the UI level.

731
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,400
They will not.

732
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:46,260
And if, if you want to push quality up the stream, like the single most

733
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:51,390
effective technique I have done is I've stopped the enablement.

734
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,150
So when I was last in the test role, I'm like, you know what?

735
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,270
My team is no longer providing the service.

736
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:06,180
And my team is also no longer holding accountability over code correctness.

737
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:07,600
Yeah.

738
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,560
Even those two changes do whatever you want.

739
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,560
One of the thought experiments I threw out in our Slack group, one of the three.slack.com

740
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,080
you can go to modern testing.org to find the link to join.

741
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,200
One of the things I threw out there as a thought experiment was imagine, let's say

742
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,200
that UI testing was an unsolved problem and deemed impossible to solve by the

743
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:34,480
industry. So in other words, imagine UI testing is impossible and doesn't exist.

744
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,500
Now what do you do?

745
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,200
Well, that's clearly you, you hire.

746
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:47,280
Uh, an army of offshore vendors or, you know, crowdsource you test.com baby.

747
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,200
I guess that's an option.

748
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:53,640
That is probably an option a lot of companies would take, but I think you

749
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,920
would figure out how to test it another way.

750
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:03,190
And, and, and in actually today's world, you wouldn't do that because that so much

751
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,790
slows down your cycle time.

752
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,200
That approach honestly, just a ticking.

753
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,480
I, I, I, I think you don't test at all.

754
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,840
You ship straight to the customer.

755
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,280
I think teams that invest heavily in UI automation don't really care about cycle

756
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,260
time again, someone will tell me you're wrong about that.

757
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,580
We have these automation.

758
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,540
We run all the time and we ship seven times a day.

759
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:25,980
That's great.

760
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:27,900
Well now, but I want to be super clear.

761
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:34,010
We may even need to break down the taxonomy of UI automation,

762
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,610
UI automation to do integration testing, abjectly dumb,

763
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:43,650
do not do it ever. Please dear God, stop.

764
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,740
Cross browser integration. I think that's the place where it makes sense.

765
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,740
If you're trying to automate particular UI interactions,

766
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,020
like, Hey, what happens when you click this button?

767
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,140
Hey, it depresses. Sure.

768
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:05,020
If what you're trying to test is that the, the UI elements do UI element things.

769
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,300
Sure. That makes sense.

770
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:13,940
But in terms of trying to test the product end to end, it is terribly

771
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,780
in productive, terribly inefficient.

772
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:24,460
And, and now on this, like I'm firmly convinced it's, it is encouraging.

773
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,420
The dysfunction loop.

774
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:30,940
I would like to point out that also on the Slack group yesterday,

775
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,420
Brent said he was going to come in and poke me and,

776
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,980
and challenge me on some of my statements about this,

777
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,100
but instead he's doubled down even harder than me.

778
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:43,970
Oh yeah. No, no, no.

779
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:47,570
And it's actually because by me making that statement, I primed you,

780
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,810
the, which I'm going to argue softened you a little bit for the podcast.

781
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,330
And I also primed myself.

782
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,010
That was soft. What's that?

783
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:56,810
I was soft. Softened. Okay. All right.

784
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,250
But I think my metaphor I should with you, you realize that if,

785
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:03,810
if you went down that anything down that direction,

786
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:08,650
you were not going to win because you don't agree with it anyway.

787
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,830
Right. It's in the metaphor I said is, is essentially,

788
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,780
Hey, Alan, are you expecting the slim? Are you,

789
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,660
are you complaining that a hammer doesn't work as a wrench?

790
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,460
Right. Or a screwdriver, whatever.

791
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,980
Well, again, that, that, and that's funny.

792
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,900
You say that because that's what you came up with earlier.

793
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,060
And so we're solving the wrong problem really well. Right.

794
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:38,770
It's the same thing. Right. It's, um, you, you, you have your house.

795
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:42,490
Let's say you have black mold, right? Throughout your walls.

796
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:46,830
So you paint over it or wallpaper. Yeah. Right.

797
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:53,040
Looks nice. Now you didn't solve the problem. Nope.

798
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,400
Just a matter of time before it comes back and hit you.

799
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,480
Actually, maybe we should build a counter selenium tool and call it black mold.

800
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,970
Well, you know where they came up with the name selenium?

801
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,260
I'm guessing they looked at the element chart.

802
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:17,770
Not quite periodic chart. Remember when mercury was really popular? No.

803
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:20,990
I forget the name of their automation tool. Anyway, uh,

804
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,150
this called selenium cause selenium is the antidote for mercury poisoning.

805
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:30,270
Oh, interesting. You ever tell you why I called my tool Perseus?

806
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,750
Why? Because the competing automation was called Medusa.

807
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,100
Yeah. Please don't,

808
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,740
Brent and I have lived these mistakes for you.

809
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,930
It's a different world now. I feel like we know what we're talking about.

810
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,020
So yeah, don't, don't make the same mistakes we made. No, actually,

811
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:02,220
it's go to principle. So I agree with what you're saying,

812
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:06,980
but I'm going to say it even further. When you think about UI automation,

813
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:13,340
think deeply about principle number one,

814
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:20,100
and don't just go, well, we have to know stop it because you don't,

815
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:24,100
I can tell you on multiple different teams I've been on it.

816
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,100
Once you go down this route,

817
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:30,870
it is a matter of time before all your test resources,

818
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,390
all they are doing is maintaining UI automation.

819
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:39,070
Been there, been there, been there. Oh my God.

820
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,510
And you can not,

821
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,500
even if it is still your job to validate co correctness,

822
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,690
you will not be able to do that.

823
00:46:51,370 --> 00:46:53,530
And it's just a matter of time.

824
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:58,570
Once you go down the route of choosing to use UI

825
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:00,330
automation to solve this problem.

826
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,920
Yeah. I wonder if, and we got it closed here in a second,

827
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,710
but I wonder if one of the suggestions I got was in my

828
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,990
Twitch splitting day was need to go to the developer and ask him to make that

829
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:16,030
code more testable and do it this way. That's great. I knew that.

830
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:16,990
I'm making a point here,

831
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,470
but I wonder if another conversation is to have,

832
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,710
if your job is to write a bunch of UI automation is to have a

833
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:28,750
conversation of ask if that testing needs to be done.

834
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:32,190
I wonder how much I'm wondering now how much you animation is not

835
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,430
not last resort only we can test it,

836
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,910
but it's because their job is to write you animation and they're testing

837
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:42,870
something that's actually completely tested by other tests.

838
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:46,230
And they're not actually getting any new information from that UI testing

839
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,070
investment.

840
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:51,430
I think there's also potential of a lot of self justification as well.

841
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,950
I believe that as well. There was.

842
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,630
And it's a set. This is why I said it's sort of the automation version of MT,

843
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:02,630
right? It's because we see that when we go and say we talk about principle seven,

844
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:07,860
we see like, well, who's going to test it? Devs can't.

845
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:11,260
There's two subjective, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

846
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:15,580
No, it's self justification. Yeah, it is. Absolutely. Absolutely.

847
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,860
I need to exist because I need to exist. Yes.

848
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,020
I I've heard that one too. I've heard it. I've heard it. I've heard it.

849
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,300
There was other Twitter drama that we are not going to get to today.

850
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,220
So I'll leave it to the listeners to discover and learn,

851
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,820
but all these cool stuff going on. I have work to do.

852
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,740
We'll ignore Twitter today. Good luck.

853
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,500
I'll edit the podcast tomorrow and we'll get it out there. All right.

854
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:43,580
That was fun. Thanks, Brett. You bet. All right. See you next time.
