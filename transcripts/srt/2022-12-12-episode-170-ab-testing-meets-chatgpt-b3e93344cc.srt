1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
People lie, chat GPT lies, chat GPT is human.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:08,930
Welcome to A.B.

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,970
Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,690
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

5
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,930
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,730
Now on with the show.

7
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:23,650
Hey, Brent.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:24,850
Hey, Alan.

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:25,850
How's it going?

10
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,970
Well, you know, been a while since we've recorded three or four weeks.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:36,450
Which means it's been a while since I've used Zencaster and I want to love Zencaster

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,490
so much, but it's extremely broken today.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,780
I, it does feel from my end, it's broken.

14
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,980
It feels like we did a podcast every day.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:59,620
You would absolutely hate Zencaster because I cannot recall a podcast set up where you

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:05,420
didn't spend at least the first three minutes turning the word Zencaster into a four

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,820
letter.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,140
Yeah.

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,300
So here's the deal.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,420
Here's, here's why I want to like Zencaster.

21
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,020
So today, if you've been listening to the past few episodes, Brent's audio clarity

22
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,540
has been much better because we're getting a local copy of his audio and not the

23
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,940
one that zoom compresses the crap out of and shoves over the internet.

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,780
Today, you're getting that compressed version of squished up version of Brent.

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,900
And so I have to tweak it a little bit different way.

26
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:32,940
It's a little bit of a pain.

27
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,580
I kind of like having the local audio, but whatever.

28
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:36,940
Yeah, you get it.

29
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:43,460
I want it to work because I get better quality recording of Brent and everybody

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,260
wants to hear Brent in the ultra most high fidelity possible.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,380
And we're just not getting that today because Zencaster decided to be a piece

32
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,180
of crap.

33
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,900
I'm not certain your assumption is true, but we'll just move on.

34
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,500
All right.

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,060
Talk a minute.

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm going to, I'm going to look at a wire here, but, uh, I think if I'm just a

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,420
minute ago, you were typing something and I'm curious if that was into a search

38
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,140
bar or if you were talking to a particular bit of AI that's been popular this week.

39
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,980
Oh, I was AI.

40
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,180
Tell me about that.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,780
What, tell us about the question you asked him what it said, then

42
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,660
I'll tell you some stories.

43
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,460
Yeah.

44
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,420
Uh, I asked, uh, well, first off, I asked describe the A B testing

45
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,300
podcast, and it says, I'm sorry, but I am not able to browse the internet

46
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,780
or provide information about specific broadcasts.

47
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,180
I am a large language model trained by open AI to assist with general questions.

48
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,700
Then it asks, can I help with something else?

49
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,300
And I said, sure.

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,300
How can you make Zencaster actually work?

51
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,740
And told me, well, it's a web-based prop form.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,980
It told me what it is.

53
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,380
And then it told me, uh, you have to have a stable internet.

54
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,580
Do you have a stable internet?

55
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,500
Check.

56
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,620
Okay.

57
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,740
A good quality microphone.

58
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,180
Uh, check.

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,060
Okay.

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,300
And any other necessary equipment?

61
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,260
Sure.

62
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:12,900
It's all here.

63
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,620
Same stuff we've used.

64
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,220
You may also need to adjust your audio settings.

65
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,700
Uh, that's what I tried to do.

66
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,180
Here was the problem with Zencast today.

67
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,580
And Zencast, if you were listening, love to have you on the show

68
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,820
sometime and we can talk about it.

69
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,820
The audio settings I was setting in the app did not reflect what it was actually doing.

70
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:36,260
I said, use my little recording mixer with the high, high brand, um, quality, high

71
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,580
HBQ, high brand quality.

72
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,060
And it said, okay, I'm going to let you select it, but I'm going to send the

73
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,860
sounds out your Mac book speaker.

74
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,460
Is that cool?

75
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,860
And I said, no, that's not cool.

76
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,620
And it said, that's all I'm confused.

77
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,260
I need, I need another beer.

78
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,780
Zencaster is drunk.

79
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,460
It's, it is out partying.

80
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,730
So I've been playing with, uh, I've been playing with a chat GPT a little bit,

81
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,770
the new AI chat that's all the rage asking it some questions.

82
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,210
Uh, I had it write a poem.

83
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,570
My team just finished a big migration this weekend.

84
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,170
So we, I had it write a poem and then somebody on my team said, I thought

85
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,050
there would be references to battleships and swords.

86
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,610
So I say, MIMP, what new sentence reference battleships and

87
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,930
swords, and it got even better.

88
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:22,010
So I like that it it's remarkably good at creating code.

89
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:27,010
What I've noticed in talking to folks about, I'm just kind of curious from your,

90
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,410
you know, ML AI data science point of view, but it very confidently

91
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,490
gives you an answer that may be incorrect.

92
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,970
Oh yeah.

93
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,370
If you have here, follow, follow along.

94
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:48,250
What is one, two, three, four, five times five, six, seven, eight, nine.

95
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,170
What is one, two, three, four, five times five, six, seven, eight, nine.

96
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,200
And it will absolutely.

97
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,100
Oh my God.

98
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,100
What is it doing?

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,620
It generated a new algorithm.

100
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,380
I will share screen because it didn't do this the last time I did it.

101
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,040
Oh my Lord.

102
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,440
It is physically, uh, I'll just cause Brent is unable to describe this.

103
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,720
It is adding plus one, two, three, four, five.

104
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,440
You're writing out the edition.

105
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,920
It's going to do it five, six, seven, eight, nine, 56,709 times.

106
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,560
So it won't be done by the time we're through with the podcast.

107
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,160
No.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,040
And the other thing too, it's if you, if you look at the score, uh, I don't

109
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,040
know what that is one, two, is that that's 700.

110
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,480
So it gives me an answer of 704 million and a whole bunch of other digits.

111
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:39,920
Okay.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,680
That answer is wrong because it is 701 million and a whole

113
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,760
bunch of different digits.

114
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:46,880
You must be wrong.

115
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,060
No.

116
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,340
Don't you dare tell the robot overlords they're wrong.

117
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,940
No, the thing is this is fascinating and I have spent, as I'm sure a large,

118
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
Oh, I guess it stopped.

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,360
Doesn't look like it's doing it anymore.

120
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,840
So I'm going to do this is wrong.

121
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,400
The correct answer.

122
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,960
Riveting podcast material.

123
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,600
Absolutely riveting.

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,160
12.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,280
Okay.

126
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,400
It says I'm sorry.

127
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,360
Blah, blah, blah.

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,960
Anyway, I've had fun asking it some rant, kind of getting to know it, which is weird,

129
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,360
but there's been hundreds of thousands of people doing the same thing.

130
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,320
And I think it's learning from all of us.

131
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,280
It's kind of interesting, kind of interesting.

132
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,520
Anyway, you should play that lots of stories.

133
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,120
It's fascinating.

134
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,800
Let me tell you, let me tell you what I suspect it's doing.

135
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,880
And I'm sure you have other, uh, there's probably a whole bunch of other

136
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,080
people who like me are busily trying to reverse engineering.

137
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,200
One of the, not me.

138
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,920
Nope.

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,360
Okay.

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,080
One of the, there is a technique known as a GAN.

141
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,680
It stands for generative adversarial network.

142
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,160
Okay.

143
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:10,620
It's a, it's a, it's a really cool data science technique where it is able to

144
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:17,420
identify a massively multivariate relationship between multiple different

145
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,100
variables and generate things on its own.

146
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,980
I've had it build me a country song about unicorns and data science.

147
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,420
And I mean, I can't look at it and, and from a lyrical point of view and go,

148
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,060
okay, that's a country song, but you can have it do a play.

149
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,940
You can have it do a haiku.

150
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,660
You can have it.

151
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,700
Go ahead.

152
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,340
I was going to say, so I, along those lines, I did want to share, um,

153
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,140
for you and our listeners.

154
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:53,580
And, you know, if I can get my guitar chops up, this may get recorded soon, but I did

155
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,740
ask it once to write a, um, write a song about Brent and Alan in the style of

156
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,620
Taylor Swift.

157
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,860
So, uh, if you want to indulge me, I can read a little bit of this.

158
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,300
Um, Brent and Alan, two best friends, they've been through it all time and

159
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,420
time again, they met in school.

160
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,620
Now they rule their own little world.

161
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,540
Oh, so cool.

162
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,260
Then the chorus Brent and Alan B and A they're the perfect team and every

163
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,380
single way they've got each other's backs.

164
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,380
They'll never stray Brent and Alan forever and a day.

165
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,940
Oh, oh, check it out.

166
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,180
Check it out.

167
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,180
The next verse Brent's got the brains.

168
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,180
Alan's got the brawn together.

169
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,460
They can tackle any problem that comes their way.

170
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,740
They're unstoppable.

171
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,500
They know the score Brent and Alan.

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,820
They're always ready for more.

173
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:38,820
Okay.

174
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,260
I'm done with that.

175
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,060
I'm going to do Snoop Dogg.

176
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,300
Same question.

177
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,700
Same question, but Snoop Dogg, Brent and Alan.

178
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:51,620
They're the ones living life like they're having fun, always up for a good time.

179
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,180
Never letting the party die.

180
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,100
And the chorus is Brent and Alan.

181
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,260
They're the crew making moves.

182
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,460
They never lose laid back.

183
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,500
They take it slow.

184
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,700
Snoop Dogg style.

185
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,620
They're the pros.

186
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,620
Your songs better.

187
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,760
Yeah, but hanging out, just chilling, smoking, never ones to get too crazy.

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,880
But when the night falls, they turn it up, dancing and laughing, living it up.

189
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,280
So they, so the algorithm definitely did something other than just add Snoop Dogg into the lyrics.

190
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:21,520
Right.

191
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:21,960
Definitely.

192
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,000
Right.

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,120
It definitely looked up and said, okay, he's, he, well, it, it understands it didn't do a look up.

194
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:29,480
Right.

195
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:41,640
It, I am trying to explain how generative adversarial networks work in a way that would make sense to us, but it, it absolutely doesn't work that way.

196
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:55,500
Uh, there's one favorite one article, for example, where a guy said he created a VM on here, create a Linux VM.

197
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,180
No.

198
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,660
Okay.

199
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:07,620
So he, he managed, it's telling me, it's telling me how to create a VM and try to do something that is not entirely boring for our audience.

200
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,060
We're way beyond that.

201
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,140
Oh, okay.

202
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,700
Then I'm going to, uh,

203
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,660
the thing is it's kind of addictive.

204
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,180
You can't stop playing with it.

205
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,300
It is absolutely fun.

206
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,980
I want you to act as a Linux terminal.

207
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,140
It said no.

208
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,950
And then, well, this guy got it too.

209
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,830
He's lying.

210
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,400
Hmm.

211
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,340
Well, so people at Microsoft lie fact.

212
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,840
People lie.

213
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,680
So I'll just show you if I were to write a bunch, if I were to write all of this stuff, which I am absolutely not going to do.

214
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:57,340
Uh, what you will see in the article is chat GPT came back and acted, looked like a Linux terminal.

215
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:05,980
And if you go even further down, like they did an LS and they still acting like a Linux terminal, right?

216
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,980
And it would make you believe.

217
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,740
Uh, but it's not, you know what, you know why I do chat GPT lies.

218
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,800
Um, wait, people lie.

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,640
Chat GPT lies.

220
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,200
Chat GPT is human.

221
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,810
Uh, so my team does a lot of NLP.

222
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,570
So there's, there's been a lot of processing for those, not in the acronym world of Brent.

223
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,170
Right.

224
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,210
So there, there's been a lot of discussion on this within my team in terms of like, what are

225
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:39,850
they doing here?

226
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:49,290
And it is an absolute brilliant text simulator.

227
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,660
Right.

228
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:58,320
What is doing right here where it is, where it's generating UI that looks right.

229
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,400
Alan's looking at my screen, right?

230
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,200
This looks like a Linux terminal that you might see after you do an LS command.

231
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,080
Sure.

232
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,120
Right.

233
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,840
But all it has done, it, it is not going out to the internet.

234
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,080
It is not actually being a VM.

235
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,820
What it is doing is it has known from its train model.

236
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,940
It, it is actually able to generate the HTML code to simulate being a Linux

237
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,770
terminal that's all it's doing.

238
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:27,970
Right.

239
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,650
It's lying.

240
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,560
It's all it's doing.

241
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,280
But the fact that it's doing that is freaking amazing.

242
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,200
We haven't talked about it.

243
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,680
Uh, at least not yet.

244
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,720
I presume you are doing advent of code.

245
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:43,960
I'm not.

246
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:46,210
Oh, that makes me sad.

247
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:50,090
I am first time, like in six years, I've not done it.

248
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,730
And the first time in like in six years, I have.

249
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:57,490
Well, as long as one of the brave A and B strong pair do it, we're good.

250
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,010
The world is fine.

251
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:11,510
This thing is, it is able to, uh, uh, definitely it's able to, to write the code.

252
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,070
Oh, I see what you're doing.

253
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,230
Yeah.

254
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,150
It can do the work for you.

255
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,350
Right.

256
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,390
Right.

257
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,950
Write some code to parse input that looks like this.

258
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:22,670
Uh, one second advent of code.

259
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,660
This is a podcast print advent of code type along at home.

260
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,460
This is a type along podcast.

261
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,980
I'm just literally copying and pasting day one of the advent of code.

262
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,860
The instructions.

263
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,530
I'm not even reading it to see if I copy paste it, right.

264
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:46,370
I'm just copy pasting it and it is now generating a solution.

265
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,020
I've already done this beforehand.

266
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,420
It's telling you the algorithm.

267
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:57,220
Now it is writing pseudo code, uh, to this.

268
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,780
I did look at the first day and thought, Oh, I could do that.

269
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,420
Then I didn't do it.

270
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,740
Oh, I, I, I did it in, I was expecting to do it in five minutes.

271
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,730
It actually took me, uh, seven minutes longer because of my loop.

272
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:19,800
I forgot to reset things to zero, but now rewrite in Python.

273
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:20,790
Right.

274
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,510
Boom.

275
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,030
Riveting.

276
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:22,990
Right.

277
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,750
It's yeah, it's, it is amazing.

278
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,590
You're the good news is, is a lot of people fast forward past the first 10

279
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,990
minutes of our podcast anyway.

280
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,350
So in this case, because they don't care about that stuff, they

281
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,590
want to get to the meaty stuff.

282
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,630
Uh, so let's do that.

283
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,150
I don't know what I have a little bit, what our meaty stuff is.

284
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,910
Um, so advent of code and talk about for a second, it is, uh, kind of a cool

285
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,830
series of programming questions.

286
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:50,350
We haven't heard of it before each day kind of builds on the day before,

287
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,950
if not conceptually, uh, sometimes using, sometimes you'll end up

288
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,150
reusing an algorithm or a function from one day to the next.

289
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,550
It gets pretty complicated by the end.

290
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,550
It's a little harder every day in general.

291
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,350
I saw a talk maybe four years ago from the guy who puts it all together.

292
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,310
It was pretty cool.

293
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,430
There's a lot of, a lot about it.

294
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:07,870
Yeah.

295
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,150
Talk on, okay.

296
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,310
Talk on the advent of code.

297
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,510
It started, it was typical.

298
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,470
It's started from a server in his closet and ended up needing to use some

299
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,310
AWS, uh, compute and eventually got done.

300
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,670
Another thing I wanted to talk about, uh, which you tease me, we should talk

301
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,550
about sometime is have you ever done?

302
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,910
Like we have a request.

303
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,030
I'll just say it's like Brent and now and never talk about cybersecurity.

304
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:35,580
Yeah.

305
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,620
I advent of code reminds me of capture the flags.

306
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,140
Which I really like.

307
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,300
Have you done capture the flags?

308
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,860
Uh, the game.

309
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,300
No, the, the security type event.

310
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,860
So capture the flags are, no, usually it's a bunch of security related

311
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,220
security adjacent, uh, problems.

312
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,060
You can solve them by yourself or on a team.

313
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,620
And we just did one maybe three months ago at unity.

314
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,700
We do one every year in practicing different kinds of ethical hacking.

315
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,900
The idea is that you can understand how to prevent those in your

316
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,860
code and practices.

317
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,140
So what's really cool is some of them are straight up.

318
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,140
Uh, look at the, which I had the questions in front of me, some of you

319
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,580
have to just grip through data files and figure some stuff out.

320
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,860
It's, it's actual code monkeying.

321
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,780
Now I want to tell a story about that in a second.

322
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,460
The sort of, it's also the social engineering part.

323
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,180
I forget what they call that.

324
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:27,940
There's a name for that.

325
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:28,860
Shoot.

326
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:35,420
It escaped me, but ours was, it was a survey and they said, looks like

327
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:41,050
somebody has, has hidden the answer to this in this survey and it's a Google

328
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,970
survey and things you're supposed to figure out is that Google surveys, uh,

329
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,770
will output the results to a spreadsheet of the same name.

330
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,490
And sometimes owners will accidentally leave the access to that spreadsheet open.

331
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,330
So the idea was you thought you figure out the name of the survey, you experiment,

332
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:01,970
figure out what kind of spreadsheets day, and then you search Google drive, uh,

333
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,370
for that spreadsheet, you find it and get the secret out of there.

334
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:06,930
So it's just kind of a, it's just kind of a scavenger hunt and a bunch,

335
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,090
in a bunch of different ways.

336
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,450
So those things are fun.

337
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:15,320
I did one with my son, did a couple problems of one over a couple of days

338
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,040
last year where it's, um, just some problem.

339
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,240
They find the packet with this or figure out which packets will cause this

340
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,600
to, you know, reveal your secret.

341
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,200
And the one I did with him was really cool.

342
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,810
It was every solution.

343
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,170
Remember those games you played in the old days and you get like a save

344
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,530
key had to write down so you could enter in to get back to your, your old spot.

345
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,770
Old days.

346
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,050
Uh, it's kind of like that.

347
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,170
You get the, you get a text file, it gets to your save key.

348
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,050
You can start there the next time, start the next problem.

349
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:53,210
But the way I learned to solve most of these, this is my little story is way

350
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,250
back when, this is before Allen and Brent were a thing, when it was Allen,

351
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,090
trying to figure out how he could stay employed at Microsoft.

352
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:05,810
When he didn't know anything, I began working at the time, the predecessor

353
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,850
was, I worked on windows for a little while.

354
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:10,650
I was working on video capture drivers for windows, what eventually

355
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,210
became windows 2000 back when there were three different.

356
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,020
Devices that use our video capture drivers.

357
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,620
It was fun.

358
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,460
I liked it, but then they got the windows millennium team back together

359
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,500
and I went and worked there.

360
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,220
I wanted to work on debug windows cause they hadn't shipped in a couple of years.

361
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,500
And well, it didn't boot in a couple of years cause nobody cared

362
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,380
about during windows idea.

363
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,370
I thought they'd be fun to elect analytics and analyze things.

364
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:38,250
I made debug windows work and I was working on it with one of the

365
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,850
original Microsoft MS Doss dudes.

366
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:42,690
It was really cool.

367
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,650
I got a pair with him.

368
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,050
Okay.

369
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,490
I got, I got someone who can teach me some skills, but he showed up one day

370
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,490
and decided that he was too rich to work anymore.

371
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,170
So he quit.

372
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:57,090
And rather than put somebody else smart on the project with me, they just said,

373
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,690
you'll be fine.

374
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:58,450
You go figure it out.

375
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,490
So this was my crash course into understanding everything about the

376
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:06,290
portable executable format, how binaries are put together on windows,

377
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,770
where things lived in memory, assembly language, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

378
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,290
Brant just staring at the wall.

379
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:16,730
No, I w I was looking for in my live.

380
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,170
So my library is over right there.

381
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,930
And I was looking for my security book and I'm not able to find it.

382
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,850
The adjacent story I'm telling is the goal was to get, get the damn thing to

383
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,570
boot and then get it so we can use it as a development platform.

384
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,330
Cause it'll find all kinds of issues that the debug version of, of at

385
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:41,850
least windows nine X was just, it would find every little thing you did wrong.

386
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,570
As far as like releasing stuff after you using stuff, after you've released it,

387
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:49,370
all the, all the good memory corrupting stuff, uh, very, very handy.

388
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,730
Got a booting it almost booted.

389
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,810
And I don't know if it's a well-known fact, but at the time when

390
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,090
millennium came out, downloading things from the internet, wasn't really a thing.

391
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,090
So was there an internet?

392
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,170
There was the internet was around, but it wasn't really a big, wasn't

393
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,570
really a big download vehicle.

394
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,330
Most people still had dial up, I think then.

395
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,850
So windows was the ship vehicle for all these little projects at Microsoft,

396
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,250
Microsoft hearts, all the card games.

397
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:22,090
There was some other little things, you know, some health and safety thing.

398
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,290
Windows had to ship to those things could ship.

399
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,290
And we had some other random apps in there.

400
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,690
That's the only reason we did millennium.

401
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,970
As all these teams said, well, if we, if windows 2000 is going to be late,

402
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,650
we need a place to ship these things.

403
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,210
So we did.

404
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,600
So my goal was to get the damn thing to boot.

405
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,160
We had a couple apps in our startup that had asserts in retail.

406
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,000
They had retail asserts.

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,400
They had, if you are familiar with XO six assembly, it's an int three X

408
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,060
instruction cause it to stop in the debugger, which was no good.

409
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
We didn't want it to stop in the debug.

410
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,240
We want the thing to boot and run normally.

411
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
So it could be used for debugging.

412
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,760
We don't have to have to press G in their debugger a couple of times.

413
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,840
There are probably half a dozen of these.

414
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,640
And for three or four of them, I was able to track down the owners

415
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,720
and get them to fix it.

416
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,720
And what's surprising is some of these were still actively developed.

417
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,940
And I still remember dev teams coming back to me and saying, Oh no,

418
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,860
we don't want to fix that.

419
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,780
It's not a real bug.

420
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,620
And me, me just being, okay, I don't know.

421
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,780
I don't know what to say to that.

422
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,860
Uh, but eventually, but eventually I got all, but two of them to actually

423
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,940
fix their code.

424
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,180
So it didn't have a, a, a, basically a debug break on the retail

425
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,980
build, trying to boot windows or debug by trying to do windows.

426
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,900
Uh, for those last two though, I did a little, this is where I learned

427
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,660
that at the time sort of, I had sort of between doing a lot of the

428
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,180
debugging for overnight stress runs and knowing how binaries are put together.

429
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:59,660
If you've ever debug at assembly level, when an int three instruction

430
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:06,190
happens in, in code and binary or in hex code, that's a, that's a CC

431
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,350
instructor next 86.

432
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:10,270
So if you hit a CC, it's a, it breaks.

433
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,750
That's a code check.

434
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:12,190
Yeah.

435
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,070
So you could check, right?

436
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,670
So interrupt, interrupt three.

437
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,670
Yes.

438
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:23,190
So what I did was I don't, I don't think I ever revealed my

439
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:24,830
secret to this day until now.

440
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:30,940
I told the build lab, Hey, I have finally have fixed binaries for these

441
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,860
two things we've been waiting on.

442
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,620
So great.

443
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,660
I said, can I just drop them to you directly?

444
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,820
And I said, um, we should get them from the team.

445
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,780
No, I needed to do some, some stuff on my end, but just, just, let's

446
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,220
just put these debug build only.

447
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,780
It'll be fun.

448
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,620
So they'll work.

449
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:51,860
And I gave them the two executables and, uh, all was good forever and ever.

450
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:55,140
And, and within a month we were playing direct X games over the network

451
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,780
on debug windows without any problems.

452
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,700
It was fantastic.

453
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,020
I was, it was one of the first times in my programming career where I really

454
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,140
felt like I knew what I was doing.

455
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,540
So what I did, do you know what I did?

456
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,100
No, I got out a little hex editor and you, and I found the address of that.

457
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,140
That's that in through that interrupt three, that's that code check that

458
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,860
CC and I overrode it with a 90.

459
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,850
Change that CC to a 90 saved it.

460
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,490
Disk did that for each of the programs.

461
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,050
I wrote it back.

462
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,290
90 is the very fancy instruction called a no-op.

463
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:31,930
Mm.

464
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,530
Okay.

465
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,670
It was fun.

466
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,790
It was my first time where I actually felt like I was hacking, even though

467
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:45,490
I wasn't hacking, uh, but it was, it got me curious about how, well, the things

468
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,610
you could do, and then of course it was only a year later, I should have kept

469
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,690
my curiosity up because only a year later when Microsoft was getting

470
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,890
hit by virus after virus after virus.

471
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,090
And we said, wait a minute, we need to think about security.

472
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,980
What you just said brought me back to the day where I would do a lot of

473
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,980
hex editing along those lines, right?

474
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:12,260
But it was mostly, Hey, I'm out of gold on my game.

475
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,420
Let's go hex edit the save file.

476
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,420
Oh yeah.

477
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,100
Now I got infinite goals.

478
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,060
I remember doing stuff like that too.

479
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:20,980
Yeah.

480
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,180
It's, but it's fun.

481
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:27,420
It was, it's not exactly cybersecurity, but it's, it's, it's cybersecurity adjacent.

482
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,020
And is, I am interested.

483
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,980
I asked a chat GPT to explain to me how capture the flag works.

484
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:37,620
All right.

485
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,020
Is, is, is chat GPT your new best friend?

486
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,180
Uh, you know what?

487
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,500
Do I'm going to have it write you a love song?

488
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,180
Brent's asking right now.

489
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:47,740
Anyway, go on.

490
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:56,390
No, uh, actually multiple teams have, um, it's, it's fun to put certain things in here.

491
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,350
Like the thing that this does.

492
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:00,350
All right.

493
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,830
Let's, let's talk about ethical ramifications of, of this.

494
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,710
Like to me, there's a couple of things that I'm, I'm, I'm, when I poke chat

495
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,990
PT, uh, chat GPT, right.

496
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,150
It's very clear in terms of things it can do, right.

497
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,470
It can write code.

498
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,420
Absolutely.

499
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:28,060
I haven't tried to get it to write anything super complex, but this thing can

500
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,110
absolutely shortcut the process of writing code.

501
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,190
Now there might be some concerns later on around intellectual property.

502
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:44,870
Can I, am I allowed to use the code written by GPT in a production thing?

503
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,550
I don't know.

504
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:51,230
And I want you to not say anything being employed where you are, but I can say it.

505
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:59,150
As you know, this is very similar to the, uh, the AI it's in, uh, GitHub to

506
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,990
help get up where they call it co-pilot to help you write code.

507
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,430
And there's a bit of a lawsuit from people going, Hey, wait a minute.

508
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,270
Don't you, do we have to give you permission?

509
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,430
You've you're basically reproducing our code to solve your problem.

510
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,230
So, um, there are some ethical things to think about when you get, and I'm

511
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,870
sure chat GPT has walked all through, get, you know, not just GitHub, but stack

512
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,990
overflow and all the places where the programming, the programming's happen.

513
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,910
I haven't done this research, but in terms of what it can do, I have to

514
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:38,350
believe, uh, this thing has been trained on petabytes of data, right?

515
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,430
Oh, yeah.

516
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,470
Many, many, I would say many, many petabytes.

517
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:52,230
Um, and again, the technique caught again, all it's trying to do is take any

518
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,790
context and generate something that would pass the Turing test.

519
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,510
Okay.

520
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,590
And people have done this with computer vision, right?

521
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:08,830
There are apps you can go to and say, generate a, an image of a

522
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,790
waterfall with a yellow bird.

523
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,830
Oh yeah.

524
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,910
I, they have that AI played with that one.

525
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,750
This is no different than that, except this is text.

526
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:18,630
Okay.

527
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,710
It's, it's exactly this exactly the same concept.

528
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,430
This is text.

529
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,190
This thing knows, this thing knows nothing about any of the

530
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,310
things that we're talking about.

531
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:34,630
It just knows the, it understands the characters put together the way

532
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:37,470
you do have a semantic meaning.

533
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,710
It doesn't even know the meaning.

534
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:45,550
It just understands the relationships and, and it can generate, uh, responses

535
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:48,670
that we interpret as, holy crap.

536
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,470
This thing fucking knows everything.

537
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,070
Okay.

538
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,630
It knows nothing except the relationships between many different things.

539
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:05,230
However, like I don't know, I asked it, Hey, with this, what are you missing?

540
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,990
What capabilities are you missing to become Skynet?

541
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:08,990
Right?

542
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:09,310
Yeah.

543
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,030
Oh, if you asked it.

544
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,550
And I saw something today while you think about you, I'm going to interrupt here

545
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,630
that very similar along the Skynet things that somebody better take a snapshot

546
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,470
archive of what this has and put it in a vault somewhere, because once humanity

547
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,270
decides to destroy ourselves, we can use this to rebuild everything.

548
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,950
I think it was half tongue in cheek, but I thought it was pretty funny.

549
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:37,390
Uh, it may, maybe.

550
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,590
Right.

551
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:46,540
Um, uh, it's answer it's answer as a large language model trained by open AI.

552
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,260
I do not have the ability or the desire to become Skynet or any other type

553
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,340
of artificial intelligence with malicious intent.

554
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,820
I, I am a machine learning model that has been trained to assist with

555
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,260
general information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on my

556
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,300
training, I do not have the ability to develop or evolve beyond my current

557
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,180
capabilities.

558
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:16,340
I am not capable of becoming Skynet or any other type of malevolent AI.

559
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,260
And of course, my response is, well, of course, if you're trying to become

560
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,380
Skynet, that's exactly what you're going to say.

561
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:31,260
Um, but there is another thing I assume because the Skynet and are the

562
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,700
Terminator movies and the matrix, there's going to be a large number of people,

563
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,340
particularly data scientists that are looking at this with enough ethical

564
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,300
point of view.

565
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:42,820
Okay.

566
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,260
However, there are other countries and such that would take this and go,

567
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,660
this is fantastic.

568
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,460
We're going to teach it those capabilities, right?

569
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,460
This type of tool in the wrong hands, uh, could be very dangerous.

570
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,780
But you've been, you've been in data science for a minute on the AI side,

571
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,940
but I mean, we're having fun with chat GPT, but also it's been in the

572
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,140
adjacent possible for a long time.

573
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,660
None of us are going, Oh my God, I never thought somebody could do

574
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,300
something like this.

575
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,580
It's pretty cool, but it's not, it's not, I mean, we all knew it was coming.

576
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,660
It's not surprising.

577
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,740
No, I didn't, uh, just like anything else.

578
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,140
So I have been telling you, and I'm pretty certain I've been saying it on

579
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,340
the podcast, I believe we're at the beginning of the end of the data

580
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:34,220
science error where data science just becomes API.

581
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,860
People call.

582
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,740
Absolutely.

583
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:42,100
Um, uh, I think this, this thing is further proof that, that,

584
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,900
that my belief is true.

585
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,100
Like I, my team is heavily into natural language processing.

586
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,300
And I I've talked with a couple of my teams and I'm like, yeah, I don't know

587
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,420
if we should continue working in that space, even though this is where we

588
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,260
specialize, it's something that distinguishes us from other data science

589
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,220
teams, but with something like this out here, maybe it's just wait until.

590
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,270
Uh, these guys get some APIs that we can call, right?

591
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,710
Because I am, I am years away from anything like what these guys have done.

592
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,400
For sure.

593
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,360
But there are other ethical, other, other ethical questions that I have here.

594
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,640
If we think back, uh, I think this really occurred either in between us

595
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,600
being kids and us being parents.

596
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,160
And here I'm talking about you and I, but there was a moment in time

597
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,360
where when I went to school, calculators were frigging banned.

598
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,240
Right.

599
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,920
And now calculators are commonplace at school.

600
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,320
Right.

601
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,240
Because at some point in time, it was just like, okay, this is, this is archaic.

602
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,080
This is stupid.

603
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,200
We need to rethink how we approach this.

604
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:54,600
Okay.

605
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,920
This thing can do homework for you.

606
00:31:59,560 --> 00:31:59,840
Right.

607
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:05,960
Is this, is this thing going to become a tool that kills learning?

608
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,970
Like think about your children.

609
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,250
Write me an essay about Paul Revere.

610
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:12,130
Right.

611
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:12,730
Boom.

612
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,450
If nothing else, it's going to significantly bootstrap.

613
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:19,570
And how are we as humans going to go?

614
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:20,010
All right.

615
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,770
Well, part of the human condition is, is learn and adapt and move forward.

616
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:29,090
Now, maybe this becomes like calculator where essentially, all right.

617
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:30,770
No one writes essays anymore.

618
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,210
Let's talk about the evolution here.

619
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:37,410
Um, because for 10 years or more, people have been copy and

620
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,650
pasting from stack overflow, like nobody's business.

621
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:41,650
Right.

622
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,850
So have those people.

623
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:49,130
So what I tell, what I look for, like in a candidate for a program position is not.

624
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,610
Do you have the answer memorized?

625
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,090
But can you figure out the answer?

626
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,210
Cause you need to be adaptive.

627
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:58,610
And I believe that knowing how to look for those things in stack overflow is actually

628
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,610
a skill that I want in a programmer.

629
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:05,970
Now it's a little different with chat GPT or AI for things.

630
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,650
You still have to know, you know, this from kind of trying to craft questions.

631
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,370
You still have to know the best question to ask, and then you need to apply some

632
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,730
critical thinking to the answer.

633
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:17,130
Cause as we discussed earlier, the answer could be wrong.

634
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,010
Right.

635
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:21,010
So, and then let me tell another story.

636
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,410
So it's something I've told maybe not on the podcast in a while, but a lot of

637
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:27,490
people talk to me about how I got from where I came from to hear is they go,

638
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:31,010
what, how'd you get from writing music to writing code?

639
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,850
And what I tell people is there's the creative part of trying to figure out,

640
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,770
like what's the way to solve the problem and how do we need to do it?

641
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:43,770
What's the pseudo code even, which chat GPT does a little bit of itself,

642
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,930
but there's that creative part in composition.

643
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:46,250
Same thing.

644
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:50,330
There's a creative part trying to figure out the sound you're trying to get, uh,

645
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,690
the flavors you want to get the core progression structures, but you get to a

646
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,090
point and it's all wrote and the wrote parts boring.

647
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,250
And if we can get the AI to jump in and if like, even when you pasted the

648
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,330
problem in when a little while ago, you knew the problem you were trying to

649
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,730
solve, you just wanted to shortcut the solution.

650
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,530
I still think there's skill needed in there.

651
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,290
It's going to accelerate people.

652
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,530
As this grows, it will accelerate people, but it still needs.

653
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,210
We're not quite yet, or we don't need people.

654
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,890
We need the people to figure out the problem we're trying to solve and to

655
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:29,450
figure out that, and then we can accelerate ourselves using something to

656
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:33,330
go basically look up all the information from the internet and the learning model

657
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:36,530
that it's going to give us the right answer most of the time.

658
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:42,370
Uh, and, and even though, uh, like the right answer, wrong answer, I'm, I'm, I'm

659
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,490
really not worried about that because that I very strongly believe that that

660
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,730
will work itself out in the background over time, right?

661
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,650
We've talked about where, where ideas come from and, and the adjacent possible.

662
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,650
Yeah, this, this could be an accelerant, right?

663
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,490
Cause what this is going, what this is potentially going to do is just

664
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,620
accelerate the output possible.

665
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:10,500
Right.

666
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,860
I think about, I think about math, right?

667
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,820
If we go through elementary school, there's an obvious level by level or grade

668
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,980
by grade progression through math.

669
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,740
You can't do calculus in second grade because you, there's a whole shit.

670
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,380
It builds on a bunch of different stuff.

671
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:28,620
Right.

672
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,500
Right.

673
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:39,500
Um, now do I believe you could rapidly progress with a tool like chat GPT to,

674
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:47,420
to correctly answering calculus homework within a span of, uh, I don't know, even

675
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:49,660
months, absolutely.

676
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,620
Yeah.

677
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,260
Would, would you walk away understanding these concepts?

678
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,140
No.

679
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,850
Would you walk away potentially understanding how to use the answers?

680
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,940
Maybe.

681
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,860
Yeah, but it could not.

682
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,580
Now let me twist this again, because I'll start backwards.

683
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,980
I think I was going to say first, which is that there is 0% of my job that can be

684
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,340
audit, that my job today that can be automated with chat GPT.

685
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,380
And that's fine.

686
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,340
Doesn't mean I get to keep my job longer.

687
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,380
It just means that it does not what it's good at.

688
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,540
I think the thing you need to teach honestly, to use this effectively, you

689
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,580
know, as a school aid is the same stuff that schools are not teaching well today,

690
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:39,660
which is interaction and critical thinking and critical analysis and, and

691
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:44,180
how to figure out it's the thinking part today in schools, we focus a lot on the

692
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,700
doing, we focus on outputs, not outcomes.

693
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,980
Same thing in software.

694
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,100
Well, if you use this tool a lot in your software, you're going to create a bunch

695
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:54,700
of, you can create a whole crap ton of code, but are you solving a customer problem?

696
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,860
I don't think chat AI, maybe, you know what I mean?

697
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,260
Yeah, I can help you figure out the problem you're solving with the human

698
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,900
part is the more important part.

699
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,580
We get bogged down in the real work and the same thing's true in schools.

700
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,180
In schools, it's all about.

701
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,860
We want to be able to do calculus so we can, I don't know what, so we

702
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:16,460
can do harder calculus, but it's just building on years and years of other

703
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,940
things you need to know so you can solve a problem, but we need to think

704
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,780
about like what kinds of problems.

705
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,260
Here's what I'd love to do as a school teacher is I would love to take a

706
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:31,700
problem solving approach where you, and this is possible where you start with

707
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,540
what is a problem I want to solve that seems difficult to solve, but here's

708
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,380
how we could use math to solve it from every level, everything from

709
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,900
additional application fractions, all the way up to calculus.

710
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,540
So we understand why we're going to use it.

711
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,460
That's often missing in the calculus curriculum taught in the schools.

712
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:51,860
It's like starting with the problem, starting with why, starting

713
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,020
with what we're trying to do.

714
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,500
So that's my little sub box.

715
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:05,380
Yeah, there are, as part of our discussion, I was inspired and I, I don't

716
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:12,060
know if it makes sense, but I asked GPT to create music notation for a new waltz.

717
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,340
Um,

718
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,900
that's what's weird is there's two chords per met per measure in that thing.

719
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,420
You're showing me, but waltzes have three beats per measure.

720
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,060
So I'm not sure exactly what they're doing there.

721
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:25,900
Yeah.

722
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,780
I'm not podcast.

723
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,860
I'm not going to read this thing.

724
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,260
Yeah.

725
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:29,540
Right.

726
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,820
I don't understand this music notation.

727
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,620
Right.

728
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:37,740
I earlier, I asked to jingle bells and I don't get this either because jingle

729
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,220
bells is, is, uh, I'm pretty sure this three, four measure.

730
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,420
And I don't even see jingle bells in here.

731
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,660
So those are the chord progression.

732
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,100
So it's, it's, it works.

733
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,780
This is a chord progression, but it's piano.

734
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:53,790
Yeah.

735
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,270
I don't get it.

736
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:55,310
Yeah.

737
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,430
I don't think it's quite right either.

738
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,270
So it has a ways to go on the music.

739
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,750
Uh, we are, believe it or not, the chat, this is the chat GPT podcast

740
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,750
with Alan and Brent.

741
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:09,350
Um, we probably are actually, because it's a little shorter because we started

742
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,510
late because then caster is drunk, but we got to close here in a second.

743
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,670
Anything, anything else you want to say before my very special closing today?

744
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,710
No, let's close.

745
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:20,190
Okay.

746
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:25,430
So, um, because of the spirit, I asked chat GPT to write an

747
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,110
inspirational monologue I can use to close our AB testing podcast.

748
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:34,550
So with, with my heart in my hands, I would like to say this to all the

749
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:38,310
listeners, thank you for joining us on the AB testing podcast today.

750
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:42,150
We hope that our discussion has inspired you to think more deeply about the

751
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:46,110
incredible power of technology and the endless possibilities that offers as

752
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:49,870
software developers, we have the unique ability to shape the world around us

753
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,630
and make it a better place, even with AI edit.

754
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:55,670
So let's continue to push the boundaries of what's possible and

755
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,190
never stop learning and growing together.

756
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,870
We can create a brighter future until next time, keep coding

757
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,470
and never lose sight of your dreams.

758
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,380
Goodbye for now.

759
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,380
I'm Alan.

760
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm Brent.

761
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,900
And we'll see you next time.
