00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,260
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:23,310
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show bonsoir aloha Brent

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:36,780
hola we can talk welcome listeners to AV testing this is not AVT 343 but you

5
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,720
should be checking those out because they're awesome they are despite me

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,600
despite me I love talking to people and I could I realized how unsmart I am

7
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,080
sometimes I hang around Brandt my ego gets all like oh yeah I'm really smart

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:59,140
and then I talked to other people I realized not so much how you doing I'm

9
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:05,220
having a good week good happy December 12th no happy episode 112 today is

10
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,060
December 5th 6 somewhere in there happy three days after one step closer to

11
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,860
your death yep I turned you know hold I am do you know how old I am you are

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:26,260
53 I believe I just turned 50 quattro oh that's fantastic that is so three

13
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,060
years older than me knowing that you're four years older than me just makes

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:38,510
things so much better it is I am pretty much older than anything yeah so so next

15
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,430
next March you would apply for it so tell me what is the pros and cons of AARP

16
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,230
it's only pros only only pros you get it is the most widely the AARP magazine

17
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:56,030
most widely distributed magazine in the country because there are so many of us

18
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:03,830
old farts now luckily the I am just just barely young enough that you cannot

19
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:12,250
ok boomer me boomers I'm Gen X generation ahead of me so screw you and

20
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,170
you're ok boomer no matter how crotchy I get you can't call me a boomer you can

21
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:25,750
just call me a dick so now shut up and pay your mortgage I have a soon to

22
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:33,780
be 18 year old son and he has informed me that it does not matter if you are a

23
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,760
boomer you can be okay boomer so I think you need I do a quality check on on your

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:48,490
principle here or it could be that as far as intelligence goes leaf doesn't

25
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:56,260
fall that far from the tree yes he is in the extreme not very smart I get I

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:02,180
get that you know some details about this one this is my this is my personal

27
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:09,710
challenge child and a lot of the times I would say he is too smart for his own

28
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,560
good yeah I remember being 18 when I thought I was much smarter than I like

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,080
if I was anywhere close to as smart as I thought I was at 18 to 20 I would I

30
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,640
would be a genius I would be running the world but here I am sitting in a

31
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:36,010
room with you yeah alright 112 this is our next our penultimate episode of 2019

32
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,770
let's just pause there yes Alan said penultimate he did right usually this is

33
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:49,570
mono syllable or monosyllabic word I normally I try normally I try and speak

34
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:55,090
in a language that you can understand right but I chose I chose a long word

35
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,680
because I didn't feel like saying next to last wait next to last panel it

36
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,680
felt it was longer I was stupid yeah I shouldn't have done that you know if I

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,600
hear one more person use use the word utilized when use is perfectly

38
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,560
applicable they're not synonyms I'm going to just stop and tear their head

39
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:25,140
off pee into their neck and go on my day the arson and mish ish utilize means

40
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,740
to use something in a manner which it normally isn't used for I'm gonna

41
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:39,700
utilize your finger to shoot I didn't have a good place to go there well I'm

42
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:46,700
gonna use utilize my finger you're going to use your finger to look up the

43
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:55,050
definition of utilize in to make practical and effective use of use is one

44
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:59,530
syllable utilize is three stop using the word utilize just stop it you don't

45
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,050
need it you don't sound smarter in fact even you when you say the word utilize

46
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,610
for use with you would work you sound dumb dumb dumb dumb if this is it

47
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:22,230
right so utilize does appear to be a synonym for the phrase use of my body I

48
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:28,730
get actively I made you lies I made use of a screwdriver to hammer in this nail

49
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:33,770
I utilize the screwdriver to hammer in this nail that works you don't utilize a

50
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:39,290
pencil to write on paper where do you stand on the then and then controversy

51
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:52,540
that's just grammar look if you we have all these idiotic Americans complaining

52
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,580
about oh immigrants blah blah blah but they can't even use our own language

53
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,660
very well drives me nuts by the way I tweeted this and this is the the

54
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,180
political portion of the of the podcast and we'll go on but I didn't I was

55
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,020
busy last week I was doing advent of code I'm still caught up I'm caught up

56
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,900
in advent of code yesterday's was super easy the day before I wanted to punch a

57
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,700
hole in my computer that's all I'm gonna say day five it's like I couldn't it

58
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,980
took me at least twice as long to understand the problem I was trying to

59
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,370
solve them to write the code at least and some people got it right away but

60
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,730
and when I go back and read it I go how did I miss that's right there but it

61
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:37,640
was really really hard for me to grok yeah you should give our listeners a

62
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,730
heads up because you announced it every year that you've been doing it for

63
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:47,530
several years I never finish I get about 10 to 12 days done then I then it gets

64
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,010
hard and I find things I'd rather do and every time you bring it up I go oh

65
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:57,770
yeah that sounds fun oh he just said he's on day three so I'm late something

66
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,090
interesting I went to see the as I mentioned before the the owner the

67
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,850
creator of advent of code he gave a talk when I was at or dev and he talks a lot

68
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:14,860
of people like make visualizations of the visualizations of the program which

69
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:23,540
is kind of cool this year someone did is doing all of the questions in Google

70
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,300
Sheets and Excel all in formulas there's always someone who can solve

71
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,220
the whole problem in one line of Mathematica a very very long line there

72
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,500
is a language you heard the language called rockstar no you should look up

73
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,980
rockstar someone did a solution in rockstar what was really fantastically

74
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:44,500
interesting is the the passion of this community in advent of code is days two

75
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,660
and three I think or maybe three and four two and three where this you're

76
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,100
programming this int code this you get a string of numbers that end up being

77
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,180
byte codes and instructions basically a string of custom assembly that you're

78
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,850
trying to send to the robot right to write an interpreter for him and then

79
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:07,410
someone after learning being taught this this byte code instruction in language

80
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:12,730
someone went back and solved the first day's problem using these this fake

81
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:19,140
int code language from day four and five like people are just crazy just

82
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,740
crazy I wonder if anyone's ever attempted to go a whole advent of code

83
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,700
doing nothing but turning machines I don't know there are people trying to

84
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,980
a different language every day which I so I have tried to use a different

85
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,500
language each year so when I first did I did it in C sharp which was fun because

86
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,340
I didn't I've written very procedural C sharp not very good at it but it gave

87
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,140
me a chance to learn a lot of the more object oriented aspects of C sharp

88
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,300
and actually use it like a real programmer that was fun the next year I

89
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,380
did it in Python which was fun for me to learn Python I think I've

90
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:57,780
forgotten all of my Python and then last year I did it in JavaScript which

91
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:06,360
was interesting I don't like JavaScript I think it's a millennial language because

92
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,720
you can write really bad JavaScript and it still works kind of but you don't

93
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,400
really know no no no no no you're missing the point I think it's no matter

94
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,040
what you do no matter how good or bad you write it because I grew up of

95
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,600
course writing C programming where if you made one tiny mistake code wouldn't

96
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,080
compile and most time you wouldn't know why so JavaScript like you get it kind of

97
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,200
close in the compiles kind of like the everyone gets a trophy language yeah and

98
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,880
then this year I said screw it I'm just gonna write it in C++ C++ is your your

99
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,560
go-to C and C++ yes I am making massive use of vectors I find myself

100
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:55,360
entirely disinterested in C C++ as well as any time I have to be on a team that

101
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,200
makes that a requirement because the it's an extremely powerful language I

102
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:12,020
remember I remember I remember like yesterday when I first got the concept

103
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:20,930
of a function pointer and oh oh right and I was like oh my god this thing is so

104
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:30,420
sweet but now it just I find it slow I think it slows me down and I'm trying to

105
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,700
go from A to B and spending the extra few days go making sure I'm not doing a

106
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:42,380
mem leak it's just friggin annoying when particularly when there's languages out

107
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,140
there I know I know it's just it's what I cut my teeth on and I and I read them

108
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,740
one thing and we're never gonna get to I have a full board I actually wrote the

109
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:55,780
the agenda today and but we have so much to talk about I feel like it's been

110
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,980
more than two weeks since we chatted do we skip a week I don't know oh do we

111
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,420
have a holiday in there something so anyway yeah I was talking on the slack

112
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,700
channel about they had a developer on the heart a developer who was rock star

113
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,860
and shouldn't even use the word rock star and actually you should look up

114
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,900
this is tangent exception the coffee's kicking in one of the reasons the people

115
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,940
that developed the rock star language wrote it was that I could become popular

116
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:31,880
and recruiters couldn't look for rock star programmers anymore but let's say

117
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:38,110
you have a very awesome but who so a variable does that mean people will go

118
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,350
in and in their resume put I'm a rock star developer prior to the language

119
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,190
being developed or or we're looking for a rock star developer sorry I only know

120
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:52,750
Ruby so don't you can look it up if you want I have so much stuff to cover

121
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,150
we're gonna have to cover some of this stuff next time that's just gonna happen

122
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,490
yeah oh next time penultimate episode oh my god this is awful next time we'll

123
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,350
do our look back on 2019 some recommendations of cool things we like

124
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:14,110
and our predictions for 2020 yeah so rock star real quick one of the variable

125
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:21,790
naming conventions is variables or variables have a proper name like Brent

126
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,470
and if I put stuff into Brent and I want to print what's in Brent to the screen I

127
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,990
shout it so shout it Brent shout at Brent print it twice oh this is yeah so

128
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,350
the idea is that the language ends up looking like 80s heavy metal rock ballad

129
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:47,060
lyrics awesome yeah it is it is good anyway a quick story about we saw on the

130
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,180
channel this week someone hired someone who was really good in one language and

131
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,400
and really only wanted to go in that language but their company didn't use

132
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,520
that language and all they did was complain that they didn't get to use

133
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,200
their language that they like and have been easier and and then I face

134
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,280
palmed and then when I really hard I was unconscious for a couple hours and

135
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,920
then when I got up I I made a point that today in programming you have to

136
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,320
learn new languages like when we interview I used to be you could

137
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,720
interview for a language maybe but even though that was probably always

138
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,240
stupid if you get the concepts of program you can learn new languages I

139
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:34,220
was actually like I was doing an informational just yesterday and the

140
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,140
woman I was talking to kept on doing self-deprecation she had a massive amount

141
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:49,710
of confidence around Python but did not feel super confident with C sharp and

142
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:59,530
I'm like so well to me that almost is a sign of a beginner programmer right it's

143
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:08,080
maybe even intermediate because I'm at a phase where I go no I am so strong in the

144
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,160
the basic concepts right I understand I understand design patterns I understand

145
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,120
functional languages or a procedural languages or cake right once you'll

146
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,690
understand the constructs in my humble opinion you will understand every

147
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:30,030
language as long as you have the the book that tells you what the stupid

148
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,870
keyword is for the thing in this language yeah I I am confident through

149
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,190
other questions we asked I look for people who like to learn and usually I

150
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,550
hire people who tend to are really good at looking things up on Stack Overflow

151
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:50,000
yeah I had so it was a point way back in my Microsoft career when we were

152
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,360
doing scene C++ and we have a lot of people coming in and Microsoft more

153
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,600
than Unity for sure but they really milk that college pipeline so we get a lot

154
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,550
of candidates out of college we still do yeah I know I know I know I know I had to

155
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:10,460
actually had to go to recruiting and say hey at one point is this two years

156
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:14,900
ago now I said I would like to hire some students out of college they go oh

157
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:23,320
teams don't usually do that that's a great idea which coming it's like what

158
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,480
we end up looking maybe it's a smaller company thing in looking for a lot more

159
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,760
unicorn type people anyway I remember way back when they would program in Java

160
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,400
it's okay I can read Java and then for then for a long time even up to today

161
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,340
it's like Python yeah pythons a good language that's cool you can do that

162
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,580
it may be something different later I would love if I could interview candidate

163
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,260
to do a question in rockstar that'd be awesome I'd interview this week I just

164
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,980
did a little phone phone screen that is super just had someone walk me through

165
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,300
something pretty easy find a find a missing number in an array kind of

166
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:07,330
question and they did it in bash okay I get an idea how you think it's cool

167
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:15,700
no it's cool like you do all you've changed your OS you do a lot of stuff

168
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:23,260
in in unique syntax bash would be hard for me now I haven't so an interview

169
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:27,420
question in bash would be hard for me because I think but I would never ask

170
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,700
unless I was hiring you for a Linux sysadmin I would never ask you a

171
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:36,660
bass bash question no no I don't so certainly I would turn down writing it

172
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,580
I'm like yeah probably uses keywords but reading it because so a lot of times

173
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,460
when I'm asking coding questions I'm trying to think ahead of the candidate

174
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:54,900
so I can figure out where they're heading what wall they're likely to to to

175
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,180
hit and then do the probing yeah yeah right bash I wouldn't be able to do that

176
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,780
because yeah oh yeah I can't even read it any like I could follow along yeah

177
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,660
anyway I'm gonna cross something out there I'm not sure which one yet but

178
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,420
it's obvious we're not gonna get everything up there sure what would you

179
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,780
like to do let's do number two because you promised me shock surprise and

180
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:28,930
amazement well I don't know about that so telephone game mailbag I heard this

181
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,650
through the grapevine but want to call it up as a mailbag and just to get your

182
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:36,170
thoughts so there's two questions here and I'll give them to you one at a time

183
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:41,490
okay one is we have talked and I thought we covered this so we'll cover

184
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:48,260
this quickly I think but I haven't heard much or any concrete examples of what we

185
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,060
should be doing instead of Selenium testing right now and talk a lot about the

186
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:59,030
downsides of choosing Selenium testing sorry sorry Jason Huggins we do not yeah

187
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,070
not not exactly no we talk about the downsides of doing UI test you can

188
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,660
exactly and things that you shouldn't do and why you shouldn't do that but I

189
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,460
feel like there's a missing episode what to do instead I feel like we've

190
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,180
covered that but I'm gonna go ahead and cover it quickly so actually I'll let you

191
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,820
cover it because I've ranted enough about UI automation so can you clarify

192
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:24,380
our stance on Selenium testing and what we suggest people do instead of Selenium

193
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:30,670
testing Selenium testing is fine Selenium is a great framework again

194
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:36,790
don't do UI testing our UI automation yeah the point is don't try and verify

195
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,190
your program logic through the UI you use the you you want to write Selenium

196
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:46,780
tests for tests that can only be caught via Selenium tests I'm a little bit more

197
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,100
flexible than that I'm not if it can be caught at a lower level let's catch it

198
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,860
there right but you can if you can use Selenium ultimately has now become a

199
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,500
super flexible framework so if you can catch the lower level things via

200
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,660
Selenium knock yourself out I don't care and the advantage of Selenium I

201
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,380
just want to call out Selenium and UI testing are not synonyms correct although

202
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:18,620
then I believe the majority of people writing tests with Selenium are writing

203
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:25,980
them as your canonical 30 year old UI test I do too but if we're gonna if

204
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,460
we're going if we're going to be bashing something on the episode let's

205
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:36,100
bash the right thing Selenium is great UI testing is not our UI automation

206
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,990
so instead if we're asking you to write less or fewer Selenium tests or sorry

207
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,070
if we're saying don't do UI automation which I've been saying for going on 20

208
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:54,030
years now maybe just 15 and we want you either to use Selenium the right way or

209
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:59,130
to focus your testing efforts elsewhere what is that well it's gonna depend on

210
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:08,900
your architecture I have always chosen to turn it into an API test so most

211
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,900
well-designed architectures have a business logic layer that sits in

212
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:20,260
between the the presentation stack and and the for lack of a better word the

213
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:27,780
database so that's where I would go and automate I would turn it into an

214
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:35,260
API test and then validate that when you call the as an example the button click

215
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:46,600
event the UI update event handler gets called yes typical model of your

216
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,480
controller right so I did a and we'll close on this I did an informal Twitter

217
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,990
survey as you know as a data scientist that people that follow me on Twitter

218
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:02,550
probably aren't the most representative sample of testers in the world because

219
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:08,470
I've pissed off the ones that maybe are doing more UI testing but I did have a

220
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:15,110
hundred and fifty answers to my survey when I asked do you mostly write code

221
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:20,350
to automate the UI non UI animation tools that aid in automation that aid

222
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:26,830
in testing and other and 24% code to automate the UI I believe in the

223
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:33,790
industry that number is higher but in my survey 24% with 35% apiece on non UI

224
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:39,130
automation and tools that aid in testing which I think isn't bad I think

225
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:49,700
that 24% I mean you're talking to a guy who as we've talked before I've been

226
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,150
in the I've been a traditional test manager I've had to make these these

227
00:21:55,150 --> 00:22:02,720
concrete decisions and several occasions you you just discover your UI

228
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:14,720
automation is harming you UI automation is we've said this a thousand times

229
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,400
before there's probably not enough tequila in the world to drink UI

230
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:28,920
automation is some of the hardest thing to do and get right it is a money pit

231
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:36,860
uh-huh the more UI automation you write if you do not apply your more senior

232
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:45,380
talent to developing the architecture and working with development to make sure

233
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:59,130
UI changes are are well handled you always need one more automator yes because

234
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,570
as you write more the maintenance cost goes through the roof and you you just

235
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:11,370
can't get to the next set of tests whereas the business layer underneath the

236
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:19,960
UI because dev needs that to be stable it's so that the UI doesn't constantly

237
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,670
have to be rewritten that just makes a lot more sense and another question and

238
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,430
this is interesting I saw this on I did a search a year ago maybe on modern

239
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:38,410
testing and saw this I'd ignored it and then I saw it somewhere else and I'm

240
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,810
gonna have you address it and then I'll address it and then we'll laugh

241
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:48,430
about it you're gonna want to hear it first I'll ask it this way Brent it's

242
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:54,070
one of the reasons we don't talk about like what to do instead of Selenium or

243
00:23:54,070 --> 00:24:00,650
enough is that because are we building ideas or trainings or do we have a

244
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,490
startup or consulting business we're trying to kick off so we're limited in

245
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,010
what we can say are we trying to hide something do we have an ulterior motive

246
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,930
I've heard this like I was I think Alan has an ulterior motive in talking about

247
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:24,350
modern testing so I'm gonna I told you you'd laugh yes we do we do have an

248
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:33,400
ulterior motive and what is it the ulterior motive is we wish to save as

249
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:41,080
many people we can from going down the wrong path in their career we do not

250
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:49,360
make money on this show we do we've had we've had sponsors now and again that

251
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,200
has always gone back directly into the show when you join the one of the

252
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:02,200
three slack right the stickers that you can ask for that we pay postage on and

253
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,720
we pay the stickers on that all came from the ten dollars we got from

254
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:14,680
sponsors the new year we have I did develop a modern testing course for

255
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:20,640
ministry of testing plug but if if money comes in from that that also goes back

256
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,680
into the podcast we have no consultancy plans I think my retirement

257
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,080
job may be consulting but I don't even know when that is it's not it's

258
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,080
not related to this I may have to I may have to get a test automation

259
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,840
consultancy because it seems to be a lot more of those jobs around the modern

260
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:48,420
testers yeah so the important thing here is no we're doing this because we

261
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:55,020
we want to try and help people we we have some strong opinions we want to

262
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,060
share and we think that they're helpful to some group of people and that's it

263
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:05,110
I may even say it a little stronger like you and I have had conversations before

264
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:13,940
around traditionalists and here I mean that more generic than just test

265
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:21,740
traditionalism we're trying to reduce just a little bit of the ignorance in

266
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,740
the world right or to spread our ignorance whatever however comes across

267
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:35,990
well the you know I think back to exploratory testing and the

268
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,310
conversations that we had when Visual Studio came out with their version of

269
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,910
it and they renamed it to XT oh god right and that that's spreading

270
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:53,890
ignorance it's it's it's just a little bit of look up and you realize that

271
00:26:54,010 --> 00:27:03,100
just a bad name for me it's all about how do we continue the conversation my

272
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:10,060
motive is is I want to get rid of test zombies people who just continuously

273
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,660
they've they've they went through a phase they thought about it and then

274
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:23,740
they stopped I want I want people to help advance their own careers and the

275
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:32,810
more we're able to say hey there's an alternative and there is and for a lot

276
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:38,960
of really good reasons it is better than what you know and in a lot of places

277
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,160
again there was a conversation on the slack channel tipping point may even

278
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:49,040
be nearing the the nice thing is is that looks like the tipping point the

279
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,720
way the way the tipping point towards an empty or something like it looks like

280
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:01,010
it's going to be more of a boil the frog action and again going with ulterior

281
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:06,290
motive we're not looking to make any money or fame off of modern testing and

282
00:28:06,290 --> 00:28:10,900
what we what I'm seeing a lot of people doing you don't have to call it modern

283
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,700
testing and remember it's not that modern and nothing to do really to do

284
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:22,420
with testing it's about how it's really about lean and agile and how to

285
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:29,300
accelerate the achievement of a quality I think it's also about measuring what's

286
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,900
important I think and the data and that's what I was getting to is like

287
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:39,960
there's many many more well apparently a shark has been jumped but there I see a

288
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,000
lot of talks about data and using data at test conferences there was one at

289
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:49,400
online test conference recently I feel like there's an overabundance of talks

290
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,120
at test conferences about how machine learning is changing the world and

291
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,960
whether it is or not that's great I wish they talk more about using data to

292
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:03,400
get insights instead but there's a reason I'm on a podcast and not a

293
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,280
conference coordinator so I'm seeing more of these things that are modern

294
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,560
testin ish happen which is great and I think they would have happened whether

295
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,760
we were talking about it or not we try and give is a framework that wraps a

296
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,920
lot of the things that are all of the things that we think go into making

297
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:25,200
software high quality software that customers love and made by high by

298
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,520
high-performing engineering teams I mean it's it's a bit too altruistic

299
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:37,450
sounding to fit into my personality but I think we're just trying to make a

300
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:44,410
better world here that's way too out that's too altruistic for both of us it's

301
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:53,540
in terms of the end you lean agile right I think what we're doing here is helping

302
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:59,020
to accelerate that tipping point yeah I hope so I hope so it keeps the

303
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,740
conversation going like we said when people people whether people agree or

304
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,740
don't agree with the principles we're happy to have you in the

305
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,260
conversation so you can think about it I hope that through debate people at least

306
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,420
challenge what they're thinking and I challenge what I'm thinking all the time

307
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:20,500
I do this in politics I never I'll skip on my political tweet a quote but I do try

308
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,280
and look at what the other side and try and understand how they're thinking

309
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,540
and I think we should do that in testing as well I did tweet last week I

310
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,960
saw a lot of people I had a conversation on a different slack channel

311
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,400
where all someone did to make their point was to point to links blog links

312
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:43,760
from a single test blog author and I don't think that makes a good argument or

313
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,720
good stance I think you begin to form your own opinions when you can take in

314
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,880
input from 10 20 30 40 different sources and figure out what you really

315
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,000
think I don't think it it makes a stance for yourself when all you do is

316
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:08,380
quote one person anyway tangents tangent so yeah that was all about no we don't

317
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:14,420
have a business we have a podcast where we it's all about trying to be a service

318
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:21,420
to people who listen yeah yeah one other thing to hit here a couple questions

319
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:26,100
came up in not really mailbag in the slack channel worth talking about let's

320
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,980
take them separately they're kind of related but separately one we've talked

321
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:35,860
a little bit about before but probably worth hitting on again is how does

322
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,660
someone so if we get to a world where there's modern testing and maybe it

323
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,140
seems don't have a dedicated testing specialist which again is if you if that

324
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,100
happens it'll be obvious that it's the right thing to do we're not trying to

325
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,040
tear away testers directly what's a junior modern testing how does someone

326
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,760
get started in modern testing and I think you and I are aligned on this

327
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:04,110
but I'm gonna ask you I think a junior modern tester is the same as a junior

328
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:10,570
developer in today's world when when I'm asked this question I go to okay let's

329
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:20,640
say I am gonna start up a new startup redundant and it's gonna be me and five

330
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,560
other people and we grow to a point where hey let's start bringing in

331
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:33,510
college hires right what am I gonna bring it I'm gonna bring in someone who who can

332
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:41,760
contribute but it's gonna be a sponge made modern testing is a quite honestly

333
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,680
it's a senior concept it is it is right I'm not going to bring in a monkey

334
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:57,100
tester now if they show the systemic thinking right that's something that

335
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,300
tests off and prides itself on is oh but testing is all about how to think and how

336
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:07,710
to ask questions yeah you need that talent in yes so development as well you

337
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:10,390
needed it in all knowledge work that's the part that drives me crazy Oh

338
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,670
testers do a B and C yeah that's important in all knowledge work it's

339
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:20,240
not special no so what I what I'm gonna look for is someone who I can train

340
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:27,080
MT on well I'm still delivered and in your startup you don't need to

341
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,360
necessarily train them it's the culture of the way your company works it is and

342
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,400
I have so right now I have although we talked about modern testing isn't a role

343
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:45,620
and I have a couple quality coaches they help their teeth they they do some

344
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,460
testing but not actually not really that much depending on on the time of

345
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,220
day in the season but they're helping the team do better testing if they left

346
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:00,000
at this stage I will probably try and replace them but I also have senior

347
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,680
devs in the org who do a lot of quality coaching whether they know it or not I

348
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,200
guess the point I'm making is some of the best testers I've known people that

349
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,600
that testing mine people that know how to people who have that system thinking

350
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,280
and know how to figure out what's gonna go wrong and mitigate it they're

351
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,730
just to seeing your devs on the team let's take it a different way okay

352
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:26,410
that's right principle seven says blah blah blah blah blah blah knowing that it

353
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:31,410
may reduce or remove the testing specialist I go the other way around and

354
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:37,230
I go okay when would I in that startup scenario when would I bring in that

355
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:42,770
testing specialist you have an answer to that one because I'm gonna start off

356
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:47,610
the other way I'm gonna start off with nope the the ground you and I are in

357
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:54,850
the same page so I think can be taught I would I would so what I tell my manager

358
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:59,810
I know I've mentioned on the podcast is our development team do all the testing

359
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:03,950
they know how to do they're not they're not skipping out on any testing they know

360
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:12,360
of however there's some testing ideas some expansive knowledge that they can

361
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,020
do more testing this on order to get that's what we coach them on we teach

362
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,860
them more things to think about so they can do more testing and figure out

363
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,300
I figure out a strategy conferences you can send I could so yeah and I'm

364
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,220
getting there so I would bring in a testing specialist when I felt I

365
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:32,890
couldn't scale it's like say I didn't have one and I guess for the same

366
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:37,330
reason you bring in a consultant I want to bring a coach in because they can't

367
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:43,610
learn the testing they need to learn quickly enough for the scale that our

368
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,010
business is growing so I'm gonna bring in some help to help them expand that

369
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:53,310
knowledge absolutely so that's that's my answer and there's things where I like

370
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:58,240
to bring up perf testing perf testing is hard that's a specialization of my

371
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:05,370
humble opinion you can get through a good 60% of it you know by looking books or

372
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:11,490
doing other such things but if you really want to nail it into in someone

373
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,250
dedicated to my experience is required security testing I agree on security

374
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:23,780
maybe not as much on performance relative security is much more needs a

375
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:30,130
specialization right because even it's a full-time job even just staying on top of

376
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:36,470
threats yes architectures I don't know that I would even bring in one a test

377
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:41,030
architect in any more because there's so much open source no no no no no no no

378
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:47,590
I although I've been a test architect as we all know I do not like that title

379
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:54,740
anymore it reeks of 1990s yeah I have as well get rid of the word tests and I'm

380
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:00,060
fine with it right to me it's a good architecture is a good architecture yeah

381
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:05,300
yeah it's a remnant and the only reason we had him at Microsoft was we didn't

382
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:09,300
have a career path for senior testers so I said I know we'll make test

383
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,490
architects and that'll keep them around it was fine it was fun but that was yeah

384
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,130
it created its own new problem it did and it was it's a it's a solution for a

385
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:24,980
problem that's wrong long past all right one last thing and I forget the context

386
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:30,420
I brought this up in but it's worth talking about David asked in the also

387
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:35,500
in the slack channel lots of activity there I mentioned as an aside oh I

388
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:42,050
remember I was a talk or where I heard it but I heard someone say something to

389
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:49,860
this effect Oh CI CD that's the dream and again I face-palmed and when I

390
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:57,740
regain consciousness a day or two later I asked I said CI CD I think is the bare

391
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:06,170
minimum at least CI and so then David asked so if that's the bare minimum and

392
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,170
I don't know if I said it's the bare minimum for MT but it's my bare minimum

393
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:13,210
expectation I expect teams to have CI check in crap happened to get tested

394
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:17,690
gets failure gets pushback what other sort of assumptions what's the baseline

395
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,650
for a team ready to adopt modern testing principles this is probably a

396
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,840
lot more than we can cover in six minutes but we'll do our best first off

397
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,800
and CI CD I just want to address I I see I see where where David's coming

398
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:45,110
from I I have models that I shipped her production now on a weekly basis and it

399
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:49,950
took one of my developers nearly the last six months to build a CI CD pipeline

400
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:59,670
then it it for for the because building the model isn't actually a failed the

401
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,830
way for those of you not watching the livestream I'm making I'm making a face

402
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:11,850
you're like there's two words after what but yeah the and then there's the other

403
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:19,520
aspect so you go what I want you to do is outside of teams think through the

404
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:26,640
other teams that you had been on mm-hmm right Xbox I've spent time in Xbox

405
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:36,810
bangs the best I've ever been on on CI CD but if you're accustomed if the

406
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:47,050
current practice is miles away from CI CD it feels untenable to even bring that

407
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:53,610
up right it just just think of dysfunctional forking such it's but

408
00:39:53,610 --> 00:40:02,410
yeah so maybe the minimum is a just a minimum quality culture and I want to

409
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:07,690
fight us it's not just text we talked about it before we know it is a people

410
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:10,690
the process and the time right it's right and when you start going into

411
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:18,210
long-standing process changes those can be brutal and hard fought when I was way

412
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,730
back when I worked on Windows CE didn't you work on Windows CE also at

413
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:29,050
some point when I worked with okay so we had before we there was even a name

414
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,850
because the CI CD book from Jez Humble and crew is just 10 years old now so this

415
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,810
is way before then so we didn't call it that and I won't it wasn't certainly was

416
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,730
his continuous deployment but we when people checked into we were to check in

417
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,130
system a check-in gate what we wanted to do is run some static analysis checks

418
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,250
run a small set of tests and then then then merge the code on their behalf

419
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,730
pretty common pretty common that's that's kind of the way CI works today we

420
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:00,160
deployed it so this guy Marty and I wrote this tool at first for the first

421
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,400
two weeks we got more than a few dozen emails a day with titles like slate rhymes

422
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,360
with hate slate was the name of our tool because people didn't like great I

423
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,360
check in my code and then my then I want to sync it to my other dev machine

424
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:23,590
and I can't because it's going through slate and slate took embarrassingly like

425
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,470
an hour which wasn't that bad an hour to finish we had a lot of running on some

426
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,940
beefy machines and somebody else broke something and it blocked my change from

427
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,990
getting in and we're blocked we're blocked me so we the same things you

428
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:42,670
hear about early stage CI today and we dealt with it we made some tweaks we

429
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,790
fixed the process a little bit we kept on going we didn't turn it off we just

430
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:52,350
dealt with it and what was great was like with that was like within the

431
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,990
first two weeks within a month we started getting mails like I don't know

432
00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:01,550
how we ever survived without this before and all kinds it just you have to

433
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:08,670
people talk about the people part introducing a process using the tech to

434
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,290
introduce a process can cause the people to freak out I hit all three of

435
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,170
your piece there and it takes some leadership to get through that so I would

436
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,490
say another min bar another minimum thing is you have to have people willing

437
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,610
to disappoint people at a level they can absorb which is one of my definitions

438
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:34,050
of leadership and be able to take the heat for that and hold their ground and

439
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:38,690
and make good decisions which is another thing every leader I've ever

440
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,970
respected is excellent at making decisions they're not like looking for

441
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,770
consensus on everything they can take the data they have make a decision so if

442
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,730
you have a good leader who's not afraid to disappoint people and can make

443
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:51,850
decisions based on what's coming in and tweak the process is needed to make it

444
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:58,450
work and and persevere that it's kind of like a high bar but you have to have

445
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,050
some leadership in place that knows how to facilitate change in order to move

446
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,830
to modern testing it can't happen if your team is a bunch of zombies no no

447
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,830
and that would probably be another min bar we should probably go into this

448
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:17,010
more in depth in 2020 in we have a full agenda for next time which which

449
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:20,910
involves me doing the one time a year I do prep when I go back and listen to the

450
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:27,890
end of show end of your show last year at one and a half speed you know what I

451
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,170
watched one of my I can't watch my own talks but I watched one at one and a

452
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:33,770
half speed and at one and a half speed I'm pretty good

453
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:44,750
nice all right anything else no okay we're gonna go with that keep your

454
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:50,710
questions coming thank you three the community and we'll see in there

455
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:57,270
brand-new say yeah if you are not on the slack channel get on the slack channel

456
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,910
yeah lots of good discussions it's it's you can go to modern testing org and

457
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:08,590
