00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,460
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,860
Now, on with the show.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,860
Hey, everyone.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,860
I'm Alan.

7
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,860
I'm Brent.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,460
And we're here for episode 128 of the A.B. Testing Podcast, your wonderful podcast for

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,460
all kinds of cool things.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,460
It's a story.

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,460
No, don't sing.

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,100
By a lovely lady.

13
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:35,570
Do not sing.

14
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,760
What have you been up to, Brent?

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,080
COVID, COVID-Ding, I guess.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,200
COVID-Ding is cool, man.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:48,120
I really like being home in the same chair all day, every day, and talking to people

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,360
all day.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,940
It's great.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,940
Yeah.

21
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,340
My wife asked me why I'm going to work, and it's essentially because I can.

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,180
Because I cannot stand.

23
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,900
I really cannot stand work coming to home.

24
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,900
I like to keep those lives separate.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,150
I actually like working from here.

26
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,150
Yeah?

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,150
Yeah.

28
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,470
I was talking to the YouTube crowd before, and I'm actually taking some vacation days

29
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,170
at home coming up, because I was talking about the fact that Microsoft, Microsoft,

30
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,530
Microsoft, is it pronounced softer soft?

31
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,530
I'm not sure.

32
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,250
At Microsoft, you're limited on how much vacation you can carry forward from one year

33
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,700
to the next, but you always accrue vacation.

34
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,060
Unity, same rule, you care, you limit on how much you can carry over, but there's also

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,570
a limit on how much you can accrue.

36
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,090
Meaning I hit a max vacation I could possibly have, and I was no longer making more vacation

37
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,530
from my weekly work.

38
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,530
Oh, I see.

39
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,930
Lame-o, so I'm taking some vacation days to do some chores around the house.

40
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,730
My first one's next week.

41
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,730
I'm pretty excited.

42
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,930
I'm a good old working forward week next week.

43
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,090
That'll be fun.

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:08,170
The other thing I've been doing is I now own a bunch of our Google contract, and I'm

45
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,690
doing a lot of work with finance to make sure our cost predictions are accurate, which

46
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,210
is a whole lot of fun.

47
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,340
That's sarcastic, because I know how much I don't know.

48
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,940
Gotcha.

49
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,140
But we're getting closer.

50
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,420
I'm faking it.

51
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,500
I still find the right questions to ask, and we're getting there.

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,600
We're getting there.

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,440
I have no doubt that you will.

54
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,120
The cost thing.

55
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,700
Okay.

56
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,690
Shall we go directly into the meat of the show?

57
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,690
It's a story.

58
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,410
Oh, God.

59
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,010
What did I say?

60
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,010
All right.

61
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:58,180
Last time we talked about how you...

62
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,060
Even my dog is mad at you.

63
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,140
We talked about how you got your start in testing and how you moved away from it and

64
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,340
kind of how you stumbled into modern testing along the way.

65
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,780
I want to tell my half of the story today.

66
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,220
Hopefully, my dog will shut up.

67
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,500
I shut my office door.

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,860
I don't know if I should let her in, let her cry in here, or then she'll be quiet

69
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,860
or what to do.

70
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,100
I'm going to let her do her thing and see what...

71
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,380
I think you should let her in.

72
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
In a bit.

73
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,380
So let her in.

74
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,380
Oh, my God.

75
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,920
Oh, my God.

76
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Let's get started.

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,400
And I'm going to count on you to ask questions appropriate or move me along as

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
needed.

79
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,570
I'll start at the beginning.

80
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,570
I was born.

81
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,510
No, I'll fast forward a little bit.

82
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,710
I think most people know I was a music major in college.

83
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:52,430
I graduated and I taught school for four years.

84
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,950
I went back to grad school to get a master's in composition.

85
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,790
While getting my master's, I learned how to use computers.

86
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,790
This was...

87
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:07,070
I used a DOS-based music software notation program to do most of my work for grad school.

88
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,470
I got really good at it.

89
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,150
That company is no longer in business.

90
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,990
I do have the source file still on some five and a quarter inch floppy disk so I

91
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,950
can do nothing with them.

92
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,260
But after I got into grad school, I was actually planning on going back into teaching,

93
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,140
but there was so much red tape after taking a year off to get back into teaching and

94
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,380
fees involved that I just decided I was going to do something else first so I could make

95
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,300
the money to go back to being a teacher.

96
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,020
So I got a job as a bicycle messenger.

97
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,020
I live downtown Seattle.

98
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,780
I did that for a while until it got really crappy.

99
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,940
It was almost as toxic as some of my software teams I've worked on.

100
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,900
But I bought a Sunday paper for you youngsters.

101
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,220
A paper is a way people used to deliver news before we had to read it.

102
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,740
And I got a Sunday paper and went through the Want to add.

103
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,820
That's what we had before we had monster.com and LinkedIn.

104
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,180
And I looked through all the Want to add, just kind of circling some random jobs to apply

105
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
for.

106
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,180
This was 1992.

107
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,180
Maybe 93.

108
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,300
I don't really remember.

109
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,620
93.

110
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,980
And one of the jobs I applied for was to do tech support at a company that made music

111
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,940
software.

112
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,060
And I applied for the job and I went through a rather lengthy interview which I finally

113
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,060
got the job for.

114
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,180
A rather lengthy for an $8 an hour tech support job.

115
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,420
I started about two weeks later.

116
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,580
I showed up on my first day and they said, oh, by the way, you're also the software

117
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
tester.

118
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Another few hours went by and someone said, by the way, you're also our network administrator.

119
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,640
This is what happens when you join a 17 person company.

120
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
I said, great.

121
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,820
I've never used a network before this morning, but it'll be fun.

122
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,700
So I learned as I went.

123
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Go ahead.

124
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:53,460
It already sounds like that you started off towards exactly what our friend Jimbo describes

125
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,820
as the definition of the test position back in the day.

126
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,660
Someone who does the remainder.

127
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,700
Right.

128
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,700
Everything else.

129
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:09,580
Well, what I did there was I did tech support and on our peak days we got like 10 calls

130
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,940
and 90 plus percent of my calls were actually helping them with windows problems, not with

131
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:24,640
problems with our product because windows at this time windows 3.1 then there's windows

132
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,660
3.1 with multimedia extensions.

133
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,020
People bought these sound cards and put them in their computer and tried to get them to

134
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:37,160
work and they didn't know how and there was this was before plug and play.

135
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,600
Although I helped them edit their system any and win any file so their stuff would work

136
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,480
in general, not for our software.

137
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,880
Once they got windows to work, our stuff would work fine.

138
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,920
Very few of my questions about our software, but the rest of the time was fun because

139
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,050
one of the programmers there took me under his wing and made me learn C. He taught me

140
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,630
the three most important things you need to know about C.

141
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,040
What are those pointers?

142
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,830
Pointers and pointers.

143
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:11,150
We got a beta version of the first version of MS test and I began to use that to write

144
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,030
some automation.

145
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,190
I didn't know what I was doing.

146
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,190
I just automated everything.

147
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,230
It was really stupid, but it was a good learning experience for me.

148
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,870
I tried to use their API.

149
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,190
I figured some stuff out.

150
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,230
In the end, I ended up writing our setup programs because those were largely based

151
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,830
on visual basic, that setup language at the time.

152
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,830
So that was fun.

153
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,670
I was doing some stuff.

154
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,470
I got promoted all the way from $8 an hour.

155
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:39,760
I got a big raise to like $35,000 a year.

156
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,480
Then for the second time, our CFO asked me to turn back the clock on our network

157
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,080
server so we could shove a few more sales into the current quarter.

158
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,840
I thought, and this was a public company, by the way.

159
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,960
I thought, you know what?

160
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,360
I don't feel good about this.

161
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,450
So I quit.

162
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,570
Yeah.

163
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,610
And by the way, not because of this, because I'm a parent, the worst things he

164
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,930
did, he is banned from ever holding office in a public company again.

165
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,500
So the just desert said, follow him around.

166
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,140
So I quit and I went home and I got out of paper and there was a bunch of

167
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,260
software testing jobs.

168
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,300
I know what testing was now.

169
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,380
I thought I was good at it.

170
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,300
I didn't think I was great at it.

171
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,380
I thought I was good at it because I could write a bunch of MS test automation.

172
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,300
Raise your hand if you know a million testers like that today and just, just

173
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,180
substitute selenium for MS test.

174
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,540
And I applied for a bunch of jobs.

175
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,500
You know how I applied for them?

176
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,970
I wrote up a resume and a cover letter and I used my fax modem to fax it to

177
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,850
people because that's what we did then.

178
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,130
This was 1994 end of 94.

179
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,570
And then I maybe fall of 94 because I, my first day at Microsoft was the,

180
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,730
whatever the first work day in January was in 1995.

181
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,560
And I was hired as a contractor and I worked, they hired me because I knew

182
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
testing and new networking.

183
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,520
And this is where I have the famous quote of, I talked to my manager.

184
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,680
He handed me this list of test cases in Excel.

185
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,000
And I said, go great.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,480
When do you want these automated by?

187
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,400
And he said, Oh no, we don't have time to automate.

188
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,080
You need to run these every day.

189
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,960
And I thought, huh.

190
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,920
And I was bored of that.

191
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,040
That was like a Monday out.

192
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,360
I was bored by Tuesday.

193
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,720
So I automated them by Thursday and then did a bunch of other work in

194
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,360
my other time.

195
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,840
So I, I started breaking the rules around day three.

196
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,760
Another good story from then is the story where we had a bug quota.

197
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,400
I was expected to find like 10 bugs a week.

198
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,710
And of course I would make sure I found, I re sorry, I would make sure I

199
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,870
reported 13 or 14 or 15 every week.

200
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,790
Cause I wanted to exceed, but if I found more, I would save them for the next

201
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,470
week that didn't want my well to dry out.

202
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,440
Oh God.

203
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,200
So I worked there for a while and fast forward.

204
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,840
I was on a six month pro contract.

205
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,720
This was in the days of perma contract, but no one told me that it was just,

206
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,880
it was just going to get renewed.

207
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,840
So my contract began to end.

208
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,800
I interviewed for other jobs.

209
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,590
Okay.

210
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,030
And I was offered a job.

211
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,470
This is the story.

212
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,470
I don't tell very often, but the job offer I got was from ST labs.

213
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:23,690
I actually, uh, this was the company, one of my interviews with with James

214
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,460
Bach and they offered me a job and I took it.

215
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,330
I said, yes, I'll take your job.

216
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:34,010
And I went to my manager the next day and said, Hey, my contract's up in June,

217
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,130
beginning of June.

218
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,650
So, so January, best spend like five months.

219
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,090
But anyway, my contract's up.

220
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,410
So I'm going to take another job.

221
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,930
And he goes, looks at me with the face, like, whoa.

222
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,710
And I said, well, my contract's up.

223
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:46,390
So I got another job.

224
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,910
So, uh, just want to let you know, I'm gonna start there in two weeks.

225
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,630
And it was, this was a contract job at ST labs, by the way, but I didn't,

226
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,230
you know, I was fine.

227
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,150
I was young, healthy.

228
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,630
It was good.

229
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,510
So, wait, wait, pause.

230
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:57,830
Yeah.

231
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,870
Because you just said something that, that tweaks my head.

232
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,630
So was it addition?

233
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:04,750
No.

234
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,150
Okay.

235
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,590
There was eight months where I was a contractor and you know how

236
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,430
most contractors go through volt.

237
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,550
I did not.

238
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,430
My company was software testing labs.

239
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,960
Is that the same company?

240
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,520
It could have been, um, yeah, it is some contract.

241
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
It was a contract testing place.

242
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,280
I mean, they, yeah, it could have been.

243
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
And Bach was what?

244
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,880
Because I actually never.

245
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,560
Wow.

246
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,600
So I was going to work.

247
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,680
I was going to, I was going to work at site on their, in their office in Seattle,

248
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,800
which I thought was great.

249
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,320
Cause I didn't want to commute to the East side anymore.

250
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,960
So, you know, I told my boss that, and then I went to my office and I was

251
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,440
doing my work cause you know, I didn't have a short time or that it was thawing.

252
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,080
I like working in software.

253
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,520
But then his boss came to my office and said, Hey, uh, I heard the news from Doug.

254
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,510
And I want to know if there's a chance we could get you to work

255
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,710
here at a full-time job.

256
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,050
I was so confused.

257
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,570
I would love to have had a poker face, but I said a confused face.

258
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,770
I go, Oh, sure.

259
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,450
That'd be an option.

260
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:14,250
And they sent a goodie bag, uh, with an offer letter assigned to it, to my

261
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,650
house, like the next day.

262
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
So, uh, yeah.

263
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,960
And I said, I said, I, ST labs.

264
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,480
And I said, well, I got a full-time job counter offer for Microsoft.

265
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,400
I said, well, well, we can, I said, yeah, it's all right.

266
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,360
I think I'm going to do this thing.

267
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,360
So I did that.

268
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,400
And of course in their hurry to hire me, they got my, but I supposed to go to a

269
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,040
new employee orientation, but in their hurry to hire me, they got the date wrong.

270
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,920
So I never went, I never went to new employee orientation.

271
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,440
I skipped it.

272
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,880
And then I worked on windows 95 and networking that finished.

273
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
I worked on what was going to be windows 97.

274
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,720
And then I was part of Bill Gates discovering the internet.

275
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,240
So I worked on IE two and IE three.

276
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,000
I was, I didn't like working at internet explorer.

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,880
So I moved back over to windows 98.

278
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,680
I'm going to fast forward.

279
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,200
I was on windows 98.

280
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,000
I was doing a lot of API tests for networking, which was a ton of fun.

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,040
I took all the GUI tests I did and I maxed them to a hundred, uh, testing at the API

282
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,400
level.

283
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,680
So I, in hindsight, I don't think I need to test all that stuff, but I liked, I

284
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,320
liked learning.

285
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,000
I liked writing tests.

286
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,200
So I was, I was learning to write code pretty well in the end of 98.

287
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,440
I was also writing most of the API tests for GDI and user.

288
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,650
Those are the core components, the user level components of windows windows 98

289
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,010
shipped, I moved to the windows 2000 team.

290
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,490
It was probably called something different then.

291
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,530
And I worked on video capture drivers at the time when there were only about

292
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,610
three cameras available in total.

293
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,490
This would have been 1999 or late 98.

294
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,210
I worked on those for a while.

295
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,130
I worked for a guy named Brad Carpenter.

296
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:50,210
It was a ton of fun.

297
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,090
Did a lot of work.

298
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,090
There was no guidance on testing.

299
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,050
I just wrote a lot of automation that made sense mostly at the API level.

300
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:01,280
Again, I learned calm, calm, uh, component object model.

301
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,680
And then I loved, I loved calm and then the marketing department said, Hey, man,

302
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,040
we need to do another version of windows.

303
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,960
We said, what?

304
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,080
So we did another version of windows.

305
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,280
They pulled a sort of a skeleton crew.

306
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,160
This is the story I tell.

307
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,120
I think I've told it on this podcast where I knew what I wanted to do.

308
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,760
And our GM knew what he wanted me to do.

309
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,720
Uh, during windows 98, we ignored debug windows and I love like turning up the

310
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,360
warning levels all the way up in my compiler, runtime analysis all over the place.

311
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,260
We ignored the debug version of windows 98 and it does so much for

312
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,380
application development because of all the additional checks and asserts.

313
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,860
And it would not boot.

314
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:42,490
Wouldn't boot.

315
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,960
Just like booting.

316
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,080
You couldn't make it.

317
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,480
You couldn't get it even get very far in the socialization.

318
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,040
And I had a wonderful learning opportunity.

319
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,040
So first off, I said, I want to work on this and Tom, our GM said, Oh, we'll go

320
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,680
talk to, to go talk to this guy leading our dev team.

321
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,640
I talked to him.

322
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,200
I thought he was a buffoon.

323
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,500
I said, I don't want to work for this guy.

324
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,860
We'll talk to Nick.

325
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,260
Maybe we go talk to Nick about it.

326
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,820
So Nick, Nick is kind of not, not as much of a buffoon.

327
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,500
And I ended up doing that job working for Nick.

328
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,500
I was going to be partnered with a person who was one of the pioneers in the windows

329
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,380
kernel, and he and I were going to pair on this.

330
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,260
I was so excited.

331
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,420
I was going to get to learn.

332
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,140
And then I think the stock went up and he retired.

333
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,100
So I had to do it on my own.

334
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,980
And so this is where I learned x86 assembly.

335
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,820
I'm probably going way out.

336
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,540
I haven't got to modern testing yet, but I just, I like to make stuff go.

337
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,220
I was mainly driven, not because I wanted to work in assembly because I knew

338
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,220
the value of having a debug version of this thing, even if nobody was ever going

339
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,750
to use it and I had a ton of fun on this product.

340
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,910
This is where I pioneered some of Microsoft's initial static analysis

341
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,990
tools and fixed a bunch of those errors and windows and windows millennium.

342
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,230
Me, which also stands for marketing edition, because it was the reason

343
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,110
marketing wanted us to ship it.

344
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:05,950
Remember at that time, windows was the ship vehicle for a lot of products.

345
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,630
You can just go to the internet and download stuff like internet hearts

346
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,750
and other crap like that.

347
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,150
They wanted to, they wanted a version of windows to ship with.

348
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,870
So there was, there was no app store then.

349
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:16,990
Right.

350
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,830
This is actually, we're finally getting somewhere.

351
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:25,150
So after that shipped, uh, our, our GM or a VP went on to take over, uh,

352
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,830
windows CE at Microsoft.

353
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,510
So I went with him and worked on that.

354
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,630
I managed the test team that did for a while that did all of our driver

355
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,110
kernel, everything, low level, actually everything except the actually.

356
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,350
What didn't I didn't do graphics.

357
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,880
Oh, actually, eventually I did graphics.

358
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,920
So I ended up managing huge chunk of the test team.

359
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,360
I decided I wanted to get out of being a manager for a while.

360
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,360
I didn't, it wasn't, I don't like managing.

361
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,240
I love managing.

362
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,760
I don't really like managing at Microsoft that much.

363
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,720
So my manager said, well, what do you get?

364
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,840
My manager said, I want you, you know, windows just made these test architects.

365
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,960
I want you to be a test architect.

366
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,040
So I became the first test architect outside of core windows over in windows

367
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,600
CE, and that's where I joined the test architect group, where we had these,

368
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,560
these surreal discussions.

369
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,800
This is also where I got a little bit of imposter syndrome and I began

370
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,810
reading books on testing and I read a book on testing and I thought, oh,

371
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,090
I know so much about testing.

372
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:26,730
Oh, now I feel like a test architect.

373
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,890
And then I read another one and I thought, Oh, now I'm a little bit confused.

374
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:34,570
And then I read a third one said, Oh, now I think I need to form my own

375
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,410
opinions because there's a lot of BS in this technology.

376
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,090
So that's, that's how I got thinking about testing.

377
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:41,930
So fast forward.

378
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:47,340
Also on that team, I built a CI system for our, because people were

379
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,740
breaking the build stuff was breaking.

380
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,540
So we put a, put a gate in place where tests had to run.

381
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,140
Uh, certainly wasn't continuous deployment, but we made people go through a,

382
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:01,180
I was going to say, pause cause back then we did, we didn't call it CI.

383
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,380
We called it a gate.

384
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,780
Yeah.

385
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,180
A gate or a gauntlet.

386
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:05,580
Right.

387
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,970
We, we didn't really have CI per se.

388
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,850
Cause like the goals and the, and the, what happened.

389
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,850
But what I've even, even without a title, we can get out of the semantics of it.

390
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:26,090
Uh, in, in, you know, backsplaining or in hindsight, I was getting rid, I was

391
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,740
slowing the team down to speed them up and I didn't know why I was doing it.

392
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:36,660
I'd never heard of lean at the time or anything, but I knew if we slowed down

393
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,340
a little bit upstream, it would be better downstream and that happened.

394
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,850
So I worked on org for a while.

395
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,610
I ended up moving.

396
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:44,930
I ended up managing a small tools team.

397
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:49,130
So it was kind of one of those ICs high level ICs that manages a few people

398
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,050
versus some manager, managing a lot of people.

399
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:55,370
And that worked well for me, but there was an opportunity when Harry

400
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,880
Robinson namedrop Harry went to Google and he was working in an

401
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:06,080
organization called engineering excellence, which at the time under John,

402
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,800
it was John Devon reported to Bill Gates and engineering excellence

403
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
reported to John Devon.

404
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
Oh, I want to go get that job.

405
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,600
And I got that job as a test architect and I started doing technical

406
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,520
teaching, that sounds stupid.

407
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,200
Yeah, I guess it was.

408
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,280
I taught testing to test, to testers and designed some courses, gave some

409
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,640
courses, ended up running that team.

410
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,180
Uh, Microsoft, I was Microsoft's director of test excellence.

411
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,580
I was in that role when I wrote how we test software at Microsoft.

412
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,660
Some of you may remember that gem.

413
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,020
It's not that old.

414
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,780
And then it was during that time that I met a man named

415
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,710
Ren Jenson, wait, this is, we did this last time where you

416
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,790
couldn't remember years again.

417
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,750
No, no, no, no.

418
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,670
Cause how did you get on?

419
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,310
How did you get on the TLT?

420
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,030
Again, I was director of test excellence.

421
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:57,070
And part of that job was to play sort of the chief of staff for the

422
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,470
Microsoft test leadership team.

423
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,780
Okay.

424
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,300
Got it.

425
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,020
Got it.

426
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:06,100
So that's, I think where I think maybe Whitaker had introduced us just

427
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,180
either before or during, but I was getting you to come to those meetings

428
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,080
and be a part of that group.

429
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Then at somewhere in there, you began coming to these test architect

430
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,640
group meetings again.

431
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
That's where this podcast was born.

432
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,260
Because we would have these conversations where we would have good conversations.

433
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,780
And as much as I make fun of Brent, I respect him.

434
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,740
And I think he's, I think he's smart and does a lot of good stuff, but I

435
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,060
know I can give him shit.

436
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:39,100
We'll actually, by having a more vigorous debate, we'll actually get to a good solution.

437
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,620
I think the reason the principles have held up, if you compare it to the ones

438
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,100
that originally wrote what we have now, they're fixed because we were able to

439
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,620
work together and debate and do those things, but we would have such animated

440
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,540
discussions during these test architect group meetings.

441
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:01,240
That Michael Hunter, who I believe is now at Tableau said, you guys should do a

442
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:11,760
podcast with, and then the podcast was born sometime in 2014.

443
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:12,920
Is that right?

444
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,720
You guys can, you guys can go look at that and figure that out.

445
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:18,900
Yeah.

446
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,260
So at this point, I am still tester, tester, tester, but I haven't really

447
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,740
done that much testing.

448
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:33,460
I probably, it was probably since, uh, actually the, the last time I did full

449
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,620
time testing is like I do testing or test automation from as part as the

450
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,360
majority of my day would have been windows 98 because, oh, sorry, windows

451
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,080
2000 testing video capture drivers.

452
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,720
After that, it was making debug versions of windows working on low level

453
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,120
components, I ended up being the person that debugged the kernel crashes and

454
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,160
the stress runs overnight.

455
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,040
And I, I love that stuff.

456
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,760
Uh, when I moved on to windows CE, I was a manager, so I wasn't testing that much.

457
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I did a little bit of brute force automation once in a while, but I was

458
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,240
mainly actually figuring out, I was doing again, debugging.

459
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,160
I love debugging.

460
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:14,600
I ended up doing a lot of it when I joined, uh, text excellence group.

461
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,320
I for sure wasn't doing any testing.

462
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,880
When I moved to Microsoft link slot was communicator, then it became

463
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,680
linked and then it became Skype for business later.

464
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,740
But I worked on that.

465
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,060
Even there I was coaching testers.

466
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,020
I was teaching testers to do exploratory testing, not developers, but testers.

467
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,380
Uh, and having fun with that from there, I went to Xbox where

468
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,060
I worked on infrastructure.

469
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,100
I forgot that there were two teams we were on just again, twice.

470
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,700
You were on the server side.

471
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,820
Holy crap.

472
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,140
I was on link.

473
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,180
You worked on server.

474
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,500
I worked on the client team.

475
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,220
No, when I think when you were on, when you were on link, I was in media center

476
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:03,100
and then media center through a series of reorgs.

477
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,100
That's how I got on the Xbox.

478
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:12,480
And by the time, by the, yeah, I'm trying to remember where was

479
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,360
ever a time I was on link server.

480
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,600
I don't remember if we were ever on link at the same time.

481
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,440
Watch Brett quit enjoying unity right when I retire.

482
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,280
No, no.

483
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,840
Actually.

484
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,080
So yeah.

485
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:24,360
Okay.

486
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,280
So I want to get to the modern testing parts.

487
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,720
So all that.

488
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,440
So I've been in all these roles.

489
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,400
I've been test architect manager.

490
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,880
Uh, it was, so we began talking.

491
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,680
It was probably around the time I was in Xbox doing infrastructure that Brent

492
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,120
to tie it kind of tie these timelines together, that Brent was doing agile

493
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,360
stuff in being, I thought, cool.

494
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,240
For the record, uh, the infrastructure, I can't even call it a team.

495
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
I ran infrastructure on Xbox as a virtual team.

496
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,560
It was all just open source style, inner source style.

497
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,200
There's one thing actually.

498
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,800
So by that time you were no longer, well, obviously you were no

499
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,830
longer in the education org.

500
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:09,230
Right.

501
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,390
I went from the education org or the ex engineering excellence org to

502
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,110
link and then to Xbox.

503
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,030
But you'll correct me if I'm wrong.

504
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:21,710
But if I, if I remember correctly, even when you left, you still

505
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,670
ran community events.

506
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,310
Yeah.

507
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:29,300
I kept running, uh, not test leadership team, but there was a, uh, at

508
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,600
one point our T kind of off, maybe it, maybe it's relevant.

509
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:38,480
Uh, we had a technical commuting, technical TCN technical.

510
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,680
I don't know.

511
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,320
Q tech.

512
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,800
Well, TCN came to me and said, Hey, we want to have a group of senior

513
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,640
level people in the testing profession.

514
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,880
Remember we're still siloed.

515
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,840
There's still massive test teams are still 10,000 testers of Microsoft.

516
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,200
So just the senior people want to get together.

517
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,280
Cause we have funding to do that.

518
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,160
And they, they had a lot of money to feed us food.

519
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,920
We went to baseball games.

520
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,200
It was soccer games.

521
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:02,840
It was great.

522
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
And then we had the quality and testing excellence community, which I ran

523
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,080
for about two years, uh, and then TCN went away and I got my time back.

524
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,340
I was an Xbox.

525
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,980
Brent was learning agile.

526
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,500
I'm getting him to talk on panels and be part of these Q tech

527
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,780
conversations is agile.

528
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,620
Still very different, but it's dark conversations.

529
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,620
Like in that time you can accelerate the achievement of simple quality thought.

530
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,020
Oh yeah, I get that.

531
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,420
When Xbox shipped, I went on a sabbatical and I came back.

532
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,620
Actually I took a ton of time off.

533
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,340
I went to Australia for a month, came back for a few months, went to France

534
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,580
for three months and then came back.

535
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,060
But during that time I was working on the stupid science project known as

536
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,780
Astoria, which was the dumb thing to make windows app.

537
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,380
Sorry to make Android apps run on windows phone thought it would

538
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,020
have been a much easier effort just to build just to make the window shell

539
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,740
or run on the Android phone, but whatever.

540
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,580
I'm not in charge.

541
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,280
That product was never going to ship, but I wanted to learn Java and

542
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,960
I wanted to learn Linux and it was fun.

543
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,000
I just did random things, took it on.

544
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,480
It was great.

545
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,000
Uh, I got bored.

546
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,480
I got so, so bored.

547
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,120
I loved my manager, but I was bored and I told him I was bored.

548
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,920
He said, yeah, I don't know what to do.

549
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,320
I don't want you to leave, but maybe you should.

550
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,080
So I did.

551
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,520
And this is where I was because we didn't have a test team.

552
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,760
This was the big move that happened.

553
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,600
Then is I skipped the whole big important chunk in the early parts of this org.

554
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,760
We didn't have, we moved from X box to the stupid app and

555
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,800
we didn't have any testers.

556
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,800
This is my first time coaching testers on how sorry, coaching

557
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,840
developers on how to write tests.

558
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,470
Can't believe I almost skipped this part.

559
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,630
I did most of it through code review.

560
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,980
I would ask questions like, Hey, where are the tests?

561
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,140
Oh yeah.

562
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,660
We're going to get those in the next check-in.

563
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,020
Uh, no, you should probably test check in the test now.

564
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,020
Really?

565
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,740
Yeah.

566
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:03,460
Cause how, why does the code work?

567
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,020
Oh, I get where you're going.

568
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,220
Yeah.

569
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,060
I'm going to write some tests.

570
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,810
And so I have a few of those conversations eventually gets to, Oh great.

571
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,490
You have tests.

572
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,490
And then I critique the tests.

573
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,770
Why does your test doing 15 different things?

574
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,400
When your test fails, how about you?

575
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,200
Like I've gone through this pain for you.

576
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,160
So when your test fails, if your test fails, no, when your test fails, maybe

577
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,480
you should have some logging to know why.

578
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,040
Well, I'll just hook up the debugger.

579
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,480
Is that really the most optimal way to do?

580
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,240
Oh, I get.

581
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:31,720
Yeah.

582
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,080
Oh, that's cool.

583
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:33,800
Good idea.

584
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,720
And then for all these things, the more I bring them up and then other

585
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,100
people would almost got to be a, what would Allen say?

586
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,100
And then after awhile, I wasn't needed to be on to pay attention to code

587
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,500
reviews because all the questions I was asking about improving tests

588
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
were getting asked by others.

589
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,340
So it was great.

590
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,860
And again, I didn't care too much because the product was stupid.

591
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,020
So then I moved to, I moved from there to, uh, this was fun.

592
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:03,400
I moved to what eventually became Microsoft teams.

593
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,760
And we all know this story.

594
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,320
I love the product for awhile.

595
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,280
They didn't have any testers.

596
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,240
They hired me because I knew about testing and a big part of my job

597
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,200
was to coach the help developers do better testing.

598
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:23,060
I did on some places and other places, they were just happy to have their code suck.

599
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,940
I won some battles.

600
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,140
I lost some others.

601
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,940
And what they gave me was a million dollar budget to go hire contractors

602
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,980
offshore to help get this testing done.

603
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,820
The idea was it for it to be a stopgap.

604
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,260
So they keep moving forward while they address their backlog of missing tests.

605
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,740
And to be clear, they had a hundred, this is, I'm sure you've all seen this.

606
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,020
They had a hundred percent or not a hundred.

607
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,820
They had like, seriously, like 90 plus percent code coverage on their unit

608
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,260
tests across the board.

609
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,220
Nice.

610
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,060
And what does that mean for quality?

611
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:56,010
It means it's perfect ship it.

612
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:59,130
Or you're missing 5%, but who cares?

613
00:28:59,370 --> 00:28:59,690
Yeah.

614
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:05,930
There's, there is so much in conversation I've been having even today is the gap

615
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,050
between works and good is much bigger than people think.

616
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,900
And, um, code coverage covers, which of those topics?

617
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,300
It covers works kind of covers, covers some of what's major tests covers the code.

618
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,620
Does it mean the code works?

619
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,420
Anyway.

620
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:27,500
So I learned a lot cause actually I found out, this is where I really found out.

621
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,180
Cause I was doing less code review and more kind of hands on working

622
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,380
with folks and then the test.

623
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,540
This is where I really discovered that, wait a minute, developers can really

624
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,700
do good testing and even though I complained about them missing some stuff

625
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,700
that could have been automated.

626
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:46,260
When I sat when I said, okay, let's, let's do a hate, hate it, but we did a bug bash.

627
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,060
Let's, let's work on finding bugs and I gave them ideas.

628
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,220
I gave them some heuristics.

629
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:55,180
I gave them Elizabeth Henderson cheat sheet and we had developers find bugs

630
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,580
that I think only the best testers in my career would have found.

631
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,540
They absolutely were able to pick.

632
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:05,300
They just needed to know it was okay to, to use their brains and

633
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,660
engage and do some testing.

634
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,180
And I had light bulbs going off that.

635
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,380
Oh my God.

636
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,620
I spent so much of my career and we need to backtrack a little bit here.

637
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:19,620
When I was in test excellence, my job was to celebrate the career and profession

638
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,660
of the software tester at Microsoft.

639
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:27,820
We had 10,000 testers and I worked on career paths extensively to describe

640
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,740
what it would be like for testers to grow all the way up to the highest levels.

641
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:37,380
And man, the cognitive dissonance, when I taught developers to be that good

642
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,340
and testing that quickly, it's like, holy shit.

643
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,300
I wish I knew then what I knew now because I did a bunch of shit wrong.

644
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,570
I learned a lot there about teaching developers to test and in, we weren't

645
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:56,010
very agile, but we, I learned a lot of things about shipping in an agile way.

646
00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:00,990
So we're able to ship our services on demand, which was great.

647
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,670
We shipped our front end once a week.

648
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,310
I wish we could have shipped it more often.

649
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,630
And that's, if I think I would have stayed, what would have got to

650
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,630
a stage where we did that.

651
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:16,230
I know after I left, they did so much of non feature flagging and shoving stuff

652
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,790
in so that we could weekly release that customers asked them to slow down the

653
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:24,550
cadence, I don't know if that's better or not now, but we did a lot of cool,

654
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,510
all the cool deployment tricks for the blue green deployments.

655
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:31,670
And we did, we actually deployed our, what was going to be the

656
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,430
next week's build in rings.

657
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,590
They still call rings, their rings or circles.

658
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,950
So like, we just push them buttons.

659
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,250
First it went to just me and my organization.

660
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,010
And then once our test team did their steps and yes, it's pretty good.

661
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:52,090
We'd roll that out to all of the organization, then to all of Microsoft

662
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,730
before we'd really sex, internally.

663
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:56,290
And I love that, that phased rollout.

664
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,490
We did it in steps versus a slider, but learned a lot about how to

665
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,250
deploy in the, in the real world.

666
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,850
So I got fed up with my manager for being a dick and I quit.

667
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,740
I had a new job.

668
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,750
I, I, I talked to the folks at unity and they said, Hey, well I said, Hey, uh,

669
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,230
I'm thinking of leaving Microsoft.

670
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
Do you have any jobs?

671
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,140
Cause they had approached me like a two years before I said, actually,

672
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,220
I don't have that other job.

673
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,180
I have a new job.

674
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,580
And I said, what is it?

675
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,940
We need someone to run our services QA.

676
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,300
I said, question one, what is services QA?

677
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,540
And they said, Oh, all of our guy was my boss for all.

678
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,260
I didn't really know.

679
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,940
It's like, Oh, we have a bunch of stuff that it's in the internet.

680
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,460
In the internet.

681
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,580
What it ended up being is when I described it, it was all the parts of unity

682
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,540
that use the internet.

683
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,300
It was everything from the website to some stuff in the editor to things

684
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,500
that are peer services like analytics and ads.

685
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:57,540
And anyway, I, this was a great job because all my interviews were all about

686
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,820
getting to know fit and feel and not about stupid whiteboard things.

687
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,860
And they never even asked for my resume until they forgot that they needed

688
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
it in order to give me an offer.

689
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,020
They're like, Oh, Oh yeah.

690
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,460
Just realized you know, resume from you.

691
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,060
That's cool.

692
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:11,500
Here's one.

693
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,660
And so I started in, I didn't, of course, I spent my last two

694
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,220
teams not having QA, but I didn't join.

695
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,260
And you remember this next, we were talking a lot about this as I joined.

696
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,020
And I still remember our very last podcast at Microsoft when, uh, we drank

697
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,860
some tequila together while we podcasted.

698
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,940
That must've been a while back.

699
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,860
I didn't join unity with like, Oh, now I'm going to get rid of these testers.

700
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,860
I joined unity thinking, this is going to be fun to manage a QA team.

701
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,780
And the challenge there for me was learning how to manage a

702
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,300
globally distributed team.

703
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,580
Very little of my team was in Seattle with me or Bellevue.

704
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,810
Worldwide, the unity Bellevue office is known as the Seattle office

705
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,090
because, uh, who knows where Bellevue is.

706
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:53,930
Right.

707
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,970
This is a lot fresher in my mind, but I remember a point when I realized

708
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:03,050
you know what this is because they're all, it was agile ish across the board.

709
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,170
So all of my org were embedded into other teams.

710
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,210
And I was there to help them and coach them, help them to do the right

711
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,730
things and give them advice and things.

712
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,610
And that's what I realized, maybe it was on a podcast.

713
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,450
I said, it's really a community.

714
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,280
And then like literally like less than a month later, I was rereading agile

715
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,500
testing and Lisa and Janet said the same thing in their book and agile

716
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,220
manager's job or agile test manager's job is to run a community paraphrase.

717
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,540
I thought, Oh, well, I'm glad I'm just discovering this now.

718
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,040
It got to a point, maybe six months in when I realized that the right thing

719
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,350
for me to do for unity's business and for the career of these people was

720
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:51,720
to get rid of them all and I fired none, but I helped all of them move

721
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,280
into different roles at unity into dev roles, into quality coach roles,

722
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,520
into DevOps roles, someone well respected.

723
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
And he knows I'm talking about him.

724
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:08,040
Someone well-respected across our entire org, who was a QA lead reporting to me.

725
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,280
And now he's like the, one of the most respected DevOps folks across the org.

726
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,320
It's probably the most I didn't set out to just see what the right thing to do.

727
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,600
So within 18 months or so, or maybe two years, it took me two years.

728
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,800
And it's funny how Brent used to joke about how I changed jobs every 18

729
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,960
months to two years and said, no, I don't, but mother effers, right.

730
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,760
Confucius say find the job you love and you'll never work a day in your life.

731
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,840
So I'm going to talk about even my new job now or what's happened since then.

732
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,960
After about two years, I, my team was gone.

733
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,000
So I moved into what was then called our monetization org, which is

734
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,200
ads, some other businesses.

735
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,840
Now it's a much bigger org and I have many more cool responsibilities.

736
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,880
But it was really those first two years of me at unity and going through that

737
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:05,280
process is where we solidified and in my head really embraced what is modern testing.

738
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,480
That was the question I was going to get to is, is, um, like to me, your

739
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,520
experience on teams feels very much like how I felt about my experience on Xbox.

740
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,240
You and I had fundamentally different experiences in that organization.

741
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,160
Um, I was lucky enough to be put into a position where I was, my role was to do

742
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,640
whatever the hell I wanted, as long as I provided value.

743
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,120
So it was, it was good.

744
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,640
It was easy to have fun, but anyway, go with Xbox.

745
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:36,960
Yeah.

746
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,550
No, I, when I left Xbox, a big part of it.

747
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,550
And in, I tell people don't leave a team, go to a team.

748
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:50,270
Um, in that particular move, I did both.

749
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,710
I was very much motivated to get out of Xbox because I thought the culture

750
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,870
was just entirely dysfunctional.

751
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,880
And then I wanted to go to a team that claimed that they were doing agile and,

752
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,280
uh, was actually happy about it.

753
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,960
And they were doing services.

754
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,660
I wanted to go, I wanted to go and find a place where I could learn by

755
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:22,300
entrenching myself, um, how software works differently in that environment.

756
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,980
And it sounds like teams was that for you, teams was sort of your Xbox.

757
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,540
It was like, I learned, I learned a lot in teams.

758
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:36,260
I used to say on teams that it wasn't until I ran all of the infrastructure

759
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,660
in DevOps that I really began to have an influence over quality.

760
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,300
And I've heard some, I've heard people say that too.

761
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,420
Like there's so much ability to have influence in a good DevOps team.

762
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,300
So I learned that there.

763
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,540
I had so much influence over the quality by controlling our deployments

764
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,300
and having an understanding of how to deploy.

765
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,140
I learned a lot of basis.

766
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,860
It was just a little bit of a toxic environment and it wasn't a product in

767
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:05,500
the end, I loved anymore because product mistakes being made in choosing to.

768
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,990
Again, going back to lean, I had also developed my own principles by

769
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:12,950
doing small things well, and those things weren't happening.

770
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,190
I didn't have control over that.

771
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,750
I just had control over the, the end of the sausage maker, but I learned a lot

772
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:25,850
about influencing quality and how I can control that from a, uh, infrastructure

773
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,000
point of view and the same thing is then three years later or two

774
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,880
years, two and a half years later, I got the hang of it.

775
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,800
I realized that now I own those same things plus program management.

776
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
And don't get confused on the Microsoft program management, but I control

777
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,800
the aspects of how our engineering teams do their estimations and deliver

778
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,760
and get, get them to think about the things they need to think about

779
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,640
to be ready to work and to be done.

780
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,480
Now I have even more control over the quality of our products.

781
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,880
Cause I, I control the whole sausage making machine.

782
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,680
The other teams I work with focus on product development, everything I do

783
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,320
and my teams do enables them or blocks them.

784
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,280
It puts them, puts the right guard rails up, I should say, so they

785
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,360
can deliver quickly and effectively and with quality.

786
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,760
So I definitely learned some of that basis in teams going into my time at

787
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,030
unity while I loved accelerate the achievement of quality.

788
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,790
And I think we had already had the modern versus traditional much earlier.

789
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,910
I believe I was still at Microsoft when we had that debate.

790
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,000
I can't quite remember.

791
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,180
I don't think so.

792
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,580
I look, I feel like we recorded that one in Lincoln square.

793
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,060
I have, I have a memory.

794
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,700
It could be, I could be wrong, but worth looking up.

795
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:48,700
It was definitely while I was experiencing a team or teams moving from

796
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:54,110
traditional, even if it was actually, they were moving from agile or fake agile.

797
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,790
And again, Lisa will probably listen to this episode eventually agile testing,

798
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,870
as she and Janet describe it is wonderful.

799
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,110
Too many times in my experience, it wasn't, it was still the embedded

800
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,750
tester was the one doing all of the testing.

801
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,790
And that's unfortunate, but I saw his teams were the embedded tester was doing

802
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,550
all the testing and wanted to move that to real whole, whole team quality.

803
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,790
When did, when did you move to unity?

804
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:25,590
Uh, January, it spent almost four years because Barack Obama and I both

805
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,950
quit our jobs on the same day.

806
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,790
So we recorded that on September 2017.

807
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,660
Oh, wow.

808
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:34,380
Yeah.

809
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:34,900
Wow.

810
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,940
It was after.

811
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,300
But then the principles came up and I really think we formed, I don't know if

812
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,420
I've answered, I think without answering it directly and walking through that, I

813
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,420
think maybe I've answered the question of how I came out of my career ended up

814
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,780
getting to modern testing.

815
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,380
It was sometimes it was actually rarely purposeful.

816
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:00,110
Here's the thing that I think that I realized that is common in both of our

817
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:00,710
stories.

818
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:05,910
Number one, there was an element of just had it with the dysfunction

819
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:12,790
that caused us to move on the team where I'm where, and then move on to a team

820
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,350
where number one, we both had autonomy.

821
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:23,700
Uh, well, actually we both had an autonomy around how we would execute software.

822
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:34,750
And we both made a decision to try out this agile lean thing and furthermore,

823
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:43,310
realized, holy effing crap that completely works so much better than pretty much

824
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,990
the best thing I had learned in the last 20 years.

825
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,190
I'm drawn towards efficiency.

826
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:49,680
Yeah.

827
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,620
In fact, I loathe inefficiency.

828
00:41:53,620 --> 00:42:00,450
So if I see a better way of doing something, I'm drawn toward it and it's

829
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:04,770
just something I've definitely discovered, especially in the last, uh, few years.

830
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,180
Yeah.

831
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,980
I remember in, in, in, again, you weren't pursuing, uh, you said it like, Hey, the

832
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:14,980
first thing I did was realize I needed to get rid of my team.

833
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:18,220
No, it actually, it actually took several months for me to get, that wasn't

834
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,700
what I wanted to do at all, but it got to a point I was like, Oh God.

835
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:21,020
Yeah.

836
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,620
I'm the, the, the orb, the light that I was being drawn towards was one

837
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:28,100
more, he didn't have dedicated testers in our services orgs.

838
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,980
No, but that wasn't what you were trying to do.

839
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:37,140
What you were trying to do is get rid of the, uh, what do we call it?

840
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,500
The co-dependency.

841
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:39,900
Yeah.

842
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,820
I was trying to ask, I was trying to run an effect.

843
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,590
Safety net, right.

844
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,310
Um, the,

845
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:48,590
I'm pointing out that one thing really cool to call out is during that time,

846
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:53,070
one of the things I did in building this community was I had 90% of my team,

847
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,750
plus some guests hang out with me in Bellevue for three days.

848
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,790
And Brent came and gave a talk.

849
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,980
Yeah, that was fun.

850
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,300
That was fun.

851
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,500
The there's, there's three times you asked me to come into a talk.

852
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:10,400
One was, uh, that agile panel, uh, way back in the day, way back

853
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,000
at Microsoft at Q tech, the second one was around the combined engineering

854
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,200
transformation.

855
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,480
I had left big at that time and I was executing it in the power BI org.

856
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
You asked me to come and talk about that.

857
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,320
I remember, I remember, uh, very fondly that one cause your joke then.

858
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,360
Do you remember what your joke was when you introduced me?

859
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,120
No.

860
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:42,970
Uh, you said some of you may or may not know, uh, this person, I don't know how

861
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:49,130
he's going to do a 30 minute talk because I'm fairly certain he can't even

862
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,450
pronounce his name in short than 10 minutes.

863
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:54,010
Cause it all true.

864
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,490
I would say the same thing today.

865
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:57,830
That's not a joke.

866
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:59,750
That's just, that's just expectations.

867
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,510
Yeah.

868
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,470
So it was well framed because you, you started it off with that challenge.

869
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,910
And I remember I nailed my time, but you're right.

870
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:12,510
If you hadn't done that, I probably would have been the cause for going over.

871
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:17,310
And the third time was, uh, was a sort of a data culture discussion.

872
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:27,420
Uh, it was actually, uh, essentially the modern data oriented techniques for

873
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,620
looking at and improving quality.

874
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:30,860
Right.

875
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:37,260
And that actually eventually became one of the decks that AST did or asked me to do.

876
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:40,800
And it's up on YouTube now for those who care.

877
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm still thinking through your story and the similarity.

878
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,920
And I think the similarity is these were sort of things that we've been

879
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,200
actively thinking about for a while.

880
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,760
I can even maybe even, uh, generalize this more is one of the things we wanted

881
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,400
to do when we started the podcast was help people who were going through any one

882
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,460
of these transformational changes and help them understand there was a greener

883
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,860
grass on the other side.

884
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:16,400
And one thing common between you and I is we embrace change.

885
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,280
We're not afraid of change.

886
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,200
We'd like to try new things a lot.

887
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,720
And we're not worried about screwing stuff up.

888
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,040
We just want to try new stuff.

889
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:23,960
Yep.

890
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,440
The concept of best practices, uh, hum, uh, that humbles me.

891
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,760
That would be the exact opposite direction.

892
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,520
Uh, a noise, uh, irritates me greatly, right?

893
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,400
Best practices are now.

894
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:40,330
Right.

895
00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:45,170
Uh, anyone who studies systematics knows that once you have a current practice,

896
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:51,730
you got it eventually the whole system readjusts and constructs new problems.

897
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:55,210
Like a example email came out emails.

898
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,090
Fantastic.

899
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,850
It's fast, right?

900
00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:00,650
I can, I can, I don't have to write a letter.

901
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:04,850
I can, I can just type a letter, send it to Alan in five minutes.

902
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,850
And I don't have to call him going, Hey, did you get my letter yet?

903
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:09,850
Did you get my letter yet?

904
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:13,730
But then what happens is it creates a new problem.

905
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:14,610
Okay.

906
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:19,770
It reduced the friction also for all the people who I don't want to get crap from.

907
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,810
So now I'm buried by emails.

908
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,090
Like I, uh, I get calls from Alan.

909
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:29,890
Hey, Hey, Brent, I sent you an email like three days ago that

910
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,410
you haven't responded yet, right?

911
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,370
I get the same, goes back to the same initial problem.

912
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,930
I've never called Brent, but I do remember this guy, Carl,

913
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:41,450
windows CE would he'd, uh, I'd see you walk up to my door and just stand there

914
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:44,730
in my doorway, we had, we had offices, the doors you say, did you get my mail?

915
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:46,390
I don't know.

916
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,670
Well, can you read it?

917
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:53,140
I know all the time.

918
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,260
No, I can't read.

919
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,690
I probably got your mail.

920
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,210
Send me, send me a dead tree mail.

921
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:02,700
All right.

922
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,460
So I like the parallels there, the parallels.

923
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,620
We got to kind of wrap up here.

924
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,980
So what, so that's kind of where I got where Matt and ask me, ask me a question.

925
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,180
Yeah.

926
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,140
One question.

927
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:23,510
So for me, I can remember like yesterday when, when it all clicked in and why I

928
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:30,430
knew this was actually correct versus me just rolling the dice and go, I'm

929
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:33,990
pretty confident in this is going to work, but not actually knowing.

930
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:42,390
Did you have such an, an aha moment where you go like, Oh yeah, I am never,

931
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,590
I am never ever going back.

932
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,660
Kind of, kind of.

933
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:51,660
And for me, you know, we had talked about this stuff and I had done it in practice.

934
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,700
I thought, well, maybe there's more context I'm missing and it's not working.

935
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:59,380
And probably not only going to work if I'm there and it's just too much.

936
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,140
And then I went, we came up with the principles and we thought they were

937
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,580
going to keep on changing for a long time, but they really haven't changed.

938
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,860
And I presented them at test bash in 2018, I believe.

939
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,740
And the number of people that came up, this is a test conference.

940
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,420
I thought I was going to scare the crap out of them.

941
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:16,420
Right.

942
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,580
The number of people that came up to me afterwards and said, Oh my God,

943
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,800
you're describing exactly what I do.

944
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,080
Thanks for putting a name to it.

945
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,480
I thought, what, what?

946
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,080
Cause I had given a talk a year earlier called testing without testers.

947
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:36,360
And I don't think I even believed it was really how I did it and how it kind of

948
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,400
could be done and how I was cheating by using contract testers, but it was

949
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,000
really talking about coaching developers.

950
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,790
But moving from there to the principles and covering everything that

951
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,030
kind of has to work together.

952
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:53,150
And so much of that, as you and I will agree is stolen from lean and the lean

953
00:48:53,150 --> 00:49:01,220
startup and agile testing that you kind of backsplend our way into that.

954
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,940
But it really was probably test bash.

955
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,940
When I thought when it became something I thought worked for me, that's something

956
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,540
I knew could work for everyone.

957
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:10,570
That was my, aha.

958
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:11,890
Okay.

959
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:17,570
And I got to tell you, I've had groups I don't even work with at unity as late as

960
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,410
last week, pull me into a Slack channel conversation.

961
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,140
Hey, Alan, we're doing this thing.

962
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,060
I can't tell you what it is.

963
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,900
Uh, how do you think modern testing principles would apply here?

964
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:32,580
I don't even know you and you're talking about, Oh my God.

965
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:39,340
Wait, wait is model modern testing principles, like a, a, a well-known

966
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,860
brand within unity.

967
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,340
No.

968
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:47,860
I mean, no, I, I have done no, I've done zero evangelism inside of unity.

969
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,340
People just find it and go, Oh, Hey, this looks valuable.

970
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,740
And they try to say, Oh, and this guy works here.

971
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,340
This is cool.

972
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,380
Or the other way around, like who the hell is this guy telling us what

973
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:01,900
to do LinkedIn search, uh, angry.

974
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,300
We, well, what the hell, right?

975
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,060
Maybe goes the other way.

976
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,540
Happened more than once.

977
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,540
That's the, that's cool.

978
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,510
The, um, yeah, I remember back in the day, no one's asked me to do this, uh,

979
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,710
in a while, but back in the day, I had teams coming out of the woodwork,

980
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,710
asking me to walk them and onboard them to agile.

981
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:24,590
Yeah.

982
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:25,470
I remember.

983
00:50:26,350 --> 00:50:28,750
All right, man, we got to close it up, but we're back on for

984
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:29,830
every two weeks now, right?

985
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:30,710
Yeah.

986
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,670
Cool.

987
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:32,030
Cool.

988
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,350
Hope you all enjoy the new time.

989
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:35,270
New bat place, all that stuff.

990
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:36,230
I'm still Alan.

991
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,230
I'm Brett.

992
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:38,830
We'll see you next time.

993
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,410
On the AB testing podcast.
