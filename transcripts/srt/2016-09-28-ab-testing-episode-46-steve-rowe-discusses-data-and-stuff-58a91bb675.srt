1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:15,080
Hey everybody. Howdy. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're back for AAB testing episode 46.

2
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:24,550
Hey Brent. Yes, I don't think we're alone now. We are not. Today we have a special guest.

3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:32,580
Is he special or just a guest? He's a special guest. A special guest. Steve Rowe is a data

4
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:42,300
scientist manager in the Windows team. His journey has been much like myself. Why don't

5
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,870
you say a few words, Steve, about how you got here?

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,910
Sure. So I'm Steve Rowe. I came through the same similar channel to Brent and perhaps Alan.

7
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,570
I was a test developer for a long time in the Windows team. I did multimedia for a long

8
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,870
time and then I did some developer service stuff and then made a changeover to data science

9
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,230
as I saw things moving and changing and I thought that there was a lot more power in

10
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,950
figuring out whether we were doing the right thing or not and bringing quality through

11
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:18,320
data rather than quality through repeating testing over and over and over and over again.

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,670
What's wrong with that? People are now worried for their jobs. Don't freak them out.

13
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,180
There is, yes, there's some of that. There's going to be, what was it called, creative

14
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,820
destruction. I think would be Schumpeter's turn that is going on in some of this. So

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,700
I don't think you'll get rid of testers but I think that there's definitely a reduction

16
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,300
in the need for raw testers as they were replaced by data. Just the same way that there was kind

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,940
of a reduction in the need for manual testers as test development picked up.

18
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,660
You'll see if you follow Steve Rowe's blogs, you'll definitely see that he's cut from

19
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,980
the same cloth as most of the three. Actually, it occurs to me. We have two of the three

20
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,760
in the room today.

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Wait.

22
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Yeah.

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
I think I'm one.

24
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,520
Yeah, but Alan doesn't listen to the podcast.

25
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
I do.

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520
I have multiple personalities.

27
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
Those guys are smart.

28
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Oh, God.

29
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,400
Brent, Brent, Brent. So I have a question. I've been waiting to have a guest to do this because

30
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,520
like testing, if you ask two testers what they do, there's a lot of overlap Venn diagram

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,960
but there's differences. I think I bet my hunch is it's the same thing in the data

32
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,720
science world. So you've listened, you know Brent really well, you know what he does.

33
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,400
What are some things that maybe differ in what your approach and what you do and then

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
what Brent does?

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,800
I don't quite know what Brent does well enough to tell you exactly what.

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,120
Yeah, Brent doesn't do anything well.

37
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,520
Well, then I do things well. So there's the difference.

38
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,120
I do perception management really well, apparently.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,600
So my team is kind of a split team. Half my team is what I would call a data engineering

40
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,280
team and the other half is a data science team. And so we spend some of our time

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,160
figuring out how to move data and process data at volume and then some of our time

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,000
trying to actually analyze data and figure out what the insights are.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I think the big difference is organizationally we're probably at different

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,800
spots in an organization. Windows is still trying to figure out how to use data.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,640
And so as you guys have been talking the last few times about the process through

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,640
data, we're clearly past the data oblivious phase. We know no data exists but we're

47
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,960
still in this phase that I don't think you quite mentioned but kind of a

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,640
confirmatory data stage where half the time we want to use data but only if it

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,680
confirms our intuition. And we don't really want to be challenged by the data.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,400
I've heard some people around me say, you know, I only want this result if it's

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,360
going to show me what I want because if it's not what I think is true, then I

52
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,880
know that the data is wrong, which is clearly an interesting stage to be in.

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,760
So a lot of our job is spent trying to get the organization to pay attention

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,080
to data, to become more data literate and more understanding of what data

55
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,120
should be used for. So we have less opinions and more data-driven decisions.

56
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
That's actually very interesting. There's something we talked about that data aware

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,120
stage, which was interesting and maybe it's somewhere in there. I think you're

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,310
much farther along than my org, for example. But there's a data trustworthy.

59
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,630
Remember we used to deal with, used to, like last week with test trustworthiness.

60
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,830
Can I trust that this test failure is a product failure? Or can I trust that

61
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,430
this test passing means the product's working correctly? We kind of, not kind

62
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:27,590
of, there's a huge parallel with data. Can I, is this data telling me, do I

63
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,590
believe this data? Do I not believe this data? Right. And I think that's, that's

64
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,390
accurately a question people ask because the one thing I keep telling my team

65
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,470
is when you're writing programs and you get them wrong, oftentimes they crash

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,270
or they go clearly incorrect. If you're using math, it doesn't generally crash.

67
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,710
You can divide by zero. You can get some imaginary numbers, but not in

68
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,270
numbers, but otherwise it doesn't crash. It will happily tell you that the

69
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,910
average house price is $2 billion. And if you believe it, you know, that's the

70
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,830
case, right? It won't tell you, sorry, you gave me the wrong input. It'll just

71
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,910
tell you the average house price and value is $2 billion, which is off by at

72
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,570
least one zero. At least yeah. So I just had this happen yesterday. I, I got the

73
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:14,700
phone call, the IM, summoning me to the boss's rooms, the VP's room. And yeah,

74
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,740
we looked at the bug data and some just going back a decade looking at bug data

75
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,340
and incoming rate was dropping way down. We're at the part of our product, right?

76
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,170
Where it should and he looked, I don't believe it's dropped down that far. I said,

77
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,850
well, that's what the data says. I'm gonna go take a look at it. I, that it

78
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,970
is a little bit too good to be true, but I think we're over that corner. And

79
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,570
sure enough, I go back to the data. Someone had mucked with a query

80
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:50,260
underneath me and got the, and screwed it up and they're off by about half. So

81
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:58,060
the numbers were not good, but it's like, I think anytime what my lesson learned

82
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,060
there was trust, but verify just, I think with, yeah, I think that was the

83
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,420
wise wisdom from way back. I've definitely seen it happen both ways. It's still

84
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,820
true here. People find data that they want to believe and they, they believe it

85
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,740
to be true. I remember years and years ago, somebody did some analysis, not like

86
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,220
data analysis, but some analysis of a, we had this big system called WTT windows

87
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,700
test technology or whatever. And there's all these jobs that ran tests, like

88
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,100
thousands and thousands of jobs that ran tests. And somebody came in one day to

89
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,100
a develop directors meeting and they said, half of these jobs don't work. I

90
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,500
ran my tool and I found out that half of them don't work. They just can't run

91
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,170
it all. And they were beating us up because we were all idiots for not

92
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,170
having working jobs. And we go back and we're like, well, they actually do

93
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,410
work. So what was going on? Well, their tool had forgotten how to parse or

94
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,810
they hadn't built it, how to parse variables. And so there might be a

95
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,930
directory like, you know, SQL and back just windows. And then we would say

96
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,290
winder in as a variable and it wouldn't parse the directory and go, well,

97
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,650
there's no directory called winder. So therefore this can't possibly be

98
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,170
accessing anything on the system. They were happily trusting their data

99
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,130
instead of verifying it. And they were, you know, and that happens both

100
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,890
what happens that way, or it happens on the dev side or the PM side

101
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,170
sometimes where they don't want the data to tell them something wrong.

102
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,490
Like I don't trust it no matter what, because it's not matching my

103
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,450
intuition. You do have a lot of those problems in, in the data science

104
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,770
space. I'll give you an example. Just yesterday, we have a new data

105
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,090
scientist that ramped up he's come from office, where they have a much

106
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:32,570
more well documented curated list of data sets. And he's like, Hey, I

107
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,010
want to do is essentially, hey, I want to do data science. Can you

108
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:43,800
point me to the documentation for our data sources? And I'm like, okay,

109
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,440
dude, you and I need to meet. Because there are literally hundreds of

110
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,840
them, none documented. Right, we have, we have this one system that

111
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:04,130
does kind of automate away all the data movement for us. And they

112
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,850
able to use reflection to get essentially a reflection to get the

113
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,490
schema and publish the schema. But you have you have things like a

114
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,250
widget, goo it in a widget ID. Are these things the same thing? Or

115
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,330
are they not, right? We you have a lot of exceptions in the data

116
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,170
because the data doesn't come to us clean. You have a lot of

117
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:32,850
people who go to the raw data directly directly operate under the

118
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,490
belief that they do actually understand everything about the

119
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,330
data that they need to, which is I think similar to what Steve was

120
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,050
talking about, but they don't. So part of the things I do now is, hey,

121
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,870
I'll point you to the data. If you present any analyses you do

122
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,750
without vetting it through me to make sure you've got the tribal

123
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,020
knowledge, right, dude, you're on your own. And when someone

124
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,380
comes to me and says, hey, your numbers don't line up with

125
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,980
Brent's. I'm telling you upfront, you're the one that's

126
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,020
going to do the the the digging to figure out why. So what do

127
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,780
you think is the right level of documentation to do on data

128
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,740
sources? Like I've seen people that want a white pages of data,

129
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,860
right? I want to be able to like point you at every single data

130
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,540
source. I want to have them all fully documented. And then I've

131
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,060
seen teams that operate more like what you're talking about

132
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,460
where it's there's a bunch of data and you can kind of tell

133
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,460
the names, but you can't tell anything else. Where's the

134
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,300
right balance? Because you can get it right. You can easily

135
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,500
over index. So I'll tell you the approach that my team's

136
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,600
taking now. We are building what we call the CDW, which is a

137
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
common data warehouse. And it's initially we had planned it to

138
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,800
be something more directive where we would build it up and

139
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,260
then democratize it. Now what we are doing because I so I

140
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,940
flatted that as a proposal. And what it turns out is my own

141
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:03,150
team, Dev and PM, they're at the phase of Yeah, that could be

142
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,780
really useful as long as we don't have to build it. And so I

143
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:13,220
think the ROI of us doing that upfront is rather low, because

144
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,340
it's uncertain who who are going to be my customers if I

145
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,540
build it. But I need the data curated for I need a subset of

146
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,380
it for my purposes. So what my team is going to do is every

147
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,180
time we ingest a new data set, we'll curate it and then

148
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,180
we'll document it and we'll do it one at a time. I'd say right

149
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,900
now, most of 80% of what I'm working with is against 20

150
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,900
different data sets. That's easy enough to document. There's

151
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,700
there's a lot of asks for a lot more. But it's not high in my

152
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,820
backlog today. So when it becomes when it becomes it and I

153
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,500
then I pull the data in, I'll document it. In the meantime, what

154
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,300
I will do is document and police standards of practice. So

155
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,060
those those others who want a different data set, I'll say,

156
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,100
Hey, you're welcome to add to the CDW turn it into sort of a

157
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,260
shared source type project. And but you need to you will follow

158
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,260
these rules. Because if you don't, and I discover it, I

159
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,220
will remove your data from the CDW. Right? So I turned it

160
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,180
into much more of a shared source, but moderated to

161
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,540
prevent broken window theory.

162
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,020
So you have a few sources, a limited number of sources that

163
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,180
are commonly used, they're all documented, and then everything

164
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,700
else is kind of still the wild west.

165
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,700
Absolutely.

166
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,820
What are some examples of data sources you use for data sets?

167
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:43,210
You can you can generify for the external audience.

168
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,850
Until right now, I'm spending a large portion of my time

169
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,690
focused on availability concerns and reliability

170
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:56,360
concerns. So we have a transaction feed for the

171
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:03,110
heartbeat of VMs is the VM up or down. We have a ton of

172
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:06,470
metadata feeds, we have another transaction feed that that we use

173
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,500
quite often, which is our we call it our control plane. It's

174
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,540
essentially, hey, how many times the customer says create a VM?

175
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,220
Do we actually create a VM? Because now those two together,

176
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:28,540
we can then come up with new insights like hey, if a if a VM

177
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,660
goes down, can we determine if it was because the customer

178
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,500
asked for it to be down, which the heartbeat feed won't

179
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,290
necessarily tell you, but the control plane feed will. And

180
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,690
then we have a just a crap ton of dimension feeds, which is

181
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,770
essentially metadata about the nouns that we see in the

182
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:54,050
transaction feeds. So we'll have a VM dimension, it tells us

183
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,690
everything about where that VM lived and who it belongs to, we

184
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,810
have customer dimensions that say, hey, this customer is

185
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,530
Walmart, for example, and their headquarters are over and

186
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,210
wherever.

187
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,770
Isn't that personally identifiable information?

188
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:17,380
It is not. That is tenant, what's known as tenant identifiable

189
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,020
information. And that is fine.

190
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,820
I said that because we've had the same discussion often in my

191
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,740
team. So what about you, Steve, what data sets is your team

192
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,460
primarily working?

193
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,100
So we have quite a I work in the developer space. So I work

194
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,780
with a lot of application development and application

195
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,940
lifecycle kind of data. So we have a lot of streams that

196
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,730
show us like what applications this is for people that send us

197
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,810
data or in the beta program, not the general machines out

198
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,290
there. But we have data that tells us like what applications

199
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,210
were installed or attempted to install and which ones

200
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,610
succeeded or didn't succeed what the application lifecycles

201
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,290
were, was it launched? Did it go into suspend? When was it

202
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,450
killed? Or was it closed down? That kind of stuff. And so we

203
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,490
can see whether or not applications are successful or

204
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,490
not. We also have interesting data, we can watch what API's

205
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,730
various apps call. And so we can use that data to do cool

206
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,210
things like figure out whether or not the build of the

207
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,810
operating system regressed an app. So let's say that maybe

208
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,250
the Facebook app calls this networking API 40 times in the

209
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,050
first minute or whatever. If I can actually watch that over

210
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,530
time and say, Oh, on this day, it dropped down to 20, we

211
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,810
probably just broke that application. What we do wrong,

212
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,330
I don't know yet, we'll go figure it out. But we can

213
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,450
actually see in the data that that application broke on a

214
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,010
given build of Windows because that it behaves very

215
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,970
differently than it used to behave.

216
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,940
That's cool.

217
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,940
Wasn't Windows recently in the news on this data thing?

218
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,420
Isn't it wasn't at Windows, the where we announced or

219
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,940
where it was announced that we are following all of you?

220
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,300
I don't think so. No, there was some news. I don't

221
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,060
actually follow the news. We don't follow everybody. We

222
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,460
certainly don't. We have very strict restrictions on

223
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,500
pride, personally identifiable information and all

224
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,620
kinds of stuff that we do to make sure that we can't

225
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,860
track people. You can also turn it off. And, you know,

226
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,820
that kind of stuff. So if you're in the beta program, we

227
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,980
tend to watch more because it'll check boxes that tend to

228
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,140
be on by default. But a typical person using Windows has

229
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,940
a lot more control over it. And we don't do anything

230
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,540
that we would identify you as anything. So

231
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,940
so you do not have the ability to see what websites

232
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,900
Alan is looking at.

233
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,220
We go out of our way not to be.

234
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,770
Just mostly I shop on Amazon. Just total tangent

235
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,970
because that's part of the show. I was talking to

236
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,760
neighbor my works at Amazon and I said, man, if I

237
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,000
got a discount there, oh, it says we get a discount.

238
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,560
And but it's like, it's not really much they get

239
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,480
like 10 percent up to a thousand dollars.

240
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,390
Yeah. So they get one hundred dollars a year.

241
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,070
Yeah. So basically they get a hundred. It's not much.

242
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,110
And you worked there for two years. So really you

243
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,990
got about two hundred dollars as you.

244
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,710
It's more than that. But it's like a really when

245
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,710
you do the math, he's really excited about it.

246
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,670
The math. I go, wait a minute.

247
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,190
Yeah, it is something like that. I've heard friends

248
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,630
talk about it.

249
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,430
So that's their equivalent of the company store

250
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,950
program.

251
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:10,400
I guess because yeah, I'm I don't like shopping in

252
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,800
stores. So I'll buy clothes in stores. And

253
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,480
obviously I don't buy clothes very often, but

254
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,680
everything else I buy. Eventually they wear out.

255
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,650
Well, you don't have to stop wearing them when

256
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:23,650
they wear out. That is a common misconception.

257
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,850
You can just keep on wearing them. This T-shirt I

258
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,090
bought in 1998. Still little colors falling off.

259
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,730
Windows 95 on it or something.

260
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:34,170
No, I was wearing this when I was working on

261
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:34,970
Windows 95.

262
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,500
And that's the nice thing, right? With with if

263
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,620
he just waits long enough, he'll have his team

264
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,380
feed him new clothes.

265
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,650
Although no one commonly gives out T-shirts or

266
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,210
common, but no one's doing pants.

267
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,170
No, I haven't. I don't know that I've ever

268
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:53,770
gotten pants.

269
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,610
I have me neither. No, I'm I'm kind of upset.

270
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,080
I think I saw a pair of shorts once.

271
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,480
That's an oversight. I don't nothing shirt.

272
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,360
Lots of T-shirts.

273
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,920
Jackets. I just got to meet yet another jacket.

274
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,360
I've got two jackets on this team, a sweatshirt

275
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,960
and a jacket.

276
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,400
So maybe you should propose when your when your

277
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,160
product finally ships, you get a pair of sweat

278
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,800
pants with the product name right on the butt.

279
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,400
Like those pink ones.

280
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
Right. Yeah. Juicy.

281
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,100
That's the name of our product.

282
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,900
They just take things for a leak in our product

283
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,700
game. Microsoft Juicy for business.

284
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,660
Actually, I saw PR for your product recently.

285
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,980
So you guys are announced now.

286
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:33,660
No, we're not.

287
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,340
I didn't see anything.

288
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Nothing. Nothing.

289
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,740
Nothing. I saw something.

290
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,900
There's nothing nothing condoned by our

291
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,660
organization has been released on the interwebs.

292
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,220
Gotcha.

293
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,340
And that's where we're going to keep that one.

294
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,030
So I've done enough things to piss off management.

295
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,590
I'm not going to go there.

296
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,350
So Steve's here.

297
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,430
Yeah. Hey.

298
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,300
So back to Steve.

299
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,180
What are we going to say?

300
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,140
How about now?

301
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,020
Sabre.

302
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,430
Go ahead.

303
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,430
So Steve.

304
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:06,990
Yes, Brad.

305
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,170
Um, I anxiously await your question.

306
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,450
I anxiously wait his question too.

307
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,690
So I've, I've gone through and sort of walk

308
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,370
through how I got to the position I'm in right now.

309
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,160
Uh, a lot of our listeners are, I'll say data

310
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,640
curious, right?

311
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,440
Um, and it's very, very clear that they are

312
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,220
operating in worlds that are behind us in some

313
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,100
degree, very similar to us, uh, 10, 15 years ago.

314
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,980
Or three years ago.

315
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:46,700
How would you, how would you guide from, from your

316
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,940
experience, how would you guide people, uh, making

317
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,740
this transition?

318
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,300
I think it depends on what course you're going

319
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:53,540
to take.

320
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,580
So there's two courses to try to get your team

321
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,580
to be more data driven.

322
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,140
Uh, one is a top down approach and the other one

323
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,460
is kind of a bottoms up approach.

324
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,570
Um, so you can either try to find or convince

325
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,890
management that this is a good thing.

326
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,690
And then management can create the edict that we

327
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,600
will go do this and, uh, then started building up

328
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,040
the organizational skills from there.

329
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,600
Or you can try to make your little section of

330
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,640
the world more data driven and do that in a way

331
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,680
that also gets your other jobs done and try to

332
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
become a center of excellence.

333
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,000
And people might mock, might follow you, uh, over

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,200
time and emulate you.

335
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,520
And those are both possible routes.

336
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,760
Um, I suspect most of our readers, listeners,

337
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,040
whatever, uh, we'll have to be in the second

338
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,000
bucket because probably most of them are not

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,520
directors or, you know, CEOs or whatever, and

340
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,000
they don't get to come down with the, with

341
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,720
the edict, they can try to convince management,

342
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,920
but it's not always easy to convince management

343
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,320
to do anything new and different because it's

344
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,400
scary and dangerous.

345
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,720
Um, and so I think that the pattern is to try

346
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,600
to start at the bottom.

347
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,800
Uh, a lot of times as unfortunate as that is,

348
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,640
I think it's a harder road to go, but it's

349
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,920
also the only road available a lot of times.

350
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,800
Um, and I think the right way to do that is

351
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,870
to figure out where, where you can replace

352
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,870
current functionality with this data or

353
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,030
supplement it with data.

354
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,510
I don't think that you can just say, we're

355
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,350
not going to test anymore.

356
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,150
We're going to use data.

357
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,670
Cause I don't think anybody's going to believe

358
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,550
that that is effective enough in order to

359
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,870
let you spend the time doing that.

360
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,470
They're going to still expect their test passes,

361
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,990
but you can start running data analysis on

362
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,670
the test passes.

363
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,390
You can start running data.

364
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,390
You can try to get some instrumentation into

365
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:19,790
the builds.

366
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,430
A lot of people have at least logs or

367
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:22,790
something along those lines, convince the

368
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,510
devs or go at it yourself, depending on

369
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,830
where you are organizationally and

370
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,910
what's allowed, and then use that to

371
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,430
try to understand, uh, whether, um, your,

372
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,550
the quality is high or not.

373
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,590
I think there's two major uses of

374
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,310
data, um, in an organization.

375
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,630
One use is to understand the health of

376
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,750
the product and the other one is to

377
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,550
understand what I call the success of

378
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,030
the product.

379
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,230
So the first one is to figure out whether

380
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,870
or not what you built is doing what you

381
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,870
expected it to do.

382
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,670
And the other one is figuring out, figure

383
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,510
out whether or not the users are

384
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,830
appreciating what you built.

385
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,350
Um, and I think it's much easier to bootstrap

386
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,070
the first one, the health metrics than

387
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,110
it is the other ones, because it's

388
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,270
more of a drop in replacement for, or

389
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,270
a supplement for traditional testing.

390
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,910
And, uh, I have a couple of blog posts

391
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,150
from way back talking about data

392
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,350
driven quality and kind of moving in

393
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,230
that direction, which focused mostly on

394
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,230
those health metrics.

395
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,990
And so I think one thing you can do is

396
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,510
you can start monitoring the percentage

397
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,950
of time that your test passes fit, pass

398
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,430
or fail.

399
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,030
You can start monitoring data about

400
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:19,150
the machines or the builds or the, the

401
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,630
environments that they're in and try

402
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,150
to tease out data from there.

403
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,710
Um, and then you can over time, maybe

404
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,470
start getting data from real instances

405
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,910
of the application, either through logs

406
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,350
or through some kind of, uh, you

407
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,750
know, data API that you have.

408
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,710
If you're in a server, you can do

409
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,790
it much more easily than if you're,

410
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,270
you're running distributed software.

411
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,870
Um, and then figure out whether or not

412
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,150
I can give you some sense for the

413
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,030
quality of your product, uh, for the,

414
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,150
the health of your product.

415
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,710
And then maybe you can turn down

416
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,950
the dial on testing and turn up the

417
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,590
dial on data.

418
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,830
What about your journey personally?

419
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,690
So how long ago were you in a, a,

420
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,650
let's just say a pure traditional

421
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:56,410
test manager role?

422
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,370
About three years ago.

423
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,290
It was the fall, about three years

424
00:21:59,290 --> 00:21:59,610
ago, right?

425
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,850
When we started the work on, on

426
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,530
windows 10 that I moved from a

427
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,770
traditional test developer job to,

428
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,130
uh, a data science job.

429
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,830
When, when, uh, so windows was

430
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,470
essentially the first of your two

431
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,510
ways to get there.

432
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,590
If I, if I recall correctly, you, in

433
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,790
other words, it wasn't a bunch of

434
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,470
small satellite teams trying to

435
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,110
convince upper management upper

436
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,830
men, as this is my perception from

437
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,990
outside of windows, it was upper

438
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,350
management said, no, we're doing.

439
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,830
It was definitely a, a, a student

440
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,830
body left movement.

441
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,950
Like everybody, uh, has to go this

442
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,270
direction.

443
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,070
We took what was a standard test

444
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,390
developer role and said that role

445
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:37,390
no longer exists.

446
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,110
We now have a quality role, which is

447
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,510
not the same as a data science role,

448
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,470
but this thing we call the quality

449
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,670
role, which is just a label we put

450
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,470
on it, um, was all about using data

451
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,790
to understand the quality of our

452
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,110
product.

453
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,430
So we had in that group, we have

454
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,830
people that are more traditional

455
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,310
developers whose job it is to

456
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,870
instrument the builds and then do

457
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,830
basic analysis on those builds and,

458
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,310
and understand the area very well.

459
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,470
And then we have data scientists

460
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,510
whose job it is to help bring actual

461
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,270
math to the, to the problems, um,

462
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,470
in, in non-basic ways.

463
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,790
Um, I'd like to think of, there's

464
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,990
a Venn diagram that's pretty

465
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:08,950
popular out there that says data

466
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,190
science is kind of a combination

467
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,590
of area knowledge, programming

468
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,590
knowledge, and statistics or

469
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,990
math.

470
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,390
And I tend to think that no one

471
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,110
person really has all of those.

472
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,070
And so we've almost ended up in

473
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,750
a world where the area knowledge

474
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,790
and the programming knowledge are

475
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,190
owned by one group of people.

476
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:22,590
That's the quality teams.

477
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,430
And then the, the data science

478
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,030
knowledge or the, the statistics

479
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,990
knowledge, and then maybe some of

480
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,430
the programming knowledge as well is

481
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:29,910
owned by the data science teams.

482
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,670
And so the combination ends up with

483
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,830
a sweet spot in the middle.

484
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,040
So when, when they pulled this

485
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,320
trigger, were you anxious or

486
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,120
excited about it?

487
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,440
I was personally excited about it.

488
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,520
I'd thought about it for a while.

489
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,760
I'd actually been looking for ways

490
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,400
to try to go do this in my, my old job.

491
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,920
The difficulty that I had as I was

492
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,200
on the team that was developing

493
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,320
what was called Windows runtime,

494
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,600
which is the API model for all

495
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,640
of the, the Windows apps, uh, the

496
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,600
app store apps, the hard part

497
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,560
about that is trying to use

498
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,000
data in something that has a very

499
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,760
long pipeline is super difficult.

500
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,600
You can't exactly A B test an API.

501
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,680
You can't send it out, you know,

502
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,960
one version of the API to it, to

503
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,160
developer a and one version of

504
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,240
developer B and see which one

505
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,840
works better.

506
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,440
You know, you can't really watch

507
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,960
for applications to be submitted to

508
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,760
a store somewhere six months after

509
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,840
you introduce the API and then

510
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,720
start gathering data.

511
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,320
So it was the, one of the more

512
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,840
difficult places to go use data.

513
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,920
And so I hadn't figured out yet

514
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,640
the right way to go use it in

515
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,880
that space until the edict came

516
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,720
down. Um, and then we moved, but

517
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,080
even there we ended up in a world

518
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,080
where although upper management

519
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,200
said, go do this upper management

520
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,320
didn't really know exactly what

521
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:31,960
they wanted to do with it.

522
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,880
Either they knew they wanted to

523
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,160
get there, but they didn't know

524
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,160
they'd never done it before.

525
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,120
And so they didn't know what

526
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,160
parts to appreciate or not

527
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,040
appreciate. And there was a lot

528
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,000
of, of trying and failing and

529
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,440
learning that happened along the

530
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,560
way. And so we had a lot of

531
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,100
we're getting much better, but

532
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,540
we had a lot of, uh, early

533
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,620
pressure from the top to go do

534
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,180
this. And then various teams

535
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,260
tried different things. And so

536
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,020
you ended up with kind of

537
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,020
this hybrid model where there

538
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,820
was a lot of local, uh, idea

539
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,660
development and talent

540
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,580
development and, and ways to

541
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,940
use stuff that was developed and

542
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,700
then kind of pushed out to

543
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,500
other people as centers of

544
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,940
excellence.

545
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,660
So it was a couple of things on

546
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,700
you, uh, touch on that you

547
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,340
talked about one was, uh, going

548
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,700
way back the, um, this is why I

549
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,870
edit. You were talking about,

550
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,790
uh, you can either have an edict

551
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,150
from top or sort of, you know,

552
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,230
grassroots and, you know, try

553
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,990
stuff and do it gradually. Uh,

554
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,830
generally that latter approach

555
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,230
in my experience sticks more. If

556
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,950
it's harder to do driving from

557
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,550
the bottom up, but it, in my

558
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,430
experience in any sort of

559
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,390
organizational changes sort of

560
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,670
sticks more, um, edicts are

561
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,430
interesting and they can often

562
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,480
work. They're often difficult to

563
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,360
get, you know, all the time I

564
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,920
see people, they go to a VP or

565
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,240
somebody high up and go, you

566
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,400
should demand that the whole

567
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,520
org does this. And they rarely

568
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,960
ever do that because they,

569
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,840
it's not always a good thing to

570
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,420
make an edict. Uh, but one

571
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,380
thing was interesting, glad you

572
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:52,940
touched on it with the

573
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,140
windows one is, is they said

574
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,970
we're making this change and

575
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,050
the, how does it happen and

576
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:05,130
what does it mean was all left

577
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,090
in the air. So was why, no, no,

578
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,130
why was there? Why was not

579
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,650
partially there. I'll go more

580
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,570
than what or how. So there was

581
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,450
this and either it was, and

582
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,730
Steve and I may be on two sides

583
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,970
of this, but it may be either

584
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,730
genius or idiocy of this. Just

585
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,210
let a thousand flowers bloom.

586
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,890
And the end of worked out.

587
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,850
All right. Regardless of the

588
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,930
how it got there, let a

589
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,210
thousand flowers bloom and the

590
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:31,960
strong flowers will guide the

591
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,520
way for the slash and burn all

592
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,760
the white ones, keep the red

593
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,160
ones. Is that you describe it

594
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,320
like we were sitting on a hill

595
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,440
and we, they showed us this

596
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,720
picture across the valley of

597
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,800
another city on another hill.

598
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,480
And he said, we want to get

599
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,560
there. And you have this

600
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
valley laid out in front of

601
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,360
you covered with clouds, you

602
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,840
know, and fog. And they said,

603
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,760
go over to that other hill.

604
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,280
And you're like, well, what

605
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,320
do I need? Do I need like a

606
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,360
camel? Do I need a parka? Do

607
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,600
I need a boat? Like, how am

608
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,320
I getting there? Like, we

609
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,960
don't know, just go, you

610
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,000
know. And so we all tried. And

611
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,680
those of us that chose

612
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,680
camels, you know, ended up

613
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,800
poor in the, in the, you

614
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,040
know, middle of the Arctic or

615
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,570
and you get halfway there. And

616
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,410
some people say, let's turn

617
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,530
back. This isn't working.

618
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,530
We're not all the way to the

619
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,610
city yet. Let's turn back. And

620
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,610
so we had those people that

621
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,890
said, let's go back to the

622
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,890
traditional ways of doing

623
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,170
things. I miss this part

624
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,530
that I had before. And then

625
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,930
some of us pushed on and

626
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,690
we're still in the process.

627
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,290
We haven't gotten all the

628
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,130
way to the city. Maybe a

629
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:17,890
few. I think that's true

630
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,090
across a lot of Microsoft.

631
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,050
I think a lot of people

632
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,010
have made it to the city.

633
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,610
There are a ton of people

634
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,410
who just want to go back

635
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,330
to their old comfortable

636
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,710
city that that comfortable

637
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,190
city that's it's now been

638
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,230
raised to the ground.

639
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,670
No, it's full. It's full

640
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:32,510
of great 90s grunge music

641
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,270
and other things from the

642
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,660
90s, many other things from

643
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,260
the 90s.

644
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,820
Yes. The problem is that

645
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,740
people don't realize that

646
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,820
the old way was just not

647
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,540
fast enough. You're

648
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,740
guaranteed to be beaten by

649
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,780
your competition. That's

650
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,660
what I was saying. All the

651
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,220
old ways. That's what I

652
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,740
was saying when when this

653
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,850
first rolled out, like, I

654
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,010
think we were still doing

655
00:27:51,050 --> 00:27:52,570
a we we were doing the

656
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,530
podcast then one of the

657
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,410
biggest things that both

658
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:57,650
Alan and I discovered during

659
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,090
those phases, explaining to

660
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,810
people why from a business

661
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,290
context, because the

662
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,050
number one question we got,

663
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,130
at least I got from from

664
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,330
individuals in the

665
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,290
Windows org was no one's

666
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,370
explaining why the old

667
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,650
system is broken today.

668
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,630
Right. It's kind of a

669
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,870
precursor towards these

670
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,880
folks who if if they're

671
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,920
forced to journey are

672
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,360
likely to want to go

673
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,880
back.

674
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,760
Right. I think that

675
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,800
they're there. We could

676
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,520
have been better about

677
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,640
that. If you go back,

678
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,360
there's some blog posts I

679
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,200
have on kind of the

680
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,040
development of tests or the

681
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,000
evolution of testing and

682
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,200
we kind of walk through. I

683
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,920
think the important thing

684
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
to recognize is that the

685
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,600
people who have made it

686
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,960
to data science, you know,

687
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,200
Island or Hill or

688
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,280
whatever, sometimes look

689
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,280
back and go, we were all

690
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,240
idiots. That was a terrible

691
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:43,960
way to do things. It was

692
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,240
never a good way. You

693
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,840
know, and I think that's

694
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,680
wrong. I think there was

695
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,440
certainly a point in

696
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,920
time and certain

697
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,230
requirements in the in

698
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,550
the environment and around

699
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,870
the ecosystem that made

700
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,670
that the right way to go

701
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,710
do things and still to

702
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,510
this day makes it the

703
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,470
right way way to do

704
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,830
certain kinds of work. I

705
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,430
think you can't say

706
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:01,870
that data science and

707
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,870
data driven quality is the

708
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,350
only possible way to

709
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,350
handle quality and it's

710
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,270
probably not the end way

711
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,030
that will handle quality.

712
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,630
There are probably other

713
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:09,070
ways that will be

714
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,030
invented later that will

715
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,510
replace those a lot of it.

716
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,710
But to say that manual

717
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,750
testing was always a bad

718
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,110
idea or that S-net work

719
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,230
was always a bad idea is

720
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,270
to ignore what was

721
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,510
actually happening in the

722
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,350
industry at the time. And

723
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,830
I think those were

724
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,830
actually very good

725
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,830
things to happen at

726
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,270
points in time when you

727
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,310
had certain requirements

728
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,950
from the ecosystem. If

729
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:27,590
you don't have the

730
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,190
ability to quickly push

731
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,390
new software out, if you

732
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,470
have to get it into a box

733
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,190
and get it onto somebody's

734
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,870
desk, you can't use the

735
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,630
data driven world that

736
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,190
we have. If you're not

737
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,150
connected, you can't use a

738
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,430
data driven system. And

739
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,150
so there was a point in

740
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,190
time when that was exactly

741
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,510
the right solution. We've

742
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,390
just moved past that

743
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,510
time. Right. I think I

744
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:47,050
totally agree. And one bit

745
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,010
of advice for pretty much

746
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,370
anything you're doing is

747
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,650
look for efficiency and

748
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:52,810
don't fall into that.

749
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,850
That's the way we've

750
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,650
always done it. Trap. And

751
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,290
don't fall into that.

752
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,050
That's the new way to

753
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,890
do a trap either.

754
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,850
Sometimes it's the new

755
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,970
shiny way. And so

756
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:00,890
everything has to be

757
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,530
rewritten or redone to be

758
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,370
the new shiny way. And

759
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,410
it doesn't always apply to

760
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,170
every part of every

761
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,010
industry, right? If

762
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,570
you're working on

763
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,890
healthcare equipment, I'm

764
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:09,090
not sure that data driven

765
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:09,970
stuff is the best way to

766
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,890
go. Like, oh, we killed

767
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,490
three people. We should

768
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,610
probably change that. It

769
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,570
depends on the area of

770
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,690
health, right? If it's

771
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,610
in some areas, yeah, but

772
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,050
there may be some, uh,

773
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,330
I'm trying to think while

774
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,250
I talk here, but, uh,

775
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:23,930
some more preventative

776
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,610
things. Maybe there's a

777
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,810
better way to measure your

778
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:26,850
blood pressure. I always

779
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:27,530
see every time I go to

780
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,170
the doctor, they have

781
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,290
like some better device

782
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,330
measure my blood pressure

783
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,290
and, and they have like

784
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,730
scales that are networked.

785
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,130
And there's a lot of, there

786
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,450
is room for, I think even

787
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,570
in healthcare to have more

788
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:40,810
data science and to learn

789
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:41,970
how doctors are using

790
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:42,890
things and to make tweaks

791
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,530
in the equipment. Yeah,

792
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,010
you got to figure out

793
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,650
where the places are. I

794
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,290
think it's always a

795
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:48,290
question of, of how long

796
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:49,050
the damage is going to be

797
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,050
sustained and how big the

798
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,210
damage is. Right. And

799
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:51,850
that's how you figure

800
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,730
out whether you need,

801
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,410
whether you need to

802
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,490
scale things. And so if I,

803
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,810
if I, the advantage of

804
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,010
using data is that I can

805
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:57,690
release something into

806
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,650
the wild for a little

807
00:30:58,650 --> 00:30:59,770
while, and I can quickly

808
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,890
fix it, which means that

809
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:01,930
the data is the damage

810
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,570
that is doing, if it's

811
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,610
wrong, isn't sustained

812
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:04,930
very long in the old

813
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,450
world, it had to be

814
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:06,370
sustained for months or

815
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,250
years because of the

816
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,250
release cycles. Now you

817
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,050
can have it out there for

818
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,410
a day or half a day and

819
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,610
fix it, which is all

820
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,770
awesome until you have

821
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,370
an infinite cost, right?

822
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,770
If, if one second of

823
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,570
damage or one split

824
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,690
second of damage, it

825
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,810
causes a death or causes

826
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,690
major harm and you

827
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:20,490
can't afford to let that

828
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,090
go. And you have to

829
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:21,850
fix it before you

830
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,130
possibly, or even

831
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:23,970
worse breaks the

832
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,370
Facebook app. Yes. Yeah.

833
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,010
That's, that's

834
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:27,810
unconscionable. We are

835
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,210
definitely, we are

836
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,250
definitely in a world

837
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:33,610
where we have a lot more

838
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,770
options than we did

839
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:36,730
back in the day. I do,

840
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,770
to your point, like there

841
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,290
is a lot of revisionism

842
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:43,690
in a lot of the people

843
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,210
that I talked to, right?

844
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,770
It's easy to predict the

845
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,050
future in hindsight.

846
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:48,730
Yeah. Especially to

847
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,500
create it. Right. The

848
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,960
lot of the world and

849
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,720
back in those days, a

850
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,440
lot of the world and in

851
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,480
a lot of our listeners, I

852
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,120
think I still are still in

853
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,560
what we refer to as the

854
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,360
old days. Yeah, I think

855
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,160
they are. They're, they're

856
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,800
missing knowledge. They're

857
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,760
missing assets that we've

858
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,160
built up over, over the

859
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,310
years. Um, the, the

860
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,790
positive thing though,

861
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,650
is in today's world,

862
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:22,850
there's a lot of other

863
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,890
examples to learn from.

864
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,650
You don't have to treat

865
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,890
it as theoretical. I know

866
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:31,130
back in the windows 95

867
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:32,970
days, if I had brought up

868
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:34,570
anything along the lines

869
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:37,170
of what I do today, they

870
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:38,330
would look at me like I

871
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,690
had three heads. Right. And

872
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,510
it's just because the

873
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,150
ideas of this type of

874
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,150
work that we do and the

875
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:50,030
benefits of it were sort

876
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,310
of academic theoretical at

877
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,270
that point in time.

878
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:53,830
Well, at that point,

879
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,190
that would have been

880
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,150
impossible to carry out.

881
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,870
But even if assuming it

882
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,550
was possible, you're

883
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,470
right. They would have

884
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,230
looked at you like, this

885
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,990
doesn't make any sense

886
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,630
because they were just

887
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,710
moving to a large test

888
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,150
organization at that

889
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,830
point in time. Like that

890
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,190
was kind of when a lot of

891
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:04,990
the independent test

892
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:05,750
organizations are starting

893
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,190
to spin up. Um, I think

894
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,870
around that time, maybe

895
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,110
today, just been up not

896
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,110
too long before that.

897
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,760
Now back to your personal

898
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:15,390
journey. So you've been,

899
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,230
you've been doing this

900
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,270
for three years.

901
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:17,630
Correct.

902
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,390
What did you do to

903
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,870
prepare yourself to be

904
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,470
the head of a, of a

905
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,230
data science that

906
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,270
engineering team, did you

907
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,150
have that skillset

908
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,630
beforehand?

909
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,790
No, I didn't at all. I,

910
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,590
in fact, I've never even

911
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,470
taken a statistics course

912
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,470
when I was in college. So

913
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,230
I was uniquely on

914
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,630
skilled in this particular,

915
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,550
in this particular thing.

916
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,670
So what I did is what I

917
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,630
always do. And I started

918
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,750
reading, I started

919
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,910
reading blogs, I started

920
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,110
reading books, I started

921
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,470
reading papers. Um, and

922
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,950
then around that time,

923
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,510
all the, the MOOCs, the

924
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,470
Massly online open

925
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,790
courses, like Coursera and

926
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,230
edX, et cetera, uh,

927
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,270
started existing. And so

928
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:50,870
I took a lot of the

929
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,430
courses. There's a whole

930
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,030
series of, of almost

931
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,910
collegiate level courses

932
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,750
that you can take for,

933
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,950
for free or almost for

934
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,430
free. Um, and so I went

935
00:33:58,430 --> 00:33:59,470
through a lot of those,

936
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,230
um, over time, I had to

937
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,230
learn a lot of the

938
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:02,990
techniques that I had to

939
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:03,710
go learn. So you have to

940
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,630
kind of become rigorous

941
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:05,150
and go back to

942
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,430
fundamentals and learn

943
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,190
the basics so you can

944
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,430
figure out what to apply.

945
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,830
Um, and then you have to

946
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,910
read, you have to figure

947
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:11,550
out where it applies and

948
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,110
where it doesn't apply.

949
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,670
But a lot of it, you

950
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,430
have to understand enough

951
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,150
techniques in order to

952
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:14,910
go back and be able to

953
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:15,550
figure out which ones to

954
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,310
apply and not apply.

955
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,430
Is there one thing if

956
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,390
you were to say, if you

957
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:21,830
only do one to start

958
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,950
from your experience,

959
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,390
what is the one concrete

960
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:25,510
thing you would suggest?

961
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,630
If you're trying to,

962
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,270
is there a data scientist?

963
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,070
Right. Yeah. So there's

964
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:30,750
there's a series of

965
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,790
MOOCs, about nine, eight

966
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,590
or nine of them, depending

967
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,390
on the take the caps in

968
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:35,190
from, uh, Johns Hopkins

969
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,630
University, um, which is

970
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,750
called, I think like data

971
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,110
science or whatever. Um,

972
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,150
it's on Coursera and

973
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:40,870
there's a series of,

974
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,710
of they're offered every

975
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,710
month or one per month.

976
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,350
And I would suggest going

977
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:43,830
through that set of

978
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,750
courses. It's a very good

979
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,990
set of courses. Most of

980
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:46,630
them aren't too hard.

981
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,310
There's a few of them

982
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:48,150
that are quite rigorous.

983
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:49,390
Um, but when you get

984
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:49,990
to the end of it, you'll

985
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,110
have a very good sense

986
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:51,710
for things. You won't

987
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,190
be a PhD by any stretch

988
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,270
of the imagination, but

989
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:54,950
you will have a very

990
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:55,910
strong sense of things.

991
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,710
And how often have you

992
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,790
been finding yourself

993
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,110
using what you've

994
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,510
learned in your job?

995
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,390
Daily, probably. Right.

996
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,510
So my job today is as

997
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,550
a manager. So I don't do

998
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,190
a lot of the direct, uh,

999
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,590
data analysis, but I

1000
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,510
overview a lot of with

1001
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,270
the data analysis. And

1002
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,390
so I will oftentimes meet

1003
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:11,910
with my teams and

1004
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,310
they'll say, we're going

1005
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,030
to go report this. And

1006
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,030
I'm like, well, what

1007
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,870
about that? You've

1008
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:15,710
missed this corner over

1009
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:16,630
here. Maybe you should

1010
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,750
use this technique. And

1011
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,510
so those all become

1012
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,550
useful to ask questions

1013
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,870
to make suggestions, um,

1014
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:22,670
and to understand what

1015
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,430
is possible and what's

1016
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,550
not a lot of data science

1017
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,030
can feel like magic and

1018
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,870
but it can't do

1019
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,790
everything. And so you

1020
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:29,470
have to understand where

1021
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,430
the constraints are in

1022
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:30,950
order to be able to

1023
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,910
figure out what to tell

1024
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:32,950
your teams to go do or

1025
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,430
to try to go do. Um,

1026
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,070
one of the things I

1027
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:35,750
think is important is

1028
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:36,430
to realize that you

1029
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,350
also need to be

1030
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,590
willing to make mistakes

1031
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:39,430
and willing to fail. And

1032
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,030
so there's definitely

1033
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,470
times when I have sent

1034
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,350
my team off to go do

1035
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,390
something and it turned

1036
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,190
out it wasn't possible

1037
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,110
to do like we went and

1038
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,950
tried really hard and

1039
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,870
then realized, you

1040
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,910
know, PhDs in the

1041
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,790
corners of universities

1042
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:49,430
haven't yet figured

1043
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,030
out how to go do this

1044
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,430
thing. So it's

1045
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,550
probably not possible.

1046
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,630
And then it's your

1047
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,310
reaction to that.

1048
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:53,950
That's important. You

1049
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,630
have to go like, okay,

1050
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,990
cool. Now we know and

1051
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,590
we'll go down a different

1052
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,750
path. No way they

1053
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,390
can't figure out you

1054
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,310
fire them all. Get some

1055
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,230
smarter people in the

1056
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,790
room. That is sometimes

1057
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,990
the management strategy.

1058
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:03,590
That's not the one

1059
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,470
that I recommend. Um,

1060
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:06,550
just just throwing

1061
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,670
spitballs. I think

1062
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,470
we're very much in a

1063
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,870
world. Uh, one thing

1064
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,430
that I've noticed is

1065
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,990
the world of, of test

1066
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,150
development and to some

1067
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,750
extent, the world of

1068
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,750
development is a much

1069
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,390
more constrained world,

1070
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,430
meaning you generally

1071
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,270
don't send people to go

1072
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:18,910
do something that you

1073
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:19,910
don't know is possible

1074
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,110
to go do. It does

1075
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,990
happen. Um, and you

1076
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:23,670
can go read like show

1077
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,350
stopper about the

1078
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,270
building of NT and there

1079
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:25,870
were people that were

1080
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,950
sent off to go build a

1081
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,830
graphic system that they

1082
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:28,470
didn't even know was

1083
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,430
possible. And they went

1084
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,030
off and I think lived on

1085
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,790
a boat for like three

1086
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,830
months and came back

1087
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,390
with a, with, with GDI

1088
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,670
or whatever, uh, out of

1089
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,350
the system. But, um,

1090
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,870
that's rare. Most of

1091
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:38,350
the time you're sent

1092
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:38,830
to go do something

1093
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,510
that everybody knows

1094
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,230
is doable. It's just a

1095
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,550
question of how long it

1096
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,390
takes. When you're in

1097
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,990
the world of data

1098
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,870
science, you don't know

1099
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,310
if there's enough

1100
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:45,750
signal among all the

1101
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,350
noise in order to be

1102
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:47,390
able to generate what

1103
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:47,910
you need. You

1104
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,710
sometimes will go,

1105
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:49,430
we'll get something and

1106
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:50,630
realize all I can tell

1107
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,350
you is there's no

1108
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,020
conclusive answer and

1109
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,980
that has to be okay.

1110
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,020
There's another

1111
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,220
tangent. This is my job

1112
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,060
to make tangents today

1113
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,180
cause I don't know

1114
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,100
nothing about no data

1115
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,210
science. I know a little

1116
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,250
just enough to freak

1117
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,290
Brent out, but for the

1118
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,490
younger of the three

1119
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,090
listeners, there's only

1120
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:08,890
one left of two are

1121
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,010
here. Um, one thing I

1122
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:11,810
wanted to call out, it

1123
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,450
wasn't just that the

1124
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:13,290
guys went off and

1125
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,770
built GDI, but it, you

1126
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:16,970
know, in seclusion, but

1127
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,810
imagine if you will

1128
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,490
building complex

1129
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,690
software without the

1130
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,980
internet. Yeah. Without

1131
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,820
stack overflow, without

1132
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,740
Google or Bing, you can't

1133
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,500
just ask somebody how to

1134
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,840
go do it. Uh, what an

1135
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,320
archaic world. My job

1136
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,480
today, trees that will

1137
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,360
give you a hint. Yeah.

1138
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,560
My job today would,

1139
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,680
would have been so much

1140
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,280
harder to get to. And,

1141
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:46,670
um, I'll double quote

1142
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:48,270
master without the

1143
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,030
internet for sure. One

1144
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:50,710
thing. And yeah,

1145
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,990
everything is faster. Uh,

1146
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,070
the reason that we're

1147
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:55,870
data science as a role

1148
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,670
is cause we're moving so

1149
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,430
much faster, both for

1150
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,550
necessity and for, and

1151
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,750
because, uh, possibility.

1152
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,230
One of the great moves

1153
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,070
about moving to a lot more

1154
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,150
open source at Microsoft

1155
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,150
using things like Git

1156
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,750
for source control is

1157
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,590
all of a sudden, uh, we

1158
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,030
used to have like

1159
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,870
horrible internal

1160
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,830
documentation for our

1161
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,670
internal tools, if

1162
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,390
they were documented at

1163
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,230
all. But now that we're

1164
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,190
using a lot more stuff,

1165
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,910
open source answers are

1166
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:17,150
on stack overflow answers

1167
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,150
are documented in blog

1168
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,870
posts. It's, it's, it's

1169
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,350
been, it's accelerated.

1170
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,310
At least one fantastic

1171
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,310
thing our team does, I

1172
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,030
pick on our lack of

1173
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,390
data science, but, uh,

1174
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:27,190
we have a very good

1175
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,110
modern engineering

1176
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,310
system. It's all builds

1177
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,270
in Azure. I find them

1178
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,990
red. Woo hoo. Use a

1179
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,310
lot of VSTS get first

1180
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,670
source control, uh, the

1181
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,630
whole crap ton of open

1182
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,830
source and enables us

1183
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,630
to move pretty fast

1184
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,550
despite ourselves.

1185
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,460
Yeah. It's, it's

1186
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,100
interesting to leverage

1187
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,620
the new world, but

1188
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,820
it's also changed the

1189
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,660
way that people learn.

1190
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,460
It used to be, you went

1191
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,420
and you got a book and

1192
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,500
you read and you got,

1193
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,100
and that kind of

1194
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,020
forced you to get an

1195
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:51,940
overview of the whole

1196
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,860
area and kind of get

1197
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:53,700
deep and realize how

1198
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,100
the pieces are

1199
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,260
connected. And now you

1200
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,900
almost have, um, a

1201
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,580
paging system where you

1202
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,820
don't even have the data

1203
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,660
until you need it. And

1204
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,300
then you go to stack

1205
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,500
overflow or you go to a

1206
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,260
search engine and you

1207
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,340
find it. And so you

1208
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,340
kind of piecemeal build

1209
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,900
this thing up in your

1210
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:07,500
head, but you don't

1211
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,220
understand the big

1212
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,300
picture sometimes

1213
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,540
almost ever. You just

1214
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,140
learn the pieces you

1215
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,780
absolutely need to

1216
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,660
learn. And then you

1217
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,540
move on and that's

1218
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,180
good and bad.

1219
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,540
Yeah, I agree too. I

1220
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,700
call it just in time

1221
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,380
learning the, actually

1222
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,580
to that point. So you've

1223
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,660
been here at least 15

1224
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,180
years, right?

1225
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,160
About 19. Okay. So

1226
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:26,880
almost catching up with

1227
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,240
you guys.

1228
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,030
The, the, the situation

1229
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:34,790
you went through three

1230
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,910
years ago, where you

1231
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,310
were, um, told to go

1232
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,270
into this space, which

1233
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,030
was fine. Cause that's

1234
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,670
where you wanted to go

1235
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,250
anyway. If that had

1236
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,130
happened 15 years ago,

1237
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:46,450
what do you think would

1238
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,090
have happened to you?

1239
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,310
It would have been

1240
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:49,950
different, right? It

1241
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:50,750
would have been, you

1242
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,870
know, go find books and

1243
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,790
read a lot of books

1244
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,550
and then, and then

1245
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,470
figure out how to go

1246
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,590
do it from there. Um,

1247
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:57,350
which is a lot harder.

1248
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,350
The hardest part

1249
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,430
actually would 15 years

1250
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,470
ago is there's no

1251
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,910
tooling. So 15 years

1252
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,470
ago, everything was

1253
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,310
proprietary tooling.

1254
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,350
Everything costs money

1255
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:05,030
or the company had to

1256
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,350
go build it. And so

1257
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,510
today I can just go and

1258
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,590
I can get our, or I can

1259
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,630
get Python and I can

1260
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,830
have basically every

1261
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,430
data tool I want at my

1262
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:13,670
fingertips and a bunch

1263
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:14,310
of documentation on how

1264
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:14,790
to go use it.

1265
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,110
And examples everywhere.

1266
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,270
And examples everywhere.

1267
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,190
Back then you

1268
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,750
probably would have to

1269
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,670
go get a book that told

1270
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,670
you here's how

1271
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,590
logistic regression is

1272
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,870
implemented in math and

1273
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:23,270
you would have had to

1274
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,990
turn that into an

1275
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,270
algorithm and write your

1276
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:26,110
own logistic regression

1277
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,430
routine.

1278
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:29,510
I, as, as our listeners

1279
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,470
know, I've gone back

1280
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,970
to school on this. Um, I

1281
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,130
don't, if, if this had

1282
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,490
happened to me 15 years

1283
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,420
ago, I don't think I'd

1284
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,690
be in this role. Right.

1285
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,680
Cause it, it's, um, it

1286
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
would have been a lot

1287
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,000
harder to, to quickly,

1288
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,680
first and foremost, online

1289
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,000
academia didn't exist.

1290
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,380
Right. Um, so I would

1291
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,820
have had to gone to U-Dub

1292
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:01,980
or some other, um, travel

1293
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,940
situation, which would

1294
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,620
made my life a lot harder.

1295
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,660
Uh, so much so I may not

1296
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,300
have done it.

1297
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,380
Yeah. I mean, you kind

1298
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,580
of had to, I actually

1299
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,620
had to some extent that

1300
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,060
I was strangely enough,

1301
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,620
I was, uh, in law school

1302
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,100
when I started at

1303
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,580
Microsoft. Um, and it

1304
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,300
didn't have much in the

1305
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,100
programming background.

1306
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,020
So I went to U-Dub's

1307
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,140
website that existed, but

1308
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:22,700
didn't have much

1309
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,740
resources on it. And I,

1310
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,580
I figured out what books

1311
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,020
you read for a, uh, CS

1312
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,940
degree. And I read those

1313
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,540
books. Um, I went to, you

1314
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,780
know, the local borders

1315
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,700
and I bought them and

1316
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
then I read those books.

1317
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,780
So I have like half of

1318
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,860
a CS degree cause I

1319
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,300
didn't do any of the

1320
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,340
homework. C plus plus

1321
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,620
programming in 21 days.

1322
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,380
Probably not.

1323
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,580
Not so much that. Yeah.

1324
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,380
This was Hennessy and

1325
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,220
Patterson and a bunch of

1326
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,380
those books. So I was

1327
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,260
talking with one of my

1328
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,460
children the other day.

1329
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,520
Um, actually they were

1330
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,720
listening to a podcast

1331
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,440
and they were talking

1332
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,480
about you are so cruel

1333
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,960
to your kids. And I'm

1334
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,280
leaving that statement in

1335
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,000
the podcast.

1336
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,160
They think it's cool.

1337
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,520
They think Allen's cool.

1338
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,080
Yeah.

1339
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
So that you drug them

1340
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,320
too. That's awesome,

1341
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,600
Brent. Nice fathering.

1342
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,680
And they were surprised

1343
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,720
cause there was

1344
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,680
something you brought up.

1345
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,240
I think it was your

1346
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,240
music major. And they

1347
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,040
were like, Allen's a

1348
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,480
music major. I'm like,

1349
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,960
oh yeah. I mean, there

1350
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,810
are, um, I don't know

1351
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:17,770
what the stats are, but

1352
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:19,290
there are just a ton of

1353
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,170
people here that didn't

1354
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,520
grow up through the

1355
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,600
prescribed and defined

1356
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,840
academic route.

1357
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,560
Yeah, there's a good

1358
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,960
fraction of us that are

1359
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,080
that way. It's still a

1360
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,280
much harder route to go

1361
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,400
through than going

1362
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,160
through a computer

1363
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,360
science degree, kind of

1364
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,240
traditional route to

1365
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,560
get here. Um, both

1366
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,800
organizationally, like

1367
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,280
it's hard to get

1368
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,000
through the gauntlets. If

1369
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,600
you don't have the right

1370
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,040
degrees, um, and it's

1371
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,640
hard to get the right

1372
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,080
level of knowledge. Self

1373
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:46,880
taught people tend to

1374
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,760
have big gaps in their

1375
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,720
knowledge a lot of

1376
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,640
times. And so it's much

1377
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,640
easier to have a better

1378
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,360
sense of how everything

1379
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,760
works together. Um, if

1380
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,800
you, if you're forced to

1381
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,520
learn all the pieces in

1382
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,760
between, um, that usually

1383
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,320
means you don't know the,

1384
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,360
the details of any given

1385
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,200
piece as much, but you

1386
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,640
know how they work

1387
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:00,960
together.

1388
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,000
The self taught people

1389
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,540
today, um, the way I've

1390
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,100
seen, I don't see a whole

1391
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,300
lot of self taught people

1392
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,900
today in the resumes

1393
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,940
that I look at, but the

1394
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,300
ones that I do see have

1395
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,700
been, have a, a large

1396
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,180
number of examples of

1397
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:19,980
things that they've

1398
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,140
shipped and applied.

1399
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,180
This goes back to what

1400
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,260
Steve was talking about

1401
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,660
earlier. I think the way

1402
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,980
Steve and I self taught

1403
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,500
ourselves gave us those

1404
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,260
overviews that are missing

1405
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,060
with the way people are

1406
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,060
self taught today, which

1407
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,020
is the just in time

1408
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:32,780
learning of just a little

1409
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,260
chunk here and there. So

1410
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:35,460
I think it's more

1411
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,940
difficult if you're

1412
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,740
learning that way,

1413
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,540
cause you really do need

1414
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,340
that overview cause

1415
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,340
systems thinking, whether

1416
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,060
it's data science or

1417
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,980
testing is so important.

1418
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,140
I think Joel Spolsky

1419
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,580
used to talk about, uh,

1420
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:47,940
he's created stack overflow.

1421
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:48,420
One of the guys who

1422
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,260
created stack overflow.

1423
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,220
Um, and he's talked

1424
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,180
about abstractions and

1425
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,060
how abstraction layers are

1426
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,500
useful, but they

1427
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,300
always leak and you have

1428
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,020
to understand the level

1429
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,220
below that abstraction

1430
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:55,820
layer. And I think the

1431
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,140
problem with a lot of

1432
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,980
today's learning models

1433
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,700
is you only learn the

1434
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,220
top level of the

1435
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,140
abstraction and you

1436
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:00,700
don't learn anything

1437
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,020
down below, you know,

1438
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,060
and that, that shows,

1439
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,140
I've seen people in

1440
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:04,900
interviews that will

1441
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:05,980
do things like they need

1442
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:06,700
to concatenate two

1443
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,460
numbers together. So

1444
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,060
they will turn them into

1445
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,620
strings, add the strings

1446
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:10,420
together and then turn

1447
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,340
them back into numbers.

1448
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,540
I'm like, yeah, that

1449
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,580
works. But what, how much

1450
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,420
work just happened in

1451
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,500
the system in order to

1452
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,740
make that simple thing

1453
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,220
happen, you could

1454
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,100
have multiplied by 10

1455
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,820
and you know, added. And

1456
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,020
instead you, you know,

1457
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:21,740
did a whole bunch of

1458
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:22,780
parsing and conversion

1459
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:23,780
and then re parsing.

1460
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,060
Yeah. But you told me to

1461
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,180
concatenate so I

1462
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,380
concatenated. So

1463
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,660
technically it got the

1464
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,540
job done, but not in a

1465
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,540
way that was, I'll

1466
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,180
save the long

1467
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,180
explanation so they can

1468
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,140
get onto the bag. But

1469
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,220
I'll just say this for

1470
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:38,900
the first time in my

1471
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,740
career, I'm working on

1472
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,300
a team full of

1473
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,420
JavaScript programmers.

1474
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,040
They're a different

1475
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,280
breed. Yeah, they are.

1476
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,240
It's a trip that

1477
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,960
they're at an

1478
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:47,880
abstraction level way

1479
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,640
higher than I've ever

1480
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,340
worked with. Hey, it is

1481
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,940
time. And I've never

1482
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,500
done this in front of

1483
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,340
anyone but Brent before.

1484
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:01,880
Mail bag.

1485
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:02,640
I always wondered if

1486
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:03,440
you did that live or if

1487
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,400
that was just in post.

1488
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,220
Apparently it's live.

1489
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,980
Live and a little

1490
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,620
reverb later.

1491
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,020
It'd be good.

1492
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,980
Yeah. It's really hard

1493
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,020
for him to get the

1494
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,780
the reverb across.

1495
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,500
He's he's been

1496
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,340
working on this for a

1497
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,220
long time. Yeah.

1498
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,140
All right. So we

1499
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:17,780
have two mail bag

1500
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,100
questions. We'll see if

1501
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,740
we can get both of

1502
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:20,940
them. I'll go in order.

1503
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,140
And Brent wrote down

1504
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:22,780
the names for me

1505
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,700
because I always get

1506
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:26,660
them wrong. So Abraham

1507
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,420
Lincoln said,

1508
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:28,820
no,

1509
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,980
or score.

1510
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:32,780
And I memorized that

1511
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,200
in seventh grade,

1512
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,840
I think, and still have

1513
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,600
like the first two or

1514
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,480
three lines memorized,

1515
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,000
but I won't do them

1516
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:41,640
today.

1517
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,840
Percy asks, where or how

1518
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,840
do we start with this

1519
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,960
data democratization thing?

1520
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,720
That's the word Brent

1521
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,480
made up last time.

1522
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,040
That's apparently

1523
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:50,760
people had heard of.

1524
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,800
My company has BI

1525
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,000
data and analytics group,

1526
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,120
but it seems that only

1527
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,280
senior management are

1528
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,560
the ones getting insight

1529
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,480
from what information

1530
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,420
they provide. So how

1531
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,020
do you start?

1532
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,300
I'll just bring it to

1533
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,060
your word. How do you

1534
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:05,820
start with this data

1535
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,540
democratization?

1536
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,660
Well, you sweet.

1537
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,780
I am retroactively

1538
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:13,940
be going down as record

1539
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:14,620
as the guy who

1540
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,380
invented data democratization.

1541
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,500
That's fantastic.

1542
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,180
It's one of those time

1543
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,060
travel movies where you

1544
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:20,580
invented it in the

1545
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,260
future and then brought

1546
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:21,980
it to the past.

1547
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:22,460
Right.

1548
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,780
Just second, my mind

1549
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:25,500
settle after that.

1550
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:27,050
Okay, go on.

1551
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,620
So Percy has a

1552
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,820
situation where they

1553
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,740
have a data science BI

1554
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,700
team that essentially

1555
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,500
services the executives

1556
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,500
and he wants to know how

1557
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,900
does he get into data

1558
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,820
democratization?

1559
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,000
Well, so the

1560
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,320
data democratization

1561
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,440
means you publish your

1562
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,160
data, you make your

1563
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,000
data available.

1564
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,840
I think he wants to

1565
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,160
be a consumer of it.

1566
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,720
So what he needs to

1567
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,400
do is start off with

1568
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,200
what actions does he

1569
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,720
want to improve the

1570
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,320
productivity or efficiency?

1571
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,280
He is a manager.

1572
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,320
What actions does he

1573
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,100
want to take to improve

1574
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,700
the productivity efficiency

1575
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:10,780
of either his team or

1576
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,780
his product?

1577
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:13,460
So you start off with

1578
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,420
what are the, where do

1579
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,140
you think you can make

1580
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,100
better decisions and

1581
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,700
take stronger, faster

1582
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,340
actions.

1583
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,380
Then what you do is you

1584
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,380
go and you just talk

1585
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,220
with that team, say,

1586
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,620
hey, I have this

1587
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,140
concrete situation that

1588
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,540
I think you have the

1589
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,300
data for.

1590
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,100
Do you?

1591
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,820
If they don't, then

1592
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:34,860
that's also going to be

1593
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,820
a good team to get

1594
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,060
advice from on the

1595
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,300
data engineering front.

1596
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,980
In order for you to

1597
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,060
democratize data, you

1598
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:43,540
have to have the data.

1599
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,540
If your BI team has it,

1600
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,210
then work with them

1601
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:49,930
to figure out how to

1602
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:50,410
share it.

1603
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:52,130
Now, I'll tell you, a

1604
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:53,090
lot of these guys will

1605
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:54,370
view themselves as, oh,

1606
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,690
we were the guys that

1607
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,730
build the scorecard for

1608
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,490
the execs.

1609
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,210
So you may need to be

1610
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,130
willing to pony up

1611
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:02,610
resources in order to

1612
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,770
share that data.

1613
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,130
The thing is that most

1614
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:05,770
of the data doesn't

1615
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:07,130
exist. It's not created

1616
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:07,930
by the BI team.

1617
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:08,890
It's collected by the

1618
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:09,370
BI team.

1619
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:09,650
Yep.

1620
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:11,010
So one possibility is to

1621
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:11,850
go to the team that

1622
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:12,450
they're collecting it

1623
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,730
from and say, hey, you

1624
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:14,610
have this database with

1625
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:15,650
this information in it,

1626
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,130
or you have this Hadoop

1627
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:17,690
server with this

1628
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:18,410
information in it, or

1629
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:19,330
you have this, you

1630
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:20,410
know, spreadsheet with

1631
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:21,210
this information in it,

1632
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,650
whatever your form of

1633
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:23,690
information is, could

1634
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:25,250
you please share that

1635
00:48:25,250 --> 00:48:26,530
out company wide or to

1636
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:27,250
a much larger group of

1637
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,250
people, you know, not

1638
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:29,450
just me, because that

1639
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,050
doesn't really, that's

1640
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:30,970
not data democratization.

1641
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,850
If you say you have

1642
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:32,370
this data, can you

1643
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,370
share it with my team?

1644
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:34,090
That's not really

1645
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:34,970
democratizing things.

1646
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:35,650
That's making yourself

1647
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,490
part of the special,

1648
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:37,290
you know, part of the

1649
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,730
elite. The better model

1650
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,090
is to say, Hey, I need

1651
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:41,930
access to this data.

1652
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:42,650
There's others that

1653
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:43,650
probably do too. Could

1654
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:44,210
you make it more

1655
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,250
broadly available? Could

1656
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,610
you lower the access

1657
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:47,690
rights on that server

1658
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,010
and start having that

1659
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,290
conversation plus any

1660
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,330
data that you control

1661
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:52,850
demonstrate how it

1662
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,090
works, make it openly

1663
00:48:54,090 --> 00:48:54,890
available. A lot of

1664
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:55,370
times people are

1665
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,650
scared to open their

1666
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:57,890
data because what might

1667
00:48:57,890 --> 00:48:58,850
happen if somebody gets

1668
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:00,130
ahold of this. And I

1669
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:01,050
think too often we

1670
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,090
are, there's no

1671
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,450
advantage to opening and

1672
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:04,370
there might be some

1673
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,410
risks somewhere, some

1674
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,730
existential corner case

1675
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,410
risk where we're like,

1676
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:10,010
okay, I don't want to

1677
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,930
share it because it might

1678
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:11,810
cause, it might leak and

1679
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:13,090
this might happen. And

1680
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:13,570
oftentimes it's

1681
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,330
overblown. And so I

1682
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:14,970
think it should take a

1683
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:15,770
little bit of risk, but

1684
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:16,490
not much. And just,

1685
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:18,240
the situation that I

1686
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,240
encounter is, is I do

1687
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,920
encounter that the teams

1688
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:22,840
that I know that lock

1689
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,440
their data, I would say

1690
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,560
the primary reason is

1691
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,440
because they know

1692
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,000
there's a lot of

1693
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,200
tribal knowledge baked in

1694
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,920
and how to use it

1695
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,720
correctly. And they

1696
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,200
don't want to be

1697
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,320
randomized by people

1698
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,720
doing it wrong. Right.

1699
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,880
Which is why I

1700
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,880
basically say what I

1701
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,880
told earlier in this,

1702
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,480
in this episode. I will

1703
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,200
say that if you're

1704
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,240
getting the data in

1705
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,720
this, in this space,

1706
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,360
you, you do want to,

1707
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,280
so Steve is right. The

1708
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,880
data is being gathered by

1709
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,120
the BI team from some

1710
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,160
place, but the BI team

1711
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,960
most likely has already

1712
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,160
done the work to clean

1713
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,720
and check that data. And

1714
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,640
to encode the tribe,

1715
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,840
the correct tribal

1716
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,080
knowledge, start there

1717
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,040
first, see if they will

1718
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,240
share it out. If they

1719
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,400
don't, then yeah, you

1720
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,520
may have to go back and

1721
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,640
reinvent the wheel, but

1722
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,160
you should figure out how

1723
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,600
to make sure you can

1724
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,840
bootstrap that domain

1725
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,640
knowledge and not

1726
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,000
reproduce it. Right. It

1727
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
is always difficult. Data

1728
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,960
democratization solves

1729
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,800
the access to the data,

1730
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,480
but doesn't solve the

1731
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,160
ability to use it

1732
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,720
correctly. Right. And so

1733
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,800
it still really

1734
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,280
requires a domain expert

1735
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,000
in order to be able to

1736
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,050
use it correctly. Agreed.

1737
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:33,450
Hey, we have two

1738
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:34,530
male bait questions. We

1739
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:35,410
do, but I only sing the

1740
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,450
song once. Henry

1741
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,130
Golding, who says, so

1742
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:40,160
chaps, how long do you

1743
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,440
think it will be before

1744
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,360
data science becomes just

1745
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,440
another tool in the

1746
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:45,800
specializing generalist

1747
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,640
box rather than a

1748
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,640
separate thing you need

1749
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,000
to spin up a big team of

1750
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,680
specialists for, which I

1751
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,920
think is a really

1752
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,460
interesting question. I

1753
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,740
will say, uh, my answer

1754
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,500
for that is actually

1755
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,580
pretty short. Um, it

1756
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,620
ran. You have never had

1757
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,580
a short answer for

1758
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,540
anything in 46 episodes

1759
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,220
of AB testing. I can't

1760
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,300
wait. It will be a very

1761
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,290
long time. The reason

1762
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:14,440
why is, uh, data

1763
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,960
scientists, uh, in the

1764
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,360
tooling is advancing, but

1765
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,080
the rate at which we're

1766
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,480
acquiring tooling and

1767
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,840
the rate at which we are

1768
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,280
acquiring data science

1769
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,360
is not keeping pace

1770
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,840
with the rate at which

1771
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,280
new data sources are

1772
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,280
coming in and not keeping

1773
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,880
pace with, with our need

1774
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,480
to go deeper on data

1775
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,920
science problems. So we

1776
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,200
are currently just

1777
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,840
scratching the surface and

1778
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,480
we have a lot of

1779
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,680
tooling. Um, but as more

1780
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,840
and more data comes in,

1781
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,360
we will have the need to

1782
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,760
improve data engineering.

1783
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,440
There's this sense that,

1784
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:56,000
uh, at least in my world,

1785
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,040
that there's a sense that

1786
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,640
we're always six inches

1787
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,010
just underneath the top

1788
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,690
of the water. Yeah. I

1789
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:05,570
think that you'll, it will

1790
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:07,770
not go away and just

1791
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:08,930
become a tool, but I

1792
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:10,370
think it will become, I

1793
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:10,970
think you'll always need

1794
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:11,890
data scientists be pushing

1795
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:12,530
the edge and to do the

1796
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:13,530
more complicated things.

1797
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,050
Um, for the primary

1798
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:15,770
reason that the thought

1799
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,210
processes of programming

1800
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:18,170
and doing data science

1801
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,330
are so different and the

1802
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,330
knowledge bases are so

1803
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:21,650
big that you can't keep

1804
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:22,370
both of them. You cannot

1805
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:23,290
be an expert in both at

1806
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,650
the same time. That

1807
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:25,810
said, I think that the

1808
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,010
pieces of data science

1809
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:27,850
will move more and more

1810
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,410
easily into the basic

1811
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:30,010
toolkit of your

1812
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:30,890
generalizing specialists

1813
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:31,490
and your specializing

1814
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:32,810
generalists. Um, and so

1815
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,610
they will be able to do

1816
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:35,170
more and more parts of it,

1817
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:36,170
but they won't be able to

1818
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,170
do some of the more

1819
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:37,930
advanced parts. And I

1820
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,290
think what it defines an

1821
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,010
advanced part and a

1822
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:41,170
basic part will over

1823
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:41,850
time, that boundary will

1824
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:42,610
continue to move

1825
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:43,490
forward. You know, it

1826
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,640
used to be five years

1827
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,360
ago, if you were data

1828
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,480
science, you had to be a

1829
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,800
PhD because you had to

1830
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,520
go invent all your own

1831
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,200
algorithms. If you

1832
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,360
wanted to go, um, do, uh,

1833
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,720
some deep learning, you

1834
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,600
had to go invent your own

1835
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,200
neural net and you had

1836
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,400
to go know how a back

1837
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,200
propagation worked and

1838
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:57,840
all that kind of stuff.

1839
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,520
Today, you just go and

1840
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,560
use the package in

1841
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,000
Python or a package in

1842
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,360
R or you go to Azure

1843
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:03,960
machine learning and

1844
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,800
you just say like, please

1845
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,720
train a neural net for me

1846
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,680
with, you know, 18

1847
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,920
levels go and it will

1848
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,200
just do it for you. Now,

1849
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,000
understanding what that

1850
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:10,920
is doing and how to

1851
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,160
tweak it is difficult,

1852
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,600
but it's easier to go

1853
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,400
do. And if I just want

1854
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,640
to go figure out the

1855
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,240
median for some values

1856
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:17,840
or I want to go and

1857
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,560
create like a simple

1858
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,760
regression, it is very

1859
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,600
easy to go do. And it

1860
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,240
doesn't take a lot of

1861
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,200
knowledge to be able to

1862
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,400
go do the basic versions

1863
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,320
of that. And that will

1864
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,320
move over time up the

1865
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,280
stack. Yes. And so what

1866
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,480
we'll find is a lot of

1867
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,240
that there'll be a

1868
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,040
broadening that a lot of

1869
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,360
the simple problems will

1870
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,520
be readily automated

1871
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,200
away. But to Henry's

1872
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,320
question, there probably

1873
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,040
will be, I don't know,

1874
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,840
I'll just make up a

1875
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:42,960
number five years from

1876
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,720
now that the tooling

1877
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,520
will exist that the

1878
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,800
generalizing specialists

1879
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,560
or specializing

1880
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,400
generalists will be

1881
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,080
able to solve 80% of

1882
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,800
the problems. And there

1883
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,760
will be environments

1884
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,880
where solving 80% of

1885
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,000
the problems is

1886
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,160
sufficient. I think all

1887
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,000
the years of today's

1888
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,880
problems. But I think,

1889
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,160
yeah, as always, you'll

1890
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,080
get to more and more

1891
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,120
complex problems as you

1892
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,800
can solve the easy

1893
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,000
problems. It will depend

1894
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,360
on on the competitive

1895
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:05,760
advantage like it. The

1896
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,800
as right now we're all

1897
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,000
competing on the basis

1898
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,720
of speed in the world.

1899
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,520
And I think once

1900
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,640
everyone is kind of

1901
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:15,200
going at the same pace,

1902
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:15,720
then there's going to

1903
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,480
be other things that

1904
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,520
that are the

1905
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,640
differentiator in the

1906
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,880
market. And I think

1907
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,400
that's where the deep

1908
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,200
data scientists will

1909
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,640
come into play. I think

1910
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,860
you're both wrong. Not

1911
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,500
totally wrong. I think

1912
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,020
I think there's another

1913
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,900
spin on it that I'll get

1914
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:30,660
to before I run out of

1915
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,020
time. I think both

1916
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,300
happen. You guys are

1917
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,300
talking right. I sit

1918
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:36,300
back and listen. It's

1919
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,020
like you're talking

1920
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,940
like Microsoft data

1921
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,620
scientists. But

1922
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:40,540
remember, if I'm on a

1923
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,260
team of 20 people

1924
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,420
making some cool app,

1925
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,100
absolutely. There's a

1926
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:46,860
twist on Henry's

1927
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,140
question. I need you're

1928
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:48,940
not going to have a

1929
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,740
data scientist on the

1930
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,620
team probably in 20

1931
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,660
people, maybe not even

1932
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,220
40 people. But you

1933
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,700
absolutely as part of

1934
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,820
a team of specializing

1935
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,740
judge generalizing

1936
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:57,820
specialists, you need

1937
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,660
someone with some data

1938
00:54:58,660 --> 00:54:59,540
science chops, someone

1939
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:00,140
who's gone through a

1940
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:00,860
couple of course, not a

1941
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,900
man, an expert, not a

1942
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,540
PhD for sure, but gone

1943
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,100
through the course or

1944
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,980
classes, you know, read

1945
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,020
lean analytics. For

1946
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,180
example, they have some

1947
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,500
idea of what to do. This

1948
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,100
is the role I play a

1949
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,980
lot on my team. So I

1950
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:13,740
can advocate a little

1951
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,140
bit there is I am not a

1952
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,500
data scientist. I know

1953
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,460
enough about it that I

1954
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,020
can tell them we're

1955
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,340
doing stupid things or

1956
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:20,860
where there's things

1957
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,700
that were obviously

1958
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,580
needed to be doing. We

1959
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,580
are now ramping up with

1960
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,460
some data science people

1961
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,620
in the org to help cover

1962
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,300
some of the things that I

1963
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,820
can't get to. But I think

1964
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,140
you need both. At some

1965
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,020
point, you may need a

1966
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:34,140
team of data scientists

1967
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,660
we as you get bigger,

1968
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:36,580
and you're making more

1969
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:37,180
impact, you have more

1970
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,540
data coming in. But

1971
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:40,380
absolutely, I wouldn't

1972
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,900
say I wouldn't say

1973
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,820
there'll be a time when

1974
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,300
I think the time when

1975
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,580
data science needs to be

1976
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,300
a tool in your toolbox

1977
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:47,980
is now.

1978
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:48,900
Right. I think the

1979
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,220
time when it's only

1980
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:51,100
tool in your toolbox,

1981
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:51,580
and you don't have

1982
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,700
specialists is a long

1983
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:53,140
ways away.

1984
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,940
But I think it's

1985
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:55,860
becoming more and more

1986
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,660
democratized.

1987
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:57,540
There's a subtle

1988
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,180
every year.

1989
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,340
I think it becomes a

1990
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,500
tool now. It'll be. And

1991
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,380
so I want to make that

1992
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:05,490
point. But I think

1993
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,170
definitely it's probably

1994
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,970
never just that,

1995
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:11,010
especially, it'll

1996
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,090
always be with scale,

1997
00:56:12,130 --> 00:56:12,970
but it'll always be

1998
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:15,490
moving on. So I'll

1999
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:17,010
invent another new term

2000
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:17,530
today.

2001
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:18,970
This is Brent's

2002
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,090
continuing short answer.

2003
00:56:20,970 --> 00:56:22,650
Expert systems. So an

2004
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,610
expert system is a new

2005
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,930
newish asset in which

2006
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,370
you apply data science,

2007
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,450
automation, machine

2008
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:32,010
learning, and you apply

2009
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:33,650
in a rigorous fashion

2010
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,090
domain knowledge from

2011
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:36,170
particular teams.

2012
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:37,810
And I will say, for

2013
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:40,530
example, 60% of what I

2014
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,530
do is analyzing

2015
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,210
histograms. And there's

2016
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,730
a very succinct period

2017
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,610
or a rigor around how

2018
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:49,410
I do that, what I

2019
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,610
discover. And that's, I

2020
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:52,690
would say, readily

2021
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:54,250
automatable. Right.

2022
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:56,330
So once an expert

2023
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,090
system or something

2024
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,250
similar comes into play

2025
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,170
that can generate these

2026
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:02,090
things, do the

2027
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,330
if conditions determine

2028
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:05,890
what further analysis

2029
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:06,730
needs to be done and

2030
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:08,930
then output, go do

2031
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,330
this. This is what appears

2032
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:11,210
to be the problem.

2033
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:14,050
I think that's

2034
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,490
certainly doable in the

2035
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,130
next five years.

2036
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,370
And there's tools that

2037
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,050
are making it easier and

2038
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:18,770
easier all the time. Like

2039
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,330
the new version of

2040
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,610
Excel has histograms built

2041
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:21,650
in in a reasonable way,

2042
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,490
which it never has had

2043
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:24,130
before. Power BI is now

2044
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:25,250
fairly democratized.

2045
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:25,930
You know, there's other

2046
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:26,650
platforms out there that

2047
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:28,050
you can use to analyze

2048
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,050
your data and get a lot

2049
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,570
of sense for it just

2050
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:31,170
from the beginning with

2051
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:32,370
it with very easy tools

2052
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:32,730
to use.

2053
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:33,970
Very cool. Hey guys,

2054
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:34,810
we're out of time.

2055
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:36,290
Hey, thanks Steve, which

2056
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,390
means shut up. Thanks

2057
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:39,110
Steve for coming.

2058
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:40,790
Yeah. I guess you just

2059
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,430
showed up anyway.

2060
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:45,290
It does. If I didn't

2061
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:46,530
show up, you would

2062
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:47,970
have been what?

2063
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,290
As testing? What's that

2064
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,090
ass testing?

2065
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,570
You need me. All right,

2066
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,130
then. All right, I'm

2067
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,330
Alan. I'm Brent.

2068
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:57,490
And I am neither.

2069
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,440
Awesome. See you next

2070
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,360
time. Bye guys.
