1
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,360
Ladies and gentlemen from the Palatial Studio D at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington, I'm Alan.

2
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
I'm Brent.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,360
And we're here for episode 30 of A.B. testing.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,360
The big 3.0.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,360
You know what? Big 3.0. I'm going to be the big 5.0 like in two weeks.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,740
Really?

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,740
Yeah. I'm ready for a midlife crisis.

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,970
I did that 10 years ago.

9
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:38,970
Grew my hair out long.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,970
You were 50 10 years ago? That's about right.

11
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,970
No.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,970
Here you're predicting midlife is 50 for you?

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,970
Oh no. I'm over the hill.

14
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,100
So, f***. Oh, I can't.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,100
Edit coming.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,540
So this episode, we have our little list up.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,540
And it's all about this episode is called Stuff Alan and Brent Did.

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,540
Yeah. It's all about ketchup too.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,820
Like the number one item on the list.

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,820
God, what was that? The end of September?

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,820
We haven't recorded. We did the live episode.

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:13,820
We'll just talk about it in a little bit.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,820
But we haven't recorded a studio session.

24
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,820
In a while.

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,820
It's been a while.

26
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,950
Life happens and we apologize.

27
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:24,950
But you know what?

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,950
I talked to somebody. I'm going to jump ahead here.

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:27,950
I talked to someone in Europe.

30
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,950
There are a lot of one of the three in Europe.

31
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,950
Just saying.

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,950
I met like seven of them.

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,010
Yeah. Similar experience.

34
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,070
We have a lot of folks now.

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,070
Yeah.

36
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,070
It's fantastic.

37
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,070
No. There really are only three.

38
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,070
They just trade off.

39
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,070
But it's funny.

40
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,070
Someone told me that they like our podcast,

41
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,070
but they can't listen to it while they do anything else.

42
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,070
I thought they're going to say because you guys are so idiotic

43
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,070
and stupid and unpredictable.

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,070
But it turns out it's just because we talked fast

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,070
and English is their second language set to stop and actually listen.

46
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,070
Oh. That's my anecdote there.

47
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,070
So back in.

48
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,070
I was going to assume it was ADHD.

49
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,070
So they have to take.

50
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,070
Oh, we should do.

51
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,070
That's the subtitle ADHD testing the print and Helen show.

52
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:20,070
Hey, you went to in the end of September conference called Strata.

53
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,070
I did.

54
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,070
It was.

55
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,070
And on to the next subject.

56
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,070
Sorry.

57
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,070
Tell us a little bit about Strata.

58
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,300
The two coolest things was went to Strata.

59
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,360
First and foremost, it was my first trip to New York.

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Second Strata was extremely interesting from the perspective of seeing

61
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,360
how the rest of the world is viewing the data science problem versus say

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Microsoft.

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,460
And then lastly, had dinner and drinks with one of the three.

64
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,460
Which three?

65
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,460
Percy.

66
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,460
Percy three.

67
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,460
Actually, it's one of my favorite one of the threes because he's the one

68
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,460
that kick started the one of the three hashtag.

69
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,520
Did he I thought I did he did it.

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,520
He did it.

71
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
He's awesome.

72
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,520
He is winner.

73
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,020
I don't know what's interesting there.

74
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,020
I don't know.

75
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
So you thought the rest of the industry is doing.

76
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,020
What is the rest of the industry doing?

77
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,020
Is it is it are they just doing math on Abacus or they actually doing cool

78
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,020
stuff?

79
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:30,020
I'll tell you what I walked away with first and foremost.

80
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,660
Microsoft today in a lot of our internal problems were still under

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,660
transition right to this as we gear up and train more people on the

82
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,660
data science world seems the type of problems that we're trying to

83
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
solve today.

84
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,660
The rest of the world solved two to three years ago.

85
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,660
You know, that's you know, it's a parallel there.

86
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,660
There was a time in software testing back when it was much more

87
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,660
relevant when the problems that the industry was trying to solve

88
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,660
were problems that Microsoft solved a few years ago.

89
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,660
But so that parallel happens and it's good for us to notice us

90
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,660
as an industry and us as Microsoft to see when to one

91
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,660
one cool thing is you see happening a little more now than

92
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,660
happened you know 10 years ago is people actually look outside

93
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,660
the walls of the board and see what's going on in the world.

94
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,660
They notice these things.

95
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,660
If I understood what you said previously that there was a

96
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,660
period in time which there was a period of time when on the

97
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,660
test front Microsoft was ahead of the rest of the world.

98
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,660
I believe so. Yes.

99
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,660
I you kind of saw I kind of saw them follow.

100
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,660
I agree with that for better or for worse.

101
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,860
I also think like a lot of other companies have followed

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,860
Microsoft's review model.

103
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,860
Amazon still uses our review model that you and I suffered

104
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
under 20 years ago.

105
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,110
But I actually wonder if there's a correlation there.

106
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,110
Right.

107
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,110
Because we were busily heavily investing and leading the

108
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,110
world in terms of how test is done and the rest of the

109
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,110
world moved into the frame of hey we don't need test and

110
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,110
they invested sooner and earlier than we do into the

111
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,110
data science world.

112
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,110
I think we were slower to something just even the science

113
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,110
part.

114
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,110
In many cases we were slower to realize the power of

115
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:29,110
measuring customer data and telemetry in general and all

116
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,110
that.

117
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,240
Yeah.

118
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,240
We kept investing using monitoring as testing versus

119
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,240
trying to test everything into it from before it went

120
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
live.

121
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,660
Yes.

122
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,660
I get it.

123
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Yeah.

124
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,660
So cool.

125
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
You met Percy.

126
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,660
You learned about some big data.

127
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,140
Biggest takeaway.

128
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,100
Big data as it gets bigger and bigger.

129
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,770
You need to work towards massively parallelizing how

130
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,770
you grok the data.

131
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,770
And the biggest takeaway the biggest aha for me is that

132
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:12,380
in that world polynomial time is absolutely too slow.

133
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,380
N squared is way too slow and it's even getting to the

134
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,600
point where O of N is too slow.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,080
So we need faster more effective ways to parse

136
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
massive amounts of data.

137
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,080
Yeah.

138
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
It's very fascinating.

139
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
This is where we've talked about it before.

140
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,080
When things what you know can't scale to your

141
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,080
needs this is where new ideas start to form.

142
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,080
So it's going to be really exciting to watch what

143
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,080
comes out of this space over the next couple of

144
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
years.

145
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,080
Yeah.

146
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
It is interesting.

147
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I was worried at the beginning because it sounded

148
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,080
like you're going like tautology mode only.

149
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
Like you're going to say as big data gets bigger

150
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,080
it's bigger.

151
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,010
I'm going to try to avoid pure tautology today.

152
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,010
All right.

153
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,010
Or not.

154
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,010
So you got to go to New York.

155
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,010
So did you do anything New Yorky while you were

156
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,010
there?

157
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,010
Yeah.

158
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,040
Went to this great Brazilian Russian.

159
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,230
How many what?

160
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,230
A Brazilian.

161
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,230
Oh I thought you said a Brazilian.

162
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,230
No Brazilian.

163
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,230
Brazilian restaurant.

164
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,230
Okay.

165
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,230
Yeah.

166
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,230
You realize Brazil is not in New York.

167
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,230
I know.

168
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,230
Okay.

169
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,230
Just checking.

170
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,230
Yeah.

171
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,230
We went to Sal's pizzeria and we also went to

172
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,230
one of the hole in the wall pizzeria places.

173
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,230
Sal's was sort of hey it's famous place we got

174
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,230
to go.

175
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,230
Okay.

176
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,230
Hole in the wall pizzeria.

177
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,230
Way better.

178
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,230
I know.

179
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,230
Way better.

180
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,230
I think the Sal's pizza I could get here.

181
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,230
I was not impressed.

182
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,230
There's nothing like a slice in New York City

183
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,230
late at night after about 17 beer.

184
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,230
Three two beer.

185
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,230
One beer.

186
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:48,230
Sufficient beer.

187
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,230
Sufficient beer.

188
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,230
Yeah.

189
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,330
Alright cool.

190
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,240
And then Times Square that was an experience.

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,560
So my hotel room was literally right over Times Square.

192
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,580
It was fantastic that the blackout curtains actually did.

193
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,620
I think they have to do that there.

194
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,620
Cool.

195
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
Alright.

196
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,900
So then in between there we went and recorded the live show at Red Finn which you heard

197
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,180
in episode 29.

198
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,180
Hopefully.

199
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,180
At least three of you did.

200
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,140
At least three well the three heard it.

201
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,420
Interesting to marry a live show with the A.B. testing style.

202
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:27,420
It was fun.

203
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,100
We got a chance to babble on a lot of things people had heard before.

204
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,100
Little interaction.

205
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,460
In most cases we remember to repeat the audience question.

206
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,740
And in some cases you had to infer the question from our answers.

207
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,140
But all in all an interesting take and we should we should do it again sometime.

208
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,740
Well think about the format of that so we get that find the right marriage there.

209
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,900
Yeah I don't think based on the feedback.

210
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,900
See I don't.

211
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,900
Here's the deal.

212
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,900
Alan doesn't read the feedback.

213
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:02,380
I don't give one flying you know what about feedback.

214
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,940
Brent however is slightly below feedback.

215
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:12,740
Can you explain to me again how just as a complete and total hypothetical aside.

216
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm forgetting it.

217
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,080
Can you explain how learning organizations work again.

218
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,930
Anyway.

219
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:31,860
Yeah we do need to tweak the format so what you guys what you guys don't know so we had

220
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:32,860
the audio.

221
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,100
I wonder if it's worthwhile to release the video.

222
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,820
If if two of you.

223
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,360
Brent there's there's a reason we're on a podcast.

224
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
That guy good point.

225
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,880
Yeah people don't we're gonna.

226
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,080
They don't need to see that.

227
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,840
We'll go down to two listeners and they're both blind.

228
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,870
If we decide to show our faces.

229
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:59,550
What we did for the presentation is we decided to do it as as we as you saw podcast style

230
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,590
we told them up front.

231
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:08,710
We had what a hundred plus people in the room and we didn't we didn't bring a slide deck.

232
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,350
Yeah which I think is fine.

233
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:14,570
I think if there was one thing I would do differently I would take your little sheet

234
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:19,240
of notes and crumple it up and throw it away before we started.

235
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Yeah you said that in the podcast and I'm still denying that it was in the way man.

236
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,240
Yeah in the way from my experience is in the way.

237
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,320
No I think so that one the great news is we got the first ever our first ever live album

238
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
for something like that.

239
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,360
I'm gonna need the out of net.

240
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,480
I'm gonna need the outline or else I'm just gonna get in the weeds also I think for this

241
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:47,330
format reel in the topics like way more high level and then stop earlier for questions.

242
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:52,090
I think the most where so I don't look at feedback because I look I observe the audience

243
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:57,170
look for engagement and it was Q&A where you start to get the engagement.

244
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:05,540
Yeah I think better last time so we spent I was roughly when I re listened to it I

245
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:13,030
was roughly counting how much time we spent talking about our prior experience.

246
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,830
I think when you go into that setting up a expectation of credibility is important but

247
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,430
I think we spent too much time on that.

248
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:26,290
I agree with you that if we had just gone through very quickly the breadth of topics

249
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,830
and just a little bit of depth and then open up the questions making it very clear

250
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:37,600
hey we can go wherever you guys think is most valuable let's start made it much more

251
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,480
interactive I think that would have been a better presentation.

252
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,520
Have we done a podcast since I did the talk at GoDaddy?

253
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Yes.

254
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,400
Okay because that was they wanted me to give us like a half hour presentation so I prepared

255
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,010
a couple quick slides on testing a single page web application which I happen to be doing

256
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,110
and just I just all it was was sorry if this is a repeat I just made some basically I started

257
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,240
with the bullet points of like five or six or seven of the things that I thought I had

258
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,520
learned that are most important.

259
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,640
I talked about them a little bit kind of how our team was doing it and then we had

260
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,720
questions that for a quick little half hour talk that worked well and also it's because

261
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,780
something like that you could go super deep on and go forever but I find that even

262
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:30,240
when I do conference talks I value the Q&A more than you can't really do a Q&A on a keynote

263
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,200
but I if I if I do a track session or even a workshop I really try and make it interactive

264
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,040
in fact once I gave a many many many years ago I give a keynote at star and Lee asked

265
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:51,200
me to give a track session and Whitaker our buddy the infamous the world famous James

266
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,280
Whitaker was there a good friend with James but I don't want to come to my talk but we

267
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,280
finished by I finished by thing that goes because being goes I can't use the exact words

268
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:07,100
he used because they're not PG appropriate because something like holy Alan you didn't

269
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,810
do anything you made your audience give the whole talk for you there's a quote I used

270
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:18,050
in my the segue into I went to Eurostar a few weeks ago and there's a quote I pull

271
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,830
a lot into a presentation once a while but usually I'm talking about some you

272
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,440
know bit of innovation innovation maybe even this stretch something some new idea

273
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,480
talk about the Heinlein quote which I will badly paraphrase as I usually do

274
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,760
but you know the future is paved by lazy people trying to find a easier way of

275
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,240
doing things and that's what I do I don't want to get a whole talk I don't

276
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,480
want who wants to listen to a talking head for an hour those people that they

277
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,120
paid to come and do exactly that I know I don't and I I'll talk about Eurostar a

278
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,440
little bit but I as an audit both as an audience member and as a speaker I think

279
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,720
it's just much more value when you're doing a track session with 30 40 50

280
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,720
people to make it interactive versus have them listen to you read bullet points oh

281
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,240
did you which yeah I had a I had a nightmare at star I had this like

282
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,320
really vivid it was like it wasn't quite all the way a sleep dream but

283
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,000
it's kind of laying in bed and I visualize like the worst presentation ever

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,720
I wrote it up I wrote it up it's basically every bad thing I've seen like

285
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,120
people reading bullet points and turning their back to the audience and slides

286
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,280
with nothing but text it's all yeah yeah I'm just like oh hey and they never

287
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,400
stopped talking they never get to a point you know okay I go damn it damn

288
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:45,200
it oh it's awful so I like that and there I saw one cool talk it was it

289
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,200
maybe went a little bit too far I won't throw out any names because I'm being

290
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,600
critical but maybe went a little bit too far on the audience participation could

291
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,280
be a little bit more roll up in it but it was a lot of fun I like engagement and

292
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,800
the audience was engaged so even though I would like to see a little bit more

293
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,800
wrap up a little bit more facilitation around the audience discussion during

294
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,280
this talk I think the audience still got a lot out of it so I can't really

295
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,920
complain from my perspective I would like you know and I'm super

296
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,640
hypercritical on on talks and there were plenty there were some really good ones

297
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:24,620
and plenty of like come on stop and am I upon a soapbox again you are when you

298
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,820
go to these often too often it's a consultant trying to drum up business

299
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:37,300
versus a practitioner trying to share knowledge with the community oh so it's

300
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,060
strata that one thing that was interesting is that they they

301
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,500
separated those conferences they were different tracks and the consultants all

302
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,340
in one session only one track Oh Lee Copeland if you're listening all

303
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,100
consultants get their own unfortunately for star conferences I think that means

304
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,700
that there's like one small track for non consultants I could be wrong I my

305
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:07,240
demographics would be wrong so I'll be quiet but so I went to those tracks a

306
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:14,220
couple of times and those are the ones where I left after 15 minutes it was you

307
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:22,280
you pick up very quickly I am NOT going to learn anything here except for this

308
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:28,390
guy's particular tool in what it costs often I think and not to pick on you

309
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,630
know it's really easy to dump every single consultant into one bucket but

310
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,340
in my experience I can qualify this I'll weasel word my way out of this in my

311
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,780
experience the vast majority of consultants speaking about software

312
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:49,860
testing at least is a lack of practical and recent knowledge or it's it's just I

313
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:55,460
just can't find it relevant I think that problem so several of these companies

314
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,660
also had their engineers come and do presentations I had a great long chat

315
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:08,240
with the engineering team from eBay and it ended up those type of things are

316
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,520
really adored it ended up being kind of like a in-person stack exchange

317
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,120
conversation they asked questions of me I asked questions of them we both learned

318
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,080
together but the people who are presenting this consultant stuff I

319
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:27,680
think they're bringing in their marketing team I'm like you know if you bring in

320
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,680
do the same presentation but have it presented by one of your low-level

321
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,700
engineers it'd be a much better presentation for that audience it kind

322
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,180
of comes back to whether you're you know I'm a big fan of storytelling in in

323
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,240
general and in talks and often if you don't have that practical experience you

324
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,260
don't have the story that helps drive the point home and if you're telling a

325
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:56,970
story it's sometimes irrelevant but I think really those anecdotes about how

326
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,550
concept X was used and what it did and what you learned are super valuable so I

327
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:09,910
know we're not I'm I'm we are doing a patented a B testing tangent so I want to

328
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,470
wind back in I think we can close I was gonna fine then I'll do my tangent okay

329
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,950
as usual brain gets to finish one of the things that was also different was

330
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,750
our rhythm I don't think our are you're in my rhythm when we do the podcast it

331
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,990
wasn't clicking at redfin and I think one of the reasons just looking at you

332
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,590
right now right we're we're looking at talking in the microphone we're reading

333
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,630
each other's by language we can kind of tell whereas and you're reading that

334
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:47,040
stupid piece of paper in front of you I was that thing is my memory now I

335
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:53,440
think you're right though that if we had if we had just briefly I think next

336
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,680
time right that sheet has to be no more than five items something that I can

337
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,120
memorize and kind of memorize the flow so that I don't go off tap it topic and

338
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,320
start talking about individual the color of your underoos that was really

339
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,980
embarrassed I cut that out that was edited out it's blue though yeah Superman

340
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:27,380
the but that's something I think from so I did read the feedback and I do think

341
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:35,980
that that awkwardness of our rhythm got picked up by the audience so let me talk

342
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,740
about before we get to I'm gonna talk a little about my experience at Eurostar

343
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:44,330
but I've been thinking for a while I want I go to all these conferences and

344
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:49,360
I watch talks and see different styles of talks and I want I need to run a

345
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,430
conference no let me finish Brent put your sock back in your mouth and let me

346
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:03,700
finish I'm shutting up because I want like I think hour-long talks are awful

347
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,130
I want 30 minute talks maybe it's 20 minute talk with 10 minutes of questions

348
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,880
I don't know what how it works I'm working out the details I think I I

349
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:20,560
just there's very few 50 to 60 minute talks that I've enjoyed if they're

350
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,080
interactive you can you can go that long or longer but just a talking head for

351
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,060
that long is just 90% of the time in my experience a total waste of time there

352
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,180
are logistics around that you've done that before and it went well but let me

353
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,900
go on another thing I'm gonna marry some ideas have been bouncing in my

354
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,900
head right here at 835 in the morning and a be testing I've also thought some

355
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,180
of my favorite conferences have been peer conferences for there's just a dozen of

356
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,020
us 15 of us in a inner you know hanging out for a couple days or a day talking

357
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,420
about stuff seeing where the conversation goes imagine a be testing

358
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,740
with more people and smarter people and Brent now and shut up and listen

359
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,370
there's potential there I went to one for teller ik that Jim Holmes hosted a

360
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,850
few years ago it was just a great experience I did the Chris McMahon

361
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,770
writing about testing peer conference fun good camaraderie great ideas some good

362
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:24,950
learning out of that and but organizing hosting travel stuff I could do but I

363
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,870
don't know so what I've been thinking of doing for a while and I don't have a

364
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,630
timeline for this and maybe we get one or two of the three to join in is a

365
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:41,740
virtual conference a virtual peer conference we pick some topics get invite

366
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,540
10 15 20 people everybody has a topic they're going to talk about for anywhere

367
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,580
from 15 to 30 minutes or some time for question and answer and interactive it

368
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,580
wouldn't be like an eight hour a day thing you do it for like we're gonna do

369
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,260
it for a couple hours over a couple days I don't know how quite it works

370
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:04,320
yet but bounce around in my head I don't have the details figured out but

371
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm throwing it out here to the masses for feedback and thoughts and planting

372
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,400
the seeds and and maybe what would be awesome if it happened if somebody else

373
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,080
just took it took it by the the reins and made it happen and etc etc so I went

374
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:25,120
to Eurostar in a mastic where in the Netherlands okay so if you those you

375
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,560
that haven't memorized European map there's a little spit of land at the

376
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:34,080
bottom of the Netherlands that goes kind of scorched itself in between in

377
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,360
between Belgium and Germany and there is a town there called Maastricht and

378
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:48,030
that's where Eurostar was this year and I went there flew into Amsterdam took a

379
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:56,120
train about two and a half hours get there I walk in I go I get to my room

380
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,240
put my stuff down hang up some things that are wrinkled I beat it's been

381
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,060
like you know 20 hours of travel at this point I walk downstairs I'm gonna get like

382
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:13,390
a something to eat and go to bed and I see great guy I haven't seen since the

383
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,150
last year I went to three years ago a great guy Alan Richardson he's Alan

384
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,150
number two I'm Alan number one we were labeled during one of the keynotes

385
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:30,250
he's a frequent speaker but he's Scottish Scottish he's Scottish so

386
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,010
he's a fun guy I like talking to him I met a lot of people who were one of the

387
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:40,410
three saw some good talks I I got it in Tuesday night Wednesday night we had a

388
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:49,120
dinner in a cave that was cool I sat with a servant caves mushrooms I don't the

389
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,280
dinner was you don't know you were there it was good not great there was

390
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:58,330
some some food I don't eat I kind of I mostly drink the wine didn't eat much of

391
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:04,080
food at a fun table James Lindsay was at our table he won the whatever the

392
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,680
European tester of the year award is or something that was fun next night

393
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:14,920
however was a dinner just for the speakers from the I was only there to

394
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,570
speak on Friday at this deep dive on mobile testing and we ate in there's

395
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:24,690
this restaurant that's made in an old church so just beautiful and the food

396
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:32,010
there was just fantastic oh so good and then I became back and believe it or not

397
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,290
usually when I got to these dinners I worried that I'm gonna come home like

398
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:40,370
full and plastered and not sleep and but it was nice to came home fairly sober

399
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,970
not too full and got a good night of sleep and got up and gave my talk the

400
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,490
next morning what's the best European country for

401
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,930
aquitarian to Eden I know it's not Germany I can get around anywhere

402
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:58,060
Germany's at the cheese you can get around anywhere I think so give the talk

403
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,900
how to go I think it went well what was the theme of your star this year the

404
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,700
member I just was there for the mobile deep dive so the theme was mobile

405
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,820
testing so I talked about application compatibility I talked about it from the

406
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:15,920
angle of the thing I worked on to make Android apps run on Windows and talked

407
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,360
about how we got data and really turned it into the importance of using data and

408
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:25,730
telemetry and that really stuck home and there was actually I was thought I'd

409
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,370
scare people with that but there's some other talks on that as well Julian

410
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:34,410
Hardy went deep into data analysis etc mm-hmm so it really kind of helped you

411
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,610
know it's tough being first it's fun being first it's tough being first but

412
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,570
what I like to do when I give a talk at a conference is I'll tie in like

413
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,010
previous talks so I feel like I set up my peers very well to tie in their

414
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,290
subjects so there was that next morning I took off I like a two and a half hour

415
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,410
train trip to Amsterdam I got at the airport early than I've ever been to the

416
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:57,650
airport like three hours early but there were such long lines I still barely

417
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,160
made my flight it was ridiculous so then I get to our plane ran out of gas

418
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,880
that ever happened say we're running all on fuel we're gonna need to stop a

419
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,020
little early and top her off so we stopped in Albany New York and got some

420
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,380
extra fuel get to Philadelphia in time for me to miss all my connecting flights

421
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,960
home spent the night in Philadelphia flew back the next day and that's pretty

422
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,160
much it I was home for a week and then I went to this I went down to visit riot

423
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,280
games who make a League of Legends hey before you start talking about riot

424
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,920
all right um you have your star questions I do you want to know where

425
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,710
Netherlands are you geography lesson you just did that this is actually the

426
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:47,190
first time I think I've heard you say that there was sort of a deep dive on data

427
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:52,870
analysis which I think is promising that that the rest of the test community

428
00:26:52,870 --> 00:27:02,020
is beginning to get with the modern times what based on what you observe that

429
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:09,200
you're a star what sort of things are still active in the test community that

430
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,600
shouldn't be and where do you see the test community moving I think there's

431
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,880
still a lot of people living in the test last world where testing is this thing

432
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,760
that happens after the development team is done with the product that's

433
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,120
unfortunate that's unfortunate for us it's fortunate for the consultants

434
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,280
that's where they make a lot of their money so that part is inefficient but

435
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:37,950
for many companies they just it's it's good enough there are most

436
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:44,210
companies doing any sort of web service or a web page anything in the cloud have

437
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:48,970
figured out that data that gathering data and analyzing it and you know turning it

438
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:52,930
sideways is the right thing to do are you seeing that as well as test first

439
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:57,410
starting to be highlighted at these conferences no I'm seeing more and more

440
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:04,030
sort of Agilish integration of the testers quality person into the

441
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:08,270
development team but it's and again I don't know what the right direction is

442
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:15,110
but more most often the tester in these agile teams is just doing all the

443
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,950
testing tasks versus coaching develop and helping developers on how to write

444
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,990
better tests in the first place so these conferences are helping to teach

445
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:28,430
and optimize for the world that people shouldn't be in is that what you know

446
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,950
I'm not saying that at all I'm saying people are sharing their experiences on

447
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:37,980
what they're doing and this is in a vague summary what they're doing I think

448
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:41,180
people are figuring out how to ship software faster and they're trying

449
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:47,900
different things to see what sticks okay and that's for the practitioners for

450
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:51,580
what I see from a lot of consultants is there's a separation between development

451
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:56,580
testing if you look at this I forget is this ISO 2 1 1 9 I might get the

452
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,540
number wrong but this there was a big hull blue last year about this the new

453
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,980
ISO software testing standard and is that the thing you quizzed me on a few

454
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:09,500
that was the IST QB thing okay thinking about this testing standard is

455
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,180
that it fundamentally from the very beginning assumes that testing is a

456
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,920
completely different task from software development so there's just it just

457
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,970
doesn't work in my world and probably for the world of a lot of people it

458
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:25,890
just assumes that testing is this thing that's done after development is

459
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:33,130
complete and that's just not a world that I don't I do know and I've realized

460
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:36,530
and acknowledge that there's a chunk of the world that lives there and that's

461
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:42,440
fine but that's not the way I ever ever want to make software there's a role for

462
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:49,880
say final validation final quality assurance right there's there's a lot of

463
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,680
people throughout manufacturing throughout software that have the the QA title

464
00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:03,660
happened then no in it in it the amount of work there really should be what at

465
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:09,820
most 1% of total time spent on the product I'm making up numbers of course

466
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:15,780
but it should be much smaller than it is true that 43.7% of all statistics are

467
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:23,380
made up I heard it was uh it's rising oh well yeah all right so you traveled

468
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:29,500
for 40 hours it took me a long time to get home maybe close to 50 hours to do

469
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:35,380
an hour presentation and then you came back and plus a bunch of free food in

470
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:41,380
Europe then you came back and went to riot I did I was invited down to visit

471
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,940
riot who and I don't know if you've played League of Legends no I played a

472
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,020
little bit and I've played it like ten times since I've been there because it's

473
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,500
I'd and I'll tell you why in a minute it is crazy I'm sure at least one of the

474
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,500
three have played League of Legends I got to go on a tour of their facility I

475
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,670
don't know how much of this is top secret or anything but I'll take my

476
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:09,350
chances I had met them a couple people down there a while back and I just

477
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,950
wanted to kind of check the place out because it's it's the most popular game

478
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,710
in the world I think they have they have world championships where they can

479
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:24,060
fill a soccer stadium full of people watching people play this video game it

480
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,620
is just crazy they have their own arena trying to figure out what rock I've lived

481
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,980
under I've never even heard of this game you're not helping the cause here

482
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,380
man yeah so they have their own arena across the street their place is built

483
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,220
on their new place is they got from Fox Studios so it's on the set of the

484
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:50,160
old 24 so like Jack Bowers old office is still there cool images is

485
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:57,100
it's a it's basically a world of Warcraft competitor then ish but not really I don't

486
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,500
want to go all the way into explaining and check it out but it's really well

487
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:08,820
thought out and I think just done really well then there I love their

488
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:16,780
business model where they don't have ads you can't pay to make your to increase

489
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,740
your ability of winning like you can't like buy a bunch like you can't money

490
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,140
won't make you win the game only skill will but you can buy it people they

491
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,580
make them money people buy skins and and things for the overall there's a

492
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,900
rotating list of champions you can choose from if you want to have one

493
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:40,390
always available you can buy that one but and they make good money doing that

494
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:46,150
and they're massively popular it is just crazy how wild the world is for

495
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,430
this thing and I was asking about monitoring and the cool thing was I asked

496
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:53,790
him all my typical questions like I was looking for like what's something they

497
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,550
haven't thought of yet and they're pretty much you know they didn't I

498
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:59,910
couldn't really surprise them with anything I'm talking about monitoring a

499
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,350
little bit oh come check this out and I see this like this route looks like

500
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:09,350
NASA where their operations team works is like showing like stuff all it's

501
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,910
really cool I don't want to give I don't want to give away any secrets or

502
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:15,990
anything but it was I was impressed with the facility I already violated my

503
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:19,390
NDA but I think I'm I think I'm probably in least in the great I'll be

504
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:24,830
vague but very recently have you have you visited one of our data centers have

505
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:31,000
you done that trip I've done the Queen Sea data center trip yeah just did

506
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,920
something similar and yeah I totally understand like the the NASA monitoring

507
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,920
yeah it's really cool right I was impressed just to monitor electricity yeah

508
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,640
check me out the dinner metal but some cold people there it was it was a fun

509
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,200
trip was worth it to go meet those folks down there and get an idea what their

510
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,520
place looked like it's pretty cool we're either to give a talk or a field

511
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:00,640
trip man most of sort of a field trip okay just meeting some people to quick

512
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,640
take a Monday off quick quick trip to LA to and it was cold in LA was a bummer

513
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,820
it was windy cold in LA is what 70 no it was like in maybe maybe less than

514
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:20,830
60 ah that's a spring here all right we don't have anything from the mailbag do

515
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:30,420
we we had something from Percy but we didn't write it down right so I want to

516
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:35,420
ask okay so we'll do an episode of stupid people at Microsoft I got two to

517
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:41,420
cover one is right you have a big truck right I do a big red truck all right so

518
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,830
we call it Clifford Clifford the big red truck that's fantastic I have a

519
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:52,630
so I don't understand is people with these here's my my wonderment people with

520
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,670
these hundred thousand dollar SUVs your truck isn't that much but no these

521
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:01,040
massive you know they're like guys before wheel drive which is made for

522
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:08,080
going off-road yet they slow to like one one hundredth of a mile an hour to

523
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:13,730
go over a speed bump that I don't understand okay is it and I have to

524
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,930
imagine help you with every single one of them has a coffee cup filled to the very

525
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:26,010
very brim with my truck I do not even pause for speed bumps I fly bumps in my

526
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:32,310
frickin Prius there there's one you know what I'm talking about right so I'm

527
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,190
gonna stop I'm gonna ease the front tires over okay okay I'm gonna go forward

528
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:47,470
yeah I just go I don't actually I know I'm the way here on the way here this

529
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,510
morning there was a guy in a truck you know the ramp down to the parking lot

530
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:58,970
ramp down to the app so there's this four-story ramp to an underground parking

531
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,290
lot near the building that we're in right now and they have speed bumps and

532
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:09,050
there was this guy who was in a three Ford 350 which is a bigger more heavy

533
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:16,300
duty truck than mine driving over the speed bumps in the way you described and

534
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:25,190
I'm just like oh my god move move what are you doing yeah all right hey we talked

535
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:30,430
a lot on this podcast about systems thinking did we we managed to have a

536
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:35,630
point this podcast not in this one previous oh right episode yes we don't

537
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:41,350
have a point this is the stuff Brett Naland did but I was thinking about you

538
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:44,630
when you have a challenge when you want to whether it's an organizational change

539
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:49,950
or a or any sort of change you want to do at work or a project or anything yep I

540
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:56,440
find it important to at least take a little bit and whether it's a my map or

541
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,600
some notes or sketch or some conversations I don't believe in analysis

542
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:04,600
paralysis like thinking through every possible plan B and plan C before going

543
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:10,290
but I do believe in thinking at least a little bit in advance about what are the

544
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,810
implications of this let me kind of walk through this in my head this would be

545
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:18,850
a long process so recently and so I I live my life so I'm fighting a little

546
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,490
battle right now where someone I work with wanted to make a big change that

547
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,010
let's go ahead and do it let's make this change okay everybody's on board let's

548
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,530
go go I'm thinking there are some big implications here that you haven't

549
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,980
thought of and like huge like the part he wanted to do is all going hello about

550
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,900
by far the easiest part it's like the tip of the iceberg he wants to take

551
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,440
care of and I'm looking at and every time I think about what's underneath I

552
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,760
go we got to do this it's probably not that bad oh you have this part oh

553
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:58,060
shoot and that connects to this and now we have to do this so it's just

554
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,660
fascinating to me how and again I don't want to get stuck in like thinking

555
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:07,820
through every possible thing but and I'm being very abstract about this in case I

556
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,540
know he's not one of the three it's interesting though this isn't like the

557
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,610
first time in my career I've seen someone who should know better push for

558
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:22,410
change without thinking through the implications of it I think the reality is

559
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,090
is system thinkers are rare I don't think they're that I think I don't really

560
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,890
don't think they're that rare especially in a tech company I know not

561
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:36,490
everyone is I think they are I think I think you have people who go all

562
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,240
right we needed we need a abstract strategy and they gloss over the

563
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,720
details I think there's a lot of people who are very deeply detail focused

564
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,360
who often just execute and execute and they don't actually even know what gold

565
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,600
they're trying to achieve and I think the people who can bridge those two are

566
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,240
extremely rare that's my experience yeah and I guess and I see a lot of the same

567
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,520
parallels I talked a lot about with the right guys about teams moving to unified

568
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,160
engineering and agile and you can't just decide that okay we're gonna be

569
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,400
agile we're gonna do this and this and this you need to think about through

570
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,920
why and what does it mean and what does it change and how do we function

571
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,080
differently and there's just a lot more pieces in there than deciding okay we're

572
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:28,630
agile now we're doing scrum and we're not writing in word documentation yeah I

573
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:37,790
mean it that started up what 15 years ago and it's has led to you inventing

574
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:43,590
fragile right I think that any I think there's Alan's I need to make a list of

575
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:46,830
these along with you used to automate 100% of the tests should be automated

576
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:51,670
little bit of just a teeny bit of a tautology there but there is something

577
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:59,080
else that I think every team needs after define team but needs a systems thinker

578
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,600
to be successful you need someone who can someone whose job it is to think about

579
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,960
how all the pieces fit together what the implications are of any sort of change it

580
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:14,000
was one of the pieces of feedback that we got from redfin is one of the

581
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,200
questions that didn't get asked apparently was why is Brent suggesting

582
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,410
that we hire an agile coach and by the way it's exactly for that reason it's you

583
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:30,250
need to have someone I mean he right and I would I would if you want to bootstrap

584
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:36,960
just hire one further hypothesize that if you look at any successful team at

585
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,320
any company in the world they have that person that can that is looking at the

586
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,120
big picture thinking other pieces fit together and that may be someone on

587
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:50,200
the team may be an architect maybe the leader but I think success requires that

588
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,640
someone is at least ongoing success requires that someone is looking at the

589
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:04,420
big picture of things it's the the desire to bounce from fire to fire is

590
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,180
seductive right it is hey Alan I don't have time to think through this whole

591
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:13,850
thing this is something that I need to do right now and then they don't

592
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:18,170
realize that that causes a chain of events that the new thing that they're

593
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:25,770
going to be asking you to do six months from now is not only directly caused by

594
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:31,010
that thing that they didn't think about but actually reverses that thing I've

595
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:36,410
seen this happen over and over and over and over let me close with a story yeah a

596
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:43,360
parable if you will so Alan's parables guys walking out to the river and sees

597
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,190
someone drowning it dies into the river to save them and then there's two more

598
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:53,390
people drowning in the river so two more people run out and run out to save them

599
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,990
and it and there's more and more people floating down the river people the

600
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,030
people are running out to the river to save them bring them to shore and they

601
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,310
see someone walking upstream they said where are you going we need your help

602
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,970
I'm going upstream to find out who's throwing all these people in the river

603
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:16,880
I use a similar metaphor I talk about if we're busy putting out if we're

604
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,520
constantly busy putting out forest fires maybe someone should move ahead and

605
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,360
find the three-year-old who's been given the lighter I like my story back

606
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,860
all right I think we're out of time and we should call it a day what do you

607
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:42,390
think sounds good I am Alan and I am Brent good thing we know our names all

608
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:48,190
right thank you for listening to episode 30 of A B testing we'll see you next time
