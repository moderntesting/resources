1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:18,340
morning everybody. Howdy. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're back for Alan Brent testing. Sometimes

2
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:23,300
known as A B testing. Yeah I don't. I like A B testing better. I'm gonna edit that not.

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:35,010
How you been, Brent? I am pooped. I am working. I'm essentially, my brain is working

4
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:42,910
seems like 20 hours a day with school and work. That's right. This is your last, you're almost done

5
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:50,050
with school, right? I have, once I get done with this class, I have one more and I cannot wait.

6
00:00:50,690 --> 00:01:00,820
I don't regret the decision at all. It has really helped my career but you know it's time for it

7
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:11,520
it's time for it to be done. Okay. All right then. It's time to get back into industry problems

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:18,770
and not the combination of both. I get that. Yep. How's your kid doing at college? He's doing great.

9
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:27,680
He's uh he's getting straight A's. The the only issue he has right now, he's not doing proper

10
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,520
financial planning. Like every other 18 year old heading off to college in the world? He's 19 now.

11
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:42,320
Yeah. It was a generalization. Yeah, no that's that's true. So he's he's figured out how to live within

12
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:51,150
his means paycheck to paycheck and I'm like yes son. You need to buy your own master's degree.

13
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,980
How's that gonna get you there? Did I tell you what I did with my son? I don't think so. No.

14
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,600
So Washington what is it the 529 plan to Microsoft or the Washington get program?

15
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah. So I've paid. I'll let you finish. Go ahead. So I've paid for his the deal I have with him for

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,480
college is I have bought enough credits on the Washington get program that will pay for his

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,460
bachelor's degree all the way through and his first year I'm paying for his dormitory

18
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:38,460
and his food at the dormitory and then the last part is for the next four years I'm sending him

19
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,970
five hundred dollars a month but I've informed him that's all. Everything else whatever else he

20
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:54,270
wants to do with his life is up to him. It's very similar so my father was permanently wounded in the

21
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:04,750
Vietnam War and so that plan is very similar to the plan I went through. I bolted on a second

22
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,470
undergrad degree. I ended up to be able to afford that. I ended up having to get a job to cover

23
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:19,120
rent and food and books and all of that. So I'm making him go through a similar experience

24
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,320
and we'll see what happens. I think that's good. My parents didn't have such a formalized plan

25
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,040
but it was definitely a tapered plan for my freshman year. They paid for because I lived in

26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,230
the dorm with the meal plan so they paid for that plus my tuition and then the next year

27
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:45,940
I moved off campus which is much cheaper and they paid for my rent which is like a hundred

28
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,740
bucks a month. I'm old. Rent and tuition. No but you went to Central. But then I bought probably

29
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:59,310
still a hundred bucks a month. I bought my actually the because I'm on the alumni board there

30
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:07,310
the enrollment is so high that it is they are struggling to find a place for everyone to live.

31
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,880
They're they're they're bursting at the seams there so it's supply and demand means those prices

32
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,560
are going up unfortunately. So I think my next year anyway they paid the rent of my tuition

33
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,400
but I started paying for my own food so I got a job. The next year was actually the last two

34
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,480
years was tuition only for undergrad and then grad school is like a total that was that was all me.

35
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,880
Did you do all your degrees at Central? I did. Okay. So that that worked out pretty well and I

36
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,040
did kind of learn we didn't turn the heat on very like we kept the the thermostat because heat was

37
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,630
expensive it's electric heat. I remember keeping the thermostat at about 45 degrees

38
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,960
so the heat would only come on if we were going to die.

39
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:02,960
And that kept the bill down a little bit but it was fine because really I was so busy all I did

40
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,860
was sleep there so I'd come back and throw some food down and dive under the covers. Sure.

41
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:17,140
And then I've also discovered when I looked into I have 529s for my kids but Washington's is just

42
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:24,850
awful. I haven't compared I like the fact that I could pre-pay for all the units. Yeah so I

43
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:30,210
ended up doesn't that require I can't remember but this is in the financial planning show but

44
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,490
there were some deals about using that for in-state colleges and I can't remember the details on why I

45
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:41,890
didn't like the Washington plan. You can use no you can use it either way and so the one thing

46
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:50,640
I like about it so it can be used out of state the the but there is a doling of the units so

47
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:59,970
they'll only give out x number of units every year. Like for example my son had applied to

48
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:07,020
several schools up and down the west coast. The only school that didn't accept him was UW.

49
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:15,490
So he was when he found out that San Diego had accepted him he was super pumped up and I said

50
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:22,140
okay well here's the deal son you got to make a choice. I've already put down the money for

51
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:30,450
your bachelors so you could use this and go to San Diego and pay for one year and then the rest

52
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:39,700
of it is up to you or you can you know go to any school in Washington and and cover the whole

53
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,310
degree. So it ended up being a this is worth a little bit of a discussion much of the same

54
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:53,150
mind as you given the way I went to school we have a nice healthy amount saved for kids education

55
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,280
we'll see where they want to go. My wife is very much that well what if they want to go to Stanford

56
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,360
I said well they then they should get a freaking scholarship or student loan. Yeah exactly I'm not

57
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:12,140
going to write and what you'll find is you do a little bit of research is even you might say oh

58
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:18,140
tuition at x school is this number this amount of money no one pays full price in some way there's

59
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:25,180
either there's there's grants there's loans there's this and that but what I wind this back to is the

60
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,860
Malcolm Gladwell this was an outliers I believe I think it's an outliers where long story short

61
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:36,610
you should go to the best school where you can be in the top 20% versus trying to go to the most

62
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,890
competitive school where like say that the story was some woman top of her class straight A's plus

63
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,650
extra credit all the way through high school goes to some top medical school filled with people

64
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,210
exactly like her all of a sudden she's not the best anymore she gets depressed drops out of medical

65
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:59,570
school not that that one example would would dictate the norm but they do find is that if you

66
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,370
momentum is important it is it is that's exactly it so I'm a big fan of that and I think

67
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,730
we'll see what happens I got time I got time yeah it is the first one goes to high school

68
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:21,820
next year yeah I I have a sophomore now in high school for me it's it's the need to

69
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,780
begin to learn life in my view my philosophy is is when they go off to college right it's not

70
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:37,660
playground it's the in my view part of the point of college is to really solidify taking control of

71
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:44,380
you've heard me rant about this before I think too many people both in the university system

72
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:51,180
parents and students want to treat the university as the vocational school and I think while you're

73
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,350
learning some skills that may help you in your career it's the education is really at the meta

74
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:06,510
level it's life skills it's financial planning skills it's how to live how to become independent

75
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:14,580
in sort of a safe and connected environment there's so much of that that happens in your

76
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:23,940
four ish years at university that goes to me as far as a lifetime goes far far beyond anything you

77
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:30,560
can learn in a classroom yeah my oldest and I mean it was super explicit when once we finally

78
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:39,040
walked through all the finances and he understood it he said so dad what happens if you know something

79
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:49,600
comes up and and um I can't pay for it I'm like I don't know I guess uh you you see what credit

80
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,800
cards you could apply to or you can see if you can get a loan or something I don't know like I

81
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,200
basically made it very clear that he'll have my empathy and I'll support him up into the point of

82
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:08,160
where I bail him out yes but not including that point one more example of a skill I learned

83
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,120
that's been applicable for up to this day and then we'll get on with the podcast is

84
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,600
you can live on one you learn to buy top ramen and cheap bread I used to buy like the

85
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,440
dale bread and make uh uh and some eggs and make like uh three weeks with the french toast and

86
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:33,600
just freeze it I can put them in the toaster in the morning but what I learned is I'll give you

87
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,060
the example tell you what I learned from it is one I worked at Domino's so as long as I didn't

88
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,780
get sick of pizza I could eat pizza anytime I worked there's dinner to care if I could make it

89
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,900
till dinner there's food uh also what I learned is I worked in the music building one of my jobs

90
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,820
I delivered pizza and I worked in the music building as sort of the the building monitor

91
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:59,500
locking doors opening up rooms things like that making sure because the professors all went home

92
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,340
at you know five or six o'clock the building was open till 11 someone had to make sure it didn't

93
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,820
burn down nobody was fighting or partying or whatever in there uh so in that job I was nice

94
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,220
to people I was a service provider I would open open doors and let them into classrooms whatever

95
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,340
they needed to do even though it was my job and I was paid for it I wasn't above bartering

96
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:26,220
for maybe not even direct bartering say for example someone said hey the practice rooms are

97
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:30,940
all full can you let me into a classroom to practice there's a music department of course

98
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:39,180
and technically for a small fee technically no but the thing is you don't you don't want to make

99
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:46,860
it contingent because that's and in transference to the real life in advance if that's contingent

100
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:53,500
then it's like weird but it's like possibly illegal yeah so instead the way you put it is

101
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,860
I'm not supposed to but I've been there let me go let you in this room please make sure it's locked

102
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,340
when you leave and check in with me when you take off so I know no double check it just just a

103
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,990
little bit of you know covering my butt a little bit but letting him in there and then maybe they

104
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:14,110
go to leave and they I remember told him check in with me so they come check in with me I said

105
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,430
I asked like just conversation where you hit it now oh I'm headed over to the door I headed over to

106
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:23,390
the meal hall to get some food because they're on the meal plan I go hey uh if you remember can

107
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:30,420
you bring me back an apple or are you going to the deli for dinner great uh do you want to

108
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,100
can you grab me half a sandwich for you that'd be awesome and they would so again if not you

109
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,940
don't directly position it as tit for tat like I'll only give you the room if you bring me some

110
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:49,250
food later but just be nice to people golden rule and then conversationally see if you can

111
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,610
they'll want to do something for you but also it's pay it forward in a way but it works when

112
00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:01,120
you're broke and you're looking for ways to eat that don't cost any money but it also don't and

113
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,750
I think an important life lesson there is don't be afraid to ask for what you want sure but worse

114
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:13,870
and sometimes they'd say no I said I said ah I don't know they don't like us to bring food out of the

115
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:21,250
out of the out of the cafeteria and I wouldn't come back with well I'm not supposed to open

116
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,170
this door for you dick you just you just kind of play it and that's no you're playing that's sort

117
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:32,370
of you're playing the probabilities that sort of negotiation is really important you know even

118
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:38,770
the professional world I will cover for you not thinking of anything I want like I'll do

119
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,410
something for you at work professionally I will put together a report for you I'll prepare something

120
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:49,490
for it some way I'm helping you out I'm not doing it with an immediate or even necessarily a long-term

121
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:56,370
idea if I want something back but when I do need something from you I will remember and I will

122
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,610
make a connection to make sure we remember that time together and that may make you more inclined

123
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:07,840
to help me out as well the actually that that's kind of one of the ways I've built my career is

124
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:20,540
basically giving if people ask for help I will give help and then after about three times where

125
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:31,420
I've giving you help and and you've rejected me I will suddenly find myself too busy to help you

126
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:39,360
the fourth time I don't know if I get that I'm it's essentially it's essentially what I want to do

127
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,840
is I want to go okay let's build partnerships and a partnership is somebody who cares about your goal

128
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:55,040
at the same time you care about theirs so it's about working together to build win-wins for both

129
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,960
sides and I call them relationships but I think you want to build those relationships and mine were

130
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,280
you know the example I gave was very much it wasn't a tip wasn't like a tip for tap thing

131
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:11,360
but it was within a three or four hour period but often in the professional world building

132
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,000
these relationships happens over weeks or months or even years yeah and and I just believe in I

133
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,120
want to treat other people like I want to be treated so I'm going to do things for them really

134
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,420
with I can't say with no thought in mind that I may get something back but it's not it's not

135
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,060
like that directly it's like I want to help you out because I like helping people and in doing

136
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,660
that we build a relationship which I know at some point I may want to draw something back from that

137
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,740
relationship yeah no I get what you're just saying so I do a similar thing it's it's difficult

138
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:55,860
to describe but when I realize that here's how I feel is if I'm helping people out and then

139
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:02,540
and then repeatedly you show that you're not willing to help me out I start to feel like all

140
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:12,700
the help I've done for you before was just you manipulating me no I don't that's I'm gonna try

141
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:19,260
hard not to blame that on Microsoft's ultra competitive culture but I'm still like helping you

142
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:26,670
if you if you don't like hell if if I'm working with someone who doesn't want to help me or maybe

143
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:34,190
they don't want to help anybody that is a flaw in their human nature but I don't look at it as I'm

144
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,990
gonna stop helping you I if I have a priority having to help someone else who's going to be

145
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,470
more appreciative of it maybe but I'm not going to get I'm there there is a down that path I am

146
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:51,870
at times what I call afflicted with the white knight syndrome so I do there there have been

147
00:16:51,870 --> 00:17:00,190
times where people who I would say are abject opponents or even enemies that I got themselves

148
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:10,800
in a real bad bind and the the small bit of my human soul that remains doesn't allow me to

149
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:19,100
reject them in those situations anyway all right we do a podcast hey hello listeners we're just

150
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:25,660
about ready to get started with the podcast about that yeah this episode of motley fool brought to

151
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:33,020
you by Albert and Burt wait that's kind of the same name now very good Albert no I can

152
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:39,740
al and Burt a be finance it's a b test life's what's up with you in the noon they wanted to

153
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:47,810
never mind a couple quick announcements I've been slacking off not slacking off I have tapered

154
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:55,540
back my conference attendance dramatically over the last few years somehow through that

155
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:02,740
idea out the window and I will be in Moscow Russia first week in December for the Heisenberg

156
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:11,570
conference yeah we're we're almost up we're almost at the the prediction episode and I think

157
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,090
last year's predictions you predicted that you would attend only one conference so I think that

158
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:24,530
one may go out the window no no it's only what that's but that's only one in 2018 that I spoke

159
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:31,600
somewhere else in 2018 did I I think 2018 hasn't started 2017 I mean but I think the only conference

160
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,200
I spoke at in 2017 will be Heisenberg I don't think I did I go to the conference in 27 the online

161
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,300
conference I did the online test conference I did I did you are correct I did too but then in 2018

162
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,620
I will be at test bash Brighton in March okay I love test bash that was the last conference I spoke at

163
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,140
test bash Philadelphia was the last test bash I last conference I spoke at in front of people

164
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:07,840
and then I'm going back to star east in May talking about tools for testing a lot of web tools

165
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,800
I'll go over haven't quite figured them all out yet but let me rewind a little bit so Moscow

166
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm giving two talks I'm giving a completely redone version of technical testing and I like

167
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,000
it because they asked if I could do the closing keynote with that talk and I love that because

168
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,840
that means I can tweak the talk based on what I see in the first two days of the conference so

169
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,160
that's going to be nice it will be very good I like it when I can do that and then I'm also giving

170
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:44,240
a talk on test automation where I will give all of my usual rants and also I'm going to be using

171
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:52,290
interactive testing using remember numbers my little test step my little oh man yeah yeah

172
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:57,970
I'm gonna pull out numbers I had to find the code for that and do some do a little bit of work

173
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:08,590
there but numbers will be in play and then at test bash in Brighton you should put numbers up

174
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:16,880
on github it is on github okay put a link to it okay let me finish I will link to it once I finish

175
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,640
this last round of edits all right uh what was I talking about test bash oh before I talk about test

176
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,620
bash Brighton actually I'll finish talking about test bash Brighton and then I'll go back so at

177
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,660
test bash Brighton I'm giving a talk called experiences in modern testing I kind of want to

178
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:38,820
change it to adventures in modern testing but I think I can keep it as experiences and speaking

179
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:48,980
of ministry of testing just last week I cheated on Brent a little bit as I usually do and I recorded

180
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:55,620
a desert island disc this great podcast from Neil Stud at ministry of testing doing a

181
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,420
podcast where he talks to testers about test things and the five discs they bring to a desert

182
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,740
island with them and I grew up you know going to tower records every week and they had this

183
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,540
publication that had desert island discs so I've always been very infatuated with the topic

184
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:16,020
and you're gonna bring a book too and you'll have to listen to that episode coming out

185
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,630
December 1st if you want to know what my songs and book are I'm not going to tell you

186
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:32,030
I don't remember them being a book no the book is an addition okay so it was fun I really put thought

187
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:37,550
into it and chose songs not only that I could listen to a thousand times not getting tired of

188
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:45,310
them but trying to span some different genres so I could uh a little bit so I could I really

189
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,830
thought like if I was really stuck and I could listen to these songs probably not on a disc or a

190
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:57,950
turntable but like the only five songs on my forever rechargeable mp3 player it would be those

191
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:05,280
five songs uh mp3 player that only could store five songs yes probably would have a pretty good

192
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,740
solar cell yeah that's what I'm thinking that's I'm I'm gonna ask you a question yeah and we spent

193
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,340
a whole episode on this another time but I want to see how succinct you can be one of the questions

194
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:24,140
I answered for indirectly maybe directly for Neil and uh something I'll talk about a lot at Test Bash

195
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:32,820
and Brighton is just what exactly is a modern tester so Brent can you define a modern tester

196
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:40,820
as we've been talking about on the podcast yes you said to be succinct so we did a episode

197
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,550
someday I gotta get to maybe I'll do that over the Christmas break is get to titling the damn

198
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:54,190
episodes we did an episode on that topic yeah just a little while back to me a modern tester

199
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:01,970
is more concerned about the business requirements and the functional requirements is more concerned

200
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:10,980
about actual customer quality and uses uh data to derive it okay that's their motivation

201
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:17,380
it's not a definition per se I think the definition that we've that we use here is still

202
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:26,580
applicable right that they use modern techniques to accelerate the achieve achievement of

203
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:33,950
shippable quality okay give me an example of some modern techniques data analysis good I put that as

204
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:39,230
a high level so now everything else I'm thinking of is a sub so let me give you the the definition

205
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,590
I gave Neil and we can pick that apart okay have you ever read the Crispin Gregory uh Agile

206
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:52,510
testing books I have okay so do I remember them so what I said to Neil it's very much like the Agile

207
00:23:52,510 --> 00:24:00,750
tester that uh Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory describe with a couple modifications one is a heavy

208
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,710
emphasis on data analysis as part of how they do their job yes and the other one is a much

209
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:13,070
deeper level of or deeper and broader level of coaching of testing and quality techniques

210
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:21,150
across the team they're much more of an expert in testing and quality than what is described in

211
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:27,870
those books the other thing I would say that's that's critical in my view is a focus on

212
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:38,350
we we shift the needle more towards reacting than preventing elaborate please uh we do not schedule

213
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:46,110
the two month long test pass to yeah and and before ship and to be clear that is not part of Agile

214
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:56,240
testing either no no so so yeah it's so my baseline of of its Agile testing with a few other

215
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,400
areas of emphasis I think remains accurate but definitely absolutely those those things of two

216
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,660
month long test passes 45 page test reports risk analysis reports actually that's not those those

217
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,420
still exist I was backtracking but this is a discussion of what they what's been observed

218
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:23,810
after the product has been released right so so there's still some preventative aspect to it

219
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:30,370
um and it's it's trying to communicate this this balance that's let me throw this out rather than

220
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:37,040
trying to test quality in which may be a bad way to put it because I don't think anyone doing a test

221
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:42,480
last approach thinks of themselves doing that but I think our listeners understand so rather than test

222
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:51,100
quality in it's more of we're trying to understand quality consistently yeah actually you know what

223
00:25:51,100 --> 00:26:00,140
instead of trying to I like I like this framing so instead of trying to get the product to be the

224
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:12,500
prescriptive definition of quality we're trying to discover quality and shift the product in that

225
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:20,770
direction I like that idea of discover quality it's better than my understand uh no it's similar

226
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:32,670
right it's the um so I think about we haven't talked about it yet but I think about one of the

227
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:43,230
slides that I showed recently which is essentially the only person qualified to speak to quality of

228
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:51,310
your product is the customer themselves and that's one of the that's one of the ways the modern tester

229
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:58,350
tries to understand or discover quality and then help shift the direction of the product in my head

230
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,510
because that ties back to Eric Reese saying you don't get value from your engineering effort

231
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:08,190
until it's in the hands of customers and then I'm but even then that's not guaranteed yeah so in my

232
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:16,270
head though I'm shoving lean startup lean analytics and agile testing into a into a ball and unfolding

233
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:23,020
into a modern tester yeah and then you sprinkle it with a little test experience and I think

234
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,820
you're exactly right and then maybe a little bit of Jerry Weinberg becoming a technical leader which

235
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:32,380
I think is a very good book on how to coach and consult with humility trust and respect

236
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,440
yeah I think Jerry's we've been quoting him for years he's he has sort of directed the

237
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,500
principles around modern tester before we've even thought of using these two words together

238
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:55,890
I mean he's been saying quality is defined by the customer for decades now I think yeah quality is

239
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:02,400
value to some person okay so what else what else that's good I think we're in I didn't go too far

240
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:08,080
off track in my definition I think one of the things I'll want to do for I haven't even started

241
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,200
on my slides yet for test bash Brighton sorry for anyone there who thinks I should have but they

242
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,200
they've been forming in my head and I think one thing is important is you know we've been talking

243
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,360
about modern tester here for a while I want to kind of define it and then dive into those

244
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,400
definitions so you can imagine the talk is maybe a definition of a modern tester and then diving

245
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:35,280
into examples and so are you officially stating that the A.B. testing podcast is now going to

246
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:42,030
create the sixth school of testing there are no schools of testing so shut up let me repeat that

247
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:48,430
slowly there are no schools of testing except for those defined by people who want to differentiate

248
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:56,850
themselves I completely agree I just wanted to make your neck veins bulge I'm fine I'm it's

249
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:04,370
funny I don't get mad as often anymore I'm not so close to the edge as I used to be maybe

250
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:10,530
10 months ago and longer yeah I am I'm a little bit of the crotchety old man too like I

251
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:18,130
I believe in my ways and I think my ideas are sound and I don't mind saying what I believe

252
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,410
and don't believe in just recently I actually saw my last post on the worrisome world of words

253
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,730
and I kind of made fun of some of the semantic argue not named fun I dove into this is worth

254
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:38,130
bringing up here as well because some people listen more than read but takeaway was that

255
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:44,980
in the test community there's a lot of focus on oh this word means this and checking versus

256
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:53,540
testing manual versus human etc etc and while those can be an interesting discussion and they can help

257
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:02,980
convey some nuance in meeting I realized that as long as the team is aligned on mission and purpose

258
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,700
we know what we're doing and why we're doing it and I poked back to Simon Sinek's work on

259
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:13,140
start with why don't if you ever read that right it's it's like yeah if you start with why you're

260
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:19,860
doing it it explains it it's so much easier to get the team behind it we talked about organizational

261
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,060
change etc so if we start with why we're doing what we're doing what is our goal why do we care

262
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:30,020
about it and get the team aligned on mission and purpose the words you describe whether what

263
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,580
you're doing is called smoke testing or checking or stress testing or whatever just don't matter

264
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:41,060
or fuzzy bunny yeah fuzzy bunny testing I'm doing fuzzy bunny testing does it matter because instead

265
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:47,140
those things can be important at a much lower level like I'm going to do some you might say

266
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,620
I'm going to do some soap testing like I've never done it because I don't never bother to look up

267
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,020
what it means but it's a word that's out there I'll ask what does that mean okay I get it no

268
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,940
problem I'm not going to worry about a name because I know it's driving towards our goal and purpose

269
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:06,420
anyway rewinding the tangent factory back in one thing I wanted to talk about as we begin the

270
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:15,140
podcast is I had my entire team in town last week for what we called the unity services test summit

271
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:24,000
USTS about 40 people here a ton of fun more positive feedback honestly than I expected

272
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,400
so I'm really happy people thought the balance was good we had one an overview of all of the

273
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,520
services at unity because nobody really knew what they all were presented by people across the team

274
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,920
spread out over a few days we had some time to talk with each other we had a full day with a

275
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:48,800
few interruptions of plus a few hours of what we call hack projects this idea of doing uh what

276
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:55,550
they call them at Microsoft I forgot hackathons hackathon this this idea of doing a hack project

277
00:31:55,550 --> 00:32:02,510
is very much part of the unity culture there's a hack week every year there are little hack days

278
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,070
here and there I wanted to make sure one that we could have some hack time together work on some

279
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:13,870
projects and that to kind of kick start some cross team projects which would also facilitate

280
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,190
knowledge of knowing who people are and it worked out great people work from different it wasn't

281
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:24,510
just with a few exceptions it wasn't just like one team clicking together on a project it was uh

282
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:30,830
it was definitely cross organizational efforts excited about that then of course we had a few

283
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:36,700
guest speakers we had alam rvold from google talking about life as a productivity engineer

284
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:42,530
which was good he's technical title is test engineer but he talked about what he does which

285
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:48,690
is very little testing what did he do here alam rvold was security in office and here being

286
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:55,890
microsoft for those who can't see the room we're in and then uh a little known principal data

287
00:32:55,890 --> 00:33:03,170
scientist manager from microsoft burt jerson sorry brent jensen also talked about uh what

288
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:11,460
was your topic on uh building building uh i think it was called building a data-centric culture for

289
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,700
modern tester or something like that i forget the title all right something about using data more

290
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,260
which is a principle i've been driving into my team feedback on that was very good what would

291
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:26,500
what did you think about that brent i i had a blast i had a blast if there was anything i wish

292
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,860
i could have done differently is show up a little earlier to watch even more of the

293
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:39,060
presentations uh because i found that picking on members of your team actually helped the

294
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:45,810
presentation yeah we had someone bring up the the infamous software testing cupcake anti-pattern

295
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:53,820
yep yep but even then before then you had someone talking about you know the business criteria

296
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:01,340
and so i was able to weave that into my talk to make it a bit more context sensitive

297
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:09,580
because uh the the deck itself which uh is available on the slack channel so if you're not on the slack

298
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:15,020
channel one of the three dot slack dot com you can hit me at twitter at alan page and i'll give

299
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:23,710
you permission yep um i'll need your email address you can dm me but it it it's a generic deck but

300
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:29,630
it's missing sort of specific context for the particular business of a particular company and

301
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,990
so getting some context and being able to present it and then tie the dots together that was good

302
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:44,110
yeah it was good uh one of the things and i love both you and alan were able to re-emphasize a lot

303
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:48,830
of points i've been making with the team over and over and i definitely saw the takeaway if

304
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:54,190
people really get that oh yeah data is important we're going to dive in here one of the hack

305
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:59,630
groups that i sat in on i i kind of wrote i i floated a little bit but one of the hack groups

306
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:06,430
i sat in on was they called it a study group to look at our existing data and provide some

307
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:12,990
extra guidance some tutorials etc so we sat down with the we have a used presto a sql engine on

308
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:19,150
top of our data store okay i started poking through and we found some really interesting

309
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:24,670
insights which was fun i think insights are addictive we also found a lot of data quality

310
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:31,710
issues yeah so the fun part there is is every group gave a presentation and i talked a little

311
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:39,230
bit about data quality in our presentation and i got a little bit of applause when i said

312
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:44,110
i can't remember how i did it it was very spontaneous but i said data quality is an issue

313
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:52,400
and we do not have a data quality team blank faces welcome everyone to the unity data quality team

314
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,400
so they understand that not only do they have to use it but they have to start driving

315
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,680
like look these these column names don't make sense the data you're collecting here is not gdpr

316
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,280
compliant these uh this needs to be cleaned up or these these tables should be separate these

317
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,800
tables should be joined these tables should be in this schema they get that now at least it at

318
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,400
varying levels across the org so be careful with that be careful with that because you can

319
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,760
that is a problem that no matter how much energy you spend on it will never get fixed no i i

320
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,880
understand that and you're never going to get it perfect but they know enough the the the tipping

321
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,000
point that i think they're over now is they know enough about it to go to to go to their

322
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,400
teams they're working with and go hey i can't answer this question via data or when i try to

323
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,520
answer this question via data i get this column gives me this information which isn't helpful

324
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,430
so was there anything practice so take away i'm curious takeaways from your team specifically on

325
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:02,590
mine so you talked to that there were some philosophical principles that i delivered that

326
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,510
all were aligned with things that you've already communicated was there anything in

327
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:13,940
addition or anything um concrete and practical that you think your team took away uh there's one

328
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,760
thing i was just thinking of is yeah the the approach of how to think about the problem you're

329
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:27,680
trying to address and strung it through into into the to what data needs to be there i presented

330
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,920
that but it might have been at that point in time too much content no they get it and i want

331
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,160
off a little bit in a tangent talking about our data quality issue but i think it's really at a

332
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,120
meta level they to reel myself back in is a much greater understanding of how important and critical

333
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:50,560
using data is to our evolution and growth or growth and evolution definitely lots of comments

334
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,560
about that i asked in my opening presentation i asked everyone to leave with an action plan what

335
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,040
am i going to do differently because of what i learned here and i preempted that again at a

336
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,680
higher level saying your big takeaways are really three things see if remember what they are

337
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,480
is i expect you to come to walk away with a much greater understanding of how we use data to do

338
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,480
our job effectively now and in the future that i think accomplished two an overview to you'll

339
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:29,040
understand what services are at unity across the board and understand the variety of that and

340
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,720
that happened as well via that uh multiple ways and three is just get to know everybody else on

341
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:42,030
the team when i joined services org was a spread among different teams there was a small services

342
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,910
org but some other pieces were here and there and we've combined those teams and then grown by a

343
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:51,630
bunch of people so this is the first time they've ever had a chance to meet each other i was the only

344
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:56,030
person in the room by that could even name half the people in the room let alone all of them

345
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:00,750
and even by the end nobody could name everybody so this is all so there's a big advantage of

346
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,630
getting everybody together and what that was one of the takeaways so those are very high level

347
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:10,350
takeaways also then i asked we have our in our internal slack i've asked people to start posting

348
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,750
like parts of their action plan like what's something you're going to do differently what's

349
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:19,870
something you're going to work on and commit to as a result of this summit and a lot of things so

350
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:25,150
far are there's some things around engaging with data using our data platform more working with

351
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:30,030
developers to uh working with their feature teams and even program management to make sure we get

352
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,150
the right data in place that's part of it and then just some continued work on some of the projects

353
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:42,020
people did which are uh one was really cool using machine learning to uh using machine learning

354
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:48,260
Brent Brent's eyes just got like as big as like a cow uh using machine learning to detect uh fraud

355
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:54,820
in our in-app purchase system okay then they got they got to start on that uh which was fun and

356
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,940
they're excited to keep that going but little things like that are just exciting to see uh so

357
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:06,740
still waiting for more people to enter some of those things so uh we'll see what happens but

358
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:12,580
overall from my end very happy with what people took away uh we also had a lot of fun too we had some

359
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:20,340
group dinners together we played whirlyball yeah so everyone everyone got to see just how

360
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:30,300
competitive i can be i have never uh never played whirlyball for uh those who haven't

361
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:39,740
played whirlyball which is pretty much anyone listening it's it's a cross between uh kind of

362
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:47,120
lacrosse and bumper cars and basketball i'll explain it better you have these little short

363
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,160
scoops that you use like to throw the ball back and forth i'm sure they have a name a little

364
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,800
woofle ball back and forth and you want to scoop up the ball and throw it through this

365
00:40:55,600 --> 00:41:01,920
it's like a i think it's vertical with bumper cars it's like a vertical basket so you have a

366
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,200
scoop to pick at the ball throw it through a hole but you're driving around in bumper cars

367
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:15,860
uh while you're doing this it's as absurd and silly as it sounds but a lot of fun but it's been

368
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:24,900
it's been team morale um events for decades yeah we have somehow i have escaped it uh my entire

369
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:32,420
career here so my team uh my team of all stars won every single match of the of the round robin

370
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:41,040
then we get to the playoff bracket and lose our first match i wanted to fire everyone you're like

371
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:50,020
but i held back you you didn't step up you you don't beat the boss you're all gone no i wasn't

372
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:56,580
mad at the team for winning i was mad at my teammates for losing i don't tolerate losers

373
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:05,540
it was a good time all week so and it worked out very well for my recovery that it was monday

374
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:11,620
through thursday last week week before last week before last and friday was a company holiday for

375
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:17,460
veterans day so i got to have a nice three-day weekend to recover that was nice and that was the

376
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,340
sort of the summit and we'll do it again next year uh next year we'll be in europe somewhere

377
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,980
i'm not sure where yet i should probably why didn't you invite me to talk at that one

378
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,720
uh because half my team of course is maybe more than with times ago half my team is from europe these

379
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:41,840
days and uh while visas we actually got everyone here no one got sent back at the airport visas got

380
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,800
worked out it was great but i think it's fair for travel we'll do it in europe next year i'm not

381
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,680
sure where yet i had uh we had one developer from the ads team attend and he worked on oh a

382
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,760
contract based the contract based testing framework which worked out really well a really

383
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,060
cool guy and he's and i sat next to him oh i went to a place called phogo de chao is that a restaurant

384
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,180
it's a restaurant okay long story but anyway i'm sitting next to him and he starts talking to me

385
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:16,420
about how we need to have our next off site in his hometown in brazil and it looks it's

386
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,180
beautiful pictures so maybe maybe it'll work out anyway i had a lot of fun we're glad to have

387
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:28,500
you i think the i think the deck is a solid one i think there's only base off of the uh

388
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:35,460
i think there's only just a few tweaks that i would want to do to it all right brent

389
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,380
i think we're all out of stuff for today's episode of ab testing agreed all right i'm

390
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,620
allen i'm brent and we'll see you next time
