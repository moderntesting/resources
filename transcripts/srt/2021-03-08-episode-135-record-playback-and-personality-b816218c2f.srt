00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:07,820
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,620
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,780
Welcome to the AB testing podcast.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,500
I'm Alan and I'm not wearing a shirt.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,980
Uh, he is Alan and he's lying.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:26,620
All right.

9
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,020
It's for, it's for you to use your imagination.

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,460
We're back for episode one 35 of the AB testing podcast.

11
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,900
This is still season one.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,700
Some podcasts have seasons and we have one also.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,340
It's just all season one because our topics, if we had seasons, have you

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,020
listened to podcasts that have seasons?

15
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,140
Yeah.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,100
A season kind of needs a theme.

17
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,820
A theme would require planning an organization, neither of which

18
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,460
we do here at AB testing.

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,420
We are adaptive.

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,340
We talk about whatever's important at the time we're recording, because

21
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,860
it's the thing we can think of to talk about.

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,220
That's correct.

23
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,660
Although if, you know, if there's a high demand for seasons, I would

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:10,620
propose we could just, uh, advance it based on years.

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,660
Yeah.

26
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,700
Except whoever proposes it, it's going to have to go back and, and

27
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,660
renumber our prior season.

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:18,900
Yeah.

29
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,460
That it's that seems like work.

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,420
Work.

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,100
Yeah.

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,020
That involves work.

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,340
Uh, and we're not in, well, I mean, we do a lot

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,060
of work, right?

35
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,980
But I want the podcast to be something that's interesting for people to

36
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,140
listen to.

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,420
So we should talk about things that we think are interesting to us.

38
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,620
That sounds very selfish when I put it that way, but hopefully we talk

39
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,700
about things that are relevant.

40
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,860
And again, if we go back for, if you're listening to your first AB testing,

41
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,300
or maybe your second, we are not defining anything new.

42
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,580
We are not predicting what's going to happen.

43
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,620
We are not prescribing something we think is where we think people should go.

44
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,100
We're talking about what we're already seeing, what we're seeing being successful.

45
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,220
So if you see change coming, uh, in fact, if I go to Reddit in the testing or

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,380
quality assurance subreddit once a week, someone is talking about what's

47
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,380
happening, changing and testing our team.

48
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,260
Our team is getting rid of our testers and everyone's a developer.

49
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,820
What does it mean?

50
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,780
We're here to help you figure out what that means and how to help you

51
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,100
get your team to not screw that up because we've gone through it.

52
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,100
And you and I have both seen very closely team screw that up.

53
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,700
So where was I going with that?

54
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,220
I don't know anything else where I talk about me some more.

55
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,020
No, I would, I would even further say we've seen teams screw it up.

56
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,300
But here's actually, here's something I'm curious from your point of view.

57
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,650
We, we, we both are saying that there should be, when you're doing this,

58
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,810
uh, I think we both agree that the benefits far outweigh the, the

59
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:58,570
detriments number one, uh, people should move forward, but do so plan fully.

60
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,770
I don't know, but you know, don't plan like a 1998 big design up front

61
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,930
waterfall thing, like you'll make mistakes, but adapt.

62
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,650
I've talked about the way we plan projects in my org at unity before

63
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,490
at this 50% probability of a date.

64
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,410
We do that not because to be different, we do it because it's a sweet spot

65
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,050
between over-planning and under-planning.

66
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,450
And what's happened in our culture is this idea of a P 50 comes up for.

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,030
Other types of changes as well, not just delivery of code.

68
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,350
What's your P 50 plan to do X?

69
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,830
So yeah, it's a, you should have a sweet spot between over-planning

70
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,470
like we did in the old days, just enough design up front to aim

71
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,150
yourself in the right direction and then be ready to learn and adapt.

72
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:43,750
Yeah.

73
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,390
But in addition to it, it's like, don't let the fear of

74
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,230
screwing up the role out.

75
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,470
Abt again.

76
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,990
Yeah, you should be okay.

77
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,830
Just screw stuff up.

78
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:02,870
So speaking of learning segue, I gave in between the last podcast and this one,

79
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,430
I delivered a webinar.

80
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,390
Thank you to test project for hosting it.

81
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,950
Talking about this again, we've talked about now for three podcasts.

82
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,190
So we'll go too deep, but this myth that there is a huge mindset change between

83
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:22,000
developing and testing, and I really just talked about some things talked about

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
before, went into more details on some things I wrote in an article about six

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,940
weeks ago now, and I was ready to be skewered, but I wasn't.

86
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,170
I was pleasantly surprised.

87
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,770
The questions were more like we'd address on the podcast.

88
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,210
Like, how do I handle this change?

89
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,610
How do I, how should I go about this change?

90
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,650
What do I do when developers don't want to test?

91
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,090
No sorts of things that I'd expect the sort of facts for if developers do testing, how

92
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,370
can they do it as well as I do?

93
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,810
I'm a specialist, blah, blah, blah.

94
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,690
Nobody told me I was full of crap.

95
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,650
Although the video recording is up on YouTube and you can find it in my Twitter

96
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,530
stream so far, only one downvote.

97
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,210
Brent, I have to ask, why did you downvote me?

98
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,130
Uh, I just didn't like how you were looking on there.

99
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,770
You weren't dapper enough.

100
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,370
No, I look like crap.

101
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,290
You weren't representing the brand.

102
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,210
Brent started the podcast leading way back saying I am staying away from my keyboard.

103
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,010
Yeah.

104
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,370
Now, now he's bringing up my YouTube video so we can see if he can download it again

105
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,410
under a different account.

106
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,020
I want to see what the additional, uh, comments might've been.

107
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,940
I don't think anyone's commented on the YouTube video.

108
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,020
I haven't looked at it in a while, but I could tell you, yeah, the one downvote,

109
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,740
but I only have 12 up votes.

110
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,140
So it's not, and comments are turned off.

111
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,460
So nobody, nobody said anything.

112
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,380
So that's what we know so far.

113
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,100
All right.

114
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,020
Anyway, check it out.

115
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,300
If you didn't see the webinar, I don't think it's anything surprising to anyone

116
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,740
on here, but, uh, that was a fun one to put together.

117
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,980
I feel pretty good about the talk.

118
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,620
Uh, of course I'd love feedback.

119
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,500
You can go to our slack group at one of the three dot slack.com and get an

120
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,100
invitation from our, our website at modern testing.org, pluggity, plug, plug,

121
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,540
plug.

122
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
So yeah, that happened.

123
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,180
And, and when I'm really bored, I'm going to go back and look at this video of

124
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,580
yours from seven years ago about starting out in security testing.

125
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,900
Oh yeah.

126
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,180
Yeah.

127
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,740
I have a couple of things that was me interviewing Alan Mervold.

128
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,140
So we're talking about, there was a time when I was in engineering excellence.

129
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,780
I can't believe that was only seven years ago.

130
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,660
It feels like a freaking lifetime and a half ago then, or maybe actually

131
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,980
it was recorded before then.

132
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,500
I just uploaded it then.

133
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:41,180
But the idea was we had realized how much of how much learning happened in

134
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,300
the old days when we'd be at, I have offices and we go to work.

135
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,540
You just go into someone's office and ask him a question and get

136
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,100
15 minutes of gold knowledge.

137
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,900
So what we did for a little while was these are highly staged, but we'd,

138
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,380
I only posted a couple of them to YouTube, but we had a dozen or so of these

139
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,340
conceptual whiteboard videos where the idea was you'd see me knock on someone's

140
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,220
door and then come in and ask a question and they'd explain it to me on

141
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,820
the whiteboard, I'd ask questions.

142
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,220
That part wasn't staged.

143
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,580
We just kind of staged me walking in with the camera running, but then we

144
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,020
just recorded them explaining something to me and we put it on, we used them

145
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,130
internally, put it on the internet to try and capture that, to try and spread

146
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:27,010
that method of learning a little, little wider.

147
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,810
It's a good idea.

148
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,050
It was fun at the time.

149
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,010
So where was I going?

150
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:30,890
I don't know.

151
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:32,130
Webinar was good.

152
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,090
Appreciate your feedback.

153
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:39,580
Why do you, why do you think it ended up being so different than what

154
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,540
you expected?

155
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,220
Do you think, I think I made my point.

156
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:49,220
Well, also probably some, the people that probably hated what I wrote and hated

157
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,520
the concept probably didn't tune in or I don't know, I don't know.

158
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,750
I did expect a little bit more, but Alan, you whatever, but that wasn't there.

159
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,190
I think people got where I was coming from.

160
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,390
I gave, I thought I supported my case pretty well.

161
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,340
So I think the thing most people struggle with is not that I felt like in that room,

162
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,000
people felt like, okay, developers can do good testing.

163
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,240
They're still stuck in the, but my developers don't want to do testing or my

164
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,800
developers shouldn't have to do testing.

165
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,600
Any one of those flavors, which have different solutions than the mindset thing.

166
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:31,000
I'd like to think I did a fairly good job convincing people that if a developer

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,720
is given the responsibility of testing, they can do quite well.

168
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,760
Yeah.

169
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,000
It's it's, those are sort of the top three excuses, right?

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,120
It's a number one developers can't do it.

171
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,680
All right.

172
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Well, no, that's false.

173
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,000
Number two, they don't want to do it.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,720
What's your first pushback on that one?

175
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,400
And they don't want to do it.

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,200
Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,640
Uh, often, often that's not really it.

178
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,200
They think they don't want to do it.

179
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,760
I it's pairing is almost my answer for all of those questions.

180
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,280
I think sometimes they're not wanting to do it is a fear of not knowing how to do

181
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,680
it or a fear of seeing value in them doing it.

182
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,400
I've found the solution to all that stuff is to begin pairing with them, test

183
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,800
things together and they'll figure out, Oh, I can do this on my own.

184
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,480
And they understand the value of it in that all of what we do and accelerate

185
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,280
the achievement, simple quality.

186
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
We want to tighten up feedback loop.

187
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:36,080
So that feedback loop involves a pass off, uh, that may involve time zones.

188
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,360
Even that's inefficient.

189
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,840
Yeah, for me, I would say, well, of course they don't want to do it.

190
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,480
Right.

191
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,240
We're, we're essentially proposing to take away their safety net.

192
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,000
It's scary.

193
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,520
For sure.

194
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,160
And I think, I think they're just scared, but we have beat this horse to hell.

195
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,080
I want to talk about my next rant and, and get some feedback.

196
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,800
I am using test project as a platform.

197
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,400
They've asked me to write some blogs for them and I haven't written blogs in a while.

198
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,680
And if you remember, I wanted to get back into writing some more blogs to go back

199
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
to our prediction episode.

200
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,320
And here I go.

201
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,760
Self-fulfilling prophecy.

202
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,680
But what I'm writing about and what they don't mind me doing is things that

203
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,320
pissed me off.

204
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,040
So first I talked about this mindset thing, which I think is crap that a few

205
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,590
people have a few, uh, large, I want to say large egos, large influences in the

206
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,870
test world talk about this deep into this mindset change, which I think I've

207
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,630
proven as crap.

208
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,070
The next thing I wrote about was challenging the notion that test automation

209
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,390
is done by a separate team from the team developing.

210
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,590
I think developers should write the vast majority of test automation.

211
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,190
I think that would actually improve design.

212
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:41,590
I made the points in the article.

213
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,510
I feel pretty strongly about that.

214
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,710
And I'm thinking about what else pisses me off.

215
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,630
It's like so many things make me mad, but I thought, well, maybe I'll write

216
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,590
something on exploratory test automation, but I've kind of done that before.

217
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,430
And I could give some examples.

218
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:00,910
It could be a more techie article and put some code samples in it, how I've used

219
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:05,670
tools to help me test, but then something hit me and I want to run it by you.

220
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,870
So you've been in testing a test automation for a long time.

221
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,150
What do you think of when I mentioned record and playback automation?

222
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,190
Like what's your, what's your first reaction?

223
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,380
Good tool when used for it's for what it's good for.

224
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,180
How's that for it?

225
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,020
Says how would you, well, that's, that's crappy.

226
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,260
So let me go ahead and answer that question myself because your answer sucks.

227
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,860
You get an F minus record and playback tools.

228
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,620
I used to hate, they were flaky as hell.

229
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,620
They weren't maintainable, but I was in a different mindset back then of

230
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,140
automate all the things or many of the things, at least all the

231
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,300
things that should be automated.

232
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,200
But if we look at what we agree about, I think the test automation pyramid

233
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,360
is a reflection of what happens when you have well-designed code.

234
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
You have very few of these end to end tests and a few of those

235
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,120
tests are UI automation tests.

236
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,720
Uh, we used to avoid record and playback tools because there were, the code

237
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,880
they generated was flaky.

238
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,480
We didn't want to deal with all the crap and they were marketed at not a developers.

239
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,360
They were marketed at testers who did not know how to code, who are not the

240
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,400
best people to be choosing what needs to be automated in my opinion.

241
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,960
Now, if we were to market those record and playback tools to developers, one,

242
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
they would use very few of them.

243
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,000
It would be faster than writing anything in selenium.

244
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,840
I have a bunch of people gonna be mad at me.

245
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:27,880
Yes.

246
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,240
Selenium is a good framework.

247
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,120
It's not an efficient way to write you animation.

248
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
I prefer test cafe.

249
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,560
A lot of people use cypress.

250
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,080
A lot of people don't like them for reasons A, B and C.

251
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,680
I'm kind of thinking here's the, here's the hill.

252
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
I'm thinking of climbing.

253
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,440
I think given that the good record and playback tools from test

254
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:53,720
to Mabel, Autify and others have eliminated the vast majority of the flakiness

255
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,320
from your web automation tests.

256
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,120
And I, I assume for UI automation with Appium, there are some similar things,

257
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,770
but if that flakiness is gone and we only want to have a few of those tests,

258
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,930
why invest a lot of time relative amount, a lot of time of writing tests

259
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,650
with selenium when you could just record and playback those suckers and

260
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,810
have them stay fairly reliable for a long time problem is they're marketing

261
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,130
these things towards testers and not developers, but I kind of think the

262
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,290
time is ripe for record and playback to be the default way to do web automation.

263
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,440
So I don't, I don't have any current experience on recording and playback,

264
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,400
but I think the standard by which I would, I would hold that is essentially

265
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,640
it's going to be a combination of, uh, that, well, everything I do is by ROI.

266
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,080
Okay.

267
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,010
But the problem with the record and playback stuff is if they're

268
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:55,010
intended to persist the traditional record and playback, the problem with that

269
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:02,670
is they're cheap to get out, but you spend, I don't know, a significant more

270
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,430
time on the backend of the price tag of this one, like maintenance

271
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,710
costs is through the roof.

272
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,190
That's the problem with, with record and playback.

273
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:19,640
Now, if you have a, if you have a measuring it by the total price tag,

274
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,480
including the maintenance cost over, over the expected lifetime of the automation,

275
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:33,360
if that's been improved, uh, yeah, why not there, there, they're cheap to, to grind out.

276
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,840
And if the current record and playback systems have gotten to the point where

277
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,080
they can write maintainable code, like, Hey, we noticed you do this same

278
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,160
routine over and over again, we've.

279
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,400
Well, it doesn't matter.

280
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,200
I mean, it used to be like that.

281
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,480
Oh, well, the burden playback sucks.

282
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,880
We can't reuse code chunks.

283
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:59,240
I don't, I kind of don't care if the code underneath is spaghetti that I can't read

284
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,120
and I can't, I can't do anything with manually.

285
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,560
I don't even care if I can see it.

286
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,720
If I just need something that I can rely on to, to continue to let me know that

287
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,640
some scenarios functionality is correct.

288
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,520
And it withstands changes underneath, which is what all these, these higher

289
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,280
end tools do, I kind of don't care about the code underneath.

290
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,200
It doesn't matter to me.

291
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:30,720
How does, how, how does current record and playback tools implement the Oracle?

292
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,480
How do you define pass and fail and current playback?

293
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,080
Well, it's up to the human to define the Oracle and what, what

294
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
you want from a scenario.

295
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,800
For example, you may want to see a, you have an account creation scenario.

296
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,960
It would be a good one.

297
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,280
You probably want to test end to end and not just at the integration level.

298
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Cause that's, that's critical part of your onboarding of customers.

299
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,400
That may be you get, there's two things you do.

300
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,160
One is at the UI level.

301
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,120
You make sure that you get to the signup successful page.

302
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,770
That would be the Oracle is this page exists by test past, but you also want to

303
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,090
have a parallel test I would kick off that would verify that the back end matches.

304
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:10,770
Yeah.

305
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,410
So I got to tell you often in the web automation world, people may only web

306
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,610
verify the front end, like, Oh, the, we got the right page that past.

307
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,370
You need to apply a little bit of systems thinking to that, but that's the Oracle.

308
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,730
You decide what the outcome is.

309
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,930
You want what is the outcome of what you want to do from your test.

310
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,930
So where are these tools help over traditional automation in the, in

311
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:37,770
selenium, I would find the web element for, for, to create a login or an

312
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:41,770
account on the site, and then one by one, I'd find the elements, wait for them to

313
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,170
appear, add my data to those, press the button, and then verify.

314
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,210
I got to again, through web elements, something like the thing I got to, I

315
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,410
changed the ID of one of those things.

316
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,370
Generally my test breaks.

317
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,130
So what happens is, especially this is where this is going back a step to

318
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:01,730
developers owning the test automation.

319
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,810
What happens now is the developers change some IDs, move some things around.

320
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,330
All of the test engineers, remember on a different team, their stuff all breaks and

321
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,370
they have to go figure out why and change their test.

322
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,250
That is a, that's an inefficiency.

323
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,290
Now what these tools do, audifies my favorite by no lot of people use Mabel or,

324
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,730
or what's the other one I mentioned?

325
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,210
Test him.

326
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,170
I think there are probably 20 others by now.

327
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:23,930
It's a hot market.

328
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,290
What they do is they figure out enough other information about the control that

329
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,530
you can change all kinds of crap about it, and they will still figure out what

330
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:37,850
control you intended and often let you know, like give you a maintenance step.

331
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,170
Okay.

332
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,850
This is, is this the same thing we'll update your, we'll

333
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,090
update our underlying structure.

334
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,250
So they make it harder.

335
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,890
They make it harder to screw stuff up by inferring and whether you want to call it

336
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,850
AI or ML or just being smart.

337
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:55,090
I think on a side tangent, a lot of the stuff we did as smart monkeys 15 years

338
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,050
ago, that people are now calling AI and ML.

339
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,490
So it's a fine line.

340
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,570
But what these tools do is they allow the underlying code to change and for the

341
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:10,610
tests to still run and, and in most cases help you update those to help them stay

342
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,050
stay relevant or stay accurate in the future.

343
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:19,490
So in the face of, of number one, these record and play tools, if the initial

344
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:25,330
technology is such that, uh, that initially the maintenance costs of it,

345
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:29,450
cause as you and I know, like it, that's the, that's the Achilles heel of record

346
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:35,930
plate is made it, if they've made it such that the maintenance cost is extremely

347
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,850
low now and then even furthermore, creation cost is low.

348
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,770
So I can have a scenario.

349
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,970
It may take me four hours to automate and selenium plus ongoing maintenance

350
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,050
costs to keep it going.

351
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:50,770
If I can automate that workflow with a record and playback tool in 10 minutes

352
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,010
and have that test continue to run for weeks or months or years, why would I

353
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,930
invest in creating a bunch of tests in selenium and again, it could get on

354
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,170
weirdly if you add hundreds and hundreds of these, but that's the wrong

355
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,090
thing to do as well.

356
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:04,930
Uh, yeah.

357
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,690
And I agree the, the, at least again, I don't have any recent

358
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,410
practical knowledge on this front, but, but based on how you lay out, I don't

359
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,650
see the flaw, like in addition, you call out that where a maintenance cost

360
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:24,490
is incurred, these tools are now smarter and telling you and asking, uh,

361
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,530
essentially the way you phrase it is saying, Hey, is it okay?

362
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,570
Is it okay for us to make this change?

363
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,970
Like we're uncertain.

364
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,690
Well, what do you plan with?

365
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,620
Uh, what is, what is in your hand?

366
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,000
This is my child, Brent.

367
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,840
So here's my statement.

368
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,760
So all that said, give me feedback if you think that's crap, but I kind of

369
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,160
think there's something there.

370
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,520
I think as far as all the vendors out there marketing tools to testers, if

371
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,560
you want to win, if you want to be like, there's a bunch of competition.

372
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,640
If you want to get the most customers and, and get more market share, start

373
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,360
marketing your stuff to developers.

374
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,240
They're going to know how to use your stuff most effectively.

375
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,480
Testors are not your long-term audience.

376
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,120
Yeah.

377
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,520
I completely agree.

378
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,680
Uh, the, and in addition to that, I'm wondering, like in this

379
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,840
particular topic, like knowing you as I do, right.

380
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,320
You're, I don't know, a half an insight away from just going all in and

381
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,360
just saying test automation is dumb.

382
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,680
You should record them playback.

383
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:41,120
I'm wondering if you shouldn't, uh, set up a special AB episode on that front.

384
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,480
Uh, with one of the listeners I'm here, I'm specifically thinking, uh,

385
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,520
Percy to, to go through that thought process.

386
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,280
I like, there it is an open invitation to anyone of the three, especially

387
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,080
if your name is Percy for a, uh, that would be Friday afternoon at six P

388
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,280
at Friday evening at 6 PM your time on a Friday of your choice, as long as

389
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
it aligns with our two week schedule.

390
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
There it is.

391
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,000
Let us know.

392
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,440
I'm looking at Slack.

393
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,120
Oh, we haven't posted this yet.

394
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,640
So we don't know yet, but there it is.

395
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,680
And YouTube.

396
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,040
We're not live streaming.

397
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,880
We're not live streaming.

398
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,840
We're live streaming.

399
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,760
Did I press record?

400
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,040
At least we're recording.

401
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,680
Well, that is a step in the right direction.

402
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,400
Okay, cool.

403
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,060
I want to move on to another topic and I think this is one that's going to

404
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:33,680
involve both some discussion today and maybe some homework for next time.

405
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,560
Oh, uh, and I'll see what you think.

406
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,880
And I, cause I want to get one, some homework for us to do.

407
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,600
And then another one ideas from our listeners on what we should do.

408
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:50,540
So the topic is, it's not just personality tests, but I was

409
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,260
reflected talking to my daughter last night and she was sharing a bunch of

410
00:21:54,260 --> 00:22:00,100
different, uh, different personality or characteristics tests she's done.

411
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,540
And she's done MBTI.

412
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:07,100
She's also done the test that says which, uh, Hogwarts house you would live in.

413
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,140
Uh, some other ones as well.

414
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,780
Another one called any agreement here.

415
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:12,980
Yeah.

416
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,180
Like which Marvel hero would you be?

417
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:17,340
Those are a little out there, but I want to talk about the ones I've done.

418
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,820
Cause we share a couple of these together.

419
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,380
We both done MBTI.

420
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,300
Yep.

421
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,620
Myers-Briggs type indicator.

422
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,260
That one is, it does give some good insights about yourself.

423
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,700
What I found most valuable in that one is understanding.

424
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,780
Cause again, it doesn't tell you how you act.

425
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,860
It tells you what's difficult and what gives you energy.

426
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,580
Uh, but there's some, there's some valuable information there.

427
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,860
We have both done a thing was very popular at Microsoft.

428
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,740
Not sure if it's still there anymore called insights.

429
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,700
Is that still being used there?

430
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,460
Uh, not to my knowledge.

431
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,340
Remember insights.

432
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,420
I need to look it up.

433
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,460
I have my book full of evaluations there.

434
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,820
You get a color and I think I'm blue, red.

435
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:53,900
I can't quite remember.

436
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,700
I'm definitely not green, which means nothing to anybody who hasn't taken it.

437
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,380
Yeah.

438
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,900
And, and actually I am red, blue and they're nearly equivalent.

439
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,260
I am like 0.05.

440
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,140
I should look and I believe I may have changed.

441
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,460
I think that one may change over time.

442
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,900
I'm not sure.

443
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,100
My roles are changed a lot.

444
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,100
So, so actually I've done this research.

445
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:24,480
I will tell you upfront, uh, the, the color one uses is no different than MBTI.

446
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,440
So it doesn't change.

447
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,400
It's who you are.

448
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,120
Well, it does change because the, the, the problem.

449
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,600
Carl Jung would say that with your MBTI, which, which it's based on his work.

450
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,600
You don't change.

451
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,440
It's your preferences.

452
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:36,960
They're innate.

453
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,880
They do not change.

454
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,040
Well, right.

455
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,720
Carl's Jung's work would say that MB, MBTI is.

456
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,000
Actually a far cry from Carl Jung's work.

457
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:46,440
Okay.

458
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:49,040
It's agreed.

459
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,240
Although it's based on that, it's based on that knowledge.

460
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,440
So there has to be, there has to be something to that statement.

461
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,960
But what I'm, what I was trying to close on is MBTI and insights has a direct

462
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,680
relationship and, and the insight stuff is actually just using two letters from.

463
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,920
MBTI.

464
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:08,680
Okay.

465
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,200
And it's I versus E or T versus F.

466
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:18,640
And so if you are an extroverted feeler, you're a yellow, if you are a,

467
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:19,440
yep.

468
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,800
And basically,

469
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,000
which is don't we have the same MBTI type?

470
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:23,920
We do.

471
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,840
That's why I'm, I'm like a little more, little more, which is weird

472
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,560
that I am a blue, red, and you're a red, blue, because you're the

473
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,160
one in the analytics role.

474
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,580
Uh, yeah.

475
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,660
But if you look at mine, they're really close to exactly the same.

476
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,060
Like there are times I just simply describe myself as purple.

477
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:42,820
Okay.

478
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,700
I want to, uh, I will get mine out before next time.

479
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,860
I want to dive a little bit deeper.

480
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,220
We've also both done strength finders, which I think is a really good one as well.

481
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,060
Yes.

482
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,740
And so I want to talk again a little bit about those.

483
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,180
And the reason is, is I mentioned this in a five for Friday.

484
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,340
I think a few of the three have done it, but there's a new one from Pat Lanchoni,

485
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,180
who's the author of five dysfunctions of a team and a bunch of other books

486
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,140
of which I have read every single one of them, probably at least twice each for now.

487
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:10,580
All of them.

488
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,180
I'm a huge fan of his work and his podcast.

489
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,700
And he has a new one.

490
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,260
He calls working genius.

491
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,200
And I'm not going to do a full advertisement for Pat Lanchoni and his working genius,

492
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,080
but he says there's six types of six types of sort of leadership genius

493
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,200
you bring to the table.

494
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,360
Maybe I'll bring mine up.

495
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,040
Maybe I will talk about them a little bit.

496
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,120
If you haven't done the test, he should not even give you a code

497
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,880
for one if you want it, you don't, you didn't have to pay for it.

498
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,320
Okay.

499
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,720
So he says there's the genius of wonder, which is the natural gift of pondering

500
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,640
the possibility of greater potential and opportunity given situation.

501
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,640
The genius of invention, natural gift of creating original and novel ideas

502
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,200
and solutions, genius of discernment, natural gift of intuitively and

503
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,280
instinctively evaluating ideas and situations, galvanizing, which is

504
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,920
rallying, inspiring and organizing, enablement, which is providing

505
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,160
encouragement and assistance for an idea or project and tenacity, which

506
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,800
is pushing projects or tasks to completion or achieve results.

507
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,080
I have, I'm curious for your opinions on this.

508
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,120
I'll give you more time to look at it before the next podcast.

509
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,520
Cause sometimes I like it.

510
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,360
Cause the idea is that there's probably two of these that you love doing

511
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,760
two that you know how to do and two that you suck at.

512
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,400
You need to work with people that can do that to help you get stuff done.

513
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,120
But I look at those and I've had to do, well, I suppose it's fair to say

514
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,520
I've had to do all of those.

515
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,680
So maybe the question is to look at which ones the evaluation I did

516
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,480
says that I don't like doing cause they, they didn't realize it didn't

517
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,200
like doing them. And there is something to that as well.

518
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,400
And from mine, I won't go deeply into these.

519
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
I won't go into everything, but I am best at discernment and galvanizing.

520
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:51,040
So I am good and enjoy using intuition and instincts to evaluate and

521
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,520
assess ideas or plans.

522
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,120
That's the N in INTP and I'm galvanizing, which is I get people to do

523
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,920
shit together, you're good at and enjoy rallying people and inspiring

524
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
them to take action around a project task or idea.

525
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,160
And what's funny with that is my inspiration for wanting to do that and to

526
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,560
get people to rally around that idea, which may lead into another topic

527
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,080
here in a minute.

528
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,720
So let's put a little pin there is that I read one of his books.

529
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,720
I forget which one it was called now, but this idea that when companies

530
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,320
are in trouble, like when Microsoft had their security issues back in

531
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:29,080
the early two thousands, the company rallied around improving in security.

532
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,000
There was a rallying cry.

533
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
People were excited about it.

534
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,760
They were invested in it.

535
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,440
They wanted to get better, learn a bunch of stuff.

536
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,480
And they built this culture of security.

537
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,560
Well, the concept of this book was you want to build that rallying cry

538
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,720
before there's a crisis.

539
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,520
You want to have something you align on and the organization wants to do

540
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,080
before there's a problem that they're trying to solve.

541
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,200
And so that was very inspiring to me.

542
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,720
So that's kind of the way I've approached a lot of my leadership since then.

543
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,680
So there could be a weird bias in the reason that one's such

544
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,440
an important for me, but I do enjoy that.

545
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,840
I love seeing organizations come together or people across an organization

546
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
come together to solve a common problem.

547
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,800
And I'm going to give you an example about that in a little bit, but curious,

548
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,200
it sounds like you've typed up and are glancing at the, uh, the site right now.

549
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,000
Any initial feedback before we maybe dive a little deeper next time?

550
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:15,880
This is interesting in, at least in some regards, obviously I have

551
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,320
not ever heard of this before.

552
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,160
It's it only came out like literally three months ago.

553
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,840
There is, I mean, I could see connections to this to both

554
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
strength finders and the MBTI.

555
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,620
Actually, he brings it up in five dysfunctions of a team that he is a big fan

556
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,220
of MBTI and likes to do that across all of the teams he works with.

557
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,660
So definitely some influence there.

558
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:39,380
Yeah.

559
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,620
The thing I think is the thing I like about MBTI is it really helps

560
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:50,370
promote understanding when used in the right context, right?

561
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:57,410
Um, an example is basically one example I bring up.

562
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,890
So I know a lot about MBTI and I'm fairly certain I could

563
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,930
teach a course on it.

564
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,170
Like way Ts and Fs look at the world is different.

565
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,960
Just as an example, if I'm

566
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,360
these are intuitive and feeling for those that aren't doing

567
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,440
that the MBTI lingo TNF is thinking and feeling.

568
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:15,760
That's right.

569
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,360
Thinking and feeling.

570
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,560
Yeah.

571
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,160
What did I say?

572
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,200
Touching and feeling.

573
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,120
That's not it.

574
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,680
Yeah.

575
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,560
No, that's a different letter.

576
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:25,880
And that particular letter it's what it, what it's evaluating is your

577
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,480
general preference around how you decide.

578
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,240
And so the other letters sort of focus on what sort of things do you

579
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,080
bring to the table to make the decision?

580
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,160
The TNF is what standard, but is it that you use to decide and

581
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,880
T's sort of decide between right and wrong in a, in a logical sense.

582
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:54,080
Fs their standard is good and bad on a, on a more of a morality sense.

583
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,400
And one of the things that I've learned from using this is that if you go in and

584
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:05,880
have a conversation as a T with someone who's an F and say you're wrong

585
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,050
subconsciously, the way they interpret it is that you just told them they're

586
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,600
immoral, right, which will bit flip them.

587
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,920
But the other thing, so you and I, we're very different on

588
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,800
strength finders, those results.

589
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,280
And I just look at this list.

590
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,400
I also suspect you and I will be very different.

591
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,240
I think so too.

592
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,200
Yeah, it's about, it's a little bit more about execution and how you

593
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,040
execute with your personality.

594
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,240
Anyway, I'm curious.

595
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,520
Oh, I'll take it as soon as I can.

596
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:33,880
Yeah.

597
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:40,290
So, I don't know, let me just segue and talk about how I've applied that second

598
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,890
one and maybe for next time, if you, if you take it and get some examples like,

599
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,970
Oh, Hey, I've done this before.

600
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:51,450
So as our listeners know, a few months ago, maybe six months ago, I expanded

601
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,210
my role to cover a lot larger.

602
00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:00,170
Well, basically all of the infrastructure support and everything for services at

603
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:00,530
unity.

604
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:05,570
So what that means is I have this team of roughly, roughly 75 people in

605
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,870
a variety of different roles, how the team had functioned previously and it

606
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:14,910
worked and I'm sure we all know teams like this, they're very busy.

607
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:19,510
They did important work, but it was, it was just a lot of incremental

608
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:23,510
development across a whole bunch of different areas, which is good.

609
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,630
They kept teams running.

610
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,710
I mean, our, our slowest deployment pipeline is 40 minutes.

611
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,430
So it's not like they were bad at anything.

612
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,030
They're actually very effective.

613
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:35,150
But one of the things I wanted to do the rally and cry, and I won't go

614
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:39,030
into any details on what our rallying cries were, but I picked a small

615
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,070
number of projects that these are some things we got to keep the business

616
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,390
running.

617
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,150
We got to keep accelerating our every development team's ability to

618
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,830
deliver easier, faster, safer.

619
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,110
We talked about that before, but also there are a few big rocks.

620
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,910
I want to move.

621
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:58,840
I wanted to ignore as much as possible organizational structure and say,

622
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,200
if you need help, ask for it.

623
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,960
If there's something else, something happening outside of your direct team,

624
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,760
you think you'd have some insight on, please go work on that.

625
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,640
Get your day job done, but, but please find ways to collaborate across

626
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,160
teams as we try and move these big rocks.

627
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,680
So I set the rallying cry and Darna, if it didn't work, I mentioned

628
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,320
before you, I manage our documentation team.

629
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,800
And one of the things we're working on is spinning up our own customer

630
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,840
facing doc portal.

631
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,700
If they weren't in my team full of a bunch of people who really, who know

632
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,220
how to build pipelines and deploy stuff to web services, that would

633
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,980
have been a lot slower process.

634
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,020
We just kicked that off short time ago and that pipeline is already built.

635
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,980
And it works and it's magic and it's great, but this is multiple

636
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,380
teams working together.

637
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,620
This is world of Warcraft guide to project management.

638
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,380
We brought varying skill sets, regardless of managerial structure.

639
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,900
And we're not a holocracy.

640
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,380
We have people managers who are responsible for people's growth

641
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,740
and finding the right work, but we built a system in which they could

642
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:07,740
easily help each other out and find where they could align and

643
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,940
make sure everything got done.

644
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,940
So pretty happy with that.

645
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,220
Uh, but again, that came from the rallying cry.

646
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,500
Like we're going to, we're going to work together on stuff.

647
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,460
I'm going to provide some vehicles for you to discover what's happening

648
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,700
across the org and these few things are the important things that

649
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,660
we're really going to move on and set goals around.

650
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,060
So also for those rallying cries, I put some pretty, put some pretty big goals

651
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,140
in place so they could have something hard to shoot for what they get from

652
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,460
that, which ends up being able to show progress is they get some metrics

653
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,500
that actually matter around those ideas.

654
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,220
Yeah.

655
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:45,460
I actually think I have a slightly different perspective on

656
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,020
what you did, but it's an alignment.

657
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:52,700
I actually think what I, what happened here was, uh, what's this

658
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,620
last name, Johnson, Johnson,

659
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,360
Steven Johnson, where good ideas come from.

660
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,200
Yep.

661
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:58,640
Yeah.

662
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,000
What are the books we should just make the modern testing

663
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,320
bookshelf with our favorites.

664
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,360
Yeah.

665
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,280
It's that one where accelerate accelerate how to measure anything.

666
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,000
I think those would be, oh, and a lean startup.

667
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,880
It probably goes.

668
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,480
Yes.

669
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,920
That is, that is a very good start.

670
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,360
Yes.

671
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,280
The, but right.

672
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:26,920
You had constructed, so life had constructed an environment where these

673
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,720
two major, but typically separate big ideas were forced to come together.

674
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:42,920
And then you further sort of motivated the birthing of new ideas.

675
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,560
By, uh, your rallying cry.

676
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,800
And I mean, I, this is from Steven Johnson's book, but it's, it's apropos

677
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:55,570
is this is my job as a manager or as a leader of a large team is to create

678
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,650
the right opportunities and a Steven Johnson says chance favors the

679
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,130
connected mind, my role is to make these opportunities for people to discover.

680
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:09,970
One find work that's interesting to them and don't worry about organizational

681
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,570
boundaries and an org like mine where we don't ship a thing.

682
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,730
We make lots and lots of things.

683
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:20,290
Having ownership within a team is going to be a bottleneck.

684
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,330
Yeah.

685
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:26,870
The, the, the thing that I think is a strong skill you have, uh, with

686
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:31,990
people on that front is, and I'm nowhere near as skilled as you, uh, on

687
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:38,270
this one is just motivating the discovery.

688
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,830
Right.

689
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:43,790
You have, I don't know how many people let's say 50 people underneath you.

690
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:50,590
You have high confidence that they are as smart or smarter than you are.

691
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,270
I have actually 75 people in every single one of them is smarter than me.

692
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,030
Right.

693
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:02,350
Your job is to get that smartness working together and knowing that once

694
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:07,470
you've achieved the tipping point of the maybe a fifth book, you can get out of the way.

695
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:10,350
Your job is just to get it over, over the tipping point.

696
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:12,390
Well, let me go to another one of my favorite books.

697
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,150
This is the modern testing book episode.

698
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,430
So the, the, the, the leaders guide to radical management.

699
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,890
And this is the, um, what's his Facebook that'll come back to me in a minute.

700
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:27,170
But this was a business writer worked for Rodoloff for Forbes magazine.

701
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,210
Still writes for Forbes.

702
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,490
Why am I spacing out?

703
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,770
Denny, not Denny, maybe Denny.

704
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:37,100
Anyway, uh, he said, create an environment for people to work in and

705
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,940
get out of their way.

706
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,220
And again, it's all different ways of saying the same thing.

707
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:47,140
I have to give you a funny story here because I frequently tell my team, like,

708
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,180
I may have an idea, but please take all my ideas with a grain of salt.

709
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,380
You're doing the work.

710
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,620
You make the decisions.

711
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,780
And I was talking, I can't remember if it was a one-on-one or a meeting.

712
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,260
And I mentioned something and one of my newer leads was like, Alan said,

713
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,220
we should do this in, in, in a meeting.

714
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
And everybody else being just laughed at him.

715
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,950
Like, it doesn't matter what he says.

716
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:12,750
We make it cause they know, they know they've worked for me for longer, but, uh,

717
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:16,750
largely we have that culture is that I could say, you know what?

718
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,870
I think we should only deploy on Saturdays.

719
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:24,110
They would all tell me to go do something anatomically impossible with

720
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,670
myself because they know that I am not the one to make decisions like that.

721
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,670
I am going, my, my job is to set them up so they can make the best decisions

722
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,190
because I, I, they're one, they're smarter than me to the closer to the work.

723
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,550
Reminded me of that story.

724
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,230
I thought it was funny.

725
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:43,230
I had to go, no, here's what we should do.

726
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:47,200
I could add a kind of phrase of like, I don't want to give all the details of,

727
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,480
I said, yeah, there could be a situation where it's, it's true.

728
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,680
It's not universally true.

729
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,160
I rely on you all to make the decision on what to do here.

730
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,080
But most people get that after, you know, you have to, again, going back to

731
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,000
L'Ancioni, you communicate the rally and cry.

732
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,640
You clarify the rally and cry, and then you communicate the rally and cry again,

733
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,240
something like that.

734
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:10,840
It's working well.

735
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,840
Oh, one other story.

736
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,720
And again, going back to management is again, I'm going to be very fuzzy on

737
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,160
details, a lot of times just setting yourself up to take advantage of.

738
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,660
You spend a lot of time setting yourself up to be ready for what happens next.

739
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,020
Does that make sense?

740
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,660
Like you, you.

741
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,660
I spend time making sure that I can be adaptive and I had a tiny little change

742
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,780
happen with the career director, someone on my team, and it immediately,

743
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:45,520
immediately solved a major, a major, I would say a problem or a challenge,

744
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,720
but a structural thing I've been thinking about how to take care of on my team.

745
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,560
By one person making a different choice, a bunch of stuff fell into place

746
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,800
perfectly and everybody involved is super excited about it.

747
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,520
So being ready for those things is what I like to do.

748
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,600
Just, I love adapting so much.

749
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:06,160
And, uh, I've told my team this too, is that everything I do in management is agile.

750
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,200
It's lean.

751
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,440
I try, I will try stuff all the time with the expectation that a big chunk of it

752
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,730
won't work and they're getting used to that, which is great.

753
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,630
So yeah.

754
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:17,230
And that's what I do.

755
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:21,030
And that's, that's, that's what, that's what energizes me is what allows me to be

756
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,590
a manager and not hate it.

757
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,510
That yeah.

758
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:26,670
You're in a perfect role.

759
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:31,750
Like for the majority of the time I've known you, you've been anti-management.

760
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,990
Right.

761
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,350
Well, I didn't want to be a manager at Microsoft.

762
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,670
Things are better now.

763
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:42,120
But when at that time at Microsoft, it was on, how would you put it?

764
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,680
It wasn't a good thing to want to manage a high performing team.

765
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,920
You wanted to manage a team with a few good people, a few, okay, people

766
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,600
and a few crappy people, because you had to fit a curve, whether you had

767
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,000
a curve or not, cause we had a curve and we didn't have a curve.

768
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,880
The curve lasted through several different versions of the review cycle.

769
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,170
I didn't want to deal with that.

770
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,130
There was too much emotional and bureaucratic and political baggage

771
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:10,330
that came with being a manager at Microsoft for the majority of my career.

772
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,650
There I've heard a lot of that's better now.

773
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:16,570
It is a lot better, but I mean, we're not even.

774
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,700
So I'd been here now 26 years and that really started when

775
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,620
Satya got here and it's still far from solidified the, but it's going

776
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:33,020
in the right direction, but I totally know what you're talking about.

777
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:44,100
Like you were the review system physically incentivize you to construct heroes.

778
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:45,680
Right.

779
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,640
100% correct.

780
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:47,480
Yeah.

781
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:54,470
I mean, obviously heroes are rare and in the world that we're in now,

782
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:59,510
particularly Microsoft and in my case, I'm in Azure that that doesn't scale.

783
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:05,050
Like you, you have too few heroes to come and save the day for all the different

784
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,210
problems that we're having.

785
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,100
You need rockstar teams.

786
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,820
Um, and if, and let me give you an example of, and again, it's, it's a

787
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:19,300
lot of different stuff I know, Mike, I don't, a lot of people have noted my,

788
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:23,500
uh, consistent denouncing of Microsoft.

789
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,700
I found it hard to do the work that I loved doing there eventually.

790
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,820
You know, one example, like here, if I have, say I have 30 people on my team,

791
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,140
just knock it out of the park and all deserve big raises.

792
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:41,300
Let's say HR comes back and says, you don't have the budget for that.

793
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,060
At Microsoft you're screwed, right?

794
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,100
I mean, I would go talk to our CEO about that and show data that

795
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,380
showed what people were doing.

796
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,540
And I would get that budget we could take care of them.

797
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,300
If people do good work, we can take care of them.

798
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,420
Yeah.

799
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,860
I don't, I don't, I mean, there is a budget.

800
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:00,100
I can't just lie and say my whole team's great.

801
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,180
Everyone gets a 20% raise.

802
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,540
I can't do that.

803
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:08,300
No, it's, it's, you can't do that.

804
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:15,870
And even, and even if you could, um, it wouldn't be the right thing to do

805
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:20,700
because the point of the incentive model is to incentivize.

806
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,980
And if you were to do something like that, it would, it would

807
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,260
probably lead to bad behaviors.

808
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,580
Like, yeah.

809
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,940
And like another thing, other one for the, the book list is we never call it out

810
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,780
explicitly, but a lot of our, I use Dan pink's autonomy, mastery, and purpose

811
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,140
model a lot, like our whole review discussion is based on tying the work

812
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,580
you do to purpose.

813
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,100
So we worry about purpose a lot.

814
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,620
And we want people to understand how the work they do impacts the company.

815
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,540
And we, of course, as Dan pink says, pay them enough money where money is not

816
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:57,060
the issue and people are motivated by a reward in the short term, but in the

817
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,860
longterm they're more motivated by having work that they enjoy and that challenges

818
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:05,380
them, I'm not saying don't pay them.

819
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,100
The motivation you get from a pay raise is short lived.

820
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,420
It is.

821
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,860
And there's been lots of different studies on this that essentially once

822
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:23,820
you've gotten past sort of a bare minimum of fiscal stability, I'll just

823
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:29,620
call it that way, whether, whether it be, you know, you have big dreams of,

824
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,500
you know, toys or, or really all you need money to do is to make sure you

825
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,020
don't have to worry about it, which is kind of, that's kind of the

826
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:41,580
position I'm in.

827
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:47,260
I, I, I only want to get paid so much as I don't have to ever worry about it again.

828
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:54,180
I had this, this goes back to some pains in my, in growing up that I just

829
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,220
like, look, I don't want to ever go back to that.

830
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,540
And as long as I have enough to make sure that doesn't happen, it's great.

831
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,500
Purpose then becomes the better incentive.

832
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,660
And that's exactly it.

833
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,140
And I love that our review is, which is we call them three Q's, three questions,

834
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,900
three times a year.

835
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,220
The first thing we talk about is like, why is what you do important?

836
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,520
I do most of my discussion on that.

837
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,510
And then some are on mastery.

838
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,350
We have a discussion around how it's going.

839
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,870
And we ask questions around, usually I ask, what would you like to do more or

840
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,670
less of or start doing or stop doing?

841
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:31,980
Like a starfish with respect.

842
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,300
Yeah.

843
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:32,620
Yeah.

844
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,660
And that, and we have a deep discussion about that.

845
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,900
And it's stuff we talk about generally in one-on-ones, but three times a year,

846
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,140
we have a longer and deeper and more reflective one-on-one we call our

847
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,460
three key process, and it's about making sure we're connected with what

848
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,460
people want to do and making sure they enjoy.

849
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,740
We are so lucky in this world to do jobs that are hard and challenging

850
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,380
and fun and get paid for them.

851
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,930
So if anyone's not feeling challenged and having fun, I want to take care of

852
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,810
that because that's, that's, that's not good.

853
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:01,530
That's no bueno.

854
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,330
See no bueno.

855
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:07,170
Do those words make sense?

856
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,770
No, I've heard them before.

857
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,840
Spanish, not one of my languages.

858
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,040
No bueno means not good.

859
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:15,320
Yeah.

860
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:15,560
Okay.

861
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,000
I'm I'm, I am in the ballpark.

862
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,320
So cool.

863
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,040
So let's go ahead.

864
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,600
It's a quick question.

865
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,400
Well, what are the three questions again?

866
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,480
Oh, um, why is your mission important?

867
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
What are you doing?

868
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,320
How are you doing?

869
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,560
Or how's it going?

870
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,440
That those are the questions, but my variation, every manager has their own

871
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,240
take on those.

872
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,440
What I do with the why question is I make everyone tie their

873
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,560
mission to the customer.

874
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,680
How does this help our customer?

875
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,680
So if they don't get there in their, in their first track at it, I walk them

876
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,920
there because it's for me, it's really important.

877
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,240
They realize that we're at a size company where the work you do

878
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,880
affects our customers indirectly, but it affects them.

879
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,960
And then what are you doing?

880
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,600
And again, I know the work they do.

881
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,880
So I want to hear like, what are the, what are you most, what are you

882
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,280
most proud of over the last four months?

883
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,040
What's something you're really excited when you talk to your parents,

884
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,280
talking about your work, what do you talk about?

885
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,240
I want to get an idea of that gives me idea of motivation and then how it's

886
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,880
going, I mentioned before is the, is the starfish retro.

887
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,720
And then I add the, the fourth question, which I think is super valuable

888
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,960
is I asked them, what can I do more or less to help you be successful in your

889
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,640
mission and it's just my way of getting some feedback from them.

890
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:27,560
Yeah.

891
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,240
And I actually think that's an important way to go.

892
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,370
I was, I was, I was taking your three questions and then thinking through,

893
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:42,500
like, I, I like to keep these things simple and the more it, the more it's

894
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:49,880
simple, the more you can, you can have a really exciting partnership with your

895
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,680
report towards positive goals.

896
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,160
Yeah.

897
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,770
And that's where book plug again, this is going to be a record, but

898
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:01,770
radical candor says you have to, you care personally challenged directly.

899
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:05,890
So the better relationship I can build with these people that work for me,

900
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:09,970
the easier it is for both of us to give that direct feedback to each other.

901
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:10,770
Yeah.

902
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:16,730
And in that, that involves, I tell my staff, my very first

903
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:19,470
goal is to earn their trust.

904
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:20,270
Absolutely.

905
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,140
A million percent agree.

906
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:23,430
All right.

907
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:23,750
Cool.

908
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,870
Well, we meandered our way through another AAB testing podcast.

909
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,390
And as a teaser for next time, I'd like to talk about the, let's talk

910
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,590
about, let's start with working genius.

911
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:36,590
But if you have any other, maybe we'll just kind of walk through our results

912
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,030
on the other ones as well.

913
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,630
It'll be like the personality type review episode.

914
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:47,140
Is that the homework I got to take working genius and then bring in

915
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:47,820
the other things.

916
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:47,860
Yeah.

917
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:49,540
You can find it just to talk through them.

918
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:54,460
I'm also curious to hear if there are others of these.

919
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:58,260
I may also send you the quiz to help you figure out your Hogwarts house.

920
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,940
Cause that may be fun to talk about too.

921
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,630
You slithering you, but you're not really, you're not, you're, you're,

922
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:05,990
you're more of a Ravenclaw.

923
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:07,470
I think we'll find out.

924
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,030
I'm the blue one.

925
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,070
I've done this test.

926
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:11,470
I'd forget which one that is.

927
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,070
I haven't done it.

928
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:13,990
I'll have to figure it out.

929
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:16,590
All right.

930
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,070
Good.

931
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:18,030
Okay, man.

932
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,990
Thank you everyone for listening to yet another episode.

933
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,350
Well, by the way, did you, someone came to our slack

934
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:27,910
group again, you can get a link from modern testing.org to join, but someone

935
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:31,110
said they started at episode one and are working their way through.

936
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,550
And I can't imagine a more painful introduction to AB testing

937
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,300
than starting with episode one, but it happened.

938
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,260
I think it's actually very enlightening.

939
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,380
I've gone back and listened to it.

940
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:52,980
And it's like you, if you were to binge on it, you very quickly see how we

941
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,500
improve and then how we're on our way back down again right now.

942
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,700
Well, it could be, could be.

943
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,340
We definitely have our ups and downs.

944
00:48:59,380 --> 00:48:59,700
All right.

945
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,940
Well, this has been fun.

946
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,700
Uh, thanks for hanging out with me today, Brent, and I'll see you in a

947
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,500
couple of weeks, but thanks everyone else for listening to AB testing.

948
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:08,300
Bye.
