00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:23,120
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey Brent we have guests

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,090
yes it's so exciting it's pretty exciting it's pretty exciting

5
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:36,330
isn't this our first no this is not our first we've had guests before we've had

6
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:43,970
lots of guests no I'm talking about Brent Brent stop talking so we can say hi to

7
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,640
Nick and Todd Nick and Todd say hi to the AB to all three of our A B testing

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,120
listeners wait if there's two here there's only one left so say hi to the

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:03,680
other one hey everybody nice to nice to meet you I bet it's Percy I bet it's

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,330
Percy he's the one listening we're not live streaming today but I Percy Patrick

11
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:19,800
although in this case Chris is probably gonna be keenly interested miss so when

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,480
Nick reach out to me he said here's Brent running off into the weeds so it's the

13
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,200
A B testing podcast so Chris kentz one of the three yes I believe is who referred

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,120
Nick to us oh that's right that's so if this whole

15
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,440
credit goes horribly wrong Christmas ball well I'll collectively just blame it

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,160
on it may be good to blame it on Chris in advance right now perfect yeah I'm

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,250
gonna certainly blame it on Chris this is our a hundred and forty second episode

18
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,570
still season one because we're too unorganized to have seasons baby

19
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,210
testing podcast and I want to thank Todd and Nick for being here and they're

20
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,210
here for a reason and maybe I shouldn't try and explain it nor should Brent even

21
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,810
though we kind of did we have a little there was a little bit of a spoiler

22
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,610
there and that Chris sent us to you can one of you tell us why the hell you're

23
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,130
here on my zoom call and being recorded right now this is me looking back to see

24
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,730
yes we're recording good why are you here tell tell your tell our listener

25
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,320
why you're here okay so this is Nick I can do that I had been referred to your

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:43,040
podcast by by Chris who is the other listener and episode 135 was you had a

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,090
discussion about record and playback tools does it make sense to be writing

28
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,890
code now that recording playback is you know so effective and much less brittle

29
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,400
than it used to be and beyond that should we be specifically targeting

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,320
recording playback at developers and marketing to developers and so I'd reached

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,070
out to you both and said hey it's kind of what we're doing and we we kind of

32
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,320
agree and so here we are it's controversy out there but maybe not in

33
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,840
here but I yeah let's that's this is this is gonna be good and I'm gonna use

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,640
this as ammo because not next week but the week after no no no calendar wrong

35
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,550
next week next week I am giving an AMA and ask me anything at test bash home

36
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,550
and I will be talking about the future of test automation well I will be sharing

37
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,110
my opinions about many of these things we'll be talking about today which is

38
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,270
great gives me it gives me ammo and food for thought and and plants my brain with

39
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:51,550
all the things that that sound crazy coming out of my mouth until I hear

40
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:55,950
other people saying oh yeah that's that's what we do you're cool let's

41
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,260
start with this question maybe this is one because I haven't done a ton of this

42
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,300
is purely purely based on my limited experience some of the new tools that

43
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,300
are out there and then writing you animation years and years ago and then

44
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,900
watching people struggle and struggle and struggle with getting Selenium to

45
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,260
run some tests that end up being flaky in the long run so talk to me about my

46
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:26,780
belief that record and playback has gotten to a maturity where we perhaps don't

47
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,620
need to handcraft UI tests in Selenium anymore am I am I in the ballpark with

48
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,620
that or am I out to lunch is that today a year from now like what do you think of

49
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:45,040
when I when someone crazy like me makes that statement yeah I can answer that so

50
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,160
I think number one we're definitely biased because we've built a tool to

51
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,420
to handle that so we definitely do believe that that's the case I think

52
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:59,390
the the thing about it is that when you think about the the actual process of

53
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,670
creating Selenium tests you're taking user actions and translating that into

54
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,670
code and then that kind of process can be very painstaking I had done it myself

55
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,110
my background is as a developer and kind of doing it I've seen kind of like how

56
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,350
you know unit testing component testing integration testing and end testing and

57
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,470
then testing the code base and then testing always felt like a poor

58
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,710
abstraction layer to me because unit testing is you're testing little bits of

59
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,150
function it's the perfect abstraction layer because the interface is code for

60
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,870
a function for integration testing there's a lot of great tools for it and

61
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,150
for things like H you know like API testing of a HTTP server or something

62
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,150
code is a good abstraction layer because you can represent HTTP calls

63
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,590
well in code for replicating what a user actually does it never felt like a great

64
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,950
way of doing it so I think the approach of recording your user actions and as

65
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,030
long as those that recording as high fidelity it actually records things that

66
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,230
can be you know replicated I personally think that is a better approach to

67
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:12,590
building those kinds of tests hey I think he's saying I'm not completely

68
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,950
out of my mind and that's that that's I'll call that a win for a Friday so he

69
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:24,310
mentioned a technical answer to that question right he didn't mention anything

70
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,830
around psychological evaluation which I doubt he's qualified for so I'm not quite

71
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:35,560
leaving that one off the table definitely not qualified it's

72
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,560
interesting so you're selling a product on this line and I'm on your

73
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,480
website like the the marketing that I am I am seeing right now seems to be

74
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:53,640
targeting sort of the the manual tester audience which is kind of more of the

75
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:59,080
traditional audience for recording playback tools what's your marketing

76
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,760
shift like so Todd I heard you just say that yeah you know what we think the

77
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,100
capabilities are there for for for dev to do this on their own what sort of

78
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,820
distinction that I'm seeing are you are you still primarily sort of targeting

79
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,140
the the manual test audience are you going to dev what's the strategy shift

80
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,900
let me jump in first because I disagree with you Brent I think it like I went

81
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,780
through their documentation and they go into details that the air quilt manual

82
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,980
tester would not be interested in so I think they're trying to cover the whole

83
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,260
audience but but now that I've I'm actually the actual expert who actually

84
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,100
knows what they're talking about I'm gonna shut up with you guys go what I

85
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,940
would say number one is I'm I consider myself a developer but not a marketer so

86
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,620
the marketing language that you see on the language on the site is mainly me

87
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,980
and I'll take the blame for it our tagline there is automation that anyone

88
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,500
can use but it doesn't really speak to any one particular person I think the

89
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,500
the why we think that we're a developer a tool that developers would

90
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,180
use it because developers are using it like of our customer base right now

91
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,980
roughly it's hard to say but about a third are Estets and QA testers a third

92
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,340
are developers and then the other third is basically everybody else in our

93
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,740
organization so like a smaller organization that just any old person

94
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,820
might be testing manually and now they're you know automating automating

95
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,980
that so so yeah just kind of it it I think the reason why that developers are

96
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:43,660
using it is because the recording fidelity is good enough that it saves

97
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,260
them time and also because we're developers and we we built it for our

98
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,540
own need so I think some of that like you know scratching your own itch came

99
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,660
into play why you see it's why you see the documentation is kind of like so

100
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,500
extensive like you would see with like a any old API yeah and I like it being

101
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,940
for everyone's and I think you in my opinion it is the website is written

102
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,100
that way I was in a panel discussion maybe three weeks ago I can't remember

103
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,220
the last 15 months for Evan a blur for me not sure about you and I mentioned

104
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,460
that I knew of developers that were using these I hate to even call them

105
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,700
recording playback you know Brett and I grew up in test in the 90s when

106
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,220
recording playback tools were just so awful like you you were it was a it

107
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,940
was a stigma against you if you even mentioned them but again they're not

108
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,860
the same anymore but anyway the point is I mentioned that we're talking about now

109
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,540
that record and playback tools are actually useful I see developers using

110
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:49,180
them it caused a mental shift in more other people on the panel said I never

111
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:56,160
thought of developers using these things this is making me rethink a lot of

112
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,320
stuff and I've taken great because I there's something to it I'm so glad to

113
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,510
hear that that developers are using your tool I think it's good one of the things

114
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,710
I'm talking about in modern testing with Brent and I is again we're not inventing

115
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:16,470
anything we're just talking about the things that are already happening and

116
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,910
one of those is developers owning more and more and in some cases the vast

117
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,310
majority are all of the testing being done for a product not saying testers

118
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:30,230
aren't needed but in some products the contact dictates that the developer can

119
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,910
do all of the testing including that bit of UI testing they need to do and they

120
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:42,010
can do it in a quick and reliable and repeatable format hallelujah yeah it's

121
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,850
pretty cool to see like when we started the company like we had I hadn't had any

122
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,600
experience with it we had evaluated some record and playback tools but hadn't

123
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,400
really had a great experience with it but it's cool to see people using it

124
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,960
like you know people that I was in their shoes a couple years ago I think with

125
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,800
when developers are using it the way I the two ways I see it is it's either the

126
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,440
dev team themselves there isn't a tester in the organization so the dev team kind

127
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,320
of owns their own tests like they would like a unit or integration test or

128
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,520
there's a testing organization and they kind of set the framework and guidelines

129
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,920
and then the developers are creating still creating for their own

130
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,600
applicant part of the application that they own but you know the tester is

131
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,360
saying okay this is when you would want to use reflect this is when you want to

132
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,960
have a component level test or API test or whatever one of the things I talk

133
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,920
about frequently is just pairing that developer with that tester and

134
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,400
thinking about all the testing needs to get done then dividing it up one other

135
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,200
thing to call out and again not trying to just plug everything about what

136
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,520
you're doing because honestly I hadn't heard of your tool reflect until you

137
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,120
email me I'm looking over your docs it's like oh thank God someone gets it like I

138
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:03,640
just I saw the like the test you should create which is one of the things

139
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,600
eventually I'm weaving a story together here but my brain isn't keeping up I

140
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,840
am part of an organization I was until recently that very large organization with

141
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,920
no dedicated testers and but we'd a handful of people are coaches consultants

142
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,320
helping helping the team do better testing understand what testing they need

143
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,710
to do and our VP would sometimes ask me for our listeners today you've heard the

144
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:36,230
story before but he'd ask what how is our team doing a testing and I say they

145
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,120
do all the testing they know how to do and which implies the good news they do

146
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,560
testing but there's obvious they have some unconscious incompetence I mean to

147
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,480
work on that but in your tests you should create section it's so common

148
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,600
sense to like Brent and I but maybe not to a developer brand new to testing

149
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,160
like here here's your core workflow here are the things are gonna stop you from

150
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,840
making money you need to be able to log in and register and go through the

151
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:09,040
main workflow and yeah those are good things that you should automate because

152
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,960
you want to test those through the UI that makes sense and you want to make

153
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,280
sure they work otherwise you're not making any money and of course you can

154
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,200
use you'll have monitoring in place to make sure it's scale you know everybody's

155
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,720
getting through the workflow but but it just it's just a common sense that

156
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,440
sometimes missing from some of the marketing is out there so so kudos for

157
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,280
that and that's maybe sort of a add-on to Brent's original question I

158
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,360
think I think the the the direction how you're marketing the website is

159
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,400
actually very good I'm gonna stop looking at it so I can ask the questions

160
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,880
I wanted to ask versus go through your website right anything to add before I

161
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:49,840
wrote keep on rolling through here I feel like you should send me to the bar

162
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,940
for beers while you actually talk to these folks so I'll shut up go on

163
00:13:53,940 --> 00:14:00,850
Brett yeah except you're also the the tech for the podcast so that kind of

164
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:09,830
puts the podcast in harm yeah and to be clear like I wasn't making a judgment

165
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:17,310
call around how you're marketing the the and since Todd admitted credit slash

166
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,790
blame for it like I was using the opportunity to say you were wrong Brent

167
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,310
that's all yeah yeah but let's let's focus on our guests and then you can you

168
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,450
can leave the bridge abuse for a future podcast you probably exceeded quota for

169
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:39,690
this one already I have written down a written down a bunch of things in a bunch

170
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,530
of different ways we could connect to these two other other sort of topics

171
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:52,010
like first off I see like one on on your blurb where you request additional

172
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,270
information like the the headline I'll say I love this one and Alan will

173
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:02,110
absolutely know why like ready to accelerate your testing efforts is the

174
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:07,270
key highlighting question right in one of our mottos is that the goal of

175
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:14,150
testing our goal of our podcast is to help people accelerate the achievement of

176
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,190
shippable quality and then third I don't know if you guys have had an

177
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:26,200
opportunity to read this but what is now becoming just basically one of our

178
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,640
favorite pieces of literature is just a book called accelerate are you both

179
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:38,670
familiar with this book no I'm not I'm not either oh well I'll just say given

180
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:46,510
your your role I highly recommend that you read it it's so one of the things

181
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,590
that's highlighted so it was it's done by a PhD Nicole Forsstrom and I forget

182
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:58,150
her partner the co-author of the book but then what they did is they went

183
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,590
through and deeply analyzed they did they did a bunch of scientific studies

184
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,970
research papers and then took that and turned it into a book one of the

185
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:12,930
statements that they call out is actually dead teams who own their own

186
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:21,110
automation are significantly more or rather the products where the dev teams

187
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:28,660
own their own automation those products are significantly higher performing than

188
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:36,240
those products that don't and the the rationale is on that one is

189
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:43,820
essentially the separation of duties by forcing your dev team to own the test

190
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,860
it holds them accountable and then they maintain that could be better more

191
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,360
frequently etc go ahead I have a question for you on that Brent yeah I think do

192
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,240
you think that's a capacity thing like do you think that teams that put

193
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,560
automation on the devs just have more horsepower to create more more

194
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,800
automation or do you think it's like you said the kind of separation of

195
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:15,120
church and state like just testing what you own means that you're just somehow

196
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:23,420
implicitly gonna test it better so what's your take on that so so my take is

197
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,780
based off of personal experience so years ago I spent the majority of my

198
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:35,750
career as a as a middle manager in QA but I've always been super technical I

199
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:42,930
have patents on test automation there's an exam then I left enjoying death in a

200
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:49,010
point in time when I took on a dev manager role in the Bing organization so

201
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:54,050
I'm here at Microsoft this is my Microsoft office hopefully I don't have

202
00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:05,810
anything our listener can't see it right it looks different yeah so I

203
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm one of the last messages that actually has an office anyway so I made

204
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,250
that move and it was during a time where Microsoft was making a shift towards

205
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,530
combined engineering sort of beginning the process and so I started on the

206
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:29,320
dev team no testers whatsoever coming from tests and I had a mix of people

207
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,600
who came from the old-school dev and a mix of people who came from the old

208
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:42,900
school test and I turned them into a high functioning dev team and the big

209
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,900
secret sauce that I encountered was that test role was a sort of mitigate risk

210
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:55,140
and in a world where you're doing services as an example there are other

211
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,220
strategies so we we we actually learned that we can mitigate risk very rapidly

212
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:07,830
by shifting to a like a Kanban model and so for example if I had one in good

213
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:12,430
continuously shipping if I had one thing that shipped out the small chunk of code

214
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:16,950
it wasn't like a scrum model where I would be integrating at 11 p.m. the

215
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,590
night before and then breaking everything the next day it's constantly

216
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:26,300
shipping and so it's suddenly everything was on the floor in the next morning

217
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,740
we know exactly what it was it was this one thing which we could quickly revert

218
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,460
and then go okay what test did we miss why did this go out etc like so in that

219
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:45,970
world I never actually discovered I needed it I had a need for a test someone

220
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,690
that that safety net that checks things beforehand and then as we grew grew

221
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:59,010
further we realized things like TDD or or even things like using having the dev

222
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:06,370
owning the test cases basically one inherent thing and maybe you will agree

223
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:12,330
I'm looking specific so make do you have a dev background at all I know I have a

224
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:19,090
a operations degree so I studied supply chain theory of constraints

225
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:26,730
Ellie are who gold red we love theory of constraints yeah new podcast topic yeah

226
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,410
we could talk for hours about that and so for me you know not to make

227
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,210
essentially the answer the short answer is no but the long answer is I've always

228
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,290
been in software I've always sold software I used to sell primarily to

229
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:43,570
marketers and then when I moved back into when I moved into this world and I

230
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,370
joined up with Todd and the rest of the team who we all worked together at a

231
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:53,170
previous startup called cure late I suddenly realized like oh wow this is

232
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,930
supply chain management this is theory of constraints this is so I don't have the

233
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,450
any of the technical skills to actually make anything useful happen but I can

234
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,850
understand it and talk about it a bit technical skills are a dime a dozen you

235
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:14,090
got that so let me redirect because so then I'll just specifically ask Todd on

236
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:19,930
this because I'm actually curious is this a universal truth so from my

237
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:28,690
experience this idea that working smarter not harder really resonates with

238
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:34,130
with the dev facility or the dev community or put it in a different way

239
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:39,250
developers are inherently lazy yeah that's a much better way to put I don't

240
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,530
like that with smarter that's all BS but acknowledging that developers are

241
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:50,050
lazy 100% behind that yes and so first there's gonna be resistance when you try

242
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:56,710
to get them to take over test but if you can't continue to push and enforce that

243
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,310
then really magical things happen because of this principle that they're

244
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,190
lazy do you want to do the least amount of work possible and if they realize

245
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:11,230
that they can't escape this work then they start thinking through okay how can

246
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:17,350
I do this how do I get the right abstractions in place how do I leverage

247
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:22,830
tools that where I just do it once and then it magically resolves itself from

248
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,870
on out I think and I'm gonna go ahead I'm I'm gonna let you finish

249
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:35,380
I'm gonna wait no I hear Alan answer well because you like for Babylon forever

250
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,460
and I lost interest I have said before that the industry has a unhealthy

251
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,780
infatuation with UI automation and I think that if we would have let like one

252
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,860
of the reasons we're in this conundrum and why we need products like yours and

253
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,380
and all your competitors not gonna single anybody out here is that and

254
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,380
that we need developers to own this stuff is because it's because developers

255
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,020
hadn't had to own it is why we've created this huge bottleneck of huge

256
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:13,300
number of these handcrafted on a UI automation that are generally flaky

257
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,740
because of the nature of UI the UI behind it if devs would have owned it it never

258
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,780
would have got to this stage because we let separate teams own that stuff

259
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:28,590
completely we're in the inefficient cesspool we're in but go go a commentary

260
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:34,070
over go on go on guests we have guests on the podcast today hey I sort of agree

261
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:39,630
and sort of disagree with it I think I think the I agree with the sentiment I

262
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,990
think like a lazy developer like laziness little bit of laziness or

263
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,910
somewhat laziness is like a good trait in a developer I certainly have it like

264
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:52,950
I'm a procrastinator so that's that's a sort of a way it's a subset of

265
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:59,590
laziness but what my experience was the last startup that Nick and I both worked

266
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:05,270
at was those actually did own end-to-end testing and we did it all manually and

267
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:11,970
it was like it was felt like a huge it was valuable but it felt like a huge

268
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:16,490
waste of time in the sense that like you have these people who are like some

269
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,570
of the highest paid people in the organization doing going through a

270
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:26,540
spreadsheet and clicking on things every time there's a deployment so you know that

271
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,340
I think the question the question is like why does that happen and I've talked to

272
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,460
you know we have had plenty of people that we talked to you that they were in

273
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,260
the same boat like remember one one of our earlier customers we talked to them

274
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,500
and said yeah we deploy twice a week we have this 80 page word document that

275
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:48,540
will go through before the deployment I think the I think the reality is that

276
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:57,340
the tools are the tools just weren't good enough like you you have this kind of push and pull

277
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,140
between you need to ship code and you want to get enough testing in to find those bugs but

278
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,580
you can't have a developer hundred percent focus on test automation so what are you going to do

279
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,460
they can't get it done with five hours a week of writing selenium so they just stick with the

280
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,980
spreadsheet and maybe there's fits and starts where you have the test automation

281
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:26,360
project like starting up but it never gets done that was that was my experience so in that in that

282
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:35,540
world why was the answer not well let's just hire a tester we we went with an out in the last

283
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:41,780
company I worked at we went with the outsource crowdsource testing so that it sort of was it's

284
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:48,580
we sort of went that route that didn't work well for us because again we had the developers

285
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,940
writing the test cases and so the developers weren't great at writing for like a non-developer

286
00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:01,220
audience and then the testers who were you know it was different tester every time weren't ever

287
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,980
familiar with our application it was like a big pool of testers and so we got a lot of false failures

288
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:12,340
where it was it was either the developer didn't write the test case specific enough to like

289
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,060
reduce remove ambiguity or the the the tester wasn't familiar enough with application and you

290
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,900
know didn't know that this actually was the way it was supposed to work so we kind of tried that

291
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:28,200
and it didn't work well either there would be people in the industry that would argue that

292
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,480
what would work better or worse if you just had between the developers owning all those tests

293
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,840
and just actually hiring a tester to you know co-locator at least co we don't co-locate

294
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,760
locate during covid but hiring a full-time tester as part of the team to work with you same tester

295
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,540
working with you every day what are the pros and cons of that versus having the developers own

296
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,610
what you ended up with i i think that would have worked a lot better for us honestly like i think

297
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:02,660
the the pros definitely the tester becomes a as long as it's their setup within the organization

298
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,020
like the right way they become an expert on the application and so they are not dependent on

299
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,860
developers or product managers or whatever to build the test cases beyond just like

300
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,660
hey i need to know like what the new functionality is coming so i can build the test cases for it

301
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:23,060
i think that the con in that case is just time it just seems like the test teams out of any

302
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:30,120
part of the organization time is the biggest limiting factor for them here's for the theory

303
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,440
of constraints comes into play go ahead yeah i was about to say nick how do you feel about that

304
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,760
from a from a constraint point of view yeah i it's something that i observe all the time

305
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,720
is that teams seem to have an abundance of capacity or at least plenty of capacity on

306
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,800
the developer side and then they go okay well i guess we should test some of this code

307
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:59,560
and then under capacity that they're under um you know staffed on the testing site and so i i

308
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:06,260
talk with a lot of teams that can create you know build code uh 10x faster than they can test it

309
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,460
and so in that situation when you talk about the startup that Todd and i were at before

310
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:18,740
we certainly could have brought a dedicated test team in but would there have been um the enthusiasm

311
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:25,780
to staff that team at the level that would be required to be able to um break it as a

312
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,860
bottleneck to be able to make tests to to not have testing impact the velocity of the overall dev team

313
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:38,660
and certainly my experience and i'm of the four of us here i'm the i'm the greenest grass i'm

314
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:46,040
the least experienced but certainly my experience is that a lot of leaders a lot of cto's

315
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:54,810
don't feel like they're getting enough value out of out of a code-based testing process or

316
00:28:54,810 --> 00:29:01,210
their current testing process because um you know they're they're not they're still not a

317
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,570
they're they're chucking resources at it they're they're in whatever way they're trying to solve it

318
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,650
whether that's a dedicated team of s-tets whether that's manual testers um and testing is still a

319
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:18,490
bottleneck like okay well how far do we have to how how how deep does my pocket have to be to

320
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,810
solve this problem uh and so i i think that's where the tar then and fits in the team here and

321
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:31,030
and other other tools like like these two that are in our space that's our advantage is you know

322
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,940
we can just do this faster and i think alan that was the impetus of the whole conversation last time

323
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,390
like what why would we be writing all this code if we if we don't have to like it has it reached

324
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:51,220
point where we don't have to and so yeah i think um i think i've gone down a rabbit hole of a tangent

325
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,940
here and i'm not sure where to get out of it tangents are part of the podcast so that's totally

326
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,340
fine but but i want to tell a story of systems thinking or theory of constraints gone bad from

327
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,420
my past and this is actually overlaps with probably all of microsoft so it'll it'll relate

328
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:13,260
to branch as well but there was a time in for several years microsoft had very much a one-to-one

329
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,860
developer to tester ratio a little bit less in some places a little bit more in others

330
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:23,740
and i remember i worked on link which was called communicator before then it eventually became

331
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:29,980
skype for business which was part of office so i gotta i got a little insight into the office

332
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:37,350
machine of test automation they had a one-to-one test ratio across a huge huge org so

333
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:42,790
thousand testers maybe more all writing almost all are writing lots of automation

334
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:50,500
the bottleneck was the flaky tests this is pre this isn't even web selenium stuff this is just

335
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,020
just flaky tests because of flaky tools uh flaky ownership all kinds of problems don't even go

336
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:02,260
into today but where the theory of constraints would maybe if we actually paused and stopped to

337
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:09,960
think about it we may have gone with a different approach to try and figure out how to handle that

338
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:18,810
bottleneck of testing when every day 90 of those testers spent the first three or four hours of

339
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:25,670
their day debugging failed tests to see if they were a false positive or not to see if there was

340
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:31,350
a product bug invent and then the the ones that weren't were investing their time in writing tools

341
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:37,510
to do automatic analysis of failed tests to try and figure out uh we had this afa automated failure

342
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:41,910
analysis to try and figure out if the failures were really failures if there are false positive

343
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:46,950
great reports about it and you know in hindsight i can look back at the time was like oh cool

344
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:54,150
this is cool technology afa but as i stop now and look back i go oh man that was bad that was

345
00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:00,150
really bad and i don't know how you feel about that brent but those experiences and then watching

346
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:04,710
what had happened over the years with dedicated test teams writing a lot of selenium i just knew it was

347
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:11,910
bad too so uh i want a time machine and go back to fix the things that i allowed to happen 10 and

348
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:17,910
15 years ago but in the meantime like i said a half hour ago in this podcast i'm glad that my

349
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:25,110
wild ideas about how we should approach this ui animation today aren't actually so wild so that's

350
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:32,310
cool but back back when i was a test manager i i actually had conversations with my boss very

351
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:43,450
similar to what nick was saying where he had a firmly held belief that the number of testers

352
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:52,340
he needed to ship his product under the constraints no matter what end was the number he needed was

353
00:32:52,340 --> 00:33:02,100
always n plus one right always and he felt like he was in a trap that he couldn't get out of and it

354
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:08,980
and it was it and as we hired more and more and then tried to solve more and more problems

355
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:16,340
like bigger problems i blew up alan was just talking about and then i was just thinking about

356
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:24,740
one very i'm not mentioning names to protect the innocent but one very big example was there was this

357
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:34,020
really important suite that was executed and nearly 75 percent of the tests pass without the product

358
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,980
being even installed right so it was the industry's fullest stories like that i think i think it was

359
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:45,060
brian merrick i could be wrong told the story could have been chem caner but someone told a

360
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:49,700
story about how something similar happened when the power was off in the test lab or something

361
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,340
similar to that fun stories hey um you were going somewhere never mind brent were you done

362
00:33:54,980 --> 00:34:00,740
we we all have sort of stories uh i think we have stories on this one so is it right to assume that

363
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:05,860
at this point in time does reflect have special uh test specialists within itself

364
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:12,340
you mean do we have uh like s deaths or on our in our organization right dedicated to testing

365
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:18,300
so we're we're a team of five so we don't have any uh testers in our organization we have

366
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:25,260
two engineers myself my co-founder and nick who's uh business development sales oh no

367
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:34,460
yeah you're fine you're fine i'll see myself out no no no totally yeah i mean okay so you have no

368
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:40,700
testers right one of our wait hold on a second no the way you're saying that is is is setting

369
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:44,780
up the wrong thing like one of our principles one of the things we've discovered and not and

370
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,180
again our modern testing principles aren't anything we've invented they're about what we're seeing

371
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:57,100
happen in the industry and we see is depending on context and knowledge there are many examples

372
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:01,980
where you don't need a dedicated testing dedicated testing specialist on your team you're cool in our

373
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:09,500
eyes it was just a fact i wasn't judging i know you sounded judgy we we felt judgment we did

374
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:17,740
yeah yeah all right so so let me set the space let me let me set the bar uh because now i'm going

375
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:24,780
to say something super judgy all right so you guys don't have any testers it's like so clearly

376
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,260
you understand and you probably get this from your customer feedback

377
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:34,940
that you don't care about the quality of your product and are actually shipping crap to your

378
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:43,420
customer branch shut up right no no no it's tugging cheek i'm not actually accusing you but this is the

379
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:50,540
sort of crap that me and alan get all the time right so yeah but we're we're all we're all smarter

380
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,340
than those people well no so they're customers and so here i want to you want to bring in

381
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:03,660
bringing nick like what do your customers say who who are you targeting we started this off of hey

382
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,940
hey we do have a marketing plan to attack devs or market to to these dev camps

383
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:19,590
are they coming back are they feeling successful yeah yeah and obviously you wouldn't come on a

384
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:27,670
podcast and say no to that so maybe you're comfortable sharing like a horror story as well

385
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:36,550
to sort of balance it out yeah i guess i guess in terms of a horror story i'll certainly leave

386
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:41,830
that to todd because he has uh he has a longer history of horror stories potentially to draw on

387
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:49,750
but uh we we target um today we work with businesses of all sizes we work with like

388
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,230
large financial institutions we work with small teams of five or ten people our most sort of

389
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:04,660
common customer is a hyper growth startup with 30 to 100 employees in that sense they

390
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:13,420
are they understand we're a startup too and so if there are ever sort of chinks in the armor

391
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:18,140
we generally have a fairly forgiving crowd i would also say we have pretty high standards

392
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:26,220
um the i think being a testing tool requires that you have a pretty decent testing or at least

393
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,100
remedying process in place so yeah i mean todd i don't know if you want to speak to some of the

394
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:36,540
horror stories but in terms of numbers you know we just passed we're a young company but we just

395
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:45,020
passed our millionth test run um and and so we're uh i think we're certainly seeing people come back

396
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:52,100
to the well and and feel like the quality of the product um you know ultimately we're a team of five

397
00:37:52,100 --> 00:38:01,610
we have we have thousands of users hundreds and hundreds of paying customers and so the quality

398
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,370
that we're putting out there people what i mean to say is people have to teach themselves how to use

399
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:11,050
the tool and people have to come and adopt it and try it and like it and so quality is huge for us

400
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:17,450
because if you try it and it's broken you're not coming back um so yeah from the horror story

401
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:22,010
perspective though i will pass it over to todd and uh and uh and let him take the take the

402
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:28,250
bullet yeah uh definitely i definitely can share our story um i would also just add because so many

403
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:33,850
testers are users that's very helpful because it keeps us honest you know they you know they're

404
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,970
greater giving us bug reports and telling us you know have an eye for detail so that's that's helped

405
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:44,810
us um you know improve the product for sure um in terms of horror stories like what what are you

406
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:51,130
looking for brand is it it's like a a customer gone wrong or you know just an organization that

407
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:59,130
kind of seemed upside down what what what can i provide for you um no i actually so i'll just say

408
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:07,050
upfront i'm certain you're going to give me the the the horror story that that the audience would want

409
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:16,150
because i don't actually think there's one here right and see the the uh one of the arguments is

410
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:24,630
all known no we need we need testers within the team uh because number one first and foremost

411
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:32,630
devs can't test because they they they don't have objectivity they they you know we're asking devs to

412
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:40,310
test their own code and therefore like you're you're providing testing a testing product uh you

413
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:46,790
don't have testers hey brent you're bringing you're bringing our own baggage into their baggage they

414
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:57,420
don't have well they get it actually that's actually my point alan is you know what this is a startup

415
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:07,420
uh that's that's succeeding as best as i can tell uh doing exactly sort of the the the modern testing

416
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,980
yeah principal and what yes exactly and what i want to talk about for our last uh eight or nine

417
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:21,660
minutes here is another thing this is a variation in what i led with at the top but i believe that

418
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:29,660
the future of success and testing tools is to stop marketing those tools to testers and to begin

419
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,860
marketing and target of course you're for everyone and that's that's where the market

420
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:39,500
is that's totally good but i think the the future spoils comes to those who find a way to get the

421
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:44,380
developers interested in those testing tools and this covers all that that i'm conscious and

422
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,220
competent talked about and knowledge etc i think there's something huge there so uh you've had

423
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,420
success there it's wide open what are you doing like i didn't know what my question is it's really

424
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:02,020
just a statement how are you actually how are you getting developers to discover your product

425
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:08,260
because often they don't look for testing tools yeah so we uh it's a couple different ways so we're

426
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,300
a freemium product so people will just come on and start using it so by being a freemium product in

427
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,900
some sense you don't control who how people find you or you know you kind of do your best you try to

428
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,100
write relevant articles and kind of um get in front of people but people just seem to find us

429
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:29,380
and use it and the and the subset of them are sticky and part of that subset is developers

430
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:35,060
but we do go out and talk to cto's directly and so when we talk to a cto at an organization

431
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,220
some of those organizations are going to have a team of developers some of them are only going to be

432
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,580
you know or sorry team of developers and testers some of them are only going to be developers

433
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:51,860
and it's it's stuck with kind of both camps but i think if you're marketing a developer tool

434
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,700
like there's some things that you definitely need you need a freemium product number one

435
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:01,140
because devs aren't going to pay for something unless they can use it number two you need really

436
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:06,740
good documentation uh we think like ideally like with videos that's particularly helpful

437
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,580
and then it needs to be an intuitive enough product that's powerful enough for the the developer i

438
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:18,340
think that's probably where we're lacking right now is just the power we started out with building

439
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:25,300
something that try to do everything that it can do for you uh and you kind of what you lose

440
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:30,660
in expressability it does kind of automatically for you but as we had more of like the sdette

441
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:38,180
developer persona come in what we found is that they need that power in order to define exactly

442
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,500
what they're trying to do and so those are the kind of features that we're adding we're kind of

443
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,260
approaching it from like the standpoint of like what would like a testing ide look like you know

444
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,260
what would debugging a test look like very cool and the point i want to call out here just for

445
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:58,100
our listeners and our principles is is you have a product out there people are using it and you're

446
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,420
adapting it as you go based on their needs and that's that's where quality comes from right

447
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,420
because only the customer could evaluate whether your product is high quality or not

448
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,260
whether it's giving them value and the way you do that is you listen to them and give them what

449
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:18,540
they need yeah we we had to rethink some of our assumptions about it for sure yeah and

450
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,900
maybe it's worth pointing out that like we talk about these modern testing principles again we

451
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:27,180
didn't invent them we just tried to document what we're seeing and as we talk about them people go oh

452
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,940
yeah that's what we do you have a name what we're doing of course that makes sense what we hear

453
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,580
i don't know if you ever even looked at the modern testing principles but as i hear you talk

454
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:41,020
it's like yeah here's a company out of nowhere never heard of them they they didn't it just

455
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:46,540
made sense i think it's a probably a combination of smart development and having someone on staff

456
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,170
who knows theory of constraints will they want well it gives their credit to nick there

457
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,690
this is a career high point for me

458
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:02,170
yeah i mean it's thank you i appreciate that i mean i think i think it's still important to

459
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:07,210
have a product that's opinionated like we still we still take some pretty opinionated opinions

460
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:13,050
like for example in the products um you can actually add a step uh through the gooey like

461
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:17,690
you have to record it like there's no way to button to like click add step so everything's

462
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,930
done through our recorder uh and then another one is like we try to abstract away the concept

463
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:27,530
of selectors so you can't actually manually add a selector we generate them all automatically for

464
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:32,410
you with the idea that we feel like that's kind of like a subset of the testing problem where

465
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:39,930
we think we could solve it for the 90, 95, 99 percent case exactly don't get me started

466
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:47,130
so i don't i don't know if you were aware we did a podcast with hugs on on the podcast oh really

467
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:57,690
yeah so we alan alan made a statement it reached out the hugs hugs came on and we had it we ended

468
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:03,290
up having them this is this is worth this is worth calling out for our guests i made a statement i

469
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:08,410
found a blog post someone talked about how clever they were for solving a problem in selenium

470
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:15,610
and it was a 80 character selector statement that they used and i quoted it and said you know reason

471
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:21,530
number 435 why i don't like selenium people are excited about statements like this and i showed

472
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:28,390
that big big huge like and uh a whole bunch of people got really mad at me and again it's not

473
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:35,110
selenium's fault there are all kinds of ways to fix that no but i but but anyway he he caught

474
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,870
onto that thread then volunteered to come on the podcast and he was very gracious he wasn't mad at

475
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:44,390
us he he tried to pick a fight with us we did not fight we did not tried to bait us i guess

476
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:51,540
we did not bite and end up being a really good conversation yeah the and and i do think that he

477
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:58,420
he uh i mean i'm old and it was a while ago but i do think we got him to eventually eventually

478
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,780
agree that actually selenium was constructing a dysfunctional behavior particularly around these

479
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:13,540
selectors so yeah i i even based on the this the conversation we had with hugs i would actually say

480
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:20,170
he probably would would likely support the fact that you're blocking people from going that

481
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:26,710
direction right because your goal is you want the the the maintenance cost of these tests to be

482
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:33,350
zero yeah right you can go down this path you go down this path it's going to be non-zero almost

483
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:39,430
guaranteed yeah and the the best way to do that is to do things on behalf of the user as long as you

484
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:44,710
can get it right like the i don't want to knock on apple but like when siri gets it wrong that's an

485
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,430
extremely frustrating experience but you know when you have something that gets it right it's

486
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:54,390
a magical experience so it's like a higher bar to achieve it but that's that's what you can

487
00:46:54,390 --> 00:47:03,850
actually have you know a tool work for you instead of you kind of fighting the tool yeah yeah i was

488
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:08,170
excited to have you on here to talk about those two big questions around you know statements i have made

489
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:14,410
and and even if you didn't back me up uh i just really love the way like the engineering approach

490
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:19,450
like you got you are all taking the five of you at your company it's it's the way i think

491
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:24,730
successful software is made and i think you've are also on the right track and remembering that

492
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:31,530
developers are part of who you need to target and to hear that you have developers not testers well

493
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:37,240
in addition to testers you have developers who are using your tool it's like yes yes this thing that

494
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:41,320
i'm imagining in my head it's actually true and i didn't have anything to do with it it just

495
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,360
happened because it's the right thing to happen so that's awesome any closing words from you all

496
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:53,560
before we call it a friday afternoon slash evening yeah i'll say hey uh thank you very much for

497
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:59,160
joining and actually we haven't talked about it did you part of your closing words do you want

498
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:06,200
to go ahead and plug your product sure yeah so so reflect is uh freemium tool you can go to reflect

499
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:12,840
dot run and sign up and uh use it right away uh i would say the biggest difference that we we have

500
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:18,840
is that the recorder uh runs in the browser and we try to make a frictionless experience where

501
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,160
you can start from zero and end up with a test in a couple minutes give us a try love to get your

502
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:28,360
feedback i guess i would only add to that the evidence that you can create a test in a couple

503
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:34,440
of minutes without writing code is proven by the layman of the podcast me being able to create

504
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,760
hundreds of tests at this point uh and so uh you know from uh for what it's worth i think the

505
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:45,000
proof has been in the pudding from that end but but guys it's been really great to chat with you

506
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,520
and thanks for having us on to you know talk about allen's uh stroke of genius and our our hurry to

507
00:48:52,520 --> 00:49:00,520
catch up and make it happen for there's a phrase we never hear yeah it hurt my head i'm confused

508
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:08,040
as to what you're talking about all right then we'll uh again our our immense pleasure having

509
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:14,280
you on uh incredible conversation thank you for being here and we'll see everybody next time
