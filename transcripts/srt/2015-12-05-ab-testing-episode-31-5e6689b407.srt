1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,830
Kids, this is Alan.

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,790
And this is Brent.

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,310
Welcome to episode 31 of A, B, Testing.

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,550
Hello, everyone.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,470
Hey, Brent, you know why I made that old man voice?

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,310
Yes, I do.

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,520
Because I'm an old man.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,720
You know what?

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,520
I don't feel a day over 50.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,840
Actually, I'll talk to you back.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,240
I feel exactly a day over 50.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,480
It's no fun if you pick on yourself

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,640
before I have a chance to.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,520
Preemptive picking.

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,440
I had already planned to come in and announce

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,160
that a big event had occurred that I am now.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,240
So two days ago, I was, you were only 8% older than me.

18
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,680
And now you're 11.

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,240
So as far as I'm concerned, I got younger.

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,960
Thank you.

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,100
So is this a chapter out of How to Lie with Statistics?

22
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,740
Which is a very good book by the way.

23
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,940
It is a fantastic book.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,330
And I don't think it's in there.

25
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,810
All right, we'll add that too.

26
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,570
It's How to Lie with Charts.

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,250
Or maybe it's just Dumb Stuff, Brent says.

28
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,370
But yes, I turn 50.

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:23,090
I share a birthday with the infamous Ozzy Osbourne.

30
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,410
And someone else who came in.

31
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,410
Holly Marie Combs from Charmed and Picket Fences

32
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,350
and some other shows.

33
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,410
Oh.

34
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,660
She didn't wish me happy birthday.

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,190
I was hoping for a shout out, but nothing.

36
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:44,070
I spent some time on History Channel's web page on a day

37
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,070
in history.

38
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,590
I know.

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,030
You had these stupid things like, oh, that one's been around

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,910
longer than the door transplant.

41
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,620
Hopefully you're around long enough for a brain transplant.

42
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,780
I did actually, though, the one on the Vietnam War,

43
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,380
I did wonder, do you actually have any memories of it?

44
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,220
Yeah, I was there.

45
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,300
I was what they called the young.

46
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,640
So my dad, I don't even know if you know this.

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,050
So my dad went into the Vietnam War, right handed,

48
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,210
and came out left handed.

49
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,410
He got hit by a mortar shell.

50
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,730
OK, that's a trip.

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,850
This is a downer, I know.

52
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,490
But he got hit by a mortar shell,

53
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,130
and he had half of his body paralyzed.

54
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,530
Now, it's a great story.

55
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,770
I grew up with this as a father.

56
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,530
And one of the things my dad does,

57
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,650
which has always been an inspiration for me,

58
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,130
is he calls the rest of us two-handers.

59
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,570
And ain't no two-hander going to be able to do something

60
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,930
he can't.

61
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,930
My dad, he got dealt a really crappy deck of cards

62
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,930
and survived it.

63
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,250
This all happened, obviously, before I was born.

64
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,650
But I do know his timeline.

65
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,670
And I'm like, hey, wait a minute.

66
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,190
Alex, or not Alex, that's my son.

67
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,950
Alan was four or five during that time period.

68
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,350
I wonder if he has any memories at all of Vietnam.

69
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:08,830
No?

70
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,670
The answer is no.

71
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,350
All right, then.

72
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,790
Shall we do our topics?

73
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,390
We got some mailbag and some other stuff to talk about.

74
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,790
Should I just jump right into my rant?

75
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,830
Go ahead.

76
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,430
All right.

77
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,590
I'm going to offend someone.

78
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,150
But it wouldn't be the first time on A-B testing, right?

79
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,390
No.

80
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,030
Is it someone that actually listens to us?

81
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,590
No, I don't know, probably.

82
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:38,810
So for full disclosure, I get the difference

83
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,730
between checking and testing.

84
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:49,650
I also get that 99.9% of the software engineering world

85
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,650
uses the encompassing verb testing,

86
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,230
Vrjarand testing, to describe things

87
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,200
that are technically checks.

88
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,440
And when I looked and I went and looked this up,

89
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,360
and even the authors of checking versus testing

90
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,520
say that testing encompasses checking.

91
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,480
Checking is a part of testing.

92
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,120
So it just irks me to no end.

93
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,560
Don't ever do this one of the three, or two of the three,

94
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,080
or three of the three.

95
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,600
None of y'all.

96
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,760
Like when someone says, I wrote some automated tests,

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,420
don't freaking get on Twitter and go,

98
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,820
don't you mean you wrote automated checks?

99
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,340
I've seen these.

100
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,580
No, they wrote automated tests.

101
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,780
They happen to be checking something that's fine.

102
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,820
Just this incessant need to correct people's use

103
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,970
of the word test is not helping your cause.

104
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,810
It's not.

105
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:56,360
It's kind of like saying, hey, Alan, I just got a new puppy.

106
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
And you coming back with, don't you

107
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,720
mean you got a German Shepherd?

108
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
You're like, stop.

109
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,610
Yeah, it's worse than that.

110
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,530
It's worse than that.

111
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,370
And then it gets worse.

112
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,850
Somebody who doesn't even like me, I can handle it.

113
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,410
And I'll flip it a little crap once in a while

114
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,210
because I get it.

115
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,490
But somebody who doesn't even know what they're talking about.

116
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,050
They see just random person happens

117
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,810
to mention the word testing when it could mean checking.

118
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,570
And they get jumped all over.

119
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,170
And then they make the argument of going,

120
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,450
well, isn't this just semantics?

121
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,010
And they go, words are important to communicate our ideas.

122
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,650
Words, we have to use the right words.

123
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:41,570
And it's like, give me a break, people.

124
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,490
You knew what they were talking about.

125
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,850
It was totally clear to you what they were talking about.

126
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:51,050
But you insisted on changing it so that only 1% of the world

127
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,250
would know what you were talking about anymore.

128
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,890
I mean, ah, stop it.

129
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,050
Just stop being an idiot.

130
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,850
I am.

131
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,610
So I am one of the people who will state words are important.

132
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,210
And I probably have on multiple people.

133
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,330
I completely agree that words are important.

134
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:15,570
But what is not important is a Nazi-style activist correction,

135
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,970
an active spell checker.

136
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,810
Dude, now no one's paying attention

137
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,690
to the wisdom behind what you're saying.

138
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,130
And they're just going, how do I get out of this meeting

139
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,450
with you, Douchebag?

140
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:30,970
Did you see my tweet yesterday, the day before?

141
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,930
Must have been the day before.

142
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,370
But every morning, I load up Feedly,

143
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,930
and I read through all my blog posts.

144
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,530
And for some reason, I subscribe to people that piss me off.

145
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,930
But often, even people that piss me off sometimes

146
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,930
say smart things.

147
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,570
But anyway, I came across, I can't

148
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,170
remember who wrote it, so sorry.

149
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,890
Another article about automated testing

150
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,330
and how we aren't really automated testing.

151
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,370
You're automated checking.

152
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,310
And testing can't be automated because testing

153
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,480
requires a human blah, blah, blah, same argument.

154
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,240
And I tweeted, in the time it took me

155
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,120
to read an article saying that testing can't be automated,

156
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,370
I could have wrote some automated tests.

157
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,130
And most people got the irony of that,

158
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,850
but I did have one person go, well,

159
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,010
I think you're talking about checking.

160
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,490
I don't get what you're saying.

161
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,210
So please, just don't be thick about it.

162
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,050
If you're one of the three, yes,

163
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,970
it's good to recognize that there is verification

164
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,410
and investigation.

165
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,770
And it's important that you have

166
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,970
that discussion with people.

167
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:35,090
But randomly correcting people is just frickin' idiotic.

168
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,210
So knock it off.

169
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,890
Case closed.

170
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,330
It is.

171
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,450
My part of the case is closed.

172
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,250
I'm ready to move on.

173
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:42,770
No, it is.

174
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,810
And I'm off this topic, but you just said something.

175
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,570
So I saw your tweet, but it didn't interest me enough

176
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,450
to follow the conversation.

177
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:56,090
But that was almost hurtful.

178
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,120
The rabid wombat there.

179
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,920
Wombat!

180
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:08,040
What was their definition of testing then?

181
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,960
What gets lost?

182
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,040
And it's funny, I went back to the source.

183
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,960
Why can't I automate testing?

184
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,520
Because testing is a human activity

185
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,680
that requires judgment and intuition.

186
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,840
And that can't be automated?

187
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,560
No.

188
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,020
Of course it can.

189
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,100
Look, please don't make me go off into this hole.

190
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,080
I went back to the source, and I verified that.

191
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,560
And it's funny, when this thing first came out.

192
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
And me?

193
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,640
I said I always considered checking

194
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,120
to be a subset of testing.

195
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
And later they said the same thing,

196
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,200
which I don't think they listened to me at all,

197
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,320
but it makes sense when he's being logical.

198
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,360
So it's not one versus the other.

199
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,880
Checking is part of testing.

200
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,840
There's a part of testing that is simple verification.

201
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,900
Boolean verification.

202
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:08,410
But the followers of the model seem to think it's a versus.

203
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:13,010
And they go to all ends to, it's almost like it's an agenda.

204
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,810
It's just stupid.

205
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,850
There are much more important things

206
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,370
to have semantic discussions about,

207
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:19,690
agreeing that words are important.

208
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,570
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

209
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,570
It's a good thing we only have three listeners,

210
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,950
because I'm glad that we don't have

211
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,650
to deal with the problem of having polarized alkalite.

212
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,770
You know, it's OK.

213
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,450
Echo our words back to us.

214
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,530
If we drop to two, it's cool.

215
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:40,810
I'm just like, man, I would feel so responsible

216
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,730
if I had a bunch of, frigging, thoughtless disciples following

217
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,370
me around holding up this testing versus checking battle.

218
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:49,890
Yeah.

219
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:56,580
And it's from the same crowd that recognizes,

220
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,540
rightfully, the power of critical thinking

221
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,340
and how important critical thinking

222
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,820
is for good testing, investigation,

223
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,220
and actually for any knowledge work in general

224
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,940
to stay up on the soapbox.

225
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,190
To not recognize it in this case, it's hypocritical.

226
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,390
Completely agree.

227
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:15,870
All right.

228
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,570
So let's talk about something not from the soap.

229
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:22,250
Actually, everything's from the soapbox, right?

230
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,210
Drent and I just had lunch.

231
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,690
Oh, it was good.

232
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,570
It was fantastic.

233
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,930
Dintag Phong plus plus.

234
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,090
All right.

235
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,770
But we were talking over lunch about some of the challenges.

236
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,370
Brent and I, Brent has been on Agile teams.

237
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,770
He's helped teams transfer to Agile.

238
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,450
And he's back on the horse again,

239
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,770
helping a team become, do adaptive software development,

240
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,290
being able to react to change.

241
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,370
And we were kind of talking about the challenges that

242
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,530
happen, moving from a predictive or any sort of even

243
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:59,210
iterative software process to an adaptive process

244
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,690
or your data driven, you're driven

245
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,450
by the need for change versus needs for stabilization

246
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:08,250
periods, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

247
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,190
Ultimately, it comes down to, any time

248
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,630
there's an established system, it's really freaking hard

249
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,740
to change to a new established system.

250
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,820
True.

251
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,640
Right.

252
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,520
So the challenge, right.

253
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,240
I don't know if you've done much research on this.

254
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,770
But do I look like I do research?

255
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,290
No.

256
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,490
Yeah.

257
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,250
You're too old.

258
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,170
Even if you did, you'd forget it the next day.

259
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,570
I got to be all kids.

260
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,290
Did you see me tweet?

261
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:44,730
I got my application to apply for AARP in the mail.

262
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,250
Booyah.

263
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:45,770
Discounts.

264
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,270
Out.

265
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,850
Lunch is on Alan from here on out.

266
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,650
Yeah, so I have a bunch of friends

267
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,090
who are Agile consultants, Agile coaches.

268
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,130
I myself am a coach.

269
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,280
And we spent a lot of time talking

270
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,000
about how do we help people do this transition.

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,970
Because it is, quite honestly, almost all of these problems

272
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,210
come down to people problems.

273
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,940
It's almost always cultural.

274
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,020
Jerry Weinberg may have a quote about that.

275
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,860
He does.

276
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,650
The exact quote, actually.

277
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:33,290
So the challenge that, so my particular team today,

278
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,540
there's a new challenge I've never faced.

279
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,980
I have had the whole team running on a single board,

280
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,060
which I'm very successful at getting.

281
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,660
But in this particular case, there's also

282
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,500
five separate managers running.

283
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,610
And all of these guys, they don't have a business first

284
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,210
mentality.

285
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,670
They have a my business first mentality.

286
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,380
And it is hard to get them to.

287
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,220
Can you clarify what that means?

288
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,260
Or actually an example.

289
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,700
So I think I know what you mean,

290
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,300
but I don't want to jump down the wrong path.

291
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,660
I'll give you an example.

292
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,900
One of my peers today.

293
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,340
And none of my team, actually.

294
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,790
None of them are any of the three.

295
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,830
An example today is, so those who follow Kanban,

296
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:37,190
you know that there's this process called limiting WIP.

297
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,430
And we limit WIP, including what goes in the ready column.

298
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,670
So we do a backlog grooming process every week.

299
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,150
And we adjust this.

300
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,310
But we have this thing called a swim lane or a rail

301
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:51,150
that we call the interrupt rail.

302
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,990
So if something new comes up and it's not

303
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,950
time for the planning meeting, and you

304
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,870
need to get somebody started on something,

305
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,990
even though two days ago we just went through backlog

306
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,590
grooming, it happens in our space.

307
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,150
We're an analytics team.

308
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,350
So we have to operate at the speed at which decisions need

309
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,010
to be made, which is hourly at times.

310
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,250
But this interrupt rail's purpose in life

311
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:26,200
is to limit how, to create a limit on how much our time can

312
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,830
be interrupted versus allowing the plan to move forward.

313
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:36,540
Well, he had like five things he

314
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,530
wanted to put into the interrupt rail.

315
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,470
And he wanted to understand, because he

316
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,450
has all of this pressure from other folks

317
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,410
to get this bug done, get this thing fixed,

318
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,010
get this stuff done.

319
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:57,920
And he's missing the old days where he could just do bugs,

320
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,480
allow bugs to get deferred, have a stabilization period in which

321
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,860
he fixes it.

322
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,980
And the thing that he also wanted

323
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,420
was to increase the WIP on the interrupt

324
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,900
and be able to get his team.

325
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,520
And he's like, I have two projects,

326
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,300
and I have five people.

327
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,660
So I need to get these guys moving forward.

328
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,820
I have this huge urgency.

329
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,540
Well, the thing is, is right now,

330
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,420
the planning phase, its purpose in life is we have commitments.

331
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,900
So I think, do you follow the semester planning?

332
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,600
Are you in, if I said we're about to end sulfur,

333
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,900
does that mean anything to you?

334
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,400
Nope.

335
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,260
OK.

336
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,300
So most of CNE, and I believe also most of ASG,

337
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,360
do six-month planning cycles at a division level.

338
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,860
That ends in December.

339
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,540
So there's still several team commitments

340
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:06,940
that my boss has made that we haven't accomplished.

341
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,500
So what's happening, so I created a process

342
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,500
so which we could resource share and get

343
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,220
those goals accomplished.

344
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,960
One of my peers, he has five open positions,

345
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,280
but he only has one person in it right now.

346
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,750
And he's where things that we've committed

347
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,950
haven't gotten across the wire.

348
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,960
Well, this peer I was talking to,

349
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,980
he is more focused on what he has to deliver

350
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,800
versus what the team has to deliver.

351
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,520
This is what I mean by the business priority versus my.

352
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,130
It's like 17 on the list.

353
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,150
And we're back.

354
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,610
I made Brent stop partway through

355
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,130
because my audio equipment was being mean.

356
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:50,550
The signals are a lot better now.

357
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,590
I'm not sure how the first half of this podcast

358
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,370
is going to sound.

359
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,350
Yeah, we're good now.

360
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,630
We have normal levels now.

361
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,790
Brent was getting smaller and smaller and disappeared.

362
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,670
And we tried a bunch of things, and I just

363
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,130
plugged into a different USB port on my Lenovo laptop.

364
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,310
And we're good to go now.

365
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,150
Wow.

366
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,650
All right.

367
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,240
Were you testing or checking your equipment?

368
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
OK.

369
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,800
I am really worried now that the first half of our podcast

370
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,660
is going to sound like poo.

371
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,620
Because now I have actual levels that make sense.

372
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,340
I can always adjust them later.

373
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,620
You want to start over and just make this one a shorty?

374
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,740
No, I don't want to start over.

375
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,820
We'll make it work.

376
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,540
So I may just publish in the second half.

377
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,940
So when we last left off, Brent was babbling,

378
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,060
talking about transitioning from predictive to adaptive.

379
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,100
And take it away, Brent.

380
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,220
Yeah.

381
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,900
I'm not going to go.

382
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,180
Am I doing that all over again?

383
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:45,900
No.

384
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,220
OK, God.

385
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,450
OK.

386
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:51,100
Yeah, it's hard.

387
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:51,580
All right.

388
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,460
Next subject.

389
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,300
I think we've talked a lot about organizational changes.

390
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,020
I'm not going to dive deep into that.

391
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,140
But it's tough for people to see.

392
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,020
There's two things in play here.

393
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,460
One is that it's easy to go back to what

394
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,780
you're comfortable with.

395
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,420
Yep.

396
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,100
And that's one of the harder things, fighting inertia.

397
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,780
The effort that people see the value.

398
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,100
For me, when I see teams get to that stage where

399
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:20,440
they can truly be just adaptive, and it's fun.

400
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,160
Oh, it's fantastic.

401
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,360
I think it's motivating.

402
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,600
Because I go to the Dan Pink research on people

403
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,920
are motivated by progress, by seeing progress.

404
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,760
And you get to see so much of that.

405
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,160
And you don't, without a lot of the roadblocks

406
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,760
that come with debt.

407
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,640
But negative motivations almost always overpower positive.

408
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,720
And in this particular example, any place

409
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,560
where the hardest part for doing this transition for leaders

410
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,280
is to recognize that you will be happier.

411
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,320
You will have a more productive team

412
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,890
if you let go of command and control.

413
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,640
If you let your team decide, they're better suited.

414
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,700
They're better able.

415
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,380
And the facilities that we put in place

416
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,340
to allow you to prioritize or influence

417
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,880
what they have to choose between are enough.

418
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,160
Right.

419
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,640
There's a Steve Denning quote that I'm

420
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,360
sure I've mentioned to you 50 times.

421
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,440
But from his book, The Leader's Guide to Radical Management.

422
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,280
Give people a framework they can work in

423
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,680
and then get out of their way.

424
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,560
Yeah.

425
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,240
I love that.

426
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,640
I give them just enough one minute manager

427
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,320
apply, swoop in, and give them coaching when they need it.

428
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:35,960
But get out of their way.

429
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,080
Let people make decisions.

430
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,200
They're actually better right than you think they are.

431
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
It occurs to me.

432
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,270
It occurs to me just now what exactly is going on.

433
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,640
What's going on is there's a bunch of people

434
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,340
who are in leader roles, but there aren't leaders.

435
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,920
They're managers.

436
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,020
I don't know if that insight helps me solve this problem.

437
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,420
Brant, if there weren't hard problems for us to solve,

438
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,500
we wouldn't be employed.

439
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,980
I have plenty of other interesting problems

440
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,620
to solve than polling people from 1998 into 2015.

441
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:17,060
Yeah, that is a challenge.

442
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,860
We are in 2015.

443
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,780
One of the things.

444
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,660
For a few more weeks.

445
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,360
So for a few more weeks, 2015, we're

446
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,640
going to pull the team to a safe model in March.

447
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,120
That's right.

448
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,360
You're safe certified.

449
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,480
I am.

450
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,320
I'm going to take them to safe, which is for a team our size.

451
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,960
Safe really works well for 50 plus.

452
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,240
Again, we're half that.

453
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,870
It's overkill.

454
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,240
But I'm going to test because I suspect that the safe model will

455
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,400
strike a balance between how the managers want

456
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
to use command and control and create

457
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,440
a predictive environment.

458
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,280
This will allow them to be predictive in three month

459
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,240
cycles.

460
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
All right.

461
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,080
I haven't done this in a while.

462
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,040
And I don't know if I can do it in my second half

463
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,880
of my century on this planet.

464
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,950
But I'll try it.

465
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,930
Mailbag.

466
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,410
That was actually better than you usually did.

467
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:27,730
I was expecting the fact that we just came back from lunch

468
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:34,290
and trying to fight lunch coma would have slowed you down.

469
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:34,890
But it didn't.

470
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,930
No.

471
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:44,570
So Alan, we have at least three mailbag questions

472
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,450
and one handy tip.

473
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,050
OK.

474
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,190
I want to talk about the first question.

475
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,830
Alan sent out to the three, hey guys,

476
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,830
we're going to do two more.

477
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,670
Any questions?

478
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,320
And one of the questions that came back,

479
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,810
why are you guys so great?

480
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:10,470
And the answer is, is there an answer?

481
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,870
Because I don't think we're particularly great.

482
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,430
I said in Twitter, we're not.

483
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,430
Could there have been sarcasm there?

484
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,780
Perhaps.

485
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,980
OK, next question.

486
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,020
We do take all questions and address them in our podcast.

487
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,240
We don't always give insightful answers.

488
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,480
We will answer.

489
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,200
We will answer with something.

490
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,360
So I went to private school when I was younger.

491
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,800
Southern Baptist religious school.

492
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,520
And I remember my teacher.

493
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,320
So much is coming to light all of a sudden.

494
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,040
I remember my teacher saying, God answers all questions.

495
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:57,900
He either answers yes, no, or not going to answer right now.

496
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,700
And I'm like, magic eight ball at least has eight answers.

497
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,020
OK, now we pissed off two of the three.

498
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,460
Let's go on.

499
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,660
Did you see the one Twitter?

500
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,420
I heard the one hashtag.

501
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,540
Yeah, tweet one of the seven of the three.

502
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,700
Yeah, I thought that was cool.

503
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,620
That was from test.

504
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,460
Pappy.

505
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:18,980
Yes.

506
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,220
Who I met at Eurostar.

507
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,660
One of the seven of the three.

508
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,860
One of the seven of the three.

509
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,700
I like them.

510
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,970
So let's talk a little bit more about the I

511
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,210
don't think any team company outside of Microsoft

512
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:37,290
uses this term, but the term often used at Microsoft

513
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,050
is combined engineering.

514
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,890
Yep.

515
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:46,340
Meaning it's a software team without a dedicated test team.

516
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:46,980
So what is that?

517
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,740
And did you watch there was a talk at a local QA SIG

518
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,300
recently with someone who used to work at Microsoft.

519
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:55,900
Yep.

520
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,420
I don't know.

521
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,820
Jamie Campbell.

522
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,780
Yeah, I knew Jamie is worked in office.

523
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,500
And then I looked at the slides and I watched most of his talk

524
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,940
and I think there's some things we can touch on.

525
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,260
But did you do either of those?

526
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,340
I did both.

527
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Look at you.

528
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,140
Yeah.

529
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,880
I would say in first ever dual prepared A-B testing podcast.

530
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm so uncomfortable using the P word here.

531
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,560
Podcast.

532
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,720
Prepared.

533
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,360
Oh.

534
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:31,180
Yeah, so there was when I was going through it,

535
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,540
first I thought it was a challenge

536
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,700
because there was massive glare on the monitor.

537
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,180
Right.

538
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,140
I had to follow along on the slides outside.

539
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,300
I couldn't see the slides in the broadcast at all.

540
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,780
I was hunting around the QA SIG's website

541
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,780
and I was halfway through the recording

542
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,420
before I finally found the slides.

543
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,420
And then I just went, oh, sure.

544
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,940
That's what he was talking about there.

545
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,860
There was only one place where I thought

546
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:57,060
I was going to disagree with Jamie.

547
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,640
And then he came the very next slide.

548
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,680
You started talking about his view.

549
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,720
And I'm like, yeah, that's very much the lines.

550
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,240
Yeah.

551
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,280
And it was really more of his experience

552
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,280
on his team going through a move to combined engineering.

553
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,840
It's very similar.

554
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,040
Not only were they moving to combined engineering,

555
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,480
but they were moving away from predictive development models

556
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,120
towards adaptive.

557
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,480
And it's important.

558
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,120
And I said this before.

559
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,320
I'll say it again.

560
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,600
And one of the things I didn't like in his combined

561
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,640
engineering slides is why move because it's trendy.

562
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,320
And yeah.

563
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,120
I didn't get the Taylor Swift metaphor in his slides.

564
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,000
The point is you don't do anything

565
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,960
because other people are doing it because it looks fun,

566
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,280
because it's cool.

567
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,120
You want to, if you're going to make a change,

568
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,360
have it be for a reason.

569
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,240
And I think it's the other way around.

570
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,680
We want to be more adaptive.

571
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,680
And because of that, it makes sense

572
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,760
for us to do a unified engineering team

573
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,160
because it lets us be adaptive in these ways.

574
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:04,050
Now, we just talked about that.

575
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,770
Maybe I don't know if I actually got to a point on it.

576
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,540
Rarely.

577
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,060
Rarely.

578
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,520
Why do we want to be adaptive?

579
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,960
We want to be able to react to what customers want and need

580
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,160
faster.

581
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,450
Why?

582
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,770
We didn't have to do that before.

583
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,050
Why do we have to do that now?

584
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:24,250
Because now, if they're not getting what they want from us,

585
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,930
they have many other choices.

586
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,970
People are much more fickle in their choices

587
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,610
of web services, web providers, apps, et cetera.

588
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,410
If you don't give them what they want, you've lost them.

589
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,370
Yeah.

590
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:41,640
I can try out, pick any popular thing right now.

591
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:48,280
And I could try out free trials of that thing, 15 to 20 of them

592
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,320
in a span of three hours.

593
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,600
One of those guys are going to have the recipe

594
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,960
that I'm looking for.

595
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,720
Yeah.

596
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,160
You will lose.

597
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,400
Sometimes, even if it's something that they don't absolutely

598
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,000
need, like if they're a word processor,

599
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,480
I probably need a word processor.

600
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,800
And I don't like Word.

601
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,880
Used to be I could wait for the next version of Word.

602
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,680
Now I have lots of other open source and freely available

603
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,800
alternatives.

604
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,720
But there may be something like maybe a game

605
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,000
where they don't need it.

606
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,840
And they might not even be an alternative.

607
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,720
But if you're not giving them value

608
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,880
and reacting to what's working and what's not working

609
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,190
with them quickly, they're going to stop using your game.

610
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,190
Not for a competitor, not for another product.

611
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,390
People could stop using what you're making just

612
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,910
because it doesn't get them enough value or pleasure

613
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,350
or fun or whatever.

614
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,950
Yeah, some games have competitors.

615
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,470
Like we talked about League of Legends last time.

616
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:47,030
Some games don't.

617
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,590
But it's the second.

618
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:51,510
The point is, in the world today with apps

619
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,510
and the world living on the web, you

620
00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,030
have to be adaptive to make software today.

621
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,870
This might be too harsh to say, but the world in general

622
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,630
today has ADHD.

623
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:07,510
They're fickle.

624
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,670
And if you don't keep them engaged,

625
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,470
they're not going to come back.

626
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,710
And we shouldn't say the world because there's

627
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:21,730
telecom and military software that doesn't need to be adaptive.

628
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,090
Telecom?

629
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,850
I don't know about telecom, but I'll

630
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,010
go with the military one.

631
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:27,530
OK, fine.

632
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,410
I'll do that one.

633
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,650
I think if the FCC lifted limitations,

634
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:36,490
what made it easy for people to switch from Comcast

635
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,050
to Xfinity to Frontier.

636
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,650
Isn't Comcast, Xfinity, the same thing?

637
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,010
It is, yes.

638
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,490
So maybe not those two.

639
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,010
Yeah.

640
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:51,790
But if it was easy to switch back and forth, people would.

641
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,830
Yeah, one thing, getting back to Jamie's thing,

642
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,150
and combined engineering in general.

643
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:00,270
So the mailbag item, to be clear, the mailbag item

644
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:07,560
was around, hey, what is the efficacy of combined engineering?

645
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,880
And to me, the biggest one, I'll

646
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,040
get back to Jamie's thing in a second.

647
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,600
To me, the biggest thing is what I call the,

648
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,240
I think I've acted on that before,

649
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,440
the ping pong game.

650
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,400
The ping pong game of, here's my code.

651
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,990
Here's a bug.

652
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,070
Here's the fix.

653
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,550
Here's another bug.

654
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,670
Here's some more code.

655
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:28,630
Here's two more bugs.

656
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,080
That back and forth and back and forth, very inefficient.

657
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:38,030
And I'll say it in a different light.

658
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,250
The world has ADHD.

659
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,330
Therefore, we have to adapt to keep the world engaged.

660
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:50,240
Therefore, calendar time, calendar time, not effort

661
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,400
calendar time, calendar time is one of our single most

662
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,800
competitive assets.

663
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:00,320
Things that waste calendar time, such as bug ping pong,

664
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,040
such as stabilization, throwing over the walls,

665
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,970
such as stabilization.

666
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:09,010
Particularly in the world, when there's

667
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:12,970
a whole massive community of people

668
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,250
who have successfully shifted and have

669
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:23,440
learned how to produce better software, in that world,

670
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,880
combined engineering is a necessity.

671
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,160
I think so.

672
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,760
Although I also hate the word.

673
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,360
I've always been fine with it.

674
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,160
And once you introduce me to unified engineering,

675
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,560
I like that better.

676
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,620
Glad I have an influence on you.

677
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,460
In terms of, well, go back to Jamie's.

678
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:48,460
One thing I did, one kind of orange flag, yellow flag,

679
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,060
he was talking about their move.

680
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,160
And some of the testers moved to development roles.

681
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,120
Some moved to data roles.

682
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,520
Data analyst, 50% moved to dev roles.

683
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,240
And he didn't say this directly.

684
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:10,200
But I was worried that in that transition that they lost.

685
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,240
One thing I think is critical in unified engineering

686
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,910
is that although the specific roles may go away,

687
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,790
the activities still need to happen.

688
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,190
And I was worried that he made it

689
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:30,240
sound like all the testing expertise was being forgotten.

690
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,920
And I think it's important when you do unified engineering

691
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,920
for that efficacy to work.

692
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,560
And I said this before, he permucated a million times,

693
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,480
is that you don't build a team where everybody

694
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,680
does the exact same thing.

695
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,560
Everybody owns quality and code soup to nuts.

696
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,520
Some people are going to be better at some parts.

697
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,980
And you want to optimize for the team you have.

698
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,940
To some degree.

699
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:01,100
And so your orange flag kind of backs into my orange flag.

700
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,940
Because one of the things he talked about,

701
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,060
his first slide, it was towards the end of his deck.

702
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,140
And I think it was titled, specialists are great.

703
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,740
And I cringed.

704
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,260
I was just like, oh.

705
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,940
But the next slide he was talking about,

706
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,740
but specialists need to learn.

707
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,970
So he delivered the same message.

708
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,330
He was dancing around specializing generalists.

709
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,090
And generalizing specialists.

710
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,610
He took it from a different angle.

711
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:31,250
But that's what he was saying.

712
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,650
Because the problem with specialists

713
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,170
is they're a bottleneck.

714
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,080
They can only do what they can only do.

715
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,720
Now, if they're in a business where what they can only do

716
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,800
is what's really valued, then fine.

717
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,600
It makes sense.

718
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,520
But the problem is when you get into a place where

719
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,290
what they can really do is not what the business needs

720
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,130
from them, then you end up, much like what

721
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,130
I was saying before, the problem on my current team,

722
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,480
you end up focusing on the local optimization.

723
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,720
And that's not what's valuable.

724
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,960
It's not how you bring out the maximum value out of the team.

725
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,680
In a world where you have to aggressively compete

726
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,720
for people's attention.

727
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,920
I like that you brought up bottlenecks in general.

728
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,200
Because when I think I go back to five minutes

729
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,040
in our conversation, going back to figure out

730
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,040
what you want to do first, and then figure out why,

731
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,840
figure out what you have to do to get there.

732
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,200
Don't start just by doing something.

733
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,560
You can even go back farther.

734
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:35,560
And if the goal is not never, should

735
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,020
be we want to ship every day.

736
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,780
That can be something you do.

737
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,540
The goal should be we want to get frequent value

738
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,260
to our customers.

739
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,220
So in order to do that, we're going to give them

740
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,580
a new build every day that has higher quality and more value.

741
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:56,230
So every day, every day better.

742
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,070
What is the most, I'm trying to reword,

743
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,110
what is the most value we can deliver every day?

744
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,270
Yeah, and maybe you do that.

745
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,910
So then you think, well, what are the bottlenecks that

746
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,030
stop the screen in there?

747
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,870
We can't do a stabilization period.

748
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,910
How do we get away from that?

749
00:34:09,910 --> 00:34:11,070
We'll fix bugs.

750
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:13,510
There's a bunch of things you can do.

751
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,910
And don't optimize them all.

752
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,310
Figure out what's the biggest bottleneck.

753
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,110
Optimize that.

754
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,270
Figure out how to get rid of that.

755
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,510
And it could be the specialist.

756
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:24,820
Well, we can't ship until our performance specialist

757
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,030
gives it his once over, and that takes two hours.

758
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:29,350
Well, how can we spread that out?

759
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,190
Well, what does he do?

760
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:32,030
Yeah, exactly.

761
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,590
Maybe we can spread that out.

762
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:36,270
But there's a huge number of things that have to happen,

763
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,110
or that happened.

764
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:40,230
Figure out, and maybe that's fine until the day he's sick.

765
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:42,510
So there's probably a better solution there.

766
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,310
But I really like the idea of just,

767
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:46,350
let's figure out what's the biggest bottleneck.

768
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:46,950
Address that.

769
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:47,910
Then go on to the next one.

770
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:50,330
You don't need to do a bunch of stuff at once.

771
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,130
Figure out what you're trying to do.

772
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,850
Figure out what's the biggest detriment

773
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,370
from letting you do that.

774
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,370
Fix that.

775
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,890
And then reevaluate.

776
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,210
It occurs to me.

777
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,090
Thinking about what I just said,

778
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:05,850
where the single most precious thing on any team,

779
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:09,250
no matter how big or small you are, is calendar time.

780
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,290
Yeah, absolutely.

781
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,030
It's not effort, calendar time.

782
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,750
And what you're really trying to do

783
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,600
is maximize the equation, ROI per calendar time.

784
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,580
Yeah.

785
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,040
Multiple ways of doing that.

786
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,200
But bottlenecks, people who, you know,

787
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,360
single points of failure,

788
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,000
all of these things slow you down.

789
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
I have one guy.

790
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,080
So I used to be the scrum master of my team.

791
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,200
I recently hired a guy to my team

792
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,080
that he followed me from my last team

793
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,010
and he took over while it was there.

794
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:48,570
And I've said, you know what, I want you to do this.

795
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:51,450
I want you to fight broken window theory.

796
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:53,490
And I want you to stick to the rules

797
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,610
and be ever persistent.

798
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,690
My job is going to be to spend less time

799
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,250
than I had been, but to make sure

800
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,090
you're sticking to the rules.

801
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,970
Okay.

802
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,850
And one of the things he just realized, it's Friday,

803
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,450
and one of the rules he has to do

804
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,890
is the work always has to move forward.

805
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:13,890
And so he noticed one of the rails we have on our board

806
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,330
is out of office.

807
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,370
And it's that time of the year

808
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,480
where people are disappearing.

809
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,200
He's like, okay, there's this big machine learning

810
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,760
conference for two days here in Washington

811
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,520
that half of my team is going to.

812
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,160
He's like, okay, just a reminder,

813
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,440
the work still has to go even though,

814
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,960
move forward even though you're gone.

815
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,800
So either you guys got to complete it

816
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,310
or hand it off by end of the day today.

817
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,150
Why would he take that approach?

818
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:47,030
Certainly the work could wait two days.

819
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,870
Right?

820
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,630
Well, it was because no, it can't.

821
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,910
Calendar time is a single most precious asset.

822
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,430
The work has to move forward.

823
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:57,590
I truly believe in one of the mantras

824
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,030
I've done on this team is, you know,

825
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,430
we released to our production server

826
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:03,630
only goes to some internal people.

827
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:06,590
But we go through a nice promotion process to get there.

828
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:09,780
And it's like better, better quality,

829
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,300
more value every week.

830
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,860
Eventually that'll be every day,

831
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,380
but it's incremental.

832
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,380
If it's a little better every week or every day,

833
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,740
just a little tiny bit over the course of weeks

834
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,540
and months in a year, it ends up getting hugely better.

835
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,380
So I like the idea of always forward

836
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:29,240
even because calendar time doesn't stop.

837
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,080
Yeah, I get it.

838
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,900
I like it.

839
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:35,260
I will say, so specifically to the question,

840
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,340
like the efficacy of combined engineering,

841
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,020
much like Alan's favorite answer is it depends.

842
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,860
If you recognize and view it

843
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,700
and implement the change strategy

844
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,020
as if the change of combined engineering

845
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,740
is a system change,

846
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,940
then it will work and it's fantastic.

847
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,420
If you do it as, hey, all combined engineering means

848
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,300
is Dev and tests are working together.

849
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,220
So we'll just incorporate tests into the dev team.

850
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,700
And that's all you viewed the change is.

851
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,300
It's a living nightmare.

852
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,060
Yeah, there's lots of ways to screw it up, right?

853
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,380
Oh, it's very easy to screw it up.

854
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,900
You could say, I could do a whole podcast

855
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,820
to get a dumb ways to do it.

856
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,900
So we could say, I have a team of 10 people

857
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,260
on a combined engineering team.

858
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:25,220
And every week, half of those people will be the testers

859
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,560
and they're, we'll do a two week sprint.

860
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,520
And maybe, oh, I know, two weeks,

861
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,360
they have to be testers.

862
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,180
That's one way.

863
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,360
Another way was we do a two week sprint

864
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,200
and we'll develop features for the first half

865
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,000
and then test them in the second half.

866
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,380
And then we'll fix the bugs in the third half.

867
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,220
I don't know.

868
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,600
I have to think through these bad ideas.

869
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,320
Don't do those.

870
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,680
Actually, the first one I was thinking through.

871
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,240
So if you did, you had 10 people on the team, right?

872
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,680
And you find some way like,

873
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,080
hey, the last character of your name, mod two.

874
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,280
If you're odd, if you're a zero or one,

875
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,760
you'll rotate back and forth.

876
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,560
I'm like, that actually could work.

877
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,400
Yeah.

878
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,240
If there was some rotation.

879
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,480
Careful, careful.

880
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,680
If there were test activities, you wanted to, yeah.

881
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,520
Right.

882
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,600
But yeah, no.

883
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,670
The typical, the typical strategy that is happening

884
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,630
is big changes like this.

885
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:24,000
People are trying to minimize change

886
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,070
instead of trying to maximize the goal,

887
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:34,540
then minimize the change that achieves the goal.

888
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,620
Though what happens with these changes,

889
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,740
where it can go arise when you think

890
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,300
that the change is the goal.

891
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,140
Right.

892
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,820
Yeah, it's kind of what I was saying before.

893
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,260
Don't just focus on what the change is.

894
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,280
Focus on what you're doing.

895
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,900
You're doing these things for a reason.

896
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,740
And it's lost a lot of times in these changes.

897
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:53,580
Oh, we're being agile.

898
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,400
Why?

899
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,810
We're doing combined engineering.

900
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,630
Why?

901
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:58,470
Because it's trendy.

902
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,190
No, you're doing it for a reason.

903
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,030
Yeah.

904
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,870
And if you don't know what the reason is.

905
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,450
And the team has to know what that reason is

906
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,380
because otherwise you're never going to get them bought in.

907
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,300
Right.

908
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,260
And you even still may not.

909
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,060
Because people, and I think I've brought this up

910
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,540
on the podcast before.

911
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,860
People, there was a study done years ago,

912
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:21,620
people are more afraid of change than death.

913
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,340
Right.

914
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,700
It was change, death, and public speaking.

915
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,340
Right.

916
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,420
You have to push change forward.

917
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,580
But you have to acknowledge that there's a fear,

918
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,660
that there will be resistance.

919
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,340
And you have to sort of.

920
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,020
And that's the leadership part of that.

921
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,480
There's tactical parts of this which we talked about.

922
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,260
But there's that leadership part of making sure there's

923
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,940
a path that works for everyone.

924
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,460
Yeah.

925
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,440
And we've talked about the last podcast as well.

926
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,000
I stand by this.

927
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,090
I do think natural boring system thinkers are rare.

928
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,210
Perhaps.

929
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,410
I am a developer.

930
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,850
Why do I have to worry about training this tester?

931
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:09,760
I don't want to just be writing code.

932
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,630
You know what?

933
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,310
Yeah.

934
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:12,710
I get it.

935
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,150
I get it.

936
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:15,590
Hey, let's give me back two of your ladder levels

937
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,470
and you can do that.

938
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:17,970
Fine.

939
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:18,470
Are they called?

940
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,110
They're not really called ladder levels anymore.

941
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:20,790
I don't know what the hell they are.

942
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:22,110
I think you're older than I am.

943
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,790
I think your birth certificate is wrong.

944
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,350
Let's do Vernon's tip and get out of here.

945
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,740
What was Vernon's tip?

946
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,740
Oh.

947
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,700
So apparently you didn't see it?

948
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,200
I did.

949
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,700
I did.

950
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,420
I was giving you a bad time.

951
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,380
So the deal is that, and it's too late now.

952
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:40,380
So now at the end of the podcast,

953
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,860
the tip of the day is when you start listening to this

954
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:46,540
podcast, keep the volume on low.

955
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,540
Yeah.

956
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,780
It's a little lob.

957
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:54,760
Maybe if you can hear that we have fire engines outside.

958
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,520
Because we're on the 20th floor with double pane windows

959
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,970
and we can hear them.

960
00:41:58,970 --> 00:41:59,650
Yeah.

961
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:00,570
All right.

962
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,410
Hey, everybody.

963
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,090
I'm 50-year-old Alan.

964
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,730
And I am not.

965
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:09,840
I am 11% younger Brent.

966
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,880
See you later.

967
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,760
Bye, guys.
