00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:13,460
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,580
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

3
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,080
This is the AV testing podcast and I'm

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:30,700
Brent and yay is this episode 133 is that correct that is and by now everyone should be finding our podcast

5
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:37,780
I change hosts for a couple reasons and it didn't go as smoothly as I wanted because I realized that

6
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,960
One I thought it was bad that a lot of a lot of

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,980
Podcast hosts make their own feeds which actually I can see what they do that

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,820
So I'm not mad at them

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,620
But it turns out a lot of them base their feed purely on the iTunes feed which is weird versus the source feed

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:00,020
But that's okay, but it just took longer to get the Apple iTunes feed updated, but it looks like it's all set

11
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,220
So now you should be hearing this. This is our second podcast of 2020

12
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:09,780
We love all of you. And hey, do you know how you find out more about the podcast Brent you go to?

13
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,940
AB testing calm you do not go to a B testing calm

14
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,400
What are we talking about on here a thing that's not really modern and a thing that's not really testing

15
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,800
You know the answer to that question Brent. Yes

16
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,320
Yes, I do you can go to modern testing org

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,560
You oh, oh, I guess I didn't which is the site a domain

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,480
We got a couple years ago for start talking about this that used to direct to a B testing

19
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,560
On my angry weasel site, but now it goes to actual modern testing org

20
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,380
I've set it up as a real website

21
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,260
Nice. Yeah

22
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:55,540
It's not super pretty but happy to take volunteer web developers and the way to get involved with anything you want

23
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,560
Behind the scenes on the podcast is to go to modern testing org and in the sparse amount of text there

24
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,260
Find the link to join our slack group one of the three dot slack comm

25
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:15,350
How's that for an intro and get everybody hooked? I'll give you a minute to go find that website and log in and say hi

26
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,860
Right the clone the github repro and yeah, we got we got

27
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,860
Typing while he's talking again

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,480
Which I don't like well, I can't remember we were recording when I said that the hard time thing is I can't punch you

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,400
We were weren't me. Okay?

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,520
The first things first before we get starting with a couple topics today is Brent wanted to talk about balls. I did

31
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,070
And you can't see this on the podcast, but right behind me in my

32
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:52,070
luxurious office here in East Seattle otherwise known as Issaquah Washington is

33
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:58,790
some balls is a mighty fine stack of some big balls

34
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,450
soccer balls except for one rugby ball the rugby balls the outlier I got that on a trip to

35
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,530
New Zealand that Australia that's an Australian

36
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,870
Replica rug just a souvenir rugby ball. I got in Australia the rest are ever since

37
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,090
For many years. I don't have all of them up there, but for the past

38
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,170
But for the past

39
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,810
2024 years or so I

40
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,970
Have procured myself every year they design it every four years when there's a World Cup

41
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,480
That's a tournament for soccer or football. It's a game

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,320
It's the most populous one in the world but popular but anyway, Oh Super Bowl. That's like in two weeks. Oh god

43
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,120
I don't even know who I lost interest

44
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,240
Although the funny tangent is here, but I'll finish the story first

45
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,440
No tangent is I every World Cup

46
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,200
They make a specific ball and I get a ball from that World Cup and save it never play it

47
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,200
I just kind of I have brand new

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,880
soccer balls footballs from every World Cup back to

49
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,600
Before Korea so it must have been it maybe back to the US run the first US run anyway

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,880
What was I gonna tangent on I don't remember doesn't matter the Olympics?

51
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,400
the Olympics no

52
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,120
Wrong. Oh

53
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,410
guess again

54
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,180
All right, so okay one thing I'm curious though so one of the soccer balls

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,940
Looks like it's impaled by a frisbee

56
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,900
That is purely an optical illusion. There's actually some other crap laying up there. It's not a soccer ball

57
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,940
It's just balls and a couple of things they threw up there

58
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:45,840
Gotcha. All right, cuz I was wondering what the hell that was but it's an optical illusion it all right

59
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,240
Thanks for coming to our podcast everyone

60
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,560
We can skip the politics session for this week up. There's stuff happening and there's still idiots just like always they're just more prominent now

61
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,520
Don't you want to do the the podcast podcast or is it too early in the episode for that?

62
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,330
It I mean, it's uncharacteristic early. We're like five minutes in

63
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,690
I feel like we should just like wait for five minutes and then start but why don't maybe maybe ten minutes in

64
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,130
No

65
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,170
Why don't we do this?

66
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:19,770
Cuz this is because sometimes we talk about like what's been going on and and why don't we talk about the article?

67
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,570
I posted two weeks ago. Maybe it's

68
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,250
Tuesday of last week and

69
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,720
We talked let's talk about that so yeah last time on the podcast

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Insert clip here. No, I'm too lazy

71
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,880
We were talking about this idea of mindsets and skill sets and how it never quite sat right and I was working on an article on it

72
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,160
And I went that weekend after the podcast and finished the article. I just needed to get some ideas going and

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
posted to

74
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,680
Exactly the reaction I expected and the gist of the article if you haven't read it you can

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:03,640
Find it in my five for Friday last week or in my Twitter feed. I don't have the URL memorized

76
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,860
But it's on the the blog test project IO and the gist of it was that I

77
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,900
argued the fact that folks like

78
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,140
Michael Bolton James Bock have posted that

79
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:24,380
Shifting from a creator's mindset to a testers mindset requires a massive and difficult mind shift. I I poo pooed that and

80
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,240
Gave some examples. I said those are really skill sets and

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,720
There's no block that developers can't do very very good testing and as expected

82
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,880
90% of the replies were duh. Yeah. Thank you. It's it's funny how I can get this happens a lot

83
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,880
because I'd like to try and tow the line a little bit is

84
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,380
For as many people as I get I get people agreeing, but I also get people saying this is old news

85
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:58,480
Why are people still talking about this? This is dumb and other people thinking like I'm killing a cat

86
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,420
I'm on the the old news camp, right? There's a reason why we call what we've done

87
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
modern testing

88
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,800
the other thing to point out that I always want to point out is you're probably gonna get to but I'm on a roll and

89
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,040
I'm riled up is that sorry go for it

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,200
Didn't invent anything with modern testing and we've been accused

91
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:27,200
I've been accused of inventing something that's harming the craft and Brent. Did we invent anything at all?

92
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,320
Um that answer is no we we invented a name

93
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,200
Yeah, we put a name to something that we were seeing if you go back to our very very first podcast

94
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,460
Don't listen to it. Trust me. We're much better now as bad as it is. We're better now

95
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:50,920
We would we just wanted to talk about what we were seeing to help people who may be going through the same thing not freak out

96
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,680
and

97
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,840
What we see is people putting their heads in the sand and freaking out if people want to give us

98
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,240
Credit for this obviously it's wrong and inappropriate

99
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,430
It's it's interesting because I actually

100
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,990
As you know

101
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,190
We are not harming the craft the craft

102
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,870
has

103
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,390
long since been under threat and

104
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,390
What we are doing

105
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,510
For those who listen are

106
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,710
protecting

107
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,710
the craftsmen

108
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
Right. It's essentially

109
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,380
God normally I can load a metaphor here

110
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,180
Right, but there's a long biscuit in a wood shredder

111
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,780
Right. No, no, I'm thinking of

112
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,980
Normally I go back to

113
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Cobalt right or or cobalt not cobalt. That's cobalt is an element cobalt is a programming language

114
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,540
While I am chronologically older that you are a dimension old man go on

115
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:07,900
Yeah, I definitely resemble that fact like Alan to me in some regard like continuing this discussion on

116
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,660
Is test dying blah blah blah. I

117
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:18,940
Won't even play that game anymore. No, it's it's like I'm already starting conversations and starting to bring up

118
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,160
That my view we are right now

119
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,750
at the beginning of the end of the data science

120
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:35,710
Specialist there there will be people holding on to that specialty for decades as well. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for sure

121
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,630
It's especially I went to school for this I studied this I've put a lot of heart and soul into it

122
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,630
Please don't take it away. I'm unwilling to adapt

123
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,740
There will be that

124
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,660
Maybe maybe the problem is right now

125
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,890
there's a glut of folks coming out of school with that and

126
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,570
They're not able to to sort of land the job in the career

127
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,370
And that would be true even if we weren't in a in the midst of a covid nightmare

128
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:12,270
So what one point I want to make and of course I I have Bolton and Bach muted

129
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,490
Not blocked but muted on Twitter. So sometimes they can show up. I don't sure how the meeting algorithm works actually

130
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,730
but it was pointed out to me that the response to

131
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:28,290
Bach on my article was that I thought it was interesting. I see exactly where he's coming from but I think it's bullshit as well

132
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,930
he said something to the effect of

133
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,170
Unless Alan you've studied social sciences, you really don't get testing

134
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:42,650
Which says two things to me one is for the testing

135
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,610
one

136
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,610
first answer, huh

137
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,500
to I don't know how I mean sure if you want to

138
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,340
I'm not gonna deny some applicability. Maybe and I'm giving in the benefit of the doubt on number two, but number three is

139
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,040
Huh again, so for number three, it's just I don't care

140
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,370
Repeat the quote it was I'm paraphrasing

141
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,090
It was people do is if they're not quite sure how to engage me on something

142
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:18,290
They know that Bolton and Bach will be pissed about they just tag him they tag him in a Twitter and

143
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,570
Apparently Bach came in I just glanced at it cuz again cuz how meat works but something to the effect of

144
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,170
Unless you've been studying social sciences is the art

145
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,090
This isn't really what they're doing isn't really testing and that's what I wanted to get to is

146
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,530
historically

147
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,610
historically, if you look what Bach has done to

148
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,650
Elizabeth Hendrickson and

149
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:49,450
Lisa Crispin where he's I've seen him say like because he hasn't seen them test. They're not good testers and

150
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,250
it's like he has the

151
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:59,810
Authority to decide what good testing is and what good testing isn't and he doesn't not in a million years, you know who gets to decide

152
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,850
Nobody actually cut customers closely. They get to value a quality and here's the trick. Here's the thing you and I

153
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,000
Agree on which comes out to be the crux of all these these people who get stuck in

154
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,760
Celebrating the craft is they care

155
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,560
1000% more about testing than they do about quality

156
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,300
Yes

157
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,860
Slaps me in the face. I suck. I just do not get how you can

158
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,740
So I love the craft and I was deep in the man. I'll learn a lot about testing

159
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,380
I know a lot about testing. I'm gonna talk about testing

160
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,940
I'm gonna write a book about testing

161
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:42,740
But which I did as you know, and I don't like it anymore because I care about now is quality customers

162
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,100
Don't care what testing we did. They don't care if I'm a skilled practitioner of the arts and social scientists and testing

163
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,740
They don't care if I could ask a hundred and one

164
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:58,780
Totally dumb straw man argument questions about testing. They care if the product solves their problem in a way that they enjoy

165
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,410
Just say true. Hallelujah. Amen

166
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,690
True. Hallelujah and

167
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,460
Amen

168
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:14,260
Part of the I mean, there's so many things that came out and what you were just saying like number one

169
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:22,010
I don't know what you're doing, but get to the point we talked about this last time. So let's let's get get to it, man

170
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,490
Number one

171
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:28,290
Yeah, there is a good deal of

172
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,370
Ivory Tower ism in his statement there, right? It's

173
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,490
Unless you have studied

174
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,170
Sociology

175
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,810
I'll find the quote and again coming from where he's coming from and again

176
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:48,930
Every behavior has a motivation. Oh

177
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,340
Sure, and I'll look up the tweets here a second

178
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,480
I'll stop trying to type while I or type on my phone while I talk but

179
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,060
from his view

180
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,300
Testing is the most important thing doing good testing his client

181
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,940
his only stakeholder is the person who's made that software and

182
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,380
First so for that angle. Yeah, he wants to do the very best job find the best report

183
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,820
give the give the stakeholder all the information because

184
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:21,700
From that school they're not decision makers or information providers and for a lot of people it's all about the customer

185
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:28,760
So the focus is different. So we think about things differently. I get where he's coming from. I vehemently disagree with it

186
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:35,220
But he's not spouting nonsense as much as I really kind of don't like the guy. I think he's smart

187
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,640
What he's essentially saying like you and I have talked about many a times

188
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,680
That the activity of testing is important. Number one, huh?

189
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:55,160
No argument. No argument number two and in the end

190
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,160
I guess number three the thing that so that's one place. I think we're in VM an agreement

191
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,640
The the thing that I guess continues to be fuddle me is

192
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,540
Given the this amounting evidence

193
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,940
On your side on on on the mindset discussion

194
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,140
All right, it being a skill set versus a might say let me let me give you the exact

195
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,700
exchange

196
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,610
When you're when you're ready, let me get I'm gonna give you the exact exchange. I don't want to go too deep into this

197
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,530
I don't feel it's fair regardless of my opinions

198
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,690
I don't want to go into rank on somebody on the podcast when I wouldn't engage him on Twitter

199
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:35,010
But I went and looked it up because I only glanced at it

200
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Uh when it was pointed out to me responding to my post with my article someone replied and of course tagged in michael and james

201
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,200
And said oh they brought up the idea of the problem of critical distance

202
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:57,680
Which is a nice term that I could find very little information on to define it and try and rebut it but the idea is

203
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,760
That because I wrote it. I can't test it which again. My reply was I found this theory to be largely false in my experience

204
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:09,540
Which is absolutely true. I'm not not trying to be provoking

205
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:15,300
I have found people that I have found critical distance to be not just false but a flat out falsehood

206
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,270
Which is the same thing?

207
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,910
So then uh james jumped in and said in my experience

208
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:26,710
You've never studied this stuff or did you start reading the literature on cognitive biases boundary objects social forms of life and sense making

209
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,390
While we weren't looking which I thought was kind of a passive aggressive dick move

210
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:34,550
Oh, I didn't look at the replies, but there's more after that but the thing is

211
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,790
We're coming from different places and and I like to believe i'm coming from a place

212
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,150
That's going to help people who are in test rules be not just keep their jobs

213
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,830
Which some people are worried about and worried about the right testing happening

214
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:56,630
What we're talking about on the podcast. I want to help people freaking thrive as software changes in a day

215
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,190
And figure out how they can take all of this

216
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,430
I already closed the tweet cognitive social stuff and apply it to all this stuff if you do it, right?

217
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:13,270
It applies to building an entire learning organization like peter singe talks about which I that's a that's a what I try and strive for

218
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:20,410
I use everything I learned in the critical thinking and systems thinking that I used as a tester to build an organization

219
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,510
that is capable of

220
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:30,630
Delivering predictably and with high quality. I use the same skills. I just don't use them to do one aspect of software delivery

221
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,040
uh, agree

222
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,340
agreed

223
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,220
but the other thing I was going to say on this one because I have the thread loaded up and

224
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,740
And bach was coming in with all sorts of

225
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,300
You know

226
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
How social creatures work?

227
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:53,960
Right, and that's actually one of the things I think is brilliant around like we've talked about it repeatedly on on tvd

228
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,220
the one of the things that's brilliant about tdd

229
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,620
is

230
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,100
The the person's writing the test before the code. Yes. It does it does it solve cognitive bias? No

231
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,060
But damn alan, it sure helps mitigate it

232
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:18,470
Right it just just in the fact that it creates a much better code base for for testing

233
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:25,270
In general it it reduces the that risk and in terms of cognitive bias

234
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,150
Right, i'll just be quite honest

235
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,870
even if test were

236
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,330
That the assumption there is test is able to maintain objectivity

237
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,470
And and not be biased as they go through their testing

238
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,880
and

239
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,600
That that by itself is fundamentally false

240
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,920
Right, even if their statements were true, I would argue that that that it that occurs even amongst the craftsmen

241
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,240
today

242
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,440
so

243
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
in my mind that that that

244
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,430
That statement is true on both sides and therefore can be safely ignored

245
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:14,020
The one thing that puzzles me here, right and this is the thing and we can go on to another topic if you want. Um

246
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,180
After this but the one thing I just don't understand

247
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,820
If they view your

248
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,820
Article and we don't have evidence here

249
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,540
But if if your article is viewed as a as a direct threat to sort of, you know

250
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
the dogma that that they're talking

251
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
in the face of

252
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,530
Of the by not the bias in the face of the the evidence that we that we're seeing

253
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,330
that contradicts this

254
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,410
Contradicts their point of view

255
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,210
Like I I just don't understand like I I completely agree that that

256
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,250
testing is is important

257
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,290
But why are they so reluctant?

258
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,140
to

259
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,740
Encourage and invite and market amongst developers

260
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Well, why are they so reluctant?

261
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,580
Why now why this you already stole my next topic, but yeah, and this is why maybe

262
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:15,860
I can't get in their heads. I don't want to actually insert myself into other feeds they've had

263
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
Many of our listeners have heard those but

264
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:26,450
I want to skip that but if you look at one of the things I love about elizabeth hendrickson's exploratory testing book

265
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:31,810
Is it specifically talks about teaching developers exploratory testing?

266
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,210
And what i've noticed in my everything, you know, I I don't just make this stuff up

267
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,690
We watch stuff. I read I read books and articles and try and put it all together

268
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,650
I want to look for a full system's view of what's happened

269
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,050
Not just what you and I are seeing what's happening across the industry

270
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:53,810
And I got to tell you what I find more and more and more is when we go to highlight stuff

271
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,530
Like think of everything we've highlighted

272
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:02,450
Chances are I can find an example of elizabeth hendrickson highlighting it eight to ten years before we did

273
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,360
Yeah, well, she is pretty awesome listening to

274
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,160
Uh the ideal cast by jean kim and i've tweeted a couple times about this so worth calling up here and I listened to her episodes

275
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,580
Specifically there's one that's an interview and one there's some outtakes of a conference talk she gave in 2014 and 2015

276
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,880
That kind of backed up the point. She was talking for a while around

277
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,920
This article that she wrote with some other folks and chem caner what they did. There's like 17 of these tests

278
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This is like 2001

279
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,770
This is a ways back. This is when you and I still thought testing was the schnitzel

280
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:44,050
Yeah, and she was meeting with these folks and they're trying to answer the age-old question. What's the right ratio of developers to testers?

281
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:49,730
And as you know, microsoft used to be almost one to one and windows was almost two to one in some groups

282
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:53,010
And they want to answer when I started when I started it was two to one

283
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:55,490
So the way they did it yeah

284
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:59,890
And what my answer has always been even very early on I what I was in

285
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,910
I didn't really care about it

286
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:06,630
I was in ee and had to think about engineering excellence group at microsoft and I realized the only

287
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,590
When did I join that group about 2005? So i'm still behind

288
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,030
The only right answer for that question is it depends

289
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,630
Or as I learned to put it shortly after if you're asking about ratios you're asking the wrong question

290
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,610
so

291
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:26,690
What they did as a thought experiment a good little affinity exercise was they asked people to think of

292
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:31,730
What was the ratio on the team that had the best project ever as far as delivery and quality?

293
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,010
What was the ratio of devs to test and what was the worst quality?

294
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:38,530
What was the biggest on the biggest train wreck you ever worked on? What was the ratio?

295
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:46,290
And they didn't find a lot of correlation on the high quality products, but they found massive correlation on

296
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,530
The low quality train wreck products. They all had a very high tester to developer ratio

297
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,560
You and I are not surprised

298
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,920
2001 you and I may have been surprised. I gotta tell you that

299
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,120
So in passing there one of the things she said this is

300
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,080
She just gets it but she like you and I we try and stir the water. She just knows she's like the

301
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,440
She's like the obi-wan Kenobi waiting for us to learn this stuff. I think

302
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,120
she

303
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:19,400
Said just in passing was talking about a test team like I can't even fathom the idea of a dedicated test team

304
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,270
Like I don't even get why that would even be a thing anymore

305
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,950
And you know, it is a thing and people are proud of their dedicated test teams

306
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:35,890
Anyway, the point you got to on ownership is interesting and I want to use that or or actually the point you made that I just totally

307
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,970
Screwed the pooch on the point you made was why aren't they talking to developers about doing better testing?

308
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,120
And

309
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,760
I have an answer but it's flippant even though I think it's right

310
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,120
So i'm going to skip it

311
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,320
But I want to talk about developer testing and it's sort of a piggyback on that last article. I wrote

312
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,680
Let me go back to 2015 when I went to google test automation conference in kirkland

313
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:05,090
Uh, it was the second or third one. I went to and a whole bunch of talks. I wasn't presenting. I was just watching

314
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,030
It was in kirkland

315
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,310
You know

316
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,310
Humans are good at pattern matching

317
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:16,070
And very quickly I noticed a pattern that if I would have turned into a drinking contest would have killed me

318
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,460
This is how many times each talk

319
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Said the two-word phrase

320
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,090
Flaky tests

321
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,090
I wanted to call it the flaky test conference

322
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,690
It's a problem that you and I have dealt with for years and years and years

323
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:36,050
Developers write about and this is especially true, especially true today in the world of selenium

324
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,150
and

325
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,870
Lots of automation teams not only is a dedicated team dedicated test automation team

326
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,880
And they write a bunch of tests and

327
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,760
They're proud of the fact they have a hundred thousand tests

328
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,680
But 5 000 of them are weird and flaky and they do things like run them again or run them 10 times or they pass once

329
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,640
That's good. I'll just delete them because they don't want to run the flaky test only ones. Don't tell us any information

330
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,040
And that bugged me and there's a solution for this. I want to get to

331
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,550
but

332
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:11,670
the other thing I was going to mention is

333
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,900
Accelerate

334
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,020
In you've heard us mention this book called accelerate written by nicole forest green and some other people

335
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,100
We love that book

336
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,620
People love the dora metrics. The um, the the four devops metrics that tell you if you're going to be high quality

337
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,780
Well a lot of reviews of the book leave out some other important

338
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,180
Indicators of quality and there's one you've highlighted on the podcast before

339
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,380
I want to highlight for you then i'm going to ask you a question and stop talking that you answer and ponder for me

340
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,180
Okay, she's talking about automated testing

341
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
In the book. Yes, and she says

342
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,600
First the code becomes more testable when developers write tests

343
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,000
Second when developers are responsible for the automated tests

344
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,440
They care more about them and will invest more effort into maintaining and fixing them

345
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,880
And what she's found here is the thing she's underlying is that

346
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:13,520
When developers own the automated testing those tests are higher quality in the products higher quality is a correlation between developers owning the tests

347
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,600
and product quality

348
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,800
So let me give you a rant with a setup statement and i've talked i've been on my soapbox almost long enough here

349
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
so given that there's scientific correlation proving this

350
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:33,680
And given that in my experience writing especially ui end-to-end automation is one of the most difficult programming tasks

351
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,640
you can do properly and non-flaky and

352
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,780
Given the fact that almost every time I talk to folks who write these sort of end-to-end

353
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,220
Ui automation tests they're doing it because it's the only level that the code is testable at

354
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,860
Given all this data

355
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,620
Why don't?

356
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,620
I see a given developers should write every single automated test

357
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,740
ever always

358
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,660
And that'll even piss off some of our listeners

359
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,060
I know we have avid listeners who love what we do who still spend a lot of their day writing test automation

360
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,820
I don't think it works. I think it's we've fallen into this weird rut where it's work that the developers don't want to do

361
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:15,300
But all according to studies here and according to everything i've seen it results in lower quality

362
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,620
If you want to raise the quality of your team

363
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:21,540
Everyone if you're not developing the code don't write automated tests for it

364
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,660
Number one, I mean do you want I mean I completely agree with everything that you're saying like what what well agree with it in

365
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:33,780
An elegant way that will allow our listeners to get a second point of view and be less mad at me and while I can ever

366
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,100
Yeah

367
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:41,860
Like I i'm still thinking around the prior conversation in the cognitive bias issue. Okay, um

368
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,180
one of the issues he even if

369
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,420
test had

370
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,380
uh

371
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
perfect ability to

372
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,940
To look at the code and be objective and and do the right thing which which again they don't

373
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,140
Uh, because they turned out to be just as human as the developers who wrote the code. Okay

374
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,260
It is very rare in my experience

375
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
that test has

376
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,370
sufficient power

377
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,620
For action to be taken

378
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,140
Okay, um

379
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:23,260
And of course the rst model will will address that because that's not their job. Their job is to provide information

380
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,240
okay

381
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,440
And information provided that no one takes action on

382
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,690
has um

383
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,540
I would imagine

384
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,420
a remarkably low impact to quality

385
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:41,930
Now even even further one of the things that that they called out

386
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:50,710
So that study that that that nicole did in in accelerate it calls out two things. It's essentially

387
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,750
they found

388
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,170
that

389
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:57,110
automation

390
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:03,110
Only correlated to a high functioning software. I forget their actual definition

391
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,190
But to good software

392
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,070
When the dev owned the automation

393
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,710
right

394
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,550
In other words when test owned it they found no correlation to that automation

395
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:24,150
Improving the software no and an anecdotal I can tell you why and there are only people that will dismiss this. Let me explain

396
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:29,190
I don't think this is going to be made up. Let me tell you why this works

397
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:36,230
I find it funny that the only I'm going to start with the test pyramid and I find it funny that the only people who

398
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:42,790
gripe about it and try and uh dismiss it as as useless are testers

399
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:48,390
So all the test automation pyramid says people get freaked out about the model

400
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,110
Of course, all models are useful and some are wrong. The reason why it works is today

401
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,910
Developers write code most developers

402
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:02,230
We're getting to a point where I think the vast majority of developers at least write unit tests and i'm on the record saying

403
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,230
That's a minimum job requirement

404
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,540
Which is great. They write nice little happy path test to make sure things work as expected

405
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,030
But then they throw stuff over the wall

406
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:16,710
So the the the shit they're throwing over the wall is just less smelly than it was 20 years ago in many cases

407
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:19,350
so what happens is

408
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,030
with

409
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:28,310
Poorly architected code we get these testers trying to test all these end-to-end scenarios almost black box like

410
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,750
I see questions all over the internet all over forums all over twitter on

411
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:40,230
What do I do to make selenium find this element? I it's really hard

412
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:45,510
I have to use an x-path and even though it's ugly sometimes it changes and my tests are really flaky

413
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,380
Yeah, absolutely true

414
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,900
The big answer to those is get your devs to add ids to your elements, which is great, but

415
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,700
They go how do I get my devs to do that?

416
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,260
If it doesn't help it's like a it just is a sad sad story to watch

417
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,180
so

418
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:08,860
Let's flip that around and watch what happens when a developer owns those tests because developers like

419
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:13,260
And maybe I think it's fair to say that most developers are lazy

420
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,700
The good ones are the best developers. I know are also lazy

421
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:23,260
And if they get to the point they have to write this this automated test in selenium and they go well, this sucks

422
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,220
I don't want to write this test. This is a stupid waste of my time

423
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,500
So then they go fix their code and they fix their architecture

424
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,980
So they can test for things that need to be tested at the lowest possible level

425
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:41,820
only in the environment where they don't have a tester because as you call out developers are lazy if they have a tester

426
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,940
And came with a with a five-word email

427
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:53,020
The second they own the automation they will fix their architecture to make the code more testable and

428
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,100
guaranteed

429
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:01,020
What they end up creating will look a lot more like the test pyramid because they're only going to write those big flaky ugly tests

430
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,820
For things that can absolutely only be tested there

431
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,020
and it doesn't mean there's not a role for people with

432
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:14,060
Critical thinking and actually that's a I don't like that because I think a lot of developers have those skills. They aren't like

433
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,340
Special things that only people who've been blessed with a special testers mindset can have

434
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,740
Nicole does go on to say it's the point I wanted to talk about in that same paragraph

435
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:28,060
She does say none of this means that we should be getting rid of testers

436
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,580
Testers serve an essential role in the software delivery cycle. I disagree with her slightly

437
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,420
I

438
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,000
in

439
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,680
There's a lot of caveats there. I think she's trying to I think she's weaseling out a little bit. Love you. Nicole. Sorry

440
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,200
I think she did wanted to avoid any backlash there, but you and I both know it can now

441
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,440
I think the point here she wants to avoid is the cult of oh, I've heard teams don't need testers

442
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,760
Let's get rid of them all it's ripping off the band-aid when it's a tourniquet

443
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,040
It's getting rid of the net without first lowering the rope

444
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,280
That's I think

445
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:12,440
There are caveats there, but uh, so I can see where she's coming from but yeah, you can absolutely make world-class high-quality software

446
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Without any dedicated testers on the team

447
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,640
Conversely and as I tweeted

448
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,320
You can you and I won't pick will it some a self-proclaimed testing expert of their own choice pick

449
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,520
The top five testers in the world if you put them on a dysfunctional product team

450
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,960
There's no way they're ever going to ship anything that customers like

451
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,320
Well with the typical with the typical

452
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,490
Process to use that i'm used to

453
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,890
Right because when you have that then

454
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,770
The the dev team optimizes for hey, it's fun time. I get to write more code

455
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,530
and

456
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,530
When when we ship shit?

457
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,850
Uh, I get to be blameless

458
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,210
And that doesn't help the business. It doesn't help the customer

459
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:01,930
Right. Um, so we have data from nicole that says that developer owned automation is better for your product

460
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,970
Yeah, so given that

461
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,650
and

462
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,090
how much

463
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,210
There's this

464
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,010
I'll say it there is a industry

465
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,730
infatuation with end-to-end tests that's that's unhealthy

466
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:23,770
Agreed to me. The solution is obvious have the devs own it the right architecture will happen both in the testing test automation architecture

467
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:30,010
And in the dev architecture, it's it's it couldn't if it was painted in pink paint actually i'm red color blind

468
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,090
If it was painted in yellow paint

469
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,650
a thousand feet high

470
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,890
It couldn't be more clear to me

471
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,430
Why is it that?

472
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,670
industry wise we uh

473
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:47,270
We're not there. What am I seeing or what's wrong with my view because it's so obvious to me

474
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:52,630
How come as an industry we're still infatuated with having people who aren't the developers of the code

475
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,190
Try it and write end-to-end tests for it as the primary means of testing. Uh, please

476
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,390
Because

477
00:34:58,390 --> 00:34:59,830
No

478
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:03,190
You know the answer to it. It's because it's seductive

479
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,230
Like you can get a really low trained

480
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,790
a low skilled person

481
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,880
Uh to try it out again

482
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:20,200
Why take the thing that look i've written shipping software in operating systems used by millions and millions of people and i'm telling you

483
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:26,360
Writing non flaky end-to-end automation is harder. I would rather go fix kernel bugs

484
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,560
I'd be more confident about changing the windows kernel or the xbox kernel same thing

485
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:36,440
Than I would about trying to write an end-to-end test. That was always going to be value and non flaky

486
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,720
Yeah, and we're going to put newbies on that here

487
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:47,240
Go for it. No, it it's again because well and you've seen it right? It's it's ui. It's newbies

488
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Right. You just hook up

489
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,680
You just hook up to a recorder script and just click around and look you got a kick-ass

490
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,600
uh automation suite and actually I want to say because

491
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,520
Reproduces that continuously will reproduce the results until the next build. Here's the thing

492
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,840
I want to interrupt you because yeah, go ahead. I think these click and record things

493
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,520
I used to hate them and think they were stupid because I was thinking about them as a

494
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,080
Trying to create a test suite

495
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,440
But it gives me a way to do some exploratory automation

496
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,240
Like I just here I want to go do this set of actions a thousand times and I don't care if it fails

497
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,360
I'm just going to do the clicky clicky clicky record and then wrap it in a loop and go home for the night

498
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:36,040
That's valuable. It's not a test. I'm going to run on every build, but it gives me an opportunity to do what I call exploratory test automation

499
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,160
Let me link together some actions. Let me make a monkey test

500
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,240
The other thing right so because it's a monkey test

501
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:50,680
Right. That's what attracts the that's why it's attractive to assign these two sort of low-scale people

502
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,680
Right because because well, let's not let's hire a better monkey in some regards

503
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,720
Right, but the problem is these low-skilled people don't have the experience around what's going to take to maintain it

504
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,120
what it's going to take to actually get it to work and

505
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,960
I think in some regard like at the end of the day here is one place where I will say

506
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,200
I won't use our typical answer of it depends

507
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,160
Because here like I don't have an answer, but I know where the answer is

508
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,760
And the answer is going to be let's follow the incentive model

509
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,740
Let's let's go follow

510
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,900
How people are reviewed?

511
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,220
Let's go follow

512
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,580
That part of the process of developing a software and in there. I think we're going to discover

513
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,900
um

514
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,460
the cause

515
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:48,180
While you were talking I thought of something else because I thought about clicky clicky clicky monkey monkey monkey

516
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,150
and then

517
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,990
what I find in the reports from some of the folks who

518
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:57,030
Who love the craft and again?

519
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:02,950
I love I I don't mean to make fun of anybody just just just pointing out where I disagree and and not just that I disagree

520
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,730
But why?

521
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,850
uh

522
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:09,690
There was a time when we didn't know what customers did didn't know how they used our software

523
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,770
We tried to find what we thought were the bugs that they would find but we were just guessing

524
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,700
We heard things like no customer would ever do that. But then they did

525
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,220
and

526
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:23,620
I still think today with some of these folks. I have seen examples of them

527
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,820
I talked about infatuation with the end-to-end automation, but they're infatuated with the edge case bug

528
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,900
And the difference today is I think edge cases given millions and millions of requests for users

529
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,220
The edge cases are much more likely to happen

530
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,420
But the difference is today is we have the data to go see we see say I run this

531
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,620
Weird made-up test I make and it finds a crash

532
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,160
Yay, I found a crash go fix this bug and in the old days someone may say

533
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
No, this will never happen in the real world

534
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,000
But what we can do now is we can go to our data and see is it's actually the cool thing is maybe we found something that

535
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,960
A hundred two hundred a thousand users have seen never been able to never been able to reproduce

536
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,920
And now at least we have a path to reproduce it. So that's better. I'm off on a tangent

537
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
I just don't get it. I I

538
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,560
I'm not particularly smart. I'm not particularly dumb either

539
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,560
But to me, it's just so obvious that we shouldn't have people who aren't the developers of the code writing automation

540
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,080
I don't get it like I i'm again thinking back on the the cognitive bias discussion

541
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
right, I'm

542
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,020
I am

543
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,020
I'm trying to puzzle through

544
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
On this one. I have not

545
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,940
As you know, i'm a data scientist I have not seen I do not have access to nicole's data

546
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,280
But I have no reason to believe

547
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,760
That she and her team are anything other than highly competent in this craft

548
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,120
Yeah, I am I am competent. She's yeah, she's not only smarter than I am. She has done this stuff for you

549
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:08,200
She knows exactly what she's doing. In fact, the methods of their research are documented heavily in the second half of that book

550
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,680
Yes, and i've gone through that

551
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,200
Let's assert then that that fact is true

552
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,960
Right when devs own the automation

553
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,890
There is a correlation

554
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:21,770
Okay

555
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,810
Now she did not say causation. She said correlation

556
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,470
which then generally means

557
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,430
either a high quality product

558
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,410
is causing

559
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,170
devs to own it

560
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:42,090
Or that devs owning it is causing the high quality product and actually both could be true. Yeah, and i'd say

561
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:46,090
She focused on devops metrics and their correlation, which is good

562
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:53,290
But I would say on teams where developers own all of the automation. I'm guessing they probably have some other

563
00:40:53,850 --> 00:41:00,170
Modern practices in place as well leading to that quality. I think my hunch is that practice

564
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:04,890
Is an indicator that they have a as we put in modern testing land a

565
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:12,010
Mature quality culture. Oh, I I completely agree, but let's talk about let's assume that they don't right? Let's say

566
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,890
You and I are going to start up a startup

567
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,130
Okay, and we're going to explicitly only hire

568
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:25,530
Like the old schooliest of the old school developers. Yeah, because they can't get jobs anywhere else. Sure

569
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:28,250
These these are ones that have been

570
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:34,810
For decades brainwashed that they are incapable of doing their own testing. Yep

571
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,530
And and they've been told that by their best friends the testers

572
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:42,650
And so when you're in my fictitious company, that's who we're gonna hire

573
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:47,770
We're gonna hire only those folks and we're gonna hire exactly zero testers

574
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:52,650
And we're gonna say you are accountable for for this automation

575
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:55,930
I do think we will eventually see

576
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:02,950
Uh, I can't predict the amount of time, but we will eventually see that quality dramatically improves

577
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,190
I believe so also and some of that via attrition when some of them just give up and quit

578
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,590
But but I get what you're talking about. They well, no, so I want to cover three cases here. Okay. Okay number one

579
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,050
Uh, they suddenly see the light and

580
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,730
And they build up a great test suite

581
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,850
two

582
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:27,690
Well, actually i'm just going to skip ahead to the thing I wanted to talk about so

583
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:32,890
Let's say these old schoolers, right? They they all gonna put in one or two unit tests

584
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,730
uh that are craptastic, okay, and

585
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,610
Uh

586
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,650
Then they have fulfilled the the our requirement on them. They own their automation suite

587
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:51,370
We we will put no requirements on the number of test cases. We will put no requirements on whether or not they pass or fail

588
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,010
We'll put no requirements

589
00:42:54,570 --> 00:43:00,970
Uh other than they own it and it is run regularly, uh daily maybe I don't know

590
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,370
It's my metaphor i'm making things up

591
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,610
now

592
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,970
We though will make one strong stance

593
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,600
right

594
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,880
your

595
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,880
your review

596
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,880
will be heavily weighted

597
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,400
off of

598
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,800
uh the customer experience or

599
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,800
Customer retention actually, there we go. Your review is weighted off of customer retention

600
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:29,930
That's it

601
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:36,730
It's a microsoft review heavy for uh thing i'll i'll just say they get a bonus target based on customer retention

602
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:43,770
Um, which I think is separate from the review, but I I get I get where you're going. Sure. Sure. I mean we can modify it i'm just tying

603
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,690
Customer retention to their incentive model. All right

604
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,450
I predict that with that incentive model change

605
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,810
those oldest of the old school

606
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,480
people

607
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,200
Will either leave to a company with a incentive model that they understand

608
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,240
Or will suddenly become kick ass automation. Yeah writers

609
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:14,920
What all let me actually give you a different ground there because as you know from dan pink people are motivated by

610
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,160
Buy enough money where it's not an issue. So they might not be the thing

611
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,880
purpose mastery autonomy

612
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,400
Yes, and what i've seen actually supports that model because i've coached i've taught

613
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,880
old school never written a test developers to write tests and

614
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,440
They've been told so long that testing is this dark art and yes, i'm talking about real testing

615
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:45,320
I've seen developers find bugs that that my biggest biggest opponents would never find they're good, but

616
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,150
they

617
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,710
They can learn to test and once they get over that hump because they've been told for so long that they can't test they believe it

618
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:57,670
Great and once you get them over that hump and you stop

619
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,550
Lying to them

620
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:06,790
And show them what real testing is and how to do it and how to evaluate risk and how to not just test the happy path

621
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:11,990
And again, I got somebody replied and said you can have developers test but the only test the happy path

622
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:18,710
I said jesus help them. That's the whole point help them because they haven't done it before they're not stupid

623
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:23,450
It just drives me crazy back to the original topic. But anyway, what i've seen is

624
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:27,290
They actually don't need that money. They need expectations

625
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:32,950
They need autonomy and mastery and a little bit of coaching and purpose. They know it's important

626
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:41,860
What i've seen is they get motivated just by them figuring out. They know what to do as you were talking one last thing I wanted to say is

627
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:46,500
When I see folks harp on the test automation pyramid

628
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:50,020
They look at it as a model. They have to fit

629
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:55,860
And they don't like it because they well, it's contextual. It may be different from my product and of course

630
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,260
But really the way to think of the model is

631
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:03,700
If your software is well architected and well testable

632
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,180
It'll nat your test automation will naturally look like that

633
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,490
So that's my point

634
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:13,610
Hey, if you're a tester and you're writing a much automated test just stop it

635
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,520
If you have to do it to stay employed do that but

636
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,320
I believe higher quality software comes from developer-owned test automation

637
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,040
Well, it's and it's not a belief

638
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,200
Well the belief the belief is the cause you know

639
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:31,960
It's correlated and it goes right back to the point we made towards the beginning of the podcast

640
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,920
We're not trying to preach some new idea. I am telling you this is happening

641
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,760
People have been doing this and it's working arguing with me that i'm wrong

642
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,960
Doesn't make these facts go away

643
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,860
I'm just I'm just highlighting some things that are happening

644
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,260
the only

645
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,500
point of doing that argument

646
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,300
honestly is to

647
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Is to make an emotional plea

648
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,290
Yeah

649
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:08,810
Right. That's all right. And again, I I get where they're coming from these opponents. So I I

650
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,660
Again largely largely positive response on

651
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:18,140
the the first article i'll write a follow-up soon and

652
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,380
See if I can anger a different crowd of people which again, I don't i'm not doing the stuff to be controversial

653
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,020
I want people to understand what's going on around them

654
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:32,540
That's my soapbox for the day. Anything else before we call it a call it an afternoon there brent?

655
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,640
Yeah, there was something else. I wanted to say but no, we're good. You can save it for

656
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:40,740
134

657
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,440
134

658
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,800
That's our next episode, right? Oh, yeah, i'm like, yeah

659
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:52,040
So the what that reminds me is I was watching a listening to a radio show. I for some reason I thought you added

660
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,440
three days to january

661
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,720
134

662
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:01,480
There's this new meme that I had to say I find appealing and and that is uh

663
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,120
to keep counting adding days to december such that

664
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:13,800
Uh, this is still considered part of 2020 because everyone wants 2020 to be over

665
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,640
Yep, i've seen that thank you everyone for listening for those who

666
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,620
Are you brent? I am I must be alan. We'll see you next time. Bye
