1
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,500
Good morning, Brent.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,860
Good morning, Alan.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,540
It is time for episode 61.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,340
61.

5
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,460
I count on Brent to remember those things for me.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,420
I don't know about you.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,930
I'm happy to be here and talk about testing stuff,

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,150
engineering stuff, quality stuff.

9
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:30,790
Sure.

10
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,070
Let's do the podcast.

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:35,470
You're such a dork.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,110
I love doing a podcast with you

13
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,470
because it makes me seem cool.

14
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,990
It really does.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,950
Yeah.

16
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,310
I go back and I listen through them.

17
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,110
That's because I'm in charge of editing.

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,030
I take out all the dumb things I say

19
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,830
and add more Brent dumb things.

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,830
Nope, no need to add more.

21
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,550
There's enough.

22
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,190
It's the privilege you get from doing the extra work

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,510
on the editing, yes.

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,010
And that's OK.

25
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,390
You actually come prepared, and you actually

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,270
have insights and acronyms and things that are valuable

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,620
that I usually end up stealing if they're good,

28
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,690
and then pretend I never heard of them before.

29
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,970
Yeah, it's sort of the inventor's dilemma, right?

30
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,450
So it reminds me of Book Plug.

31
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,650
This is a very popular book.

32
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,330
I'm sure a lot of the three have read it,

33
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,940
but Austin Kleon's Steal Like an Artist.

34
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,100
I've not heard of that.

35
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,140
It's a good book to read.

36
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,940
That's what I do.

37
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,460
I steal like an artist.

38
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,860
I have about 10 books I'm simultaneously reading.

39
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,900
Oh, have you read?

40
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,740
I started reading.

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,660
Which is a horrible strategy.

42
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,580
I started reading.

43
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:47,540
Now, Philippe Canoriam on one of the three Slack channel

44
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,060
just gave Brenton Isem nice tile devices.

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,580
Yes, thank you.

46
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,100
Thank you.

47
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,620
Thank you.

48
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,020
I have mine right here.

49
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,620
He recommended a book, and I'm going

50
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,540
to mess up the title called Everybody Lies.

51
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,790
Pretty sure that's right.

52
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,510
A lot about data science and analysis.

53
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,470
Dang cool.

54
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,030
Dang cool.

55
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,910
Not even all the way through it yet,

56
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,670
but I stopped reading everything else I'm reading now

57
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,070
because I can get through this.

58
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:16,150
It is, yeah, you should check it out.

59
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,790
So far, it's a bunch of research based purely

60
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:27,510
on one of the most abundant and unfiltered sources of data

61
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,070
on how people think and what they're

62
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,950
thinking about around the world.

63
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,890
It's Google search queries.

64
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,650
Oh, interesting.

65
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,090
Brent who worked in Bing goes, oh.

66
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,410
So now I really got to look at this.

67
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:51,460
In Bing, I found the data that I had just fascinating.

68
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,780
And that's only on a tiny bit of the traffic

69
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,060
that Google is getting.

70
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,580
Right.

71
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,930
Zing.

72
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,220
There were conversations when I was in Bing.

73
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,900
We still hadn't done the combined engineering

74
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,340
all throughout Microsoft.

75
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,300
And so I still had a lot of my lunch buddies

76
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,890
were like directors from Windows and things like that.

77
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:27,910
And I remember going, OMG, do we have some interesting data?

78
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,230
And I remember talking to, I'm not

79
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,420
going to mention his name, but it is someone you know,

80
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,180
former director within Windows.

81
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,310
And I said, do you think it would be valuable

82
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:47,700
if you had access to what users and at what rate people

83
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,120
are coming in and doing search queries for your features?

84
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,360
Because, and I showed them right there and then,

85
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,480
because I had permissions, I showed them right there and

86
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,160
then I'm like, look at this.

87
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,360
Type, type, type, type, type.

88
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,180
He's like, oh my god.

89
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,300
Or, oh shit.

90
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,180
Yeah, so it's taken a while, but one of the things

91
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,260
that I did then is I went back and I said, hey guys,

92
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,460
we got to figure out a way to expose this data

93
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,740
to the rest of Microsoft.

94
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,300
Because there is.

95
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,780
What, if you think about it, what a massively valuable data

96
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,540
set.

97
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,140
It is.

98
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,620
And looking at some of the different ways,

99
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,300
I mean, I don't want to give it away,

100
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,020
but some of it was like a sucker punch.

101
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,380
Like, oh, I see.

102
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,140
It's because the story is woven very well.

103
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,740
They start correlating some data and go, oh crap.

104
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,100
Wow.

105
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,950
That I did not see that coming, but yeah, that makes sense.

106
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,630
There is on the topic of, when you said everybody lies

107
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,630
and then said it was a sort of a data science-y discussion.

108
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,670
That triggered one of the concerns that I have around

109
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,860
what people like me are doing today that's going to

110
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,340
just completely change the world going forward.

111
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,860
Now, a lot of us have this optimistic point of view,

112
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,460
oh, there's going to be all these little AI bots.

113
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,260
Everyone's going to have their personal Cortana.

114
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,810
Or what, Cortana is in Halo, not Cortana is in the,

115
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:29,260
the voice user interface that Microsoft provides.

116
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,020
But I thought I had a small little holographic woman

117
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,140
inside of my computer.

118
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,580
Oh, that's when I use Windows at least.

119
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,580
No, actually my older son, just as an aside to the aside,

120
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,180
my older son had actually gone up

121
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,820
and looked up on the internet.

122
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,060
And there's a bunch of Easter eggs,

123
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,180
Easter egg questions you can ask Cortana.

124
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
Ah, cool.

125
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,020
For example.

126
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,180
Again, using a search query,

127
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,180
I think we just went tangent inception, loop back.

128
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,100
So for example, you can ask Cortana,

129
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,260
what does she think of Google?

130
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,540
And she says a very, oh, they did a lot of innovative stuff,

131
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,220
but I use Bing.

132
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,380
Oh, that's just stupid.

133
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,740
I would just say they're a very successful

134
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,300
advertising company.

135
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,860
The funniest one I remember is if you ask Cortana,

136
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,160
will you marry me?

137
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840
But I'll leave that for the audience

138
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
to test it out themselves.

139
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,600
Anyway, winding back up the stack,

140
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,870
one of the things that I'm concerned with

141
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:43,050
is ethics is not standard curriculum

142
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,650
in data science training.

143
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,130
It's not, this is actually what's interesting.

144
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,010
And I've ranted about this before.

145
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,010
I think the lack of critical thinking ethics

146
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,840
courses in STEM are hurting STEM.

147
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,680
STEM.

148
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah, this is my big rant.

149
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,640
I try and shove a bunch of sciencey technology,

150
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,440
math facts into students brains,

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,360
but then they get to the real world

152
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,140
and they don't know how to use them.

153
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,700
They don't know how to use them ethically.

154
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,970
They don't know how to make decisions.

155
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,450
There was a study I came across recently.

156
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,130
We could do an all tangent episode.

157
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,770
We're well on our track.

158
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,850
There was a study recently that came out

159
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,850
that basically said valedictorians and salutatorians.

160
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:39,710
Very rarely impact the world the way they are expected

161
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,750
when they're granted.

162
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,830
Sure.

163
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,430
And it's, in my view, it is the difference between

164
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,830
street smart and book smart.

165
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,950
Knowledge and wisdom.

166
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,890
Yeah.

167
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,810
Anyway, one of the key things that I'm worried about

168
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,010
with data science is I think we're well on our track.

169
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,060
If you think about where how the lens is going,

170
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,340
you think about how far away we are

171
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,540
from just completely automating 80% of decision making.

172
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,460
I think we're on our track to number one.

173
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,940
Everyone will have a built-in lie detector.

174
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,440
So if I have Google Glass,

175
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,500
facial recognition is just going leaps and bounds.

176
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
And computers can pick up nervous ticks

177
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,780
in ways that are imperceptible to us as humans.

178
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,300
There's a lot of training that there's,

179
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,060
what are they called, mentalists.

180
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,740
These are people who kind of have trained themselves

181
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,060
on understanding these nervous ticks.

182
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,060
And they know if you answer and you look a certain way

183
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,890
that you're accessing a particular part of your brain,

184
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,330
and that part of your brain is where creativity is stored,

185
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,970
and that is a huge indicator

186
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,530
that you're not looking up information,

187
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,370
but you're inventing information.

188
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:19,170
There's a really good book on this.

189
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,690
I read a year or two ago, but I cannot remember the name.

190
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,030
There's like a 2% chance I'll look it up

191
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,730
and put it in the show notes.

192
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,330
So if no one has the ability to lie anymore,

193
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,330
and then you have all of these AI bots

194
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,410
making decisions for you,

195
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,370
that kind of, whether you're religious or not,

196
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,560
that kind of takes a big chunk out of this free will thing

197
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
that we're so fond of.

198
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,720
So somewhere there is a techno-thriller built around

199
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,360
all these premises you just talked about.

200
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,640
Yet this is something that is reasonably likely

201
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,160
we'll see in our lifetime.

202
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,600
Yeah, because it's convenient,

203
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,180
there's gonna be a lot of people that buy into it.

204
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,540
It'll be interesting.

205
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,940
Like people joke around about the sheeple nowadays.

206
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:16,070
Just wait until you see two decades from now.

207
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,430
That's going to be crazy.

208
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:23,430
So I spoke at the online test conference last week.

209
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,230
You did, I managed to listen to about half of your talk

210
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,430
and then I had to take my kid to school.

211
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,350
I had a good time, it was a fun talk.

212
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,270
It is always strange for me to give a talk

213
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,670
from when there's no audience to look at.

214
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,910
We talked about that a little bit on the last episode.

215
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,950
Yep. Take a shot,

216
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,270
because we talked about that before.

217
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,030
But it was such a soapbox for me

218
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:51,250
that I had no problem ranting for the invisible crowd.

219
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,370
Yeah, how did the, the thing I was most interested was,

220
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,530
that I missed was the profess Q and A session afterwards.

221
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,170
How did that go?

222
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,770
So there, the Q and A was,

223
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,290
there were one, maybe just one question afterwards.

224
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,530
There weren't a lot of questions during the talk itself.

225
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,090
There was a special Slack channel set up for,

226
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,130
Slack team set up for the event.

227
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:19,690
And I answered three or four questions afterwards.

228
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,930
And what was great also,

229
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,460
we had more questions were asked,

230
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,340
but many were answered by people already in the channel,

231
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,050
who may have paid more attention than others.

232
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,370
What sort of questions?

233
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,770
Well, from the absurd things like,

234
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,330
is Alan saying we should write more automation?

235
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,490
And someone replied, no,

236
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,290
that's the opposite of what he said.

237
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,530
He very explicitly, yeah.

238
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,090
I don't think they actually listened.

239
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,290
Then I looked at the slides.

240
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,150
One quick tangent there is,

241
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,500
people ask for my slides.

242
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,780
I posted them.

243
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,420
There was, I did a little interview for info Q,

244
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,260
little email back and forth,

245
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,780
but he said, hey, can I see your slides?

246
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
So I can form some questions.

247
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,700
And I said, my slides aren't going to be very helpful.

248
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,260
Yeah, I'm not a list of bullet points sort of presenter.

249
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:09,050
But what else were the questions?

250
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,370
I'm just like, how do you,

251
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,690
more clarification on other things you could do

252
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,020
to become more air quote technical.

253
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,220
Yeah, I think,

254
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,660
I think the thing that you did

255
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,350
that was interesting there.

256
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,750
Was not wear pants.

257
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,030
Oh, that's a sec.

258
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,870
Go on.

259
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:31,050
Is you kind of brought the term technical

260
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,490
back to its roots, right?

261
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:37,450
Technical in context often just means,

262
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,650
oh, you're a coder.

263
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,330
Yeah, and I beat the,

264
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,570
I wanted to beat the crap out of that concept.

265
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:47,330
So I don't want to recap the whole talk.

266
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,250
It's online.

267
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,930
You can find it if you use Google.

268
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,490
Bing may find it, I don't know.

269
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,010
Or we can ask our crack editing staff

270
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,810
to include a link to it in this podcast.

271
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,490
There is a three or 4% chance that'll happen.

272
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,170
But I'll pass that down the road and see what happens.

273
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,210
No, the thing I realize,

274
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:13,290
and you and I hadn't talked about this before you did this,

275
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:16,290
but I realized upon listening to your talk,

276
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,970
you're saying essentially,

277
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:24,700
no, technical in your context is

278
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,500
the use of rigorous techniques

279
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,510
to, in this case, it would be testing techniques

280
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:40,280
that would advance the business goals.

281
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,240
Yes, yes.

282
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,080
Right.

283
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,550
So in this context, right,

284
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,150
a technical tester,

285
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:55,050
by definition, a new hire who just came out of college

286
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:58,530
and never heard of a test position before

287
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,370
is probably not a technical tester.

288
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:05,530
Perhaps not, but I'm finding a lot of students

289
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,810
come out of college knowing how to use Git,

290
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,610
knowing how to, they definitely know how to use grep

291
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,480
to parse for things.

292
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,080
I think they know, they haven't learned quite how to

293
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,360
apply some of the tools.

294
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,640
Basic software engineering techniques, sure.

295
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,440
But the testing techniques,

296
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,660
what is the difference between ET and ad hoc testing?

297
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,660
Ad hoc is, I don't quite know what I'm doing,

298
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,340
but I'm testing, I'm...

299
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,900
It's not even testing, I'm randomly going through Crap

300
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,180
and hope I find something.

301
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,140
It's an Easter egg.

302
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,660
Where exploratory testing is,

303
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm learning while I'm testing,

304
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,340
I'm trying new things based on what I've learned,

305
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,540
I'm poking around, when I find a sore spot,

306
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,140
I poke a little deeper.

307
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,020
But generally, exploratory testing,

308
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,140
in my view, exploratory testing,

309
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,140
is a bit more structured.

310
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,700
You kind of know what you're looking for

311
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,930
and you're trying to see if it's there or not, I guess.

312
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:15,120
Whereas ad hoc, in my view, is you're just clicking around,

313
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,400
relying on your observation skills

314
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,130
to notice something odd.

315
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,090
Correct, I'm not sure why you're going there.

316
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,720
No, because I'm basically saying ad hoc testing

317
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,260
isn't really testing.

318
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:37,660
It certainly wouldn't be in the way you're framing it,

319
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,120
in my mind, it wouldn't be technical testing.

320
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,640
I'm looking something up here

321
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,600
because I saw a Twitter exchange

322
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,960
that was begging to troll me,

323
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,080
but I was busy and didn't play along.

324
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,520
I'm seeing if I could find it.

325
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,080
We're just gonna live here in Tangentville

326
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,600
and we may do less mailbags than we planned.

327
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,560
But I think of all the terms in testing,

328
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,560
and they're all used a lot

329
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,080
and some are buzz wordy and some aren't,

330
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,620
but Brent, what's black box testing?

331
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,590
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

332
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,590
Black box testing is where you test a system

333
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,150
without knowing how it's implemented.

334
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,870
Sure, sure.

335
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,110
And then white box testing is

336
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,750
a lot of times code analysis, code coverage,

337
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,850
you're doing things at a lower level.

338
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,570
And of course you can use tools in either state

339
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,530
to help you out.

340
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,380
But I saw someone, they were talking about

341
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,820
whether full stack testing was black box plus automation,

342
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,690
and he said, black box testing to me

343
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,970
equals testing done by a human

344
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,990
that is unassisted by any kind of tooling.

345
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,790
So, yeah, I know, Brent made a face.

346
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,070
But then it gets worse,

347
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,070
and I wanna just, cause it ties in technical testing.

348
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,070
He says, so as soon as you start using browser dev tools,

349
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,830
you've crossed into using tooling

350
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,830
to assist your testing, automation equals tooling.

351
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,670
So, then he goes on.

352
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,910
So it's like, whoa.

353
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,430
Your world is shifted in a weird angle

354
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,710
in the wrong, wrong direction.

355
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:16,550
So, I absolutely, I just, so many things wrong,

356
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,630
but I wanted to bring it up here

357
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:21,230
because it does touch on what it means to be technical.

358
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:23,870
I think one of my testers on my team

359
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:28,030
listened to the presentation from Copenhagen.

360
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,470
STE, I don't know if I've ever said this on the show,

361
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,010
but I have a combination of software test developers

362
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,750
and software test engineers, varying technical skills.

363
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,070
And some of my STEs are very, very technical.

364
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,270
They're former game producers at major AAA companies.

365
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,710
They're indie game devs,

366
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,590
building and making their own games on the side.

367
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,070
They're very technical,

368
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,070
but they're not focused on tooling or automation.

369
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,260
Where was I going with that?

370
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,420
Oh, one of my STEs listened to the show

371
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,100
and liked what she heard

372
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,940
because being technical for testing

373
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,020
may mean you have a clue what to do

374
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,740
when you press F12 in a browser window,

375
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,640
Debugger Tools.

376
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,580
You know how to use a proxy like Fiddler.

377
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,780
By the way, I didn't mention this in the conference,

378
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,460
but Fiddler now has a beta for Mac.

379
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:27,420
Really? Yeah, you can now use Fiddler on Mac,

380
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,420
which is awesome.

381
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,920
There's a tool people use on Mac called Charles proxy,

382
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,540
which works pretty well, but Fiddler is,

383
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,800
Fiddler's very, very awesome.

384
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,340
But just knowing how to use tools

385
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,110
to do better testing, that's technical.

386
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,070
Technical, as I said, and you pointed out,

387
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,830
is just using the techniques or tools of the craft.

388
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,760
In a nutshell, using techniques, that's technical.

389
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,720
Yeah, but that can be an overloaded term.

390
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,480
Yeah, it sure can.

391
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,350
Ad hoc testing, in my view, is not a technique.

392
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,110
And fortunately, I don't hear that term very often.

393
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,350
Yeah, that's good.

394
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:09,550
BlackBox, in this case,

395
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,830
when I think about BlackBox versus WhiteBox.

396
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,590
I don't even think about it, but.

397
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,030
No, I do.

398
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,270
So let me just go briefly on this.

399
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,110
BlackBox, you don't know how it's implemented.

400
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,110
So what you're trying to do

401
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:27,150
is without knowledge of how it's implemented,

402
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,590
you're trying to determine is it,

403
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,590
is when the system gets inputs and it generates outputs,

404
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,590
are these outputs expected or reasonably expected

405
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,580
based off of the inputs?

406
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,980
Now, the reason why you do BlackBox testing,

407
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,460
or the benefit of BlackBox testing, in my humble opinion,

408
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,910
is it allows you to make sure you're not primed

409
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,640
by the assumptions of the implementation.

410
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,350
It forces objectivity.

411
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,270
Now, I think the more experience of testers

412
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:14,830
have the ability, they recognize this is a problem,

413
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:19,830
and they have the ability to accelerate

414
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,710
their forward progress by even with knowledge

415
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,190
of the implementation, blocking out

416
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,190
that the threat of invalid subjectivity.

417
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,020
Right, this is one of the reasons for BlackBox testing

418
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,780
is the thing that you and I hear all of the time

419
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,660
as pushback to some of the things we were saying,

420
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,660
which is, well, yeah, but devs aren't very good

421
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,940
at correcting their own assumptions,

422
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,180
and you really wanna have an objective observer focus

423
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:04,580
on what invalid assumptions the dev may be making.

424
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:09,620
We've stated over and over again that's a crock of crap.

425
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,860
Yeah, and I actually went over some myths like that

426
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,340
in presentations like myth, devs can't test.

427
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,380
Myth, knowing how to program skews your testing.

428
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,900
Yes, actually, I agree.

429
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,900
I mean, perhaps, but yeah, I mean.

430
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,380
It does skew your testing.

431
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,140
You will move a lot faster.

432
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,700
A lot of these things are rationalizations,

433
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:41,780
so sharpshooter bias, it's a bias.

434
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,900
It's like, hey, I am going to proselytize

435
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,540
with a rational argument the thing I want anyway.

436
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,220
I think what we see a lot, I think it's very clear,

437
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,380
and if you listen to the show,

438
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:59,900
you know that we believe that testing is changing a lot.

439
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,620
Actually, software engineering is changing,

440
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,620
and the bit of that that is testing

441
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,740
is changing very much as well.

442
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,060
The way we make software, changing massively.

443
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,860
I think there are a lot of these arguments come from people

444
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,620
who are resistant to that change.

445
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,420
It's for job preservation, or they're afraid of change,

446
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,220
or whatever, so they're digging their heels in,

447
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,140
and they're saying, no, this is not happening.

448
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,820
They're putting their hands over their ears

449
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,100
and screaming, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,

450
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,980
but it doesn't matter, the world's changing anyway.

451
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,740
If they don't, they can disagree,

452
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:36,570
but that's going to lead one place, unemployment.

453
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,460
So some of these people are smart, right?

454
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,740
I mean, they may be, here's how I'll put it.

455
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,920
These sorts of discussions around these changes

456
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,160
definitely triggered the fight or flight response

457
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,120
to a lot of people.

458
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,960
Absolutely.

459
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,640
If you didn't see the change coming,

460
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,160
you didn't make steps to prepare yourself,

461
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:07,540
and you realize, holy crap, I can't retrain

462
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,860
in the time in which this thing's gonna land,

463
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,660
so the only thing I can do

464
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,660
is try to defend it from landing.

465
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,500
Sure.

466
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,740
It's human nature, and actually,

467
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,300
it's one of the things that drives me

468
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,980
to come and do this podcast,

469
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,070
because there's still a lot of people in the world,

470
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,750
as we know, and even as some of the responses

471
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,340
we've seen from 60 or even from the online test conference,

472
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:42,820
the statement that we said that the world

473
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,340
of just providing information

474
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,620
and being satisfied with that is over.

475
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,580
That's a shocking statement to a lot of these people,

476
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,130
and we're like, sure.

477
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,450
At this point in time,

478
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,490
I'm actually quite content shocking people,

479
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,980
because if they want to not be in the unemployment line,

480
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,020
start doing something now.

481
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,380
I think it's really important that, not just you and I,

482
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,260
but other people who are living on this,

483
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,220
trying to live on the edge of pushing forward,

484
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,900
continue to have a voice.

485
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,740
I saw someone post an article a few weeks ago,

486
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,980
kind of hedging around and saying,

487
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:26,340
maybe we shouldn't write so many GUI tests anymore,

488
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,900
and we've all seen the testing pyramid

489
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,260
with the bit at the top for GUI tests,

490
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,860
and it's been there forever, yet now people are going,

491
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,460
hey, maybe these GUI tests aren't worth the investment.

492
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,980
I looked up when I wrote my GUI, Shmooey blog article,

493
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,900
and it's just about exactly nine years ago,

494
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,740
and I might have been late posting it then,

495
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,100
so probably something I thought about well before then,

496
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,060
if I was able to write a blog post about it,

497
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,820
but these things are happening.

498
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,540
One last thing before we actually begin the show today,

499
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:02,660
is I do a lot of talks.

500
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
I like giving presentations, I think it's fun.

501
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,480
I like sharing my opinions and my rants

502
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
with those that will listen.

503
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,480
I very rarely, with maybe one or two exceptions ever,

504
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,590
will give the same talk twice,

505
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,830
but this technical testing thing,

506
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,540
it's a talk that I think I would give again

507
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,220
in the right context, I gotta figure out where that is.

508
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,300
I would, of course, it won't be exactly the same.

509
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,500
I'll change some things around,

510
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,020
but it's just, as the presentation started

511
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,820
falling in place for me,

512
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:44,090
I realized how passionate I am

513
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,730
about getting rid of this myth

514
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,810
that technical equals coding,

515
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,170
and coding equals automation,

516
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,330
and automation equals GUI automation,

517
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,370
because I think that's just a horrible path

518
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:56,410
to lead people down, and it's not the way of the future.

519
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,810
It's not going to help you out down the road.

520
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,450
And I see so many posts on testing forums

521
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,890
and Twitter and here and there,

522
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,050
I'm a manual functional tester

523
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,770
looking to get into automation,

524
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,210
how shall I proceed?

525
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,570
It's like, oh God, the world is doomed.

526
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:17,570
Coursera, C sharp Java courses, right there.

527
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,520
I was really proud of 60.

528
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,040
He's talking about episode 60 of AB testing,

529
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,120
our previous episode.

530
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,880
And it reminded me of a lot of the conversations

531
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,280
that both you and I had when Microsoft

532
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,800
was in the middle of this.

533
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:39,860
One of the challenges,

534
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,920
so you and I both grew up in tests,

535
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,600
and we're both strong proponents of unified engineering.

536
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,460
That's a threat to the test discipline.

537
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:58,330
And one of the things that you and I are saying,

538
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,130
or at least I'm saying, I think you agree,

539
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:06,610
is that test discipline is not inherently valuable.

540
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,010
It's the output of the skills of the people

541
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,580
that make up what we currently isolate

542
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,890
as its own discipline.

543
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,510
Now, I grew up in tests,

544
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:27,730
and I do feel a sense of membership to that community

545
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,330
and a sense of leadership or responsibility

546
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,170
to that community.

547
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,730
Like when Microsoft was in the middle of this,

548
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,870
my job, when I saw a lot of these people in panic,

549
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,770
my job was to show a path forward

550
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:48,170
and to bolster the element of hope around that path.

551
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:53,010
I'm like, look, this move doesn't eliminate

552
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,830
everything that's valuable about you.

553
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,880
One of the things that, and I've said this here,

554
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,110
when I get done babbling, I'll take my shot,

555
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,650
but I have lived in a dev world

556
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,890
where I did these combined engineering,

557
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:17,890
and I have lived knowing that those people

558
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,720
who have the ability to code

559
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,960
that grew up in tests and understand those skills

560
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,200
are actually better developers.

561
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,040
Like, it's been my experience hands down.

562
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,680
Those people who started with tests

563
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,100
understand this model, added the coding skills,

564
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,390
they are stronger as developers in this new world.

565
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,530
One of my test developers, S. Detz,

566
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:51,130
borrowed term from Microsoft, I kind of resent it,

567
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,860
is doing mostly development work.

568
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,820
In fact, we're looking for eventually,

569
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,660
probably the next six months,

570
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,100
we'll find a dev job for her at Unity.

571
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:06,000
Former tester, the most conscientious test writing developer

572
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,600
that I know at Unity, because she gave the pack,

573
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,440
she writes great tests for everything,

574
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,160
it's ingrained, like, of course, of course you write tests.

575
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,120
Of course you write really good tests

576
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,080
when you're writing code.

577
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,920
Yeah.

578
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,680
It would be dumb not to, they get that.

579
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,160
I have a weaving story here that I haven't talked

580
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,960
to anyone about this before, but I'm gonna bounce it off.

581
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,760
You and the three listeners,

582
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,680
Brent, you may remember when I worked on Xbox One.

583
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,520
I do.

584
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,360
I do.

585
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,200
I had nobody.

586
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,640
You joined, right, when I left.

587
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,870
I joined, right, as it was starting up, yes.

588
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:44,070
I had no one reporting to me for the entire Xbox One cycle,

589
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:49,070
but I was responsible for growth and technology sharing

590
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,390
in community for, at first, just the Xbox One console team,

591
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,510
and then I expanded across live, and then across games.

592
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,830
So I had, I managed a community of people concerned

593
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:05,190
with Xbox One quality to make sure we all knew

594
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:08,850
about tools each other were using to find connections,

595
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,550
to make sure the smaller team

596
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:14,470
of very senior technical testers,

597
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,470
I was sort of the product manager for Xbox testing tools,

598
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,670
that we knew what the needs were,

599
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:26,350
very much like a test manager, test director role,

600
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,990
except I was doing it all through,

601
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,910
they weren't reporting to me.

602
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,410
So, which I'm fine, totally comfortable with.

603
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,290
So now at Unity, and I hope my boss isn't listening

604
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,970
because he'll shit his pants.

605
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,910
And this would be a long, long-term thing.

606
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,310
Nothing would happen in the next even year or two.

607
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,270
I've been thinking more and more about my organization.

608
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,790
It's a matrix organization where I have QA people embedded

609
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:54,860
in feature teams, yet all reporting to me.

610
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,500
And the reason they report to me,

611
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,740
I've talked about it before, is I run a,

612
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,620
this is gonna scare the people that listen

613
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,320
to the podcast that work for me,

614
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,380
but I'm gonna go on with the thought experiment.

615
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:07,420
Most of them are embedded in feature teams,

616
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:10,140
they work for me, and I run a community.

617
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:13,540
It's all good, Alan Skyes.

618
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,780
Just talk to him afterwards and he'll set it.

619
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,860
So I run a community of testers,

620
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,860
and so I can find ways for them to connect

621
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,380
and to share tools and technologies.

622
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,220
We need to get a lot of that.

623
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,020
This, by the way, is why you don't tell your team

624
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,860
that you do this podcast.

625
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:31,860
I did not tell them they found it.

626
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,060
Of course, I believe in total transparency,

627
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,820
so my calendar's open for anyone to see

628
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,260
exactly what I'm doing all day,

629
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,540
and then 8 a.m. every other Friday, there's podcasts.

630
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,940
Oh, it's just podcasts.

631
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,420
Nothing, go away.

632
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,740
And they search for Alan Page Podcast,

633
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,020
and they go, oh, hey, pop the stack.

634
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,420
Again, at UNITY, I run a community of testers,

635
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,740
they're embedded.

636
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,960
There may come a point, and I don't,

637
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,600
again, I don't know if this will happen,

638
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,150
but logistically, I could just merge

639
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,350
many parts of my team into the dev org,

640
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,510
set them free, but still run that community of testers.

641
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,390
They don't need to work for me to be

642
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,950
the quality and testing expert on that team.

643
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:16,570
There are some advantages to that

644
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,810
for the short and medium term,

645
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:22,730
but I could see a world, and again,

646
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:25,370
one thing, if I was an old school test manager,

647
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,850
I'd be afraid to death of that,

648
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,570
because I need my org to prove my existence.

649
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:33,010
I think in order to do that,

650
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,370
I would one, have to get them to a level of independence

651
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,810
and have that community strong enough

652
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,330
where they would come back to it,

653
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,850
even if it wasn't a community based on reporting structure.

654
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:46,370
Before you can abandon the matrix,

655
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,370
you do have to make sure,

656
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,410
a huge portion of these have been

657
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,490
sufficiently taught leadership.

658
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,690
A lot, this would be a long term thing,

659
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,610
it's kind of, it's a little sparkle in my head,

660
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,410
one of those background threads that

661
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,690
may pop up for me to think about once in a while,

662
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,490
but I could envision an org,

663
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,010
and I have to also build trust

664
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:09,650
among the dev managers and my managers,

665
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,210
other people in the org that I can justify my job,

666
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,850
and maybe I don't, maybe I work myself out of a job.

667
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,290
It doesn't matter.

668
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,010
What matters is that we have the most efficient way

669
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,210
to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality.

670
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,250
I have found that literally every time

671
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,760
that I automate myself out of a job,

672
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I attract the interest of hundreds around me

673
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,160
that want me to go and solve a harder job.

674
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,480
Yeah, and I really do see,

675
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,360
I want my role to be one where I can just

676
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,040
make everything better,

677
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,520
and that's a horrible way to put it,

678
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,960
but I wanna make, improve us,

679
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,400
I wanna advance things, I wanna challenge people.

680
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,870
If I do that to an extent,

681
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:05,870
that what I do the role I was hired for

682
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,150
is no longer relevant, that's okay.

683
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,470
That can happen, I'm not scared of that.

684
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,950
And then tying that back to what we were talking about earlier.

685
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,230
Unless you're a geezer, so it'll probably be

686
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,390
time to retire by then.

687
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,430
I can do this one or two more times and I'll be dead.

688
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,790
Yeah, actually as you were talking,

689
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,510
one of the things I was thinking about,

690
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,760
so I'm not the only person to ever manage

691
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,560
a dev team of combined engineers.

692
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,880
I know, unified engineers.

693
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,720
Whatever.

694
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,280
Actually, and that's actually an important distinction.

695
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,780
Because I have seen tester folks being incorporated

696
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,580
under a dev manager,

697
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:55,090
and that person ran it like a combined engineering team.

698
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,610
You know, it was a burden,

699
00:34:56,610 --> 00:34:59,650
oh no, I gotta manage these test guys.

700
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,270
The difference that I took is I'm like,

701
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,230
no, what I need is a unified engineer.

702
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:12,070
I need people that can do code and do testing.

703
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,670
And I know I've talked about this story,

704
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,500
but by realizing that what I need to do is,

705
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,140
all I needed to do with these test guys

706
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,460
is remove that lack of self-confidence

707
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:31,840
that is brow-beaten in the testers.

708
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,320
And once I did that, these guys were rock stars.

709
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:43,050
Now, what I have found though is leadership matters.

710
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,540
So if they get re-orged into somebody

711
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,140
who says something along the lines

712
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,340
that starts with, pick your favorite sentence,

713
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,660
but starts with, I've been doing this for the last 20 years.

714
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,980
If you have moved these guys into that

715
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,200
they had not been taught leadership

716
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,560
in a way that defeats this lack of self-confidence

717
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,440
thing I mentioned.

718
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,060
Just gonna put them in a worse situation.

719
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:19,420
So yeah, now Unity sounds like it's a lot more

720
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,760
closer to an ideal world.

721
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,820
And to be clear, there's a massive room for advancement.

722
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,360
To catch up to some of these things,

723
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,360
but their ability to move quickly is very, very strong.

724
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,750
You have to have a way to make sure

725
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,590
that when the unified engineering model happens,

726
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,590
or something along these lines,

727
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:55,260
to make sure that they're viewed as an asset,

728
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,580
not a detriment.

729
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:00,820
Sure, and again, it's not like I don't want,

730
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,860
I don't want so many people reporting to me,

731
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,500
I'm gonna push them off to the dev team.

732
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,660
Not my goal at all.

733
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,300
I think they'll become a point

734
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,740
in it'll be different paces on different teams

735
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,980
where it just makes more sense for them to vote there.

736
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,900
They have the autonomy they need,

737
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,420
and I can still swoop in.

738
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,340
If you back that up to, compare it to

739
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,500
when I was on the Microsoft Teams team,

740
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,300
there were no, it was unified engineering.

741
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,700
I was hired as the quality guy.

742
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,820
There were no QA people embedded on the teams.

743
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,160
So I had a different problem to solve.

744
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,640
I had to do it the other way around.

745
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,680
I had to coach and train people

746
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,640
how to think like a tester,

747
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,400
and find the people who are good at it,

748
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,920
and make them, Microsoft called it the dotted line report.

749
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,000
Basically just to have,

750
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,760
exhort some leadership over them.

751
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Empower them to be the quality and testing expert

752
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,120
for that team, whether or not

753
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,800
that was their official role.

754
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,680
Every feature team had, at first at least one,

755
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,580
but sometimes one, two, three, four, five people

756
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,380
who were actually got how to write good tests

757
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,460
and cared about it,

758
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,260
and had a level of craftsmanship to their code,

759
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,620
and then would evangelize that across their team,

760
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,380
and ask the right questions during code review about tests,

761
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,820
and make sure they had the right balance of tests.

762
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,180
So I did it the other way where I built them.

763
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,420
That way works.

764
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,460
I actually,

765
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,700
But it's slower.

766
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,940
That was fun to do,

767
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,100
because it was a fun little challenge for me to do that.

768
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,940
It's slower.

769
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,540
I like having the QA team.

770
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,100
I've enjoyed managing this team.

771
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,140
It's been a ton of fun,

772
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,580
but also I'm just throwing this out

773
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,980
that we'll revisit this in episode 97 or something.

774
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:44,940
But I could foresee downsizing my team

775
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,980
in favor of the efficiency of our ability

776
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:53,050
to get quality features to our customers efficiently.

777
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:57,190
Yeah, and again, to Alan's employees,

778
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:59,590
he means downsizing the number of people

779
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,510
reporting to him,

780
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:05,620
but the rest of you will be working in the dev org.

781
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,860
There's no job loss being discussed here.

782
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:15,580
And by the way, episode 97 is at least

783
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,260
two, three years away maybe?

784
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,320
In a good, yeah, I kind of think, yeah.

785
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,160
We'll see.

786
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,360
So again, don't be scared.

787
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,620
Just, the thing is my team already knows

788
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,540
I'm full of totally random thoughts.

789
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,300
I have a very agile approach to management,

790
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,540
means I'm gonna ship early, ship often.

791
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,100
So, and those are my ideas, shipping early and often.

792
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,420
So I'll throw stuff out.

793
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,980
If it sticks, great.

794
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:44,220
If it doesn't, I don't care.

795
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,060
My feelings aren't hurt.

796
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,380
I'll try something else.

797
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,060
And I've had many, many thoughts in my life

798
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,500
of things, oh, maybe I'll think about this,

799
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,540
that I've just never done, never happened,

800
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,440
and that's okay, and I'm okay with that.

801
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,920
You're an INTP, right?

802
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,480
I am an INTP.

803
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,320
As am I.

804
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,440
And for those who aren't familiar

805
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,800
with the Myers-Briggs psychotyping testing,

806
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,900
this is essentially a model that generalizes.

807
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,540
It's not a exercise of putting people in a box,

808
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:22,980
but it generalizes how people make decisions.

809
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,980
And when I walk through the difference

810
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,660
between a P and a J,

811
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,340
I'm not gonna go through the whole speech.

812
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,620
Perceiving or judging.

813
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,460
Right.

814
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,300
But I'll just.

815
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,660
So the whole process, INTP,

816
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,380
and I am an INTP as well,

817
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,660
the whole process is about the decision-making process.

818
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,580
The first one is I versus E,

819
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,100
actually talks about what decisions

820
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:53,580
you're interested in thinking about.

821
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,240
N versus S says,

822
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,510
how do you collect data?

823
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,860
T versus F is around the decision-making process.

824
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,820
What bar do you use to make a decision?

825
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,100
T's are thinkers.

826
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:13,940
And F's are?

827
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,780
Fred and I are thinkers.

828
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,860
We think about crap all the time.

829
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:18,060
All the time.

830
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,220
But P's versus J,

831
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,700
the thing that's interesting about that is,

832
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,380
once you've made a decision,

833
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,060
how do you stick to it?

834
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,300
And the way I describe the difference between the two

835
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,110
is you can think about a decision tree.

836
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:36,860
J's, once they make a decision,

837
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,460
they prune the rest of the tree.

838
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:44,460
If you know about game design and tree pruning,

839
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,300
once they made a decision,

840
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,820
they abandon the tree that they no longer need.

841
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,700
Okay?

842
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,090
Whereas P's always keep the tree,

843
00:41:57,090 --> 00:42:01,830
but for us, it's a balanced binary tree.

844
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:03,610
So when we make a decision,

845
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:08,780
we actually reweight the tree and rebalance it.

846
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,380
And so when new information comes in,

847
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,420
we go into the tree, rebalance it,

848
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,620
and now a new decision is made.

849
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,340
So P's are viewed as being spontaneous,

850
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,540
or the negative side is we can't stick to a decision,

851
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:31,520
but really what we're doing is we're adapting.

852
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,880
Yes.

853
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Now, there is no positive negative to being a J or a P.

854
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,760
P's, in a world where you have to constantly adapt,

855
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,230
P's are quite good at it.

856
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,990
But the challenge with P's is,

857
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,070
if our tree gets too big,

858
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:53,510
it mentally can be a challenge to rebalance the tree.

859
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,590
I mean, it's not actually a balanced binary search tree,

860
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:59,930
it is, that's just a metaphor.

861
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,670
J's though, if they're forced to re-decide something,

862
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:06,110
what do they have to do?

863
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,630
They have to rebuild the tree in order to prune it again.

864
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,390
So that's why you'll see them getting really frustrated

865
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:15,550
when a decision gets unmade.

866
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:18,630
So a couple things, a bunch of things.

867
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,310
Actually, one is you can wave your arms

868
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,750
around Myers-Briggs types indicator being a horoscope,

869
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,430
be whatever, and if you take like the online test,

870
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:31,780
it's gonna be probably inaccurate to some extent.

871
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,940
I think Brent and I have both taken

872
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,420
like the long form written test.

873
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,400
It's fairly accurate many years ago.

874
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,860
I wanna read a little bit about the INTP

875
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,980
for our listeners in a second,

876
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,820
but it reminds me, long time listeners will know

877
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,660
that one of my favorite authors in the world,

878
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,300
a man I have a huge man crush on, Stephen Johnson,

879
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,940
in his book, Wonderland,

880
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,770
talked about the fox and the hedgehog.

881
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,510
I do not have, I have listened to the podcast,

882
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,690
I do not have the book.

883
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,250
So it's actually in the podcast as well,

884
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:01,410
but the fox and the hedgehog

885
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:05,770
is basically how people approach learning.

886
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,570
And the difference is the hedgehog has one world,

887
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:11,080
he just sees it.

888
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,320
And the fox is always learning and adapting.

889
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,760
And it tells stories about how important,

890
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,880
and the Wonderland's all about

891
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,680
the importance of play and learning.

892
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,800
Talks about how the fox, the mother fox,

893
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,680
will actually bring back live prey to the den,

894
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,640
let the young fox play with it before he kills it and eats it.

895
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,480
Little gross for Friday morning.

896
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,020
The difference is the fox sees everything,

897
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,480
and they adapt as things come on,

898
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,320
and they're always learning.

899
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,820
They have a more plastic brain.

900
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:41,360
And Brent and I are always,

901
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,120
maybe this is reflected in our ability to have ADHD

902
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,160
and bounce all over the place,

903
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,240
but we're always thinking,

904
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,840
and sometimes the thoughts are so strong,

905
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,760
we can't resist them.

906
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,840
And pretty soon, there's a squirrel with a balloon

907
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,520
on top of a truck or a train.

908
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,720
With a ringmaster hat on.

909
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,560
So I'm gonna read a little bit about us.

910
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,080
I think his name is Petey.

911
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,280
So you can get some insight.

912
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,120
This is a definition I have,

913
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,880
I guess this is the first hit on Google.

914
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,290
The INTP personality type is fairly rare,

915
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,070
making up only 3% of the population,

916
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,810
which is definitely a good thing for them,

917
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:18,050
as there's nothing they'd be more unhappy about

918
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,090
than being common.

919
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:23,390
INTPs pride themselves on their inventiveness

920
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:24,690
and creativity,

921
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,490
the unique perspective and vigorous intellect.

922
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,490
I know I'm pretty dumb.

923
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,970
Usually known as the philosopher,

924
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,850
the architect or the dreamy professor,

925
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:34,210
that part's pretty good.

926
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,810
The INTPs have been responsible

927
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:38,170
for many scientific discoveries throughout history.

928
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,890
I don't actually like that definition very well.

929
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:44,010
One thing I read about INTPs early on

930
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:46,690
that kind of hooked me on, oh wow, yeah.

931
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:51,010
Says INTPs abhor inefficiency.

932
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:53,590
And that's me to a T.

933
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:57,080
It depends on how you define inefficiency, right?

934
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,440
Because I do not.

935
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,400
This is Brent thinking.

936
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,560
I do not abhor laziness,

937
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,960
because I live that way.

938
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,840
What's the Heinlein quote?

939
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,320
Something about progress being driven by lazy men

940
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,800
trying to find an easier way.

941
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,100
Right.

942
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,740
So nothing wrong with laziness.

943
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:18,730
And often, I mean, automation is laziness.

944
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,570
Like I'm too,

945
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,850
I'm too lazy to write, to do this again,

946
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:24,930
I'm just gonna write a script

947
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,250
or something to help me out with it.

948
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,970
Oh no, so that's absolutely true.

949
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:31,110
Like there are times where I have gone against,

950
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:32,930
this is back when I was still in IC,

951
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:33,770
I've gone against,

952
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:35,410
my manager explicitly told me,

953
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:37,960
I don't want you to automate this.

954
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,920
But the next three weeks,

955
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,200
you're gonna be running the same 100 test cases every day.

956
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,920
And I've told this exact same story.

957
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,760
Kill me first.

958
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,640
I had the same manager.

959
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,120
Because I was, I told the story,

960
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,240
I think I told it during my talk,

961
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,920
that that was my first, maybe I did,

962
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,120
my first day at Microsoft.

963
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,020
Yeah, I mean, I definitely don't like repetition.

964
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,440
The one thing in that thing though,

965
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,560
that I think does resonate,

966
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,460
the label of architect.

967
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,640
Right now, to some people,

968
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,160
this means a technical design.

969
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,880
And yeah, I'll do that.

970
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:16,880
But lately, I'm doing a lot of process architecture.

971
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:21,120
I'm going, no, actually the tech side of this

972
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,040
is actually pretty efficient right now.

973
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,040
The bottleneck is all these damn people

974
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,520
using processes invented in 1995

975
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,400
for a world that no longer exists.

976
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,040
I like thinking it that way.

977
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,640
And the architect for me is the systems thinker

978
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,140
looking at all the pieces at once.

979
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,820
That's what foxes do.

980
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,120
Look at all the pieces at once

981
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,220
and then they'll make decisions and adapt.

982
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,020
I have noticed in,

983
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,480
now that I know my team pretty well top to bottom,

984
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,380
managing them is a little bit of an architectural task

985
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,920
in some ways.

986
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,680
I compared it this week a couple times

987
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,020
to playing a big game of slide 15.

988
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,860
I don't know what slide 15 is.

989
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,000
Slide 15 is the box of 16 squares.

990
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,320
You have 15 tiles numbered one through 15.

991
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,680
You have to slide them around to get them in order.

992
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,080
Oh, sure.

993
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,080
That game is called slide 15.

994
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,880
Okay.

995
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,320
Because I'm thinking, okay,

996
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:18,080
I want to be able to do this work here,

997
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:19,280
but in order to do that,

998
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,200
I need to make this person do this and that.

999
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,800
So it's a lot of,

1000
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,480
and they have a backup plan.

1001
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,460
Because if they do that,

1002
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,120
oh then they can go there.

1003
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,240
And it's kind of fun.

1004
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,240
I know what you're talking about.

1005
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,280
It reminds me of solving technical problems,

1006
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,680
but I can apply the same thinking generally

1007
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,680
to making sure the best thing happens

1008
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,640
for the team overall.

1009
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,880
I kind of view that,

1010
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,640
like my metaphor for that problem

1011
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,800
is pick any game you've ever played that has a tech tree.

1012
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,760
Yeah.

1013
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,600
Right?

1014
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,780
It's essentially, okay, what can I do now?

1015
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,900
What do I need to be able to do?

1016
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,660
Now, what resources do I need to apply

1017
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:07,900
in order to unlock that next technical advancement

1018
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:13,100
on my self-visualized tech tree for my team?

1019
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,940
I'm in knee deep in planning right now.

1020
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,940
So I am doing a lot of thinking through

1021
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,860
what are all these possibilities,

1022
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,100
but at the same time,

1023
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,760
sort of writing down things in a firm fashion.

1024
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,580
And as a P, I hate that.

1025
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,320
So also in Wonderland, Stephen Johnson,

1026
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,600
this is I think gonna,

1027
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,200
not didn't quite have the tech tree,

1028
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,840
but a good example of systems thinking is SimCity.

1029
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,090
Yeah.

1030
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,810
In order to do one thing,

1031
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:48,130
you have to do a bunch of other things.

1032
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:49,530
They can relate to other things.

1033
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,690
You get all those,

1034
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,570
it's managing that is a good systems thinking problem

1035
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:59,250
that is fun for some and infuriating

1036
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,050
or even stupider boring for others.

1037
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,690
For me, I would love it if they released

1038
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:11,690
another version, an up-to-date version of SimCity.

1039
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:16,690
I lost a whole day of my life back in college.

1040
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,610
Long story short,

1041
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:24,570
I got so involved in this game during college,

1042
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,930
I finally got done, got up,

1043
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,090
went to go talk to my buddies

1044
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,130
because we were all supposed to go to the bar tonight.

1045
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,330
And they're like, dude, that was yesterday, where were you?

1046
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:40,400
And I'm like, what?

1047
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,910
Yeah, so shall we start the show?

1048
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:50,910
The good news today is that looking at the board

1049
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:53,990
of the topics we're going to get to,

1050
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:56,870
episode 62 is completely planned.

1051
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,430
Yes.

1052
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:00,270
Two weeks in advance, at least.

1053
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:01,590
That's pretty fantastic.

1054
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,910
So one of the things that I'm starting to think through

1055
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,710
because I talked without-

1056
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:07,510
But to be clear, I enjoyed the conversation.

1057
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:09,240
That was great.

1058
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:10,320
I actually think,

1059
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,320
so now, one of the things that I wanna do

1060
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:19,660
is go and retroactively title our episodes.

1061
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,640
Because we get enough of them and we get questions.

1062
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,480
I'm like, oh, go listen to episode number,

1063
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,360
I don't know which one it is.

1064
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,740
And I'm tentatively gonna title this one,

1065
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:37,380
Something Around Retrospective.

1066
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,740
Like this is sort of the 60 retrospective episode.

1067
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:44,060
Yeah, but we, it was,

1068
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:46,770
I like the term tangent inception.

1069
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,450
Tangent inception?

1070
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:50,770
The tangent inside of a tangent inside of a tangent?

1071
00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:55,010
Yes, the inescapable tangent tree.

1072
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:56,610
But fun stuff.

1073
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,650
Okay, so we'll do an all mailbag show next time.

1074
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:01,490
Yeah.

1075
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:03,650
Cool with that, unless anything awesome happens

1076
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:06,210
in the world of software for that we preempt ourselves.

1077
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,090
Or in case we just start talking

1078
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:09,970
and never get to the mailbag like we did today.

1079
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,210
But for now, we'll plan on an all mailbag show

1080
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,050
next time we have at least three questions

1081
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,010
for the mailbag.

1082
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:17,410
If any more come in, we'll try and see

1083
00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:18,850
how many we can shove in and catch up.

1084
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:21,410
So if you asked the mailbag question

1085
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:25,010
and we didn't get to it and you think you guys are lame,

1086
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:27,450
we apologize and we'll do it next time.

1087
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,530
Or we'll plan to do it next time.

1088
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:29,450
We'll do our best.

1089
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,170
Yeah, we go through all of them so far.

1090
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,280
Yeah.

1091
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,120
Okay, thanks Brent.

1092
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,120
Thank you, Alan.

1093
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,000
We'll see you next time.

1094
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,840
Bye.
