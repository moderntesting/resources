1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:15,950
Hello everyone howdy I'm Alan I'm Brent and we're back with a be testing one more time

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,020
I'm Brent. I'm Alan

3
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,500
Hell oh one more. Oh, we're back for one more episode

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,480
Episode we are episode 77 pair of sevens double sevens. You can't roll those on dice unless there's two eight-sided dice

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,460
Or more or ten yeah, yeah

6
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,620
We

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:45,940
Are the podcast about things like software quality software testing modern testing agile organizational change?

8
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,000
Random stuff squirrels and what else Brent?

9
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:56,510
It's mostly the squirrels mostly squirrels. Yeah. Yeah, how you been Brent? Oh, it's been a rough week

10
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,230
How about you?

11
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:04,310
Well all my weeks are good. I was skiing last week at Whistler had a great time

12
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,070
Home this week working away

13
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:15,610
Working away next week working away the next week, but working from Brighton while I go to test bash. Yes

14
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,970
Where in the world is how is the weasel you gotta work on your prep there?

15
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,870
Yeah, the weasel will be in which means we need to move our podcast vigil around again because I'll be in Brighton

16
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:33,810
That's fine. Gosh. Nothing much else going on. I'm taking the gear you're gonna do another not taking gear if there's gear there

17
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:39,010
I'll use it, but no I'm gonna spend day and a half at unity. I'm going to

18
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,690
Workshops on Thursday conference on Friday

19
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,100
Unconference on Saturday as I believe that I'll leave Sunday morning. That sounds like fun

20
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,900
Yes, that's my plan is to have fun. It's test bash officially our favorite conference now

21
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,140
Test bash is officially my favorite conference. I don't know about you

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:07,780
Officially hands down and they are crazy. I cannot believe this grassroots thing and has they think they have five

23
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Conferences, maybe it's more

24
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,740
That's great. They're doing their first ever test bash in San Francisco next year. Nice

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:21,100
I believe there's one coming up in Australia. Yes, there's one in Sydney. I think oh

26
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,060
There they just pop up all the time

27
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,040
I'm just excited to be part of it Richard Bradshaw who I've met I

28
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,600
Think I've only met him in person once twice

29
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,920
I've been in person twice because once at test bash Philly when I went two years ago

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,440
Then before that I met him at Euro star

31
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,080
Was I giving oh I went to euro star a few years ago not to speak at euro star

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,920
But to speak at the mobile conference they had the following day, you know euro star I

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,360
Haven't heard that in a long time. It's still around. Yeah still around

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,450
That's a you picked up on what I was thinking

35
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,810
Yep. So as I get ready for

36
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,650
Test bash god head brain. I have a dentist appointment this morning

37
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,170
I like to be nice to my dentist and not pound myself full as much coffee before I

38
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,770
Have my teeth clean does I normally do so I'm a little I'm not quite on a full tank

39
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,400
You want coffee? No, I can get you know, cuz I have to go straight from here to the dentist and oh

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,120
You're going to and I don't want coffee breath for other for I like but like be a nice to my dentist because I'm sure they

41
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Smell worse things. Oh, no doubt

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,960
Okay, that's a tangent. I'm not going to explore

43
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,860
So test bash is coming up a couple other announcements around

44
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,740
Talks that I have coming up in the where's the we're in the world is the weasel thing

45
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,880
probably worth

46
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,600
mentioning so I watched your

47
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Abuse and misuse webinar

48
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,160
I did give a webinar two weeks ago on the abuse and misuse of test

49
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,080
Have you done another one since I did I did one on Tuesday on the future of test automation

50
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,840
Which is also recorded and if I am a good podcaster, I will put the recording to both of those links

51
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:16,680
Links to the record whatever I will put links to both of those recordings in the podcast

52
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,320
So that's kind of cool. Yeah, I'm interested in hearing that

53
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,730
The your last one was with the

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,400
That's the pan or the two-person panel one. Yes. Yeah, okay. So what else do I have coming up?

55
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,400
Let me talk about a few things. I screwed up this year. I

56
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,720
Usually am good about saying no and after several years of doing one conference a year one talk

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,980
I am doing way too many and I I am saying no to anything else, but I

58
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,940
So one I have an in end of

59
00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,340
April beginning of May I'm giving just a workshop at star East on web tools

60
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:08,540
Which will be fun, but I forgot that when you sign up for a tutorial at star they book they automatically book you

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,680
Twice so I'm also giving the same

62
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,040
workshop at star West in

63
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,680
October do they

64
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,760
And I forgot I feel bad I want to

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Maybe not do it, but I'm going to do it

66
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:33,050
So that happened just record the first one and have them I kind of thought it back the second time

67
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,330
I didn't like I like even the same talk twice

68
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,930
So that's happening. I'm going to I'm not officially announced yet, but I will be speaking at a conference in

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,580
June on the East Coast I'll leave it at that for now, but I'm giving two workshops there

70
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,800
Interesting to our listeners maybe I'm giving workshops on managing the modern tester

71
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
nice and

72
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,000
Community builders guidebook so things that we've been talking about on the show the show will large will dictate

73
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,160
large amounts of the content also giving a keynote there on

74
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,910
Don't exactly remember

75
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,870
But that'll come up later once it's official and then finally I'm going to be giving

76
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,030
Yet another iteration of the adventures in modern testing based on

77
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,730
feedback feedback

78
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:30,890
Learning more experiences. I'm going to be doing that at PNS QC in October as well

79
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,730
the one of my favorite conferences one of

80
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,530
In Portland so all kinds of weasel information, but

81
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,950
Let's reel it back in

82
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,190
Real sound effect brand bridges bridges stairs at me. He goes shut up Alan the clock

83
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,830
Just shut up actually shut up and don't talk just just shut up

84
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,180
No, just keep talking okay

85
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,540
Okay

86
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,020
in preparation to

87
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,020
Give these talks on modern testing and a and just think about modern testing in general and to maybe bringing up

88
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,820
Content and make modern testing org a real website that does that just doesn't redirect to the podcast website

89
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,540
One of the things I had been thinking about for a while is what are the modern testing principles?

90
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,820
what are the principles of modern testing and

91
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:29,560
a couple things came in mind while I was creating these and these are not

92
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,440
Brett Brett and I are gonna vet these a little bit on air

93
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,360
Maybe make some edits as we go so I can get these two

94
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,840
I feel a little bit more confident in them

95
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,100
I read them last night again, and I'm starting to feel pretty good about these

96
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,520
But I know there's some things that aren't quite right so in preparation for this I looked at

97
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,440
the

98
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,960
Agile principles and you know what the agile principles are Brett you have memorized no how many are there?

99
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,430
Isn't that the one with 12 there are 12? Yes. Yes, and

100
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,800
You pick this up from the agile manifesto

101
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,060
I did I did Lisa, and I did not want to these are from the agile manifesto

102
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I did not want to

103
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,860
Repeat these directly that would be

104
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,080
Plagiarism yes, and I didn't want to for the same reason

105
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,400
I didn't want to just make them all about agile testing because I see

106
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,600
Modern testing very much as an extension or an evolution of agile testing in many ways

107
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah, my view it kind of view it as a

108
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,840
Subset maybe yeah, maybe

109
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,370
In my mind not sure yet because I know Lisa says that she really likes it

110
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,530
She wants she grabbed on to the idea of the tester as a coach and that's coming up a lot more in conferences

111
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,050
we saw some feedback from a conference in Australia on Twitter over the weekend and

112
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,290
Katrina colloquy whose book I still over review on it's a very good book on on testing in DevOps and

113
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,810
She pointed out some theme. She had heard in the talks and

114
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:07,050
Yeah, much like much like modern testing it freaked some people out. I thought oh, those are pretty good things

115
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,370
They reflect they reflect some of these principles of modern time. No I

116
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,490
So I have her tweet

117
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,610
Loaded up right now and and she summarized that at cast 18

118
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
that a lot of them

119
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,480
themes were around testing being a bottleneck and

120
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:34,780
they were trying to come up with solutions which and the ones she had listed were

121
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,640
Essentially reduce the amount of testing done push testing to the users

122
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,800
remove tester as a roll and

123
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,820
Removing step-by-step test cases the last one I'm like

124
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,160
I hope we did that a long time ago. I thought we did so

125
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
Out of out of context you could look at those go. That's stupid

126
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,200
But within the context of modern testing a lot of this you go yes, of course

127
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,800
So let me blast through a few of the agile principles for context

128
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,840
You get an idea of what principles are and by the way

129
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,980
I highly recommend if you want to read a good book about principles in general and how they're developed

130
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:23,280
Ray Dalio's book called principles is very very good. I read it reread it every few years. So here are a few

131
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,160
I'm not gonna read all 12 of the agile principles

132
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,840
Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early continuous delivery of valuable software

133
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
People are nodding their heads. Yeah

134
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:42,200
Welcome changing requirements even late in development agile processes harness change with for customers competitive advantage

135
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,860
I'll do one more

136
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,580
Deliver working software frequently from a couple of weeks to a couple of months with a preference to the shorter time scale and they go

137
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,220
On but you'll read these you go. Yeah

138
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,180
Yeah, those are things we try and do when we do agile or if your team is faking as you go

139
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,930
Yeah, we don't do that. But

140
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:58,730
But again

141
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,630
I want to get some context on what principles were and then I want to talk about what I've come up with as the

142
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,690
Modern testing principles and Brett and I are going to figure out live on air

143
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:13,250
Where some word changes may need to be made where we may need to remove one because it just doesn't it's

144
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,890
Maybe it doesn't reflect

145
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,770
True modern testing principle or it's not part of what we should be the subset or maybe there's some things that are missing

146
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,930
So, how do you want to do this? I'm gonna go through one by one or just read them all that's

147
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,740
So I have I have this printed out as well. Let's start off with

148
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,520
What which one of these do you think is the most important?

149
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,850
They're all important there. They are all important if you look at the agile one

150
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,920
Right. I our highest priorities to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software

151
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,100
I I do I don't know where we going because I

152
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:01,100
Yes, that's very important but all the agile principles I think number one should be number one, okay

153
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,700
Good. Yeah, the order makes sense. I have

154
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,740
Let's put it this way. I have changed the order of these around no

155
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:14,820
No, no into an order that I think makes sense for the cause of modern testing. Okay, so let me let me be clear

156
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,620
I don't think what you have listed here is number one is actually the right number one

157
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,750
Which one do you think is the right number one with what you listed here?

158
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,660
number three

159
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,980
Okay, I could we could make that change

160
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,890
So number three is number one. I'm gonna start with number three. Are we just gonna do the whole podcast talking about bullets?

161
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:43,370
Yes, so let me start with number three then I'll go one two four five six no other changes

162
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,970
So number three is interesting

163
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,890
But get it is the one what I was gonna get when we got to is gonna bring up is

164
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,990
Really most like one of the agile principles. So I want to talk it. Let's do number three first

165
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:02,930
Let's have a discussion on why it's important in the modern testing principles in addition to some of the similar things that are in

166
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,490
The agile testing principles sound good. Yeah, let me just do one

167
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,770
Blip and then every lister is going please just tell me what you're talking about number three

168
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,290
In my podcast ever

169
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,450
Yeah, if you believe that please go back and listen to episode one

170
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:30,340
In my mind modern testing that what we're really trying to do is number one pull up principles

171
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,140
not

172
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,140
not not

173
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,130
Alan has written out a definition principles are a fundamental truth of proposition that serves as a

174
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,010
Foundation of a system so it's not the system. It's it's essentially

175
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,730
the skeleton of the system

176
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:50,530
These principles are what hold it together

177
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,050
Yes, okay

178
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,170
Guide is guide me completely

179
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,100
So I view when I think of this I am thinking of

180
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,630
three

181
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,110
concepts

182
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:13,150
combined together and that's where the principle should be formed and that is

183
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,110
the testing discipline

184
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,630
agile itself and

185
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:22,150
the business as it is

186
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,550
interpreted from data

187
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:33,070
So that last one is sort of a business data thing and I haven't quite gotten the good name on it

188
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,510
then like I do think that the principles of modern testing need to

189
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,900
like the fundamental foundation whatever the

190
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,860
the skeleton of the skeleton is

191
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,100
a

192
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
t8 or a ta

193
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,440
OSQ

194
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,520
Right accelerating the achievement of shipable quality. That's that's

195
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,220
the job

196
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,250
so I think the modern principles need to flesh that out of around what we mean and

197
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,890
and inform the

198
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,410
The skeleton for the next phases. Okay tactics and such should form off of this

199
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:21,420
All right, I'm done go. Okay 20 minutes into an episode on modern testing principles. We're gonna tell you what one of them is maybe

200
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,340
You're so awful so new number one

201
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,460
Squirrel the customer is the only one suitable to judge and evaluate the quality of our software

202
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:38,630
Yes, so that's do you think that that's the only lead with I think that's number one. This is actually

203
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:42,710
Paraphragm something you and I have both said before you probably said it first

204
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:50,500
This one is obvious it does overlap the agile principles as well. I

205
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:56,260
Feel like it's still worth bringing up here because I agile is a lot about the customer

206
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,780
But I think the role of the modern tester is to

207
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,950
Magnify to help magnify shine a light on the customer

208
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,890
yet the

209
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:14,250
So this is these are words that were in my deck that I presented to unity

210
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,560
and

211
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,640
What I wanted to call out in particular with this so

212
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,920
Test is not qualified

213
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:35,480
To evaluate the quality of software only the customer is yes, right? So the the point of

214
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,180
As it relates to a modern testing principle

215
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,730
It's test has got to get off its its high horse on

216
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,010
Being the at I think of your slide the champions of quality

217
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,450
the slide he is referring to for those of you that are

218
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,060
Wondering why we never talk about anything in particular is I have these slides

219
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,500
I've used in the past having used him in a while talk about testing the champions of quality and showing these superheroes

220
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,820
I say you know

221
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,100
You're the gatekeepers at the end and then I show these people shoveling horse crap at the end of a parade

222
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,030
Yeah, is that what it is? I've always imagined them shoveling elephant crap. It could be all for ya

223
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,310
I don't see a lot of elephants and parades so

224
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:27,520
Sure, okay. Okay, then I will again if I was a good podcast coordinator I would

225
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,560
Promise but I will try my best to print these out

226
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,160
For the show notes. So any wording could change there. I don't think so. I'm gonna call it good

227
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:44,960
I'm gonna read it one more time. The customer is the only one suitable to judge and evaluate the quality of our software

228
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,740
Yeah, the only one

229
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,660
The so when I when I wrote this originally

230
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:58,240
What I struggled with is the word suitable because I really wanted to say qualified

231
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,810
But then having qualified and quality in the same sentence

232
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:11,090
Triggers the only lesson I remember from sophomore English. Okay, I'm gonna keep it as suitable

233
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:15,370
And then I know I've heard that I feel like I've heard this somewhere

234
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,220
Before you I'll dig it out sometime. Okay. All right

235
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:26,540
So the we can look at my if if I stole it from somebody it's it's quoted in my deck. Okay

236
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:36,140
Consciously it would consciously sold it. No, and so I don't if I paraphrase some I will I will attribute

237
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,850
If you remember no, I do it when I do it right in the deck

238
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,730
You don't have to remember what I'm saying

239
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:50,770
It oh is that perhaps sometime you maybe read this or saw it in a presentation

240
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,290
Oh god, I gotta get and then it didn't register like oh, yeah

241
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,890
And it kind of triggered a thing under this shit all the time and my brain is not as screwed up as yours

242
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,970
not quite I

243
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,880
That could be another episode I firmly disagree with that

244
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm old but I drink a lot and helps preserve the brain cells

245
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,480
The the formaldehyde

246
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Let's do another one. Oh god

247
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,530
the anticipation ooh

248
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,250
We accelerate the team by identifying and mitigating bottlenecks

249
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,370
Particularly if the bottleneck is testing

250
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,530
captures part of ATA SOQ it does

251
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,180
the thing I don't like about this one is that it it

252
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:41,390
Focuses the acceleration and I don't think that that's I don't think that plays out

253
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,430
You were right in my thinking what you brought up a few minutes ago was apparent in my thinking

254
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,430
I did want to support accelerate the achievement of quality

255
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,790
Yeah, so that's where this came from and why it is the original number one

256
00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:00,010
What would be a better way to support that? I think it's important that we are

257
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:09,470
We apply theory of constraints to identify a bottlenecks to identify where the slow parts are in the system and

258
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,930
implement processes tools

259
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:17,850
Discussions as needed to help optimize and make those bottlenecks

260
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,060
Less of a bottleneck and more efficient, you know

261
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,700
Since you invoked the theory of constraints and you know, I'm a invoked. I'm a

262
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:36,030
Wholehearted believer in it, you know what? I'd so I like the the principle you're trying to get across I

263
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,270
Just don't think it's getting it across

264
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:46,590
What's a bottleneck and maybe we don't need the words a bottleneck is an inefficiency in the system

265
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,790
particularly one that slows

266
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,750
People or the process down so they actually now I think it messes with our ability to get quality software

267
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:01,710
frequently to our customers, I think I figured out what what I

268
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,760
What my gut is telling me is missing on this. I'm gonna test this out

269
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,760
Live and see right the theory of constraints essentially is all about number one. It's it's you

270
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,320
it's you can only go as fast as

271
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:25,520
The bottlenecks in your system in essence. Yes, but it also calls out an approach in techniques around identifying

272
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,170
Which bottleneck so here?

273
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,240
That's the thing. I think is missing. It's around

274
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,600
investigating identifying and I didn't and then working through the bottlenecks in

275
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,700
Business order

276
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:53,360
Yes, I get that because the line I use is you want to mitigate your find your most severe bottleneck and mitigate that not till it

277
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,640
Solve completely but tell us not the biggest bottleneck anymore

278
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:04,180
Yes, so we're missing a word in there. Yes, we're missing a I think it is just a word by by identifying

279
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,910
Prioritizing and mitigating bottlenecks. I like how you just phrased it where it's essentially

280
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,040
What we're doing is we're

281
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,380
constantly

282
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,380
reevaluating and removing

283
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,310
the next current bottleneck or the next biggest bottleneck we

284
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
could say

285
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,840
And welcome to the brainstorming session baby testing we could say we apply the theory of constraints

286
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,310
to

287
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,390
identify prioritize and mitigate

288
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,230
bottlenecks in this from the software system. I love that

289
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,340
You should type

290
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
I write slow

291
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,350
Make sure the word accelerate is in there and the word system is in there

292
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,100
What did I say? Do you remember we apply the theory of constraints?

293
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:02,740
To and then a whole bunch of other words

294
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:08,880
We apply the theory of constraints to identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system. Yes

295
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,600
Okay, so that one sounds very David Debbie

296
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,380
the first one also sounds

297
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,730
Debbie

298
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:25,650
Okay, fine. So we have somewhere in the principal is we got a cover

299
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,170
What is?

300
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:34,330
Tests secret sauce. Well, let's actually get through all of these

301
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,050
Okay, and then we can figure out what's missing or if we need to add some spices to the others

302
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:45,250
So we have now for number two is we apply the theory of constraints to identify

303
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:48,330
Prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system

304
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:56,800
I like it and what I had before was particularly if the bottleneck is testing which we can add a salt later or something else

305
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:03,560
Let's let's let's leave it as it is for now without that tag and see if we have to go back and add something to it

306
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,780
How about just a separate principle?

307
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,420
Testing should never be this a bottleneck

308
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:18,060
It's funny. I've said that before many times actually several times. I should say over the last few weeks is

309
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:24,620
What was the quote? I even put it in our slack our slack channel. I said QA is never the bottleneck

310
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,230
But really testing is never the bottleneck

311
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,680
Testing is the bottleneck all the time testing is never really the bottleneck

312
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:42,340
Explain if testing is the bottleneck. It means you've likely messed things up elsewhere. Oh, it's not the cause of the bottleneck, right?

313
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,420
Yeah, it's not the root cause of the bottleneck. Let's come back to that

314
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,980
let's leave this one as is and like I said if we get to the end if

315
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,500
We can go back and add something around testing frantically take some notes. I'll type them up later. So the next one is

316
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:05,700
Our primary focus is helping the team create higher quality software. Is that going to be redundant with the others now?

317
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,580
The thing I don't like about it. Is it soft it is soft and it isn't

318
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,140
disambiguated

319
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,160
from

320
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,770
Traditional testing I wanted to capture the coaching role we use so much in modern testing

321
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,340
Yet, so I picked that up and what you're really trying to say

322
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,310
We're testing word and it kind of piggybacks off of the bottleneck

323
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:40,030
Right if the bottleneck is that devs don't know how to test their own shit

324
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:46,260
Then it is better for the modern tester to sit down

325
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,160
figure out what makes it so hard for them to test their own shit a

326
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,240
Modern tester this is how I've kind of viewed the thinking of a modern tester none this front. Okay

327
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,660
it is

328
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,820
important to drive

329
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:13,380
code correctness upstream it is it creates a bottleneck

330
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,140
when

331
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,040
We let the code get all the way down to

332
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:29,210
Amid to low-level tester to then write the unit tests. We're slowing down the system

333
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:37,900
Modern testers role is to figure out why code correctness isn't moved upstream and to make changes to make that happen

334
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,300
so for example

335
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,750
One complaint I get from does all the time is they don't know how to test

336
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:52,840
Fine, we sit down and teach them another one is look. It's my job to write dev code. I

337
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,590
Need I need the ability to write these unit tests or whatever super

338
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,230
cheap

339
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,030
Right good when they starting off. They're gonna view them as a high cost

340
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:12,760
So I think I think a tester can help in terms of teaching can help in terms of reducing the friction

341
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:18,460
I get it and actually something I've been saying recently since I first wrote these which has actually been a few months

342
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,170
Something I've been telling people on my team

343
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:27,270
Which I think is going to tie into this is that you are not responsible for quality quality is owned by the team

344
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,790
however, you are responsible for the quality culture of the team and

345
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:36,030
That ties in a lot to what you're saying because I'm gonna babble some words out here

346
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,150
Then we'll figure out what they're what the right principle is

347
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:38,350
Okay

348
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:45,950
is that I do count on the modern testers on my team or the soon-to-be modern testers as the as they grow and mature to

349
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,550
Figure out what?

350
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:52,650
Like what's the testing we should be doing and where should happen in the cycle?

351
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,290
Which is a little bit of a paraphrase what you just said

352
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,470
Yeah, if there's better unit tests need to be done

353
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:03,790
They're going to dive in and help make that happen whether it's coaching or just identifying where missing tests are

354
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,600
identifying

355
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,000
What are the integration? What are the what are the?

356
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,580
Tests that we may be missing around maybe there's some stress or load tests or some performance testing looking at the what I call

357
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,580
The all aspects of quality

358
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,180
Maybe one thing though and and I don't disagree with what you're saying

359
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,980
But maybe this is one thing that we need to explicitly call out

360
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:29,630
Software quality and code correctness are different things

361
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:39,480
That's while true. It's not really a principle. I know no, I don't know where to integrate it in but the

362
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,440
I'm okay with with software

363
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,820
quality

364
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:54,260
That test being accountable for software quality. I am NOT okay with tests being accountable for code

365
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,660
correctness and

366
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,040
What I think somewhere in here is we should say

367
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,250
Something up to the effect of part of our job is to push code correctness

368
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,450
upstream

369
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:19,000
Right two years from now. I don't I I would very much not like to see

370
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
your team at unity

371
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:27,190
You know writing test cases to make sure the dev didn't introduce a bug

372
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,580
Right. Dev should be focused on that

373
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,980
So this perhaps needs a tag but even a better phrase pulled out what I just said that I liked for changing from

374
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,780
Our primary focus is helping the team create higher quality software. Let's get rid of that but

375
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,530
This may need a tag like I said, but what if I just said what I said before

376
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:51,810
We are responsible for the quality culture of our team. I like that and just leave it at that

377
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,980
Could we have a tag?

378
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,860
We are responsible for the quality culture of our team

379
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,380
Hyphen comma semi-colon including

380
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,560
coaching

381
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,790
Blah and blah the thing I still think is missing from this and I think this is an important principle

382
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:16,470
Because when you just say software quality quality as you know, just like the word test is ambiguous

383
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:21,330
No, but that's in the old one you lost me. I said we are responsible for the quality culture of our team

384
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,810
I did not say software quality

385
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,510
Software quality was in the old one the old ambiguous one. Okay, we are responsible for the quality culture of our team

386
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,630
I guess the old so others be more explicit

387
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:46,680
Something in here needs to state in a way that's helpful that we we hold some accountability

388
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,760
for

389
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
teaching

390
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,640
Others how to fix their code correctness issues

391
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,620
But we are not the safety net

392
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,310
Something in here needs to guide people to realize

393
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,250
That a modern tester is no longer the safety net for code correctness issues

394
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,950
Yes, and I and I think we add that as a separate that I have an idea here

395
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,060
Okay. How about this for this principle?

396
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,120
We are responsible for the quality culture of our team and are accountable for helping and coaching the team in this regard

397
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,340
Next principle added and perhaps in this order. Maybe maybe it goes first

398
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,600
In between those two is just straight out. We are not the safety net for software quality

399
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:46,830
That can be given the definition of principle. It's viable to leave that there or to have that as a principle

400
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,550
I love that if you replace the word quality with correctness

401
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,760
That is done. All right. I'm feeling good. We are halfway done

402
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,760
With the principles and we'll read them out. I'll read them out in order as

403
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,580
When we're done on this list, what did we do one through four one through three?

404
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:13,660
Dude, we did three then one and two now we're doing four. All right number four

405
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,980
We use data to deeply understand customer usage and customer pain

406
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,820
Yes, good with that one. I I am okay

407
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:26,440
number five booyah

408
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,900
Continuous learning and adaptation both as an individual and a team is critical for success

409
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:41,320
And maybe this falls into that vague category a bit. So let me talk about what I was trying to capture as a modern tester. I'm

410
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:48,390
Deeply care about the retrospective. I am probably it's this could be some my personal bias

411
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,750
I think that learning the learning organization is so important for software quality

412
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:01,250
now it's trying to capture the modern tester role in that process and also the fact that as

413
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:08,690
Specializing generalists we need to constantly be learning new things to be successful. So that's what I was trying to capture

414
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,090
I don't think I quite got it, right?

415
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,310
So this is what I need some help. What do you think?

416
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:20,730
So I figured out what you're trying to do there and I completely agree

417
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,710
Continuous learning is important

418
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,190
however in my sense

419
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,310
Like what I would love to see the principles tie out

420
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,760
Or when when you look at the whole set it helps to clarify

421
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,280
What is the ROI of a modern tester into the business? Why do you hire these people?

422
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,090
Right because that's been a long-standing problem in in the test community

423
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,810
Test doesn't even know what the health test does

424
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Now continuous learning

425
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,610
It's not really a

426
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,690
It's not a ends. It's a means

427
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:10,400
Right it is but adaptation in my mind is an ends and we've talked about this

428
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,480
multiple times

429
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:19,410
So if we're focused on accelerating we can't accelerate

430
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,490
way and and have a you know a year in between the

431
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:32,330
The cadence points where we get any sort of feedback from the customer whether it be verbal or as we stated in the prior principle

432
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:36,780
via data, I do think that is

433
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,550
critical and that is

434
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,960
So here's what I'm thinking in my head something along the lines that says

435
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:48,380
We will move forward with a goal and a plan

436
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,660
That what I'm gonna write or what I'm gonna say is is gonna be too verby

437
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,960
But the idea is we move forward with a goal and a plan

438
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,440
But we're constantly paranoid that it's wrong

439
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,280
We test it and adapt

440
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,740
There's something there and it reminds me a couple things

441
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:14,320
I want to bring up one is I use this phrase a lot in my current job is make sure people have the I say

442
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:21,560
Some people do or do not have what I call the appropriate level of paranoia. So that reminded me of that but

443
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,060
test

444
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:31,200
traditionally has been a cost center people look at it as a cost there was a book that came out it I

445
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,190
Don't want to trash on it because maybe some of the listeners contributed to it

446
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,750
But it was called how just the title I want to talk about how to reduce the cost of software testing

447
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:48,700
What I see as a modern tester is it's not a cost a modern tester is a force multiplier a modern tester

448
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:56,180
You can often tie dollar signs to their contributions which we only could apply negative dollar signs to testers

449
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,660
So I don't know if I want to capture some of that

450
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:04,880
But that thought came out in my head to me what I'm trying to communicate. I thought it might that's why I babble

451
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
So say it again. It's Kaizen

452
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:13,180
K-a-i-z. I know Kaizen is yeah, and and I'm trying to find the the

453
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,310
interpretation

454
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,530
Believe someone once shared with me

455
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:27,730
Wikipedia is not validating this but I believe once someone once shared with me that Kaizen was literally

456
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,310
translated as

457
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,470
llama lines of being chased by a tiger

458
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:40,350
That the that you're you're trying to improve but there is a sense of urgency

459
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,070
around it so

460
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,010
Wikipedia just says it's the word for improvement

461
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,530
but

462
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,820
The way it was once described to me was more around there's a sense of urgency around it

463
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:02,340
The the other aspect that you were just talking about as it relates to adaptation

464
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,840
And as it relates to a cost center and it occurs to me

465
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,660
This could combine with what you've listed first for number six

466
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,830
modern testing strives to be an ROI Center not a cost center

467
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:30,660
So how do we continuously adapt to remove the wasteful practices from our system?

468
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:34,140
It is a wasteful practice to test

469
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,160
The last month before we ship. Yes, it is a wasteful practice to have a bug database

470
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,160
These are all wasteful

471
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,360
practices that that

472
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,940
encourage

473
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
manual human

474
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
philosophical interaction

475
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,510
Whereas in the modern world you don't need this

476
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:07,270
You don't have to be theoretical you can ship you can get your data from your back-end database and you can

477
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:13,290
Hypothesis or do hypothesis testing and prove or disprove which approach is better

478
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,260
That is way too verbi for a principle. It is

479
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
how about something like

480
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,740
we

481
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,740
Apply we something about

482
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,490
We apply continuous improvement

483
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,830
We use continuous improvement. What's the right verb there?

484
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,300
We use continuous improvement

485
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:41,620
I did a couple blog posts last year after based on my time in teams not not as

486
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:47,560
Anger inducing as my last one about teams, but talked about two problems that team had

487
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,520
the fallacy of now customers have to have my feature now and

488
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,920
Failure to launch meaning well, I got to get it perfect before they get it

489
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,760
I was too common in those two principles in a team culture is

490
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,270
just death

491
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,100
Yes, so what I have now and it has to be perfect

492
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,540
So with a and and you have two different either we want to stop both of those right we want to

493
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,940
One

494
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,940
They don't maybe they don't need to have it right now and we need to be able to identify when that's not the when that's

495
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,900
The case also we also need to identify with something. We have to get feedback on this. It's useless

496
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,220
Because of a previous principle for us to just iterate on this forever without getting customer feedback

497
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:39,020
So there's something about finding that balance

498
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,500
maybe

499
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:46,080
This you triggering a thought of this speech. I give my team and that is

500
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,040
the

501
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,320
single most precious resources I

502
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,980
Am worried about it's calendar time

503
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,360
then engineering time I

504
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:05,040
cannot scale calendaring time and I can only scale engineering time to a degree and

505
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,890
Nothing

506
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,870
This is what I want this principle to sort of call out because nothing pisses me off more

507
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:19,570
Where I have one of my superstars heads down on a project for three months

508
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,830
We ship it and we realize no one cares

509
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,150
particularly when I have a backlog of

510
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:36,250
A hundred things that I could have done instead can I throw another one? I am yeah

511
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,640
Doesn't use adaptation, but let's try this

512
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,980
Continuously as this lot. This is a lot like the second one accelerating the three of constraints, but a little different

513
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:56,190
Continuously solve problems for the team enabling them to optimize calendar time closer or farther away little of both I

514
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,100
Think it's net farther away. I like calendar time in there

515
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,360
Yeah, I think what we have here is better better

516
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,440
Yeah, the thing I'm trying to I'm trying to do an emotional plea here really honestly

517
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,040
Does this principle need to be I am the quality guy?

518
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,500
My customers in pain

519
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,800
Their pain is continuously moving. How do we adapt to solve the customers pain?

520
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:34,000
That brings in the desperation and the pain part, but there's an important aspect here and that is

521
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:41,540
Test shouldn't just be focusing on preventing customer pain instead of just figuring out. How do we make their pain go away?

522
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,460
How do we figure how do we apply our talents to make the customer happy?

523
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,950
What if I said this and just give me the the farther away farther away or closer?

524
00:41:53,130 --> 00:42:00,990
Ensure that the team adapts and optimizes in order to solve customer pain in order to solve customer pain

525
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:06,870
Something there should be a time constraint in there in order to I like that

526
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:17,450
Better so that's closer. I don't like the ensures the team part because then that it sounds like a guy in an ivory tower

527
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,070
You guys will

528
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,140
adapt

529
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:31,740
What if I say embrace continuous improvement and help the team adapt and optimize in order to solve customer pain?

530
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:39,880
Yeah, I think let's go on to six or the next one and then I think we'll we'll do another round offline

531
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,820
Because I want to now see what all of these what the whole set looks okay

532
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:47,820
I'm gonna leave it as the original one. I wrote with my notes here and number six is

533
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:56,100
We strive to reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing role on our teams by increasing testing abilities and know-how across the team

534
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:06,770
Yes, I think I'm okay with that one as is yeah, it's too long because really what you're saying. It's not that long

535
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:08,970
I think it's shorter than any of the agile principles

536
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:16,370
What am I saying? How would you say you're saying in essence what we've said on the podcast?

537
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,970
It

538
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,290
We're here to eliminate bottlenecks a

539
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,640
Testing specialist is a bottleneck a specialist is a bottleneck in general. Yes

540
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,290
testing is an activity that

541
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:41,080
Can be taught and be incorporated into a specializing generalist system. That's essentially what you're trying to say. Absolutely

542
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,880
I like the shock value around

543
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,550
Testing specialists are a bottleneck

544
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:54,750
That's this that's what this is saying that is what you're saying

545
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,230
But I can't just that that as I've shocked value doesn't explain the principle behind it. It's a it's a statement

546
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:07,470
No, yeah, it's it's that by itself is only useful when it's combined with the prior. We hate bottlenecks

547
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:11,810
All right. We'll go with that. Let me read them off in order

548
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:17,530
Okay, and then we'll have a little bit of a recap on that and then I think we'll be pretty close

549
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:20,090
We may be tweaking that one for a while. So

550
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:24,740
There's one other thing that's I think not

551
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:33,330
Called out. What's that? So the thing that I am finding more and more

552
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:43,620
validated by external content is that test is shifting to be much more focused on

553
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:51,740
Business KPIs then code KPIs. That's not a principle, but I think we're missing something. I'm not now

554
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:54,860
I think that's captured here. Okay, I think

555
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:02,540
The customer is the business and that may be coming because you're doing a lot of stuff with business KPIs. So that may be

556
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,200
Brent influence over modern testing influence

557
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,480
That's fine. Let me read these in order in the new order

558
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,840
Number one the customer is the only one suitable to judge and evaluate the quality of our software

559
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,300
Yes, number two. We apply the theory of constraints to identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system

560
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:32,880
Number three we are responsible for the quality culture of our team and are accountable for helping and coaching the team in this regard

561
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:41,010
Number four we are not the safety net or the modern tester is not the safety net for software correctness

562
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:49,810
We use data number five now we use data to deeply understand customer usage and customer pain

563
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:52,470
number six

564
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,470
Currently to be changed

565
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:00,530
continuous learning and an adaptation both as an individual and a team is critical for success and

566
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,850
then number seven for episode 77

567
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,470
we strive to reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated for a

568
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:19,020
Dedicated testing specialist on our team by increasing testing abilities and know-how across the team. I think that's good

569
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:25,300
I think those aren't bad. Yeah, it's what's triggered when you said that last one or the number six again

570
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,620
What triggered this time around?

571
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:34,940
When I go and help when I am doing doing the agile coach thing and I'm walking people through how to think about agile

572
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,220
Okay, I

573
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,660
Bring up

574
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:42,820
It's about adaption not iteration. Yes, right?

575
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:46,270
But that's an agile thing. It is an agile thing

576
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,850
But what's the difference between adaption and?

577
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,240
iteration

578
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,480
constant learning

579
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,790
That's the implementation. It's about changing the goal

580
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,320
Iteration you don't need to change the goal you just

581
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:11,800
Iterate correct adaption is your your changing the direction of the system. Yes, of course

582
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,800
So the continuous learning and and all of that right if you combine these things

583
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,720
What is our role in the system is to adapt the system towards a more positive customer goal?

584
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:30,780
continuously and then when you say that I realize that that principle is

585
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,150
very much

586
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:41,690
Probably a lines with one or more of the agile principles exactly. So it's not unique to modern testing

587
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:45,620
It isn't

588
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:49,890
but

589
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:56,030
That's true for several things. We've listed here not entirely not entirely constrained that one

590
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:00,970
Specialists no, no, I I disagree

591
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:05,530
Wholeheartedly the rest of these are all about modern testing. All right

592
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:12,730
The fact that they do it within an agile mindset is one thing but they're all about modern testing

593
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,930
These are things that most testers on agile teams won't say all

594
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:25,370
But I'm gonna say many I'll say most the other six now are things that most testers on agile teams are

595
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:32,770
Not doing it's the difference between agile testing and modern testing and it is a it's a gradual change

596
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,490
It isn't like you're in one school or the other

597
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:42,540
But if you're on an agile team and you're doing it right and you're not doing fragile continuous learning and adaptation

598
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,500
a part of what you do, but the other things we mentioned are things that are

599
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,620
Slightly different to most

600
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:57,580
testers working on agile teams so they do specify some difference between the agile tester and the modern tester and

601
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:03,660
So I'm thinking my thinking is is when I print these out. I'm going to remove that one and

602
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:09,740
With the one we added about the safety net we'll be back to say and then see how it hurts and see how it hurts

603
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:17,140
That's what I'm gonna work with I feel good about these I'm going to print these I'm going to vet them again with the test bash crowd and

604
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:24,020
Then because I feel much better about these and then we'll at that point all that's left is maybe is a little bit of tweaking

605
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,500
Which we can do

606
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:31,540
Again based on feedback. We the principles are great because like everything else in agile

607
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,060
they are

608
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,060
fallible and they will be

609
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,100
Adjusted as needed as we learn more information about our customers

610
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:45,060
That's the one thing that once we publish these things if this if this ends up

611
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,490
being a thing

612
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:54,900
one thing I want us to do that the agile manifesto did not do is continuously iterate it as

613
00:49:56,020 --> 00:50:03,260
Think flaws are discovered. Absolutely. I cannot work any other way. I am incapable of doing anything perfectly

614
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:09,460
I recognize that and embrace that so I figure I will just throw stuff out as it's close as we did today

615
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:17,700
It gets better which it did today and it will continue to improve as we get feedback from smarter people than you and especially me

616
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,620
It just occurred to me

617
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:29,590
We could use the principles of modern testing to test the principles of modern testing. This is like inception

618
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:34,410
No, we could we could shoot this out to to the three

619
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,600
Then we can evaluate as they are

620
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,430
Who's the customer of these principles?

621
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:45,250
We have a customer. Yeah these principles the three is a is a

622
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,030
good set of them

623
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:54,350
So what I would suggest as we wrap up here is I'm going to write these out in the blog post

624
00:50:54,350 --> 00:51:00,670
They'll be a test bash. I encourage lots and lots of feedback via email the slack channel Twitter or whatever and

625
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,520
We'll take that and

626
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,720
iterate and learn

627
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
Okay. All right

628
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,920
Once again, I'm still Alan and I am Brent. All right. We'll see you next time on a be
