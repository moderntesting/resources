1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,500
It's up everybody. Hello, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And guess what? We're back again.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,700
Episode... How many are we, Brent? Episode number 36.

3
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,420
All right, we're not recording. We're not. I'm kidding, we are. Yeah.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:31,600
So again, the astute three will know you record usually in the morning at 8am.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,280
Yep. And it's a good time to catch Brent a little off guard. And Alan takes far too much pleasure

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,000
in that. You know, I do. I do laugh at the misfortune of others. Did you see the Taylor Swift?

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,800
Whoa! I kicked the button on my chair and I just dropped about a foot. It was like a little

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,480
elevator drop. I'm good now. Did you happen to see the Taylor Swift versus a treadmill?

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,200
No. Oh, it's good. So not a big Tay Tay fan. Not a big fan of treadmills. In fact, if I were to

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,440
choose one or the other, I would choose the treadmill. But there's this video of Taylor

11
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,000
Swift. It's an app. It's an ad for Apple Music. We're at Microsoft. I just talked about Apple.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
It's great. And she's running and rapping and showing like she can pick whatever song she wants,

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,600
you know, and she goes doing her thing and then she falls flat on her face. It's hilarious.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,640
The misfortune of others always... Was it Chaucer who said that? One of the three tell me

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,200
there's a line, a famous line about laughing at the misfortune of others. And I laughed at

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,160
Taylor because it was really done well. Honestly, if we take away all of our social

17
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:45,520
filters and really think about it, I think we'll all agree that there is nothing funnier

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,280
than watching somebody actually or accidentally hitting the coffee table with their shin.

19
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,170
As long as you don't die. As long as you don't die.

20
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:03,570
So how many? 36? 36 episodes. And we have hit our two year mark.

21
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,970
We've been doing this for two years, 36 times saying the exact same shit.

22
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:17,570
Over and over and over. And yet we have now multiple people claiming that

23
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:23,490
they've binge listened to us. There's only three listeners, Brent.

24
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,050
Yes, they rotate through. After one person finishes Ben listening, you're like,

25
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:35,010
Oh, I've pretty much figured out everything these guys have to say.

26
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,370
Yeah. I don't understand. Honestly, thank you, Danny Fott. I know there's others, but

27
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,850
he's one of the three now and he said he binge listened. And honestly, I can't stand listening

28
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,690
to myself talk for more than about 15 minutes. I don't know how it happens. I don't know how

29
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,980
you survive. I'm betting alcohol or massive amounts of coffee.

30
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,040
It might be a distraction from like a commute home. I don't know.

31
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:11,100
While we're wallowing in our two years of... Whatever this is.

32
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:19,980
I think success is too strong of a word. In fact, I'm sure it is. Two years of therapy.

33
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,970
In one of the topics that was rejected from today's list, as the three know our process,

34
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,650
as we get in the room and set about five minutes writing some things on the whiteboard, we say,

35
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:37,650
Yep, yep, yep, nope, nope, we order them. And then we go. And one of the things we cut was

36
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,170
just some stuff often listeners may have figured this out.

37
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,090
Are you uncutting it?

38
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,490
No, I'm cutting it. I'm just saying that they were there because I just need some therapy on

39
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,170
this and working through with Brent in front of the front of three people we can't see

40
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,890
often helps me. So if we have not helped the three and the community,

41
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,530
maybe in a way we've helped each other.

42
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,180
No.

43
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,100
So speaking of hugs, I got the nicest LinkedIn comment that I share with Brent.

44
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,220
And now I'm going to share.

45
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:16,860
Hey, wait a minute.

46
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:17,660
Wait, wait, not yet.

47
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,300
Did I ever tell you that I kind of invented a drink?

48
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,470
Okay, no, but there's a story here. Please tell me.

49
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,700
I call it the group hug.

50
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,150
Oh, please go on.

51
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,750
And it's it is just n shots of Patron.

52
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,730
I love it.

53
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,610
So that's so interesting. When you thought of drink, I thought I really don't. I love wine,

54
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,450
beer, it's IPA or nothing for me. I'm a Northwesterner.

55
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,730
I love the bite of the IPA. But if I drink a hot hot alcohol,

56
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,020
it's almost always tequila occasionally have a gin and tonic, but I'm a big tequila fan or mezcal.

57
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,850
So I don't know what a mezcal is.

58
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,490
Mezcal is like this. It's still from Agave, but it's a smoky. It's really good. If you can find

59
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,930
a good one or really awful. If you find a bad one, the swing on mezcal I found is a bit large,

60
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:22,910
but someone at work yesterday. And once again, I'm proud of ourselves because we cannot quite get to

61
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,670
that first topic without a tangent. But there's a tradition at Microsoft. I don't know who started

62
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,310
or even if it's really a tradition, but people bring in on their anniversary of n number of years,

63
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,230
that many pounds of M&Ms.

64
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,470
Yeah, I don't know when that actually began.

65
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,990
Because I didn't even hear of it.

66
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,110
20 years.

67
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,510
I didn't even hear of it till I've been here at least 10.

68
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,830
Yeah. And I actually started getting harassed for not doing it like the last three years.

69
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,670
And people do variations once in a while, and I've never, ever, ever done it. And someone

70
00:05:52,670 --> 00:06:00,700
yesterday been here 11 years and brought in 11 pounds of M&Ms. And maybe I'll be a team player

71
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,620
and I'll bring in some on my 21st anniversary coming up this year. And I thought because

72
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,100
my 21 year anniversary at Microsoft is in June.

73
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,860
Is it?

74
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,220
Yeah, I hit my 20 year last year. So I'll be 21 years in June.

75
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,580
I must be 21 now.

76
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,380
Yeah, maybe.

77
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,740
Because I'm like, wait a minute.

78
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,100
So because I have been working long.

79
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,500
I am.

80
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:27,810
Brent. The sight of Brent actually thinking is like freaky.

81
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:33,090
You know, as it's like, first days and anniversaries as I get older, I was like,

82
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,410
I don't even want to know him anymore. So yes, I'm old.

83
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,770
Anyway, go ahead.

84
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,810
My story.

85
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,450
You're listening time. I'm glad we didn't hug.

86
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,840
I will this June I will have been at Microsoft 21 years and 21 is the legal drinking age.

87
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,720
So instead of M&Ms, I am going to bring in a nice bottle of tequila and doing shots.

88
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
Then you want to come by my desk.

89
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,700
Oh, but not that we drink at work.

90
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,780
It'll be all the time.

91
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,020
Little teeny shots.

92
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,580
If you go to you have a bev mode just down the street.

93
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,460
We do here.

94
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,140
Yeah, just up the street.

95
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,500
Oh, I know where it is.

96
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:13,660
Yeah.

97
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,780
I don't know if you've seen these things. They're called twisted shots with a Z.

98
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,620
I really leery of pre mixed drinks.

99
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,060
They're not. No, they're there.

100
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,660
They're these small little shot glasses, kind of like K cups.

101
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:38,180
And in the middle of it is is there's a divider and they put in one beverage on one side and

102
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,700
another beverage on the other side.

103
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:45,090
And then when you shoot them, the mix and so it's mostly not pre mixed,

104
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,170
but they're fun as hell.

105
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,370
Some of them are really good.

106
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,970
Next time I go to a frat party, I'll bring one.

107
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,210
No, go get a six pack.

108
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:58,050
You can test them out at home with your wife and then you go, hey,

109
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,610
I'm thinking about getting I don't know what are you going to get 21.

110
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,810
Anyway, I like getting good like Patron.

111
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,010
It's a sipping tequila.

112
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,250
That is shouting to get its group hug.

113
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,770
It's a group hug.

114
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,730
Yeah. All right.

115
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,730
Oh, so anyway, back to the podcast.

116
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,770
We're still recording.

117
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,330
Looks like it.

118
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,770
Yes.

119
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,970
Oh, indeed we are.

120
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,530
So I got a nice we got I got it.

121
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,330
It came to my LinkedIn inbox, but I shared it with Brent.

122
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,580
A very nice comment from a LinkedIn, a linker.

123
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,140
What's it called?

124
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,620
A linked someone I'm connected to.

125
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,420
Yeah.

126
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,980
That sounds very new agey.

127
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,180
A connection, a connection.

128
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,460
Chris George.

129
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,400
He says, Hey, I never thought I'd write a letter like this.

130
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,760
Sorry, wrong one.

131
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,880
Hi, I recently found yours and Brent's A B testing podcast and as such have found a new

132
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,040
use of the two hour commute time in my car.

133
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,170
Wow.

134
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,720
One two hour commutes a long time.

135
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,680
And I feel sorry for that.

136
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,480
Luckily, there's an hour we can do something else because our podcasts are usually.

137
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,000
You think it's two hours one way.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,880
I don't know.

139
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,640
Anyway, he says, and I say, I've been a tester for 20 years,

140
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,960
mix of automation, exploration, management, et cetera.

141
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,720
Sounds like a lot of the three and rent and I, and I guess in the last couple of

142
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,840
years have been struggling with working out how testers fit into continuous delivery teams.

143
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
I've experienced the dev tester dependency cycle, which we've talked about.

144
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,040
I love that.

145
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,120
Thanks for picking that up many times and have been in denial that the tester role is the

146
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,600
problem.

147
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
Listening to your podcast and the explanation of the dependency cycle and the unified engineering

148
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:36,880
teams.

149
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,920
I love that he uses unified, not the stupid Microsoft combined thing.

150
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,400
Yes.

151
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,440
So I'm digging.

152
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,960
He gets our lingo.

153
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,800
He does like he's really like, this is why I'm all tingly and happy.

154
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,520
One of the three.

155
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,000
Welcome.

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
It's consolidated and validated many thoughts that I've been having recently and helped me

157
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,040
adopt a more consultancy role in my current team to help the devs do more and better testing.

158
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,000
So in a word, thanks.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,960
Keep up the good work.

160
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,800
So thank you, Chris.

161
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,120
Yeah.

162
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:03,920
Thanks, Chris.

163
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,800
I we love hearing that we actually do something.

164
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,080
I'd say right again.

165
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,720
I'm not really.

166
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,160
Yeah.

167
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
Help totally wrong.

168
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,440
My my goal in life is one of the one of my principles, I guess, wouldn't say goal.

169
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,200
A principle is just to help people.

170
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,360
And if I can help you, it's good for my who I am.

171
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,720
Well, we talked about it last time.

172
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,840
People want purpose, mastery and autonomy.

173
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,080
Yeah.

174
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,400
And furthermore, they do want those.

175
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,840
We're still working on mastery.

176
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,400
We're still and we're still huge fans of Dan pink.

177
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,640
Yeah.

178
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,680
If you get bored of our podcast, just pick up like one of the Dan pink audio books and go

179
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,480
from there.

180
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,680
So I run the hidden brain quite often, which is good.

181
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,640
NPR podcast.

182
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,000
I have to add that one.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,920
I have too many podcasts in the delete some.

184
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,560
Anyway, I wrote back and I said, as I worry, I said, I see to say, I said, I worry that

185
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,520
we're kind of beating a dead horse because as Brett and I already mentioned today,

186
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,520
we've been talking about the same thing pretty much for 36 going on 36 hours now

187
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,400
over two years.

188
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:11,230
But I say, I worry sometimes you're beating a dead horse and he wrote back.

189
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:14,110
Nice guy said, I don't think it's a dead horse.

190
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,030
So we're beating a live horse, apparently.

191
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,660
Many teams are at various various stages in this journey.

192
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,220
He's been in a position where being able to react and ship tools quicker

193
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,740
is important for a number of years.

194
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,020
It's quite easy.

195
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:33,300
But however, howings, however, seeing how you guys change track from my perspective

196
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,140
are knocking it out of the park regarding frequent high quality and reactive

197
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,460
releases.

198
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,620
Is it just inspirational for a massive organization?

199
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,540
So when he said change track, I'm like, wait a bit.

200
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,940
Is he about to give us a compliment on ADHD?

201
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,060
That's the, you know how I don't know if you're like me, but all the podcast on the

202
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,460
car and then I'll think about something and I'll space out and I realized I

203
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,100
haven't heard the last 10 seconds or 30 seconds or whatever.

204
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,300
So yeah, of course.

205
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,460
So the, the bonus in our podcast is when it happens, you wonder,

206
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,700
am I still listening to the same podcast because we changed our.

207
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,300
And it, and it's a positive thing with our podcast, a feature of our podcast.

208
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,460
If you do zone out for that 10 minutes, you don't have to rewind.

209
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,810
Absolutely correct.

210
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,250
This is like the inception podcast.

211
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:26,530
Really.

212
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,290
It's a podcast within a podcast.

213
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,450
Cause our tangents have tangents,

214
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,400
but they don't have tangents within tangents within tangents because we're

215
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,160
too old and we will just lose track.

216
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,600
No, I think we've done that despite our age.

217
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:49,460
The, um, one thing I was thinking about when, when I saw this comment for the

218
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:54,700
first time, you know, a couple of podcasts ago, we were talking about how

219
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,260
back in the day Microsoft used to lead the way on testing.

220
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:09,840
But, um, and then you and I sort of started this conversation, uh,

221
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:16,960
earlier than the podcast, but like four years ago now where, uh,

222
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:22,530
we realized that Microsoft wasn't doing what the rest of the world is doing.

223
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:30,370
But now we've kind of, it kind of occurred to me is, is, is Microsoft again leading

224
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,090
the way in how, in some regards of how tests should be done.

225
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:46,400
Cause I see the, uh, perzy, um, uh, the comment that we got today, uh, other comments I've received

226
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,280
Chris, yes.

227
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,480
Other comments I've received from other folks.

228
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,360
Right.

229
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,000
They're really seeing us kind of showing the way.

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,640
Yeah.

231
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,760
But just like, uh, in the preface to this, there's this big book I wrote that called

232
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,680
how we test software at Microsoft.

233
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,160
And even in that book, which is horribly at a date, uh, as the three know, uh, in the

234
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,720
preface, like there's no way for me to capture, you know, with at the time you believe it

235
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,720
nearly 10,000 testers, Microsoft, you know, what they did as a whole.

236
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I tried to gather some of the things that were common.

237
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,320
Um, but even there to say that Microsoft is leading the way, I think in some places,

238
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,280
some parts of Microsoft, there is some, uh, leadership and how software engineering

239
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,000
is done quickly and at scale, but there are also as you and I know, without calling

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,520
out any names, some really poor examples of how to do that as well.

241
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:42,640
Yeah.

242
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,520
No, even as the words escape my mouth, I was like leading the way to bring

243
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,160
Brent down from cloud nine skip right past eight, seven, six, five, four, maybe

244
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,520
cloud two, we'll start there.

245
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:02,370
So I'll say, you know, I'm, I'm extremely grateful in some regards that, that the

246
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:09,570
the stuff we babble about, uh, approximately every two weeks is, is adding value to

247
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,370
somebody's life.

248
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,610
Going back to the therapy, just talking through these things, uh, that we're

249
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:18,690
going through in our daily work helps me refocus on a lot of them.

250
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,490
So it does it, I get benefit out of it as well.

251
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:25,010
There's a reason I get up early twice a month, although we had a little break.

252
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,010
Brent Brent skipped out on our last podcast.

253
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,470
I just moved it one week.

254
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,950
A digit.

255
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,430
All right.

256
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,590
Yeah.

257
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:30,910
Nevermind.

258
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,550
It was last.

259
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,950
Yeah.

260
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,870
We're going to try and be back on a regular schedule now.

261
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,090
Yes.

262
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,930
I thank you outlook.

263
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,530
Not a not very often do people say thank you outlook.

264
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,090
Uh, no, no.

265
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,570
Before we go on, we have another topic around this, but I want to give a quick

266
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:50,050
plug.

267
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,090
I always like the plug.

268
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,690
I haven't given a talk at a conference or anywhere.

269
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,650
I guess in the fall I did Euro, Eurostar, the mobile deep dive after Eurostar.

270
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,730
Nothing since then and nothing for a while before them, but I am doing a flurry of appearances.

271
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,210
Are you?

272
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:06,530
I am.

273
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,290
A flurry.

274
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:08,850
A flurry.

275
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,660
A McFlurry.

276
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,060
Is that four or five?

277
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:13,380
Three.

278
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:13,780
Three.

279
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,380
Is a three a flurry?

280
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:15,940
What's three?

281
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,740
I don't know.

282
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,700
I thought that was few.

283
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,140
Okay.

284
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:19,860
But they're all close.

285
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,900
A flurry sounds cooler.

286
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,860
But they're close together.

287
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,680
Does that count?

288
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,320
Sure.

289
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,960
What is that called?

290
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,520
A storm?

291
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,840
Maybe we shouldn't worry about it.

292
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:35,920
So on May 11th for our local three, I will be at QA SIG, which is at Cordez offices in Seattle.

293
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:42,700
And I, this is, I was worried they wouldn't want to do this talk,

294
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,020
but Jamie Campbell, a former Microsoft, he gave a talk there about combined engineering

295
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,820
in maybe a year ago, but it was in a way, it was a different version than

296
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,980
the unified engineering of my team.

297
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,540
We did talk about it about a year ago when after that talk.

298
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,110
So given my experience, it's always easier for me to give a talk if I can just,

299
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,910
I can tell how easy, how much fun and really how good my talk is going to be

300
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,830
by how quickly I can run an abstract for it.

301
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,130
Okay.

302
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,290
So I quickly wrote an abstract and I said, Hey, I know Jamie gave a similar talk.

303
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,540
If this, if this is too much overlap, let me know.

304
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,260
I'll do something else.

305
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,340
But this is kind of what's top of mind for me.

306
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,940
And what is the audience here?

307
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,900
This is, it's mostly tester people.

308
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,980
It's the three people like the three.

309
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,470
Is it sort of an open space?

310
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,310
It's an open meeting.

311
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:35,950
Anyone can go.

312
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,350
Yeah.

313
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:36,510
Yeah.

314
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,150
Open space meeting.

315
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:37,790
Anyone can go.

316
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:43,650
And what did I call the talk?

317
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,890
I called it testing without testers.

318
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,500
And I won't read the abstract here.

319
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
You can go to qasig.org and check it out yourself because I didn't bring it up

320
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,900
ahead of time.

321
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,060
I don't want to search around on my computer while we're talking,

322
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,860
but that's on Wednesday, May 11th in the evening.

323
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,860
I'll talk and lobby about what's how I've done things here on my team.

324
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,980
And a lot of Q and a interactive as my talks usually are.

325
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,500
Is it re it's going to be recorded?

326
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,980
It'll be, I think they stream not only record,

327
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,260
they stream live.

328
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,100
So check that out.

329
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,420
Yo.

330
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,460
And then a few weeks later, I can't remember the exact dates.

331
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,300
I am giving a talk to a, where the audience is a special interest group in Waterloo, Canada.

332
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm brushing up on my Canadian.

333
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,480
I'm going to see how well I can do.

334
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm going to give the talk entirely in English Canadian.

335
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,720
And that one, I think it's going to be a similar topic,

336
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,880
but I'm going to do it.

337
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,080
It'll be a little bit more broad.

338
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,520
It'd be a combination between the talk I'm giving QA SIG and the keynote.

339
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,200
I gave it star Canada last year about how Microsoft now tests software,

340
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,400
making fun of my book and talking about some of the more sweeping

341
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,920
general changes of Microsoft versus just my experiences.

342
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,400
And then I come home for a few weeks.

343
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,280
And then I'm off to Las Vegas, Nevada.

344
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,640
You heard of it?

345
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,520
I guess they have like restaurants and these gambling places there.

346
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
And they also have a conference called Better Software,

347
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,240
where I'm giving a, you know, this a three and a half hour workshop on.

348
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,440
Do you know what it's on?

349
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,920
Testing.

350
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,360
What kind of testing?

351
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,460
Exploratory.

352
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,060
Oh, no, Brent.

353
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,220
The three will be automation.

354
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,420
How about AB testing?

355
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,680
Is it?

356
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,440
It's on experimentation.

357
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,480
And then I'm home for the summer after that with nothing else planned.

358
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,760
But really, it's a large expansion of talk I gave there last year,

359
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,640
sort of at the last minute.

360
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,520
So it should be a lot of fun.

361
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,970
I'm so glad you played right into that.

362
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,330
That was it.

363
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,370
It's so much amuses me on so many fronts.

364
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,770
Whenever you bring up, you're doing talks on the AB testing.

365
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,420
I'm sure you do it just fine.

366
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,700
It just I'm like, okay, why not?

367
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,870
Go, Alan.

368
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,150
You did a great job last time.

369
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,390
Yeah, thanks, Brent.

370
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:11,890
All right.

371
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,050
So shall we start the show?

372
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,270
Longest.

373
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,270
No, not the longest.

374
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,390
Not the longest.

375
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,430
This is how we roll.

376
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,930
Actually, we've gone through four of the items on the board.

377
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,530
Yeah.

378
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,930
One says one is episode 36.

379
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,050
One is two years.

380
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,130
I think we covered those at about the first 30 seconds.

381
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:46,610
So my product, which is hard and fun and interesting and for all sorts of different reasons,

382
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,570
we ship to our production server once a week.

383
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,550
You do that now.

384
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,190
We do that now.

385
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,150
We ship once a week.

386
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,030
Okay.

387
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,390
So you deploy once a week.

388
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,630
We deploy once a week, yeah.

389
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,230
But because I still think you're extremely locked down.

390
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,600
Can anyone go to it?

391
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,800
Can I go go to it now?

392
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,020
Different.

393
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,540
We deploy to our production server and there are about 200 users at Microsoft outside of our team

394
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,700
who can use our product for what our product is designed for.

395
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,700
You're not one of them.

396
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,980
No, I am not.

397
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,220
I offered for you to be one.

398
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,100
You said, I don't know.

399
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,540
I don't want to see it first.

400
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,780
So I'll show it to you after the podcast.

401
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,100
Okay.

402
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,540
And then I'll get fired.

403
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,060
But I'll show it to you.

404
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,540
Okay.

405
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,060
Anyway, we can get you on board.

406
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,030
If only you knew someone who was sort of in control of access.

407
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,430
I don't know what your product does yet.

408
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,790
Oh, it slices.

409
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,590
It dices.

410
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,390
It makes your, it's a floor wax and the dessert pudding.

411
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,790
Every product coming out of Microsoft today does slicing and dicing, it seems.

412
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,510
But ours seamlessly integrates into the enterprise world with more buzzwords that

413
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,870
I can't flip out of my face at 8 30 in the morning.

414
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,430
Right.

415
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,590
They all seamlessly integrate as well.

416
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,030
So I didn't I say that?

417
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,430
You did.

418
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,590
So we have for customer and business satisfaction.

419
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,020
Anyway, our product.

420
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,900
You forgot the line.

421
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,140
God, we can't, we cannot get to the point.

422
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,180
Like Brett and I are kidnapped.

423
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,500
They have guns to our head and they're saying, tell us, tell us where the diamonds are.

424
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,220
So, oh, did you know that diamonds are from carbon and.

425
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,540
And carbon.

426
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:40,140
Oh, oh, this is about a baseball diamond, but I was at, you know, it's like, oh my God.

427
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,300
So anyway, so one week you say every week, every week.

428
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,720
Uh, uh, and it's, it's going, it's going well.

429
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,430
But you know what, Brent, it's not enough.

430
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,820
We're going to ship more often.

431
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,880
So what I want to talk about the subject I want to go back and forth is, uh,

432
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:08,460
pros cons, pitfalls and benefits of, and I have a live list of these myself because

433
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:15,440
I've been preaching them to the team of going from shipping once a week to once a day, once

434
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,200
every weekday, let's say, and then maybe even more often after that.

435
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,400
So what are the things in, this could be a way too open ended of a question for a,

436
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,240
for a Brent question.

437
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:34,080
But as you've seen teams and your experiences as you've gone from shipping once a week to

438
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,000
once a day or any sort of acceleration like that, what are the big, uh, benefits

439
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,480
and the big challenges to doing that?

440
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,560
And I have a big list myself, but I'm going to let you start.

441
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,150
The biggest benefit, uh, bar none is the more often you ship,

442
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,580
the less risky shipping is.

443
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:10,340
So, so shipping more frequently dramatically boosts quality and reduces risk.

444
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,020
Well, there's with a whole slew of caveats, but yeah,

445
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,540
devils in the details there, right?

446
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,580
And that's exactly it.

447
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,380
There's a, there's almost a little yin yang thing of because we're shipping every day,

448
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,860
um, there's a chance that, I mean, there's, you don't get that bake time.

449
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,540
You get shipping once a week and maybe some little things begin to slip through.

450
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:38,210
But because you're shipping every day, those things are mitigated or fixed, uh, much quicker.

451
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:45,970
I think over, over, uh, I do believe that the benefits outweigh the scary parts that

452
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,450
come with that.

453
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,090
I think there's a cultural and people thing of getting over the fact that, uh,

454
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,770
there may be some minor and I'm going to call them bugs because they might not even impact

455
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,410
the user.

456
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,170
There may be some minor things that aren't caught because that's that big time.

457
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:10,240
And for example, maybe there's a, um, uh, in one build, you introduce, uh, something that

458
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,680
causes this API to fail.

459
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,600
Um, but it's not noticeable and you're blind.

460
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
You don't have the right monitoring in place.

461
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,520
So you miss it until you start getting reports from a large, the larger deployment.

462
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
And then you go back and fix it the next day.

463
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,320
So it was a dip.

464
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,880
Yeah.

465
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,550
But, but what that forces you to do, uh, to me, shipping more frequently is all about what

466
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,590
we call the outer loop.

467
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:40,100
You know, the inner loop is like unit tests and deployment and, and, and, uh, test the,

468
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,140
the testing you do, the internal dogs, a little bit of bake time you get moving in

469
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,220
a one in whatever your release is.

470
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,900
But the outer loop is monitoring.

471
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,900
How quickly can you detect an error with monitoring and react to it and maybe even

472
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,860
deploy a hot fix?

473
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,780
How does that, so I'm breaking.

474
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,420
I was about to go on there and then Brent gave me a look.

475
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:06,260
So you're, you started this question primed with, I gotta be careful because it's a

476
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,820
Brink question and it occurs to me now that you're doing a great job pretending to be me.

477
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,300
I'm answering the question.

478
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,420
So this is again, this is the therapy part because this is what I've been telling

479
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,620
our team and, um, by Brent nodding his head, having gone through this more often than me,

480
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,260
the fact that that's now I want to hug you again, but not really.

481
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,900
It's so I'm, um, talk to me some more.

482
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:36,610
So let me put my Agilist hat on, right?

483
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,970
The, do you ever take it off?

484
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,260
Not very often.

485
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,060
How about in the shower?

486
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:42,800
No.

487
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,200
Okay.

488
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,920
All right, go on.

489
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,360
It's, it's water resistant.

490
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,250
There is a great book.

491
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,850
I may be forgetting his name, but Donald Reiner.

492
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,530
Is the author's name.

493
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,250
It's the title, I think is product development flow.

494
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,210
Oh, flow.

495
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:00,370
Yeah.

496
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,610
Hop in my bookshelf.

497
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:02,770
Yeah.

498
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,060
He, if you, if you want to understand Agil and there's only one book you're going to pick,

499
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,580
that's the book.

500
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,850
Uh, because he goes through, uh, lots and lots of white papers, lots and lots of science

501
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,010
and evaluates which model is better.

502
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,330
Okay.

503
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:29,570
And now what you're talking about going from one week to one day is sort of the discussion

504
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,450
of small batch versus large batch.

505
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:39,650
From a, from an Agil point of view that that's, that's how we refer to it in the vernacular.

506
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:48,340
Small batches, meaning you're constantly shipping small things is significantly better than

507
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,900
constantly shipping large things.

508
00:27:51,620 --> 00:28:01,330
Um, those of us in testing can, can recall, uh, so for example, the periods when there's

509
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,690
a massive stabilization period and there's a co-complete date, right?

510
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,690
Well, and I'll interject there.

511
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,490
There are teams.

512
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,970
I know that Microsoft who even within the last five years have had a coding milestone

513
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,200
where three to five months, I don't know how long, three months were spent where you

514
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,840
write code.

515
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,600
Uh, you don't stop, you don't get this is flow also.

516
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,680
Cause you don't want to get out of your flow and fix bugs

517
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,650
because you can use the six months stabilization period to fix your bugs.

518
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,290
You're right now.

519
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,130
And it's just a stupid process.

520
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:47,020
So the, um, so they spend two years writing up all of the bugs that they're going to

521
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:54,700
fix in the final six months without any sort of customer feedback as to which ones

522
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,220
are important, which ones aren't.

523
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:02,880
Um, so I, I think I've told the story on the podcast.

524
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,320
So when I went to Bing before I was a, um, I went to Bing primarily because I wanted

525
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,120
to learn service software.

526
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,480
I had not at any point in time shipped the service, uh, in my career.

527
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,960
So I wanted to add that little bullet to my resume.

528
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:27,730
And, uh, at that time, Bing was known as the, the most agile team.

529
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:28,930
Okay.

530
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,010
Um, so I went there.

531
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,170
Uh, I studied up on agile.

532
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:38,610
I was not yet a, uh, uh, a coach by any means, certainly not certified in any way.

533
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:47,460
Um, and read several books, uh, before joining and I hit the ground running and

534
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,380
we started a scrum model.

535
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,140
Now they had already been doing scrum.

536
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:59,280
Um, and we made a, we decided to do a scrum model and there was a pre-existing

537
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,360
asset, which I didn't like the design.

538
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,260
And we decided as a team to completely refactor the design.

539
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:13,570
We changed a major piece of every component and we did it in two weeks.

540
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:22,370
We were proud, but just like every team ever, um, we did a bunch of features and

541
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,770
then we were like, ah, integration will be easy.

542
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:32,880
And we ended up trying to integrate at that, the 11th hour before the sprint was done.

543
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:42,380
And that two week sprint cost us two months of unwinding because we had changed

544
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,340
everything.

545
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,220
And of course, none of it integrated.

546
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,510
Um, it was funny cause when, when I had, when I had taught my team the scrum

547
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:58,430
model, I said, we're going to start with this, but then we're going to shift to

548
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,390
the Kanban model.

549
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,970
You knew right off the bat, you're going to go on bond.

550
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,210
Yeah.

551
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:10,580
Uh, the, the, I can't tell you why I knew off the bat.

552
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,620
I just had forgotten, but if he had asked me back then, I would have told you.

553
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,100
Put a pin.

554
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,020
I want to come back to that in a minute, but go ahead and go out.

555
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:24,500
So the team after hearing, after going through this experience, like our,

556
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,220
it was our second sprint that we had ever done.

557
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,210
It took us four sprints to fix it.

558
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,040
And, uh, after that, my team essentially revolted.

559
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,910
They said, Hey, we want to go with the Kanban model now.

560
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:54,670
The, um, and the Kanban model is one of the things is, is you don't do these massive

561
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,390
integrations.

562
00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,850
You integrate one small work item at a time and then everyone spread out.

563
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:06,830
So when the, I had a team, a set, there's a subtlety there.

564
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,540
That's important though, because it's goes back to batch size a little bit or

565
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,420
a work item size.

566
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,820
I'm having technical difficulties.

567
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
I'll help you in a second while you're dropping.

568
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,500
I'll fix it for you in a second.

569
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,620
Stop playing.

570
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,340
Stop playing with the brand.

571
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,980
I figured out.

572
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,860
Stop playing revenue.

573
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,660
Oh, great.

574
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,110
Physics come to AB testing.

575
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:32,910
So the, uh, the size of the ticket on the Kanban cord on the Kanban board.

576
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,190
What's a Kanban cord?

577
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,310
That's interesting concept.

578
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,110
We'll come back to that.

579
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:42,350
One could be integrate into a ticket could be integrate.

580
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,430
No, I could wouldn't be a good one.

581
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,230
Or do you mean a column?

582
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,230
No, a ticket.

583
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:50,350
So it could be, you could, the point is you could have an item on there.

584
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,830
It's way too large and it would run in the same problem.

585
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,190
So part of the part of the board, part of what works is you need to have,

586
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,790
uh, items that are, uh, smaller.

587
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:00,670
Yes.

588
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,940
It took a long time to make that point.

589
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,420
I'm very sorry.

590
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:14,260
Uh, we even today, um, the, the policy that I, I did back when I started in Bing is what I've

591
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,220
kept doing.

592
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,500
I haven't changed that one.

593
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:22,660
Um, one of the things that most teams are aware of when they go into this and they're focused

594
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:29,580
on waste is how much time is wasting wasted rather on planning.

595
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:38,540
So the Kanban method, um, I kind of do and planning, I now kind of do a hybrid of multiple

596
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:38,940
models.

597
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:44,460
I think we talked about this a couple, three, four episodes ago, but the Kanban model

598
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:48,300
is essentially saying waste is or planning is a complete waste of time.

599
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,260
Um, I don't know if Kanban says that directly.

600
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,420
The Kanban method does the one by Dave Anderson.

601
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:02,820
So he, the, the framework called the Kanban method invented by David Anderson at

602
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,700
Microsoft.

603
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,500
Surprisingly, when I read that I was surprised.

604
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,220
I'm like, what?

605
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,940
This awesome thing was invented here.

606
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,510
Um, yeah, he invented it here and then left.

607
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:20,780
And then he actually deployed it, um, and, and made his success in an entirely

608
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,660
different company.

609
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:31,570
Anyway, um, basically says as long as the work, everyone agrees there's an 80% chance

610
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,490
that it takes two weeks or less.

611
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,710
Good planning done.

612
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:42,160
And that sort of lightweight model, uh, works.

613
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:43,040
It works very well.

614
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:50,720
The, what, um, because it'll get caught, uh, in, in the next phase, which is sort

615
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,240
of an analyze phase where you have to deconstruct it into the work and, um, we

616
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,840
don't let the ticket move on.

617
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:06,400
If that person or the, the, the people who review, if any of them believes, dude,

618
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,440
there's no way you're getting this done in two weeks or less, then it, then it

619
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,120
gets broken down into different tickets.

620
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,080
So what are your columns?

621
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,520
I actually want to dive into Kanban.

622
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,280
You're used to Kanban here a little bit.

623
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,160
What columns do you use?

624
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,120
Um, the columns I use are the first one is analyze.

625
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,400
Then it goes into engineer.

626
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,780
Then it goes into release, then customer validation, then done.

627
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,170
Okay.

628
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:35,650
Okay.

629
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,930
Um, so they come from the backlog into analyze these things.

630
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,730
Oh, and yeah, there's backlog then ready.

631
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,050
Sorry.

632
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,810
Ready is the very first one.

633
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,170
So these things could be analyzed.

634
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,470
They, they, they're loosely analyzed.

635
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:49,790
Okay.

636
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,710
So, but ready moves to analyze.

637
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,750
So let me go again.

638
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:58,670
Backlog ready, analyze, engineer, release, customer validation.

639
00:35:58,670 --> 00:35:58,990
Done.

640
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,460
So I follow the backlog.

641
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,370
Basically the backlog to ready is, is like a traditional product owner, a

642
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,490
scrum type process.

643
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:15,650
So my team can pick whatever they work.

644
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,050
They want to do in the ready column.

645
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,230
Okay.

646
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,630
Any, any ticket in the ready column is open to them.

647
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,310
Anyone can take whatever they want.

648
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,470
That is not pre-assigned.

649
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,300
But only I can put tickets into the ready column.

650
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,140
And the promise that, that I make, and when I put tickets into the ready

651
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:45,570
column is that these are the next set of things that from the best available

652
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,450
information I have, we'll add the most business factor.

653
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,010
Okay.

654
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,850
Do you use a physical board or?

655
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,250
I do.

656
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:58,290
So good, because I've been playing with digital boards for our team and I ended

657
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,690
up making a physical board first for some part of our work, not all of it yet,

658
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:06,690
just on the window behind my desk, because there's something about a

659
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:10,050
physical board and I want to move it later, but so this is just temporary.

660
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,450
But I can explain it because I've had this question because I actually, um,

661
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,810
okay, I want you to explain it because reason is I think physical boards,

662
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:23,810
the action of move physically moving a ticket for one column to the other.

663
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,730
And me and having, when you go to is one thing.

664
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,370
So one, the physical action, I think is, uh, it going back to damp pink.

665
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:34,610
I think it shows you get progress from that.

666
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:34,850
Yep.

667
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:35,810
More than digital board.

668
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,450
But even moreover, I think the digital boards, because they,

669
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,130
they can be open or not on your computer and everybody has a different view of them.

670
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,890
One of the principles of Kanban is visualize your work.

671
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:53,330
And I think having that board in a place that your team can all see multiple times a day and know what

672
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:59,330
people are working on. And just, I think that physical board for me is, uh, a better way of

673
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,490
doing that than the digital board. But I'm curious to hear your answers as well.

674
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:10,050
I will tell you that I have figured out what is the ideal board.

675
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:16,660
Um, but I haven't yet figured out a way to build it.

676
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,100
That's cheap.

677
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:26,220
The ideal board would be a digital board, but on one of these gigantic touch,

678
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:32,880
touchscreen monitors in a place of a physical board where, where people

679
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,080
have the tactile experience where they move their tickets to done.

680
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:45,970
The reason why a physical board is more powerful is because of the social influence.

681
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:52,290
The fact that you have a physical board requires you to have a regular standup where everyone gets

682
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:56,610
together. Um, forces transparency, forces, knowledge sharing.

683
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,650
Yeah. It to me, the transparency is key there for it.

684
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:02,610
It encourages, obviously forces, but it encourages accountability.

685
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,780
I know in people are built, it not only is accountability, but it also

686
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,100
allows people to have recognition. So there's the negative thing like,

687
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:22,800
Hey, Alan, I see you have five tickets. All of them are over SLA, which in my vernacular means,

688
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,280
um, you've gone beyond the two week limit. Right. So that's, there would be two crimes

689
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,320
in there. You're multitasking and, um, everything's over SLA.

690
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,040
So, um, I'll interrupt for a second. So when I think of Kanban, I think of two main principles.

691
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:44,720
Uh, one we've talked about before, visualize your work. Other one is limit your work in progress.

692
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,320
As a manager, how come you let me have five open tickets at once?

693
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,570
Uh, what's your deal?

694
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,370
That's actually the thing that's also cool about Kanban is it does support autonomy.

695
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:06,030
So if, if you have five tickets in flight, um, you made that call.

696
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:07,790
Boy, I was stupid, huh?

697
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:17,870
I will as if I'm the, if I'm the, the, what we call the Agile coach, which kind of takes on the role

698
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:25,570
of like a scrum master, but it's Kanban not scrum. Um, if I'm in the scrum master role and I see you

699
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:30,140
doing that, whether or not you're my employee, I will give you crap about it.

700
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:37,340
Alan, you, all of these tickets are now over. It's because you're multitasking.

701
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:45,580
I want you to pick three of these tickets and hand them off right now. It will like right during

702
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,060
standup. But, but Brett, they're, they're almost done. They're, they've, they've been 90% done for

703
00:40:50,060 --> 00:41:01,380
a couple of weeks each. Great. Yeah. Then that handoff should be easy. The God, where was I going?

704
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:08,340
I don't know. Oh, so the, the, the ready column. So you said visualize your work,

705
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:16,370
um, limit whip, limit work in progress. Right. And the other one that, that is just super critical

706
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:24,460
is pull. Don't push. Um, you're looking at me puzzle. No, no, no, I get it. Um, the,

707
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:32,860
so the, the ready column itself will have a whip. Um, cause some, some teams, when they

708
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:37,180
first roll this out, they just make their backlog and the ready column the same thing.

709
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:44,420
And I go like, no, no, no, no, no. I'm going to put, I'm going to force a limit on me as to

710
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:51,300
how many most important things there can be. Right. Right. So putting a whip on the ready column forces

711
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:57,890
people to say, I don't know if you've ever heard of this speech, but I back in the old days,

712
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:04,980
the first decade we were here, I heard it all the fricking time, the tyranny of, or yeah. Yeah.

713
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:15,550
Which is essentially in an, in an enablement argument to say, Hey, multitask and don't incur any cost.

714
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:24,290
And it's kind of like saying gravity work the other way. Like multitasking, uh, the, the mythical man

715
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:32,530
month, um, there's all kinds of proof on this that multitasking slows you down. It, it isn't,

716
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:40,820
free. You can humans cannot context switch freely. Anyway, where do you want to go next with this? I've,

717
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:47,540
Oh, oh, we have now officially gone from tangent to tangent to tangent. And now I'm lost.

718
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:52,660
It's AV inception. So we were talking once upon a time about shipping more often. And,

719
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,580
Oh yes, I'm a big fan. I'll just kind of steer us back here. Um,

720
00:42:57,330 --> 00:43:01,970
I like this conversation, but I'm a fan of Kanban as well. And I also limit our,

721
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:07,650
on our digital version, uh, my small little teams, um, ready calm. What do I call it? Um,

722
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,370
I call it something else. I can't remember, but it's ready.

723
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,850
And then what I would do, actually, when you go from one week to one day, the one thing that,

724
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:22,420
after to in, in a feeble attempt to try to add some value to the 15 minutes of babble,

725
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,620
I just did. Um, it does occur to me that when you go from one week to one day,

726
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:37,380
what you, you want to decouple each developer's cadence from the ship vehicle. In other words,

727
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:46,260
Hey, whatever is checked into this branch goes live daily. If you, if, if your stuff is not ready,

728
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,620
do not push the master. Okay. And so our, our, uh, branching structure is a little different from

729
00:43:51,700 --> 00:44:00,180
that, but we, um, uh, we will still pull from our development branch to a, uh, pre-production

730
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:06,820
branch daily. And then later in that day, um, that branch, once we've done just a little bit of,

731
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:13,860
of validation, uh, user experience, evaluation, et cetera, that will go to, uh, production.

732
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,100
So there's a couple of things that we talked about the outer loop and getting monitoring in place.

733
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:26,770
Um, uh, that is often the best way to make you do something is to force it to need to happen.

734
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:31,730
We, I'll be open. We don't have the outer loop. We need to be able to do this. So there's going

735
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:36,610
to be a pain point as we do this. It goes, Oh, wait, we're blind here. We need to make

736
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:42,050
sure we have the monitoring here. So I'm willing, I'm willing to take that risk to force what I

737
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:47,090
think that important monitoring, which good monitors are to me equivalent to good tests,

738
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:55,790
um, to force those to happen. So one of the things, um, God, how many years are you going to tangent?

739
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:03,060
Cause I had more to do here. No. Okay. So my variant of, of Kanban, right? I listed off the

740
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,960
columns that I used in, in that variant. This is a re tangent. No. Okay. Okay. I'll be quiet.

741
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:17,760
If you remember, I, my columns, we released, then it went to customer validation, then it went

742
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:28,820
to done. Um, what that customer validation does to a team is you can't call your ticket done until

743
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:37,460
you've proven by whatever means you have available that the customer is now getting the value

744
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:44,720
intended out of the, out of your ticket. Right. So in this particular case, if you go to daily,

745
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:52,400
so let's say I work on, on your team, um, we're shipping daily. I just finished what I believe

746
00:45:52,400 --> 00:46:00,500
is my feature. I released it. It is now in the wild. I can't move that ticket to done. I can't

747
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:09,300
work on the next feature or bug or whatever, and tell I have proven to you, um, the guy taking the

748
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:17,360
role of the product owner that is doing what we believed it's doing, which means I have to have

749
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:23,600
telemetry or I have to have a customer to go interview, which is the two most common ways of

750
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:30,560
doing customer validation. Um, there is a team at Microsoft, the SQL server reporting services team,

751
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:38,640
which I used to work on. So I, I taught them this stuff. Um, they're about to ship and I am,

752
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:47,780
my team is one of their customers now and I'm finding, uh, bugs or, or feature requests. And now

753
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:53,220
they're, they're giving me what we call a CV customer validation, a CV request all the time.

754
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,020
Hey, Brent, can you CV this? Here's our bill, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

755
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:05,010
So it's fantastic. It gives me the opportunity as a customer to say, no, that is not what I want.

756
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:11,680
Right. And, uh, leads into experimentation a little bit. Cause one of the things we do when

757
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,600
someone has a new feature, we have a very simple mechanism, what we call feature flag, put the

758
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,720
feature behind a flag, meaning has to be turned on explicitly. Um, and we can do that for a

759
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:27,200
subset of users and, or, or for all users, when, when it gives us a way to, uh, not like here's

760
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,080
a brand new feature that may be disruptive, turning it on for everyone at once may not be the best

761
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:39,680
idea. A B testing and exposure rings and flight control and all of that is really critical when,

762
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:47,020
when you are really live and you have more than 200 users. Great. Because it,

763
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:53,660
you can't interview them all. Right. You need telemetry and data and those assets in order

764
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:58,060
to scale. Right. I think that's the big shift. Like right now we can get away with a team like

765
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:05,100
mine shipping once a week can get away with bug reports and, um, you know, uh, little mini

766
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,940
stabilization. I called it bake time. It's really just stabilization. We can get away with that

767
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,700
shipping once a week, shipping daily or more often, or even twice a week, uh, that outer loop,

768
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:22,620
that monitoring, that, uh, being able to react to monitoring and alerts are just, it's critical.

769
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:27,900
Waiting for test results is, uh, not the way to do this. The one culture shift that you

770
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:36,370
might encounter when you, when you go into this one is, um, what we call swarms. Okay. So

771
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:44,300
once you're shifting to prod daily, you have to sort of create an entrenched

772
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:52,580
life site first mentality. Absolutely. Like life site cannot be down. This is a service.

773
00:48:52,580 --> 00:49:00,900
It can't be down. And any bug discovered in production has to be resolved within the,

774
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,980
my team is within the next 48 hours. Oh yeah. I would say less than that,

775
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:11,460
but depending on the severity of it, if you have the, it's a reasonable SLA

776
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,700
is directly related to how quickly you can react. If you have the automation, the tooling in place

777
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:25,460
to do it. Um, you also need to have the ability to, if you look at the bug and you go, Oh crap,

778
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:32,020
this is on the floor. I can't get this fixed in 20 and 48 hours or whatever your SLA is.

779
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:40,340
Then you must have the ability to do a 15 minute revert. It just, it's, you can't have life site

780
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:46,880
down. Right. And then once you have something like that in place, the magic really starts

781
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:53,340
to happen in terms of getting your devs aboard on the culture because devs don't like being interrupted.

782
00:49:53,340 --> 00:50:00,220
And if you have the principle of life site first, then them, they deploying crap to production

783
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:11,550
creates this loop where they created the, the, this, what we called swarm tickets.

784
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:17,390
Swarms are essentially bug tickets, but on my board swarms are the only thing that actually

785
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:23,630
cause interrupts because life site first and Hey, Alan, if you don't want to be interrupted,

786
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:29,550
quit shipping shit. And they learned that on their own very quickly that they're in control

787
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:35,260
of their own destiny on that one. I agree. Yeah. That's a good plan. Do you want to do the last one?

788
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:42,850
Sure. Okay. So I gave, um, we're in, uh, lovely Lincoln square Bell view and I gave, uh, Brent,

789
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:49,460
uh, not even a tour. I showed him where I sit, but, uh, I have a kind of, uh, cool little space

790
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:57,220
where there's, uh, four of us work together, uh, on the areas I work on and we have a nice little

791
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:03,090
open space. Um, open space is a big topic at Microsoft and in the industry, as far as,

792
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:08,930
you know, how teams are organized and sit, uh, there are excellent ways to do it. There are good

793
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,890
ways to do it. And there are horrible ways to do it. And Microsoft who because it was such a big

794
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:22,910
company had done all of them. It's great. Yes. Mostly we found all kinds of different ways to do

795
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:28,990
it really bad mostly because often people see open space. Oh, open space is better. Okay.

796
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:36,670
And then you end up with a, I'm not going to name any teams. I know one building, which is basically,

797
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:42,750
I call it a barn. Yep. It's huge. Like, it's like Rose, it was like study hall.

798
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:48,350
It's not really, it's a barn. It's not open. It's not open space is meant for collaboration

799
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:53,470
and working together and being able to have those quick conversations. So it's interesting, um,

800
00:51:54,530 --> 00:52:06,000
back. So the first team to do this at Microsoft was the Xbox org. And I happen to think so.

801
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,120
I happened to be in Xbox when it happened. Right. This was just before the commons were built.

802
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:17,330
And yeah, I know. I think there were teams doing it before then. The prevailing,

803
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:26,930
maybe the prevailing pattern that I noticed or noticed before then were, uh, uh, the shoe box

804
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:35,360
office, right? The, the office where you, you basically get a four by six office, um, with

805
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:44,000
a big heavy wooden door. Yes. So like the, the offices in my building in Bing were, were like this.

806
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,720
Oh yeah. You get this small little thing versus the old school, like, yeah, you got glass doors

807
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:54,000
there a little bit, a little more open, right? Call those the open office, but not open office.

808
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,890
Yeah. Um, what, when Xbox, uh, did this move, whether or not they were the first fair point,

809
00:53:02,610 --> 00:53:09,730
when Xbox did the move, the spaces were labeled as collaborative spaces. Okay. And over the last

810
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:16,370
10 years, it has been shifted to open space. Well, it's, it's been misinterpreted a bunch

811
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:21,250
of different ways. So, um, let me put it in perspective. When I have like an example here

812
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:28,290
and, uh, even when I was an E E we had a really nice team room. Uh, the idea is that we're all

813
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:33,230
working on the same thing. Uh, we have an area where we can work by ourselves and there were,

814
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:40,750
where we can work together. Uh, and those things I think are important, uh, where it's been screwed

815
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:46,210
up in translation. Uh, and I don't know about other kinds of, but I can talk about Microsoft is

816
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:52,860
one, the barn, but two I have, there's been a few buildings remodeled for open spaces recently.

817
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:59,980
And I have a, uh, colleague for example, works on a team in one of these buildings and it's,

818
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:05,740
it's a big, they have rooms that hold, and to me, the ideal team room size is, you know, less than,

819
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:12,530
less than 10. I like, like four to eight. It should be, uh, it should be able to fit

820
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:22,000
one whole team plus whoever the manager is that sort of scope. It should be a functional working

821
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,400
team. All right. So, and maybe it could be a little bigger. Um, but there's a lot of

822
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,640
these open space rooms built to fit 18 to 20, which I think is a little large. I think it's

823
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,080
too large for a team. Maybe if it's all the same team, it's all right. But the problem is,

824
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,560
is they don't have teams this size. So he's working on the, the six people that he works

825
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:45,440
with are all together plus some random PMs and if, and a few other people, they just kind of

826
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,520
shove people in and go, here's an open space, but they're not working on the same thing.

827
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,720
They're working on, they're just, they're two different or two, three, sometimes four

828
00:54:54,720 --> 00:55:00,560
different projects going on in one open space, which is, I think not cool.

829
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:10,750
It creates, um, it creates an environment that does the exact opposite.

830
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:15,310
And to me, it's critical because it's not just, I lost in translation. It's happened with,

831
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:19,790
you know, you know, agile has been bastardized in the same way, a million ways.

832
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:24,110
But if you look at the open space, I think it's a very powerful thing that really, really,

833
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:28,990
really works unless you totally screw it up by not paying attention to the parts that actually

834
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:34,110
work about it. They were actually, so when this first started, right, there was a study that came

835
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:43,970
out and I no longer remember who it came out around 2003 that showed like a back then valve

836
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:49,330
and how they delivered software was, was, um, and you can still on today,

837
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:52,210
go to the internet and find a copy of their employee.

838
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:53,570
Oh, the, the, the employee handbook. I love it.

839
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:01,730
That, Hey, you come in, you check out a desk, you move your desk to whoever you're working with

840
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:13,410
and you get stuff done. And that study showed essentially that these open spaces

841
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:21,410
improve productivity because they improve collaboration. Okay. And that, in my belief,

842
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:26,050
I don't know if it's true or not, but in my belief, that's what kick started this,

843
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:31,810
this Microsoft. I don't know if it's that, that that's not it either. It's, it's more of, oh,

844
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:36,050
open spaces are good. The college kids like open space. Let's see if we can not do any more.

845
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,450
That's what it is now, but it wasn't what it was then.

846
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,730
Yeah. I'm, I'm blown away by it.

847
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:54,480
In 2008, there was a study done by MIT that said, no, actually open spaces is not what creates

848
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:02,640
collaboration and productivity, but fungible spaces. The ability for me to go to a particular

849
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:09,620
neighborhood, change the wall structure. Such that. So imagine this, this one neighborhood

850
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:14,980
you're talking about with 30 people in it in five different teams. If I can change the wall

851
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:21,380
structure such that now it's just me and my team in here until we're done with this project,

852
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:27,310
and then we'll take the walls and we'll put them wherever these walls go. Yeah. Right. And MIT has

853
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:32,590
this famous two or three story building where they can reconfigure just about everything.

854
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:42,640
And it's the ability to have the environment shift actually boost collaboration and productivity.

855
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:50,960
The other thing I'll say, Agile helps a lot as well. The, the joke I would, I would tell people,

856
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,320
and it's not much of a joke because I've had it validated multiple times.

857
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:02,320
Most of these open spaces, what ends up happening is people go to it and they rebuild

858
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:12,460
their office world in the form of a $75 pair of headphones. They're like, I will

859
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:23,550
filter all of you people out. See noise canceling beauties. The, what I discovered in

860
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:30,020
my last move to open space and, and apparently my building, the one I'm in right now is slated

861
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:36,820
for conversion, the beginning of the conversion in the next couple of months. So I'll be in a

862
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:47,680
new building sometime soon. My team, when we moved in our, in our last adventure, we, we moved

863
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:54,160
from office world into open space, but I had been working with the same set of people for

864
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:01,810
a couple of years before we did. And I warned them all. I'm like, no, this is open space.

865
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:07,410
It's not collaborative space. It becomes collaborative space based on how we, we use

866
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:17,250
it. I preformed that. When we moved in, actually one of my employees who, who, who is no longer one

867
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:22,940
of my employees, but still one of your mentees came to me and he said, Brent, have you walked

868
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:29,580
around all of the other neighborhoods, which is what we call these open space environments?

869
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:36,460
And I said, yes, I have. What's your take? And he's like, in comparison to ours, they're like

870
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:43,390
graveyards. So you got a whole bunch of people and there's a practice where they actually create

871
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:50,320
rules around silence and turn it into like a library in the middle of a funeral.

872
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:57,280
Whereas my team, we had, we had been practicing agile. We had learned very quickly

873
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:05,120
the benefits of collaboration and knowledge sharing. So when my team moved into this

874
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:11,040
environment, we were still kept together and it was a freeing experience, not a trapping one.

875
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:17,280
So, and, and that's the key. I wanted, I'm looking at the clock, we have to wrap up here, but,

876
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,700
but moving to an open space doesn't make you agile, but an agile team.

877
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,540
Or collaborative. Or collaborative.

878
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:26,780
Matter of fact, doing it wrong will do the opposite.

879
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,860
But an agile or collaborative team can take advantage of that open space.

880
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,340
Right.

881
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:38,820
And that's, so yeah, stop doing it wrong. Do it right. That's my advice.

882
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,020
That's essentially.

883
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,380
It's like a pile of a sell high.

884
01:00:42,850 --> 01:00:47,410
That's, that's kind of the advice of our podcast every week.

885
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,570
Quit being stupid, do smart things instead.

886
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,310
Yeah. Yeah. That's a good, that's good advice. Thanks, Brent.

887
01:00:54,110 --> 01:00:54,750
That one's free.

888
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:56,590
You know what? They're all free.

889
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,270
Good, good point.

890
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:01,950
Except to take an hour of our time and an hour of our listeners times

891
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,230
that they can never ever get back.

892
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,580
That's why we have a continuous flow of threes.

893
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,560
We'll see how we do. Hey, I am still Alan.

894
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:16,080
And I am Brent.

895
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,840
And this was episode 36 and we'll see you soon for 37, right?

896
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,320
Yes.

897
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:20,880
All right.

898
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,040
As long as math still works the same way.

899
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,880
All right. Happy springtime, everybody.

900
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,240
Bye.
