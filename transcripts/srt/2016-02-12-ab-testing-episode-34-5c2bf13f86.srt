00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,480
Good morning, everybody. Hello, I'm Alan. I'm Brent.

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,480
Go back for episode 34 of A.V. Testing. Welcome.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,570
Good morning, Alan.

4
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,090
Thanks for coming out my way this time. Hey, good morning, Brent.

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:22,410
It's my pleasure to come out your way.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,130
I think loyal podcast listeners, each of the three know

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,290
that we generally record first thing in the morning

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,930
when people really shouldn't be awake and to make it more interesting

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,010
and for added benefits, et cetera.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,690
If you're going to read your laptop and not actually speak into the microphone,

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,540
I'll crush you.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,790
I'm getting over a cold, so I may be distracted even more easily than before.

13
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,990
But yeah, so how you been, Brent?

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,190
I'm just fine. Shall we begin?

15
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:03,670
People will be so disappointed if we just begin.

16
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,390
All right. So I threw out a couple of questions

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,750
to internal alias and things that I had observed over the few weeks.

18
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,230
And you said you wanted to discuss him here.

19
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,150
And frankly, that's why I threw him out there anyway, because I was hoping

20
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,940
we could talk about them.

21
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,540
So the first one is and I've

22
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,260
I've actually blogged about a different flavor of this many, many, many years ago.

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,500
And I really was just referring to

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,060
article that Eric Sink wrote even longer ago

25
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,620
where he talks about two types of people in the world.

26
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,620
Those who know that software ships with known bugs

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,580
and those who can't believe it.

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,580
I think anybody listening to this podcast realizes that, oh, yeah,

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,260
software ships with known bugs.

30
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,540
But this is a variation of that.

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,380
I mean, if you were to talk to someone off the street and say, you know,

32
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,820
it's just say, hey, that'd be a stupid question to ask them when someone off

33
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,140
the street is like, hey, do you know that software ships with bugs?

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,540
Of course it does.

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,820
And anybody that ships software knows we make choices.

36
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,900
But there's a flavor of this that I have seen.

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,940
Can I ask a question? No.

38
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,260
OK, OK, go ahead. Yeah, actually, you can.

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,700
Did this this Eric fellow, did he state this

40
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,390
in which decade recent or I believe it was the 90s.

41
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,860
OK, so anyway, back then, I think I and a whole bunch

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,380
of testers would have been indignant with the idea that we ship bugs.

43
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,150
We all knew we did.

44
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,530
Yeah. But there's a flavor of this.

45
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,770
I've seen actually from testers in the industry, as well as from some teammates.

46
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,170
I'm going to kind of see if I can weave that story together

47
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,890
with some examples, maybe, that are totally almost made up

48
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,370
or at least paraphrased because I can't remember them.

49
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,850
Hey, folks, software ships with bugs,

50
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,970
especially today when the idea is

51
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,650
if there's a bug and someone finds it, you fix it immediately.

52
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,130
And if there's a bug that is never discovered by anybody,

53
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,180
it's not really a bug if and you can.

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,980
It's a software error defect, whatever you want to call it.

55
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,620
But it doesn't affect the usability or the experience of the user at all.

56
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,540
If it's never discovered, I would state, though,

57
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,100
because I think one way to interpret what you say is

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,380
this is something new today.

59
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,180
And I would argue that's always been true.

60
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,420
No, I agree. It's always been true.

61
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,480
All right. So I'm not. Yeah.

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,420
So for example, I remember a couple of years ago,

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,840
I can't remember who some tester was

64
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
astounded that I can't remember if it was

65
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,560
WhatsApp or Skype or one of those messaging apps

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,480
when they put in over 32000 characters into their field

67
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,860
that the extra characters were not sent.

68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,400
Oh, and you know what? That's a bug.

69
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,000
But they were screaming about data loss and which technically it is

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,120
struck my shoulders and shake my head a little bit.

71
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,020
It's funny that the learning from that, I just I knew it was wrong.

72
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,540
I didn't know what to do about it.

73
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,060
And then let's ignore it.

74
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,660
Let's fast forward to today on my team.

75
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:33,100
So we have a team of no testers unless you count me. I don't.

76
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,300
All right.

77
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,620
So we have these pretty senior PMs and devs who they see a bug

78
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,450
and they freak.

79
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,730
Even the devs.

80
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,010
Sometimes even the devs.

81
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,290
Oh, tell me a story about that.

82
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,690
That would be great.

83
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,610
A dev manager.

84
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,890
We're trying to decide if the team if build is

85
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,170
we did a big product reset and we just want to get the team dog

86
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,050
fooding our product and using our product for communication every day.

87
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,370
And I said, we got to go.

88
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,130
This one's this one's good enough.

89
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,570
It's a little rough around the edges, but we've got to tell the team to start.

90
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,130
We can start.

91
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,730
And he does like two or three things and

92
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,770
one of them doesn't quite work and he goes, no, it's totally broken.

93
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,200
We can't do this.

94
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,920
And we stop and talk through it.

95
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,160
And and we look at the context

96
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,800
and the nature of the bugs, the bug.

97
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,960
There are all bugs, as you know, are not created equal.

98
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,320
There are thousands, if not millions of different intricacies and context

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,680
and things that go into the bug.

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,640
How often does it occur?

101
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,120
Is there a reasonable workaround?

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,240
The list goes on and on and on.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,880
And what I've realized, what being in software and especially

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,240
on the testing side for over 20 years is done for me is I can very quickly

105
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,760
contextualize any bug.

106
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,620
What's contextualized?

107
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,060
It's a word I just made up for this.

108
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,580
Meaning when I see an error

109
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,820
or something go wrong, I immediately start looking at how often would it happen?

110
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,340
What's the impact?

111
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,300
If this is as bad as they're saying, how come no one else seen it before?

112
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,860
Let's look a little bit deeper and figure out what else is going on here.

113
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,220
So you evaluate the the risk and the benefit of fixing the bug.

114
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,780
I think the risk of not fixing or not fixing now versus fixing

115
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,340
later today or tomorrow.

116
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,600
Right. Or making a decision based on the nature of the bug.

117
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:40,040
So what I've noticed is I see just there's the from these cohorts

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,240
who are haven't quite mastered this fact.

119
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,750
They see the error, the bug, they have a moment of panic.

120
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,800
And when they declare that the whole thing is FUBAR and I stop.

121
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,480
And sometimes I know they're getting better at it.

122
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,200
I just stop it and I'll just go, what do you think, Alan?

123
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,830
And I don't say anything.

124
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:06,900
And they go, let me look at this again, look at it again.

125
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,100
OK, so it really it's kind of if you look at it in a way by design

126
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,300
and it's it's probably wrong.

127
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,980
We should look at it and there immediately as we have a

128
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,340
a moment together about it, they can take a moment to realize

129
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,300
that it's not that big of an issue or maybe in some cases it is that big of an issue.

130
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,460
They may see something that the opposite can happen occasionally.

131
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,940
They go, well, that just happens.

132
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,510
Hold on a second.

133
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,590
This is Alan Page, software psychologist.

134
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,710
That the I was going to go for the bug whisperer.

135
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:48,830
But it's an interesting almost human behavior observation exercise.

136
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:54,150
Fun to watch how people react to bugs in software.

137
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,070
Why do you think you were reacting that way?

138
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:03,190
Oh, very good, because there's always motivation behind the way people act.

139
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,870
One, I think there's a new responsibility

140
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,230
they haven't had before to actually care about these bugs and to make decisions

141
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:16,270
based on them, so they're maybe taking it a little bit too.

142
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,630
I want to say too seriously, but there's a lot of pressure

143
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,830
to make sure they make right decisions based on quality.

144
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,310
People are trying to understand that they own quality and this stuff's important.

145
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,750
So that stuff drives it.

146
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,190
They don't want to make the wrong decision, but in some cases,

147
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:37,070
they're so worried about making the wrong decision that they get paralyzed.

148
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,990
In fact, one of them said to me, one of my colleagues said the other day,

149
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,870
it's the worst thing we can do is to is to ask the team to dog food

150
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,710
this product too early.

151
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,830
And I said, no, the worst thing we can do is actually sit on this

152
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,190
and never ever have anybody look at it besides us.

153
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:02,510
Yeah, so so it's it's context and it's weird because I'm the test.

154
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,950
I'm supposed to be the guy.

155
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,470
I'm you know, traditionally the tester is the you know,

156
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,710
I don't want to be the gatekeeper.

157
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,790
I don't want to be that guy.

158
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,510
We know what happens.

159
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,710
You see my slide on what happens when you're the guy

160
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,810
at the end of the product cycle.

161
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,290
We actually podcast this early on.

162
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:28,260
And so one of your prior adventures in your career,

163
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:35,440
you I recall you went and interviewed your manager's peers.

164
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,310
Pretty sure this is when you were starting in your very last team.

165
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:46,190
And one of the guys said the goal of QA is to sign off and that upset you greatly.

166
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,510
Oh, that was an Xbox.

167
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:53,640
Yeah, we had no longer employed director of development for Xbox.

168
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
He was talking about roles.

169
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,920
And I explained to I thought testing and fit in back home.

170
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,680
And testing.

171
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah.

172
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,680
And he said, no, no.

173
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,400
The goal of test is to sign off.

174
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Yeah.

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,280
And the guy was a couple levels above me.

176
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,440
And I didn't want to burn any bridges.

177
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:15,200
But the thought you can imagine the thoughts going through my head

178
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,600
of what I wanted to say.

179
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,960
The thoughts going through my head is imagine the payroll money

180
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,080
that Microsoft saved.

181
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,610
Now, winding back to your last story, so far my favorite part of your story

182
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,740
is what you haven't mentioned, which is.

183
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,780
Is that I'm not wearing any pants right now?

184
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,140
No.

185
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,660
Something else.

186
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,660
I was working through a segue to bring that up.

187
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,100
All right, great.

188
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,140
I guess that will work.

189
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:50,980
No, is the infamous question that was always asked to test

190
00:10:50,980 --> 00:11:02,870
in this sort of situation, which is why wasn't this found before?

191
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,590
Did that not get brought up?

192
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,350
No.

193
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,670
It almost seems non sequitur in this case.

194
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,950
We have bugs.

195
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,110
And my team now, I don't know if I told you this.

196
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,080
That's fantastic, by the way.

197
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,010
My team, bless their little hearts after all my work,

198
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,850
we talked about this.

199
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,790
We now fix bugs as we go.

200
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,950
So you're down to zero bugs?

201
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:37,390
We still have some previous debt that is being actively beaten down.

202
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,190
But the goal is to hover at zero.

203
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:42,550
So your rallying cry is working.

204
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,310
I don't know how, but yeah.

205
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,860
I think it's the threat of shipping.

206
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,540
Well done.

207
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,780
You deserve a self pat on the back.

208
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,370
Golf clap.

209
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,210
All right.

210
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,690
All right, so I forgot where we were.

211
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,210
Anyway, interesting observation.

212
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,810
Wanted to bring it up.

213
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,210
I'm still not clear on.

214
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,610
So I'm guessing it's somewhere in FUD.

215
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,870
But do you think it's something new that's causing the panic,

216
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,030
or do you think it's just sort of tradition?

217
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:16,630
So no, a little bit of tradition.

218
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,790
But I think more, we have a product and probably

219
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,110
some context.

220
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,310
So you're going to made up that work contextualized earlier

221
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,790
around bugs.

222
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,910
Context would be good.

223
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,790
So we have, I mentioned our product a little bit of a reset.

224
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,130
We're not officially announced.

225
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,950
I won't talk about what it is and what those deals are.

226
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,470
But we changed our back end infrastructure.

227
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,710
So we're slowly getting our site that we had running pretty

228
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,350
well back in November, up and running.

229
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,950
It's actually running very well.

230
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,150
But we have a pretty aggressive ship schedule

231
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,140
to start bringing some other teams on later this month,

232
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,340
to bring on some external teams and larger parts of Microsoft

233
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,020
through the rest of the spring, and then

234
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,900
to have public preview, mass availability in June.

235
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:09,060
So it's a very aggressive ship schedule, which on one hand,

236
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,620
the art of shipping is so fun.

237
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,940
And in my role, I play part tester, part shipper,

238
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,060
which are two weirdly opposite hats

239
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,180
to wear in the traditional world.

240
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,140
So I put on this one hat that says,

241
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,260
we've got to fix this stuff before we can go forward.

242
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,540
But we have enough people already paranoid about that.

243
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,940
So more often than not, I have to wear the ship hat, which

244
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,460
says, let's get crap out there so we can get some feedback

245
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:31,960
on it.

246
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,540
Let's go fast.

247
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:37,740
As fast as we can, let's be aggressive about getting out

248
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,260
to more people and making sure we have the tools in place

249
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,620
to learn from their experiences.

250
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,260
Because if we don't do that, we're

251
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,380
not going to make the rest of our goals.

252
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,100
I've noticed a similar phenomenon myself.

253
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,700
As I went through the transition,

254
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:06,220
detestifying the way I looked at problems.

255
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:11,180
And I have now found that it's very common for me

256
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,940
to take the opposite view I did 15 years ago.

257
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,140
No, you can't ship that.

258
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,380
I don't want even customers even coming

259
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,180
into the room that's dark and with the software running.

260
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,620
But now I'm just like, no.

261
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,700
Getting customers inside.

262
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,020
You and I have advanced down that path a little bit.

263
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,140
And a lot of our peers haven't.

264
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,180
So I think you saw where my story was going,

265
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,060
but I'll finish it for the three,

266
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,780
is that there's a lot of paranoia over,

267
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,620
we can't go to these people if there are errors in our product.

268
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm thinking, go to the people.

269
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,580
They'll tell you what the errors are.

270
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,620
We'll fix them because we're set up to do that.

271
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,100
And then we need to get the other feedback.

272
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,060
The only time that I am right now,

273
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,550
the only time I'm in agreement with, let's say,

274
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,110
your peers' point of view, is when

275
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:05,350
we don't have the process and infrastructure in place

276
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,510
to quickly react.

277
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,870
If we're going to ship a bug and it is super painful,

278
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,790
and we don't know, let's say we don't know the bug.

279
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,830
This is where I'd become.

280
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:17,830
Oh, yeah.

281
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,190
We don't know if we're about to ship something.

282
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,070
If we don't have the ability to turn something around

283
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,070
within a week, then I'm concerned.

284
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,070
No, that makes sense.

285
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,670
And also, if you have any sort of, we don't know why.

286
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,860
But every once in a while, the whole site goes down.

287
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,820
We're not sure why.

288
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,940
I think you want understood issues.

289
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,060
You still want to keep a tight ship.

290
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,900
I don't think you can do, if we still

291
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:49,770
had hundreds of known issues, it's a little more difficult

292
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:53,460
to say, OK, here you 1,000 people go use this,

293
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,380
because you know there's 100 issues

294
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,740
and so they're going to run into.

295
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,100
And I'd rather have them have a small number of issues

296
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,820
or some issues that we didn't know about.

297
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,660
Anyway, horse is dead and beaten.

298
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,680
Speaking of traditions and things.

299
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,560
There was this product that Microsoft bought called Yammer

300
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,360
that is actually occasionally used to Microsoft.

301
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,120
You've heard of it, Brent?

302
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,600
I have.

303
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,120
I use it.

304
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,640
Did your team still use Yammer for reports and things?

305
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,480
I've changed teams.

306
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,280
So Mike, I did bring it into my team.

307
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,680
And I'm pretty sure my last team has abandoned usage.

308
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,400
Yeah, as far as I can tell, and this is,

309
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,960
I don't spend a lot of time on Yammer,

310
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,920
but the primary usage scenario of Yammer by Microsoft

311
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,070
employees is to complain about stuff.

312
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,230
So my current use of Yammer, we've

313
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:54,830
pulled together a branding site for the output of my team.

314
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,350
And when you go to this site, the very first page

315
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:03,120
launches into an embedded Yammer page.

316
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
So the first thing people see is the communication

317
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,240
we have up on Yammer.

318
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,920
Interesting.

319
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,520
Yeah.

320
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,640
Well, a colleague pointed me to a thread on Yammer,

321
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,730
which I took part in.

322
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,060
But it was, I don't know the context of how it came up.

323
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,020
But someone said, the basic gist was, and I won't read it.

324
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:23,740
I'll paraphrase it.

325
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,380
It said, can we please have our testers back?

326
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,630
No.

327
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,750
And the gist was, well, there was a couple

328
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,590
of really fundamental flaws.

329
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:42,550
As you know, Microsoft, we don't have any anymore, even Estet's,

330
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,550
which does not mean you idiot.

331
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,870
I'm sorry, the three-year smart.

332
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,270
But when your friends hear that Microsoft

333
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,110
doesn't have any testers, that does not

334
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,750
mean we don't do any testing.

335
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,310
We do plenty of testing.

336
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,750
In fact, in some cases, we may do more testing

337
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,630
than we did before.

338
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,030
Not true across all products.

339
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,270
Some people have not made.

340
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,670
We've talked about the transition

341
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,030
to unified engineering.

342
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:08,520
Some teams have not made that transition as well as others.

343
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,120
Blah, blah, blah, covered that.

344
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,680
But here's the point.

345
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,760
Here's while maybe I'll rant a little bit.

346
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,540
Here's the soapbox.

347
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,820
All right.

348
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,380
If you want your testers back, because you're a lazy developer

349
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,540
and you can't make your code work on your own

350
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,500
and you need the safety net of a tester

351
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,060
to make sure that you feel good about your code,

352
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,100
then quit.

353
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
Don't even wait to get fired.

354
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,570
Just either get yourself fired now, HR violations.

355
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,410
I have a list of them.

356
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,690
I can give them to you.

357
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,050
The probably fireable fences.

358
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,610
I don't care what they are.

359
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,450
Just quit.

360
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,210
Leave.

361
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,010
I don't want you here.

362
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,770
I don't want you in the software industry.

363
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,730
Go do something else.

364
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,570
Go sell.

365
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,210
Real estate.

366
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,770
Real estate's on the rise again.

367
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,330
Go sell real estate, Brent says.

368
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,050
Yeah, I can, sure.

369
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,250
Just something else.

370
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,810
Don't go looking for your safety net.

371
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,210
And you think, well, I'll quit and go to some other company.

372
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:01,930
Guess what?

373
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,010
Unless you go into some IT shop in Podunk, Iowa,

374
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,410
making $11 an hour, you are not going to get a tester

375
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:10,050
to test your crap.

376
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:12,260
Oh, wait a minute.

377
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,740
If we could send them to one of our competitors.

378
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,260
Oh, yeah.

379
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,020
Oh, actually, for your style, I hear

380
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,940
Google is a great place to work.

381
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,300
You should really consider it.

382
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,230
Yeah.

383
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,230
And they'll say, well, Google has testers.

384
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,030
It's different.

385
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,950
There you go.

386
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,510
Go there.

387
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,310
You'll thrive.

388
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,670
But then there's another reason.

389
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,790
So now, I don't want the safety net.

390
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,990
It's because our products are low quality.

391
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,070
Oh, so you need someone to beat quality into the product,

392
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,630
because that's the job of the tester.

393
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:48,900
This idea that testing is where quality comes from is,

394
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,940
it doesn't make any sense.

395
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,860
How can it make sense to anyone in software?

396
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,580
If we would test this, we would have higher quality.

397
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,900
There was something that you said

398
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,020
on when we were talking about the prior topic.

399
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,660
I decided not to bring it up, but I'm going to now.

400
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,580
And you said a statement which says,

401
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,060
not all bugs are created equal.

402
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,780
And it was clear that you were referring

403
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,410
to evaluating the impact.

404
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,130
But it got me thinking, no, he's right.

405
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,570
Not all bugs are created equal.

406
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:23,790
And I'm like, OK, so how is test impacting that?

407
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,550
How did test ever impact that?

408
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:27,470
Never did.

409
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,230
Never did.

410
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,070
Look, Dev douchebag, if you want to bring back testers,

411
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,190
first try figuring out what's happening,

412
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,950
such that you're creating the stupid bugs in the first place.

413
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,190
Right.

414
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,150
This whole rant is, there's a side rant coming up.

415
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:49,710
I was talking about testers and quality.

416
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,480
And they're just not related.

417
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,200
Well, not directly related.

418
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Of course, if you test things, you're

419
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
going to have higher quality.

420
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,800
Maybe, if you're lucky.

421
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,280
Yeah.

422
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,680
Bugs released in the wild are not

423
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,060
because of a tester failure, because they didn't have

424
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,560
testers.

425
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,320
And there are douchebags on Twitter.

426
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,310
Did I say, did we just go up to PG?

427
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:12,950
I hate this.

428
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,910
I'm pretty sure where I've always been PG.

429
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,550
Maybe people who, there are people

430
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,750
who make their money on the fact that they need testers.

431
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,630
So this idea there are no testers freaks them out.

432
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,460
And then every time there's a bug,

433
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,920
a press release of a bug, they act like they're

434
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,480
going to be like, this wouldn't have happened

435
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,120
if that team had a tester.

436
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,760
Right, exactly.

437
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,920
It goes right back to this, can you

438
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,680
look at this bug in context?

439
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,960
And they would have found this bug if they had a tester.

440
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,360
They wouldn't have released this.

441
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,520
And it's like, they're just a bunch of BS.

442
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,240
I just don't get people.

443
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,280
I am, the longer, and I've said this before, and the three,

444
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,280
I do not mean to offend any of you.

445
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,920
But the longer I work as an engineer in this new world,

446
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,640
the less and less I relate with software testing

447
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,800
that I see in Twitter and the BloggerSphere, et cetera.

448
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,790
Same here.

449
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:16,270
So you know, my blog site is Testastic,

450
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,890
which I love it as a brand name.

451
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,570
But I'm just like, every time I go in and I want to post

452
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,730
and write it up, I have test in your name.

453
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:28,570
And I'm just like, ugh.

454
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,210
I so, and I can feel every time I notice that,

455
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:38,690
I just so, that a big chunk of my self-identification

456
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,050
with that brand is just lost.

457
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,890
I just, I don't feel it.

458
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,570
And I still consider myself a test specialist.

459
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,730
There are test, people in the test world

460
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,930
who wouldn't consider what I do testing, and I don't care.

461
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:59,160
But I'm a specialist in test and quality.

462
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,520
I'm respected for that, and I get paid for that.

463
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
So that's what I do.

464
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,120
But I can't relate to discussions on automation and,

465
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,080
and it's ridiculous.

466
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,930
I am still quite passionate around quality

467
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,970
and how to get there.

468
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:28,120
I no longer have the passion around preventing impact

469
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,160
to quality.

470
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,080
My passion is much more around how

471
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,720
do I minimize the total impact of quality.

472
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,080
So the model used to be, oh, we must prevent it at all costs.

473
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,240
No.

474
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,880
No, if it's cheaper, faster, better, cooler to react to it

475
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,400
and that reduces the overall pain,

476
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,720
that's a better strategy.

477
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:57,110
I'm done with the month-long test passes before we ship.

478
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:06,290
Yeah, bringing back testers, it almost, to me,

479
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,890
hopefully like in the next five years, if a dev says that.

480
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:16,090
So let me put a cap on that, because then we'll go on.

481
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:21,090
My role, I am on this 120-person team,

482
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,810
whatever big we are, as the test guy, the quality guy.

483
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:29,290
But I'm not the, and I think having that role,

484
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,930
having a quality specialist, a test specialist on a team,

485
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,210
I think is good.

486
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,130
But I don't do really any testing.

487
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,290
Your role is that?

488
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,730
I'm making sure the right things are happening,

489
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,040
but I'm not your tester.

490
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,280
You're a knowledge coach.

491
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,560
Your role is to scale the testing skill set

492
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,200
within your org.

493
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,240
And I think, actually, even with that size,

494
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,400
if you were to have more of you in that team,

495
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,960
maybe two or three of people like you would be fine.

496
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,600
But much more than that, you start

497
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,880
to feel and look like a safety net that people would go after.

498
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,360
Right.

499
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,240
The one thing, too, that I always find interesting,

500
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,280
you know how we previously talked about people go,

501
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,280
well, if they had a tester, blah, blah, blah,

502
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,690
this would have been found, and this would never have shipped.

503
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,330
Hey, guys, particularly to those folks

504
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:39,890
who are generally consultants who get paid to rile up testers

505
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,490
and send them new projects, I don't

506
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,690
know if you're aware of this, but I

507
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,370
know hordes of testers who have found that bug

508
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:58,360
and had the decision to ship taken from their control.

509
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,600
So no, that's wrong.

510
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Your prevailing assumption that somebody

511
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,910
didn't know about this before it shipped

512
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,070
is not guaranteed.

513
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,390
Yeah, and often, I hate, I want to end this subject,

514
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,230
but there's context.

515
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,910
Often, you may see this bug is horrible.

516
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,270
How could they know about this?

517
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,830
And sometimes you knew about it,

518
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,430
but you didn't realize, you're talking about contextualization.

519
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,350
You didn't realize the impact of the bug.

520
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,150
Like, oh, this is bad, but it looks

521
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,950
like it only happens in this situation,

522
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:34,070
but it turns out it happens in a wider situation

523
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,950
or something like that.

524
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,230
Yeah, it only happens at midnight on February 29,

525
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,120
and only if it's on a Wednesday.

526
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,800
Oh, wait, no, it happens all the time.

527
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,600
Whatever.

528
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,520
Hey, we, thank you, three, one of the three sent us

529
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,240
a letter, an email, not a real letter.

530
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
I haven't got a letter in a long time.

531
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,250
I get cards at Christmas, but we got an email.

532
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,130
It must be nice still having friends.

533
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:03,850
And you know what happens when, well,

534
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:07,810
if you're not obnoxious and ugly, you get friends.

535
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,650
Or one of the two.

536
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,590
Yeah.

537
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,030
You learned to live with it.

538
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,110
When one of the three sends us an email

539
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,830
and asks us a question, you know what that means, Brent?

540
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,270
I do, but why don't you share?

541
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:23,110
Mailbag!

542
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,960
Woo hoo!

543
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,840
Love these things.

544
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,700
Christopher Rod from Microsoft.

545
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,540
One of the three emailed us and asked us.

546
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,300
I'll skip all the stuff that says,

547
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:44,300
Brent, you smell bad even over the podcast, which is weird.

548
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,920
But anyway, anyways, I have a question for your mailbag.

549
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,640
Can you guys talk about your experiences

550
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
and process you guys go through

551
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,000
when doing planning and decomposition

552
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,880
for sprints or semesters?

553
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,160
I'm assuming you're involved in those types of meetings.

554
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,390
Yes.

555
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,110
How are requirements gathered, blah, blah, blah.

556
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,510
In the past, I've experienced horrible requirements

557
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,990
with one-liner storage scenarios,

558
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,430
the infamous we're agile,

559
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,710
we don't have documentation excuses came up,

560
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,750
blah, blah, blah.

561
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:17,970
So I spend a lot of time helping teams

562
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,770
groom their backlog and get things in order

563
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,970
and watch their crazy attempts at estimation.

564
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,800
So I can add some color too,

565
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,880
but you've done more of this, Brent,

566
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,520
so I'm gonna let you start.

567
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,300
Oh, I'm reeling on the agile equals no documentation,

568
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,780
but I'm going to do my best to ignore this.

569
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,540
It's okay, the three no.

570
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,980
Yeah, that's true.

571
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,380
All right, so.

572
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,420
Anytime now.

573
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,320
Where to begin?

574
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,800
So I'll just say at a high level,

575
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,340
what my team does is we want to,

576
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,000
so semesters at Microsoft, I'm gonna start here.

577
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Semesters at Microsoft generally mean six-month chunks.

578
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,560
I have a question for you because

579
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,800
I haven't used semesters before, is that,

580
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,400
and I just could be an ignorant part of my Agilish,

581
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
is that a Microsoft thing

582
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,040
or is that really an Agil thing used?

583
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,360
No, it's a Microsoft thing.

584
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,960
Good to bring up, okay, thank you.

585
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,240
I ignore Microsoft-only terms,

586
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,980
so I'm happy about that one.

587
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,420
So the model that I am now most using,

588
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,450
there is essentially three models that I'm familiar with.

589
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,330
There's the Kanban model, there's the Scrum model,

590
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,770
and then there's the SAFE model.

591
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,650
My favorite one is the SAFE model.

592
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,800
Really?

593
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,640
Yeah.

594
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Really?

595
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,320
Really.

596
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,840
So elaborate, sorry, I'll shut up.

597
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,960
Why does that shock you?

598
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,000
Are you familiar with it?

599
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,240
I'm familiar with SAFE.

600
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,680
The SAFE planning model?

601
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,520
Yeah.

602
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,460
Okay.

603
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,680
So when you're planning,

604
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,480
there's a couple of considerations.

605
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,590
In an Agil world, right, you want to,

606
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,020
Alan and I have mentioned this over and over again,

607
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,220
you want to create a planning model

608
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,670
and a planning cadence that's adaptable,

609
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,390
not predictable.

610
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,770
Right?

611
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,610
Yes.

612
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,450
Yes.

613
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,130
Now, there's another aspect to this

614
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,330
that we haven't talked here,

615
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,900
which falls into what I see occurring

616
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,540
when people start the conversation around

617
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,420
we don't do documentation.

618
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,620
Okay, because in addition to,

619
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,260
you don't want a prediction-based model,

620
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:06,840
you also don't want an interruption-based model.

621
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,440
And loose documentation, no documentation,

622
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,090
encourages interrupt-driven processes

623
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,650
under the name of agility.

624
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:32,190
So what my team does,

625
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,750
oh, I'm gonna go three more principles.

626
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,430
Okay, number one, in order to adapt,

627
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:44,870
that means you need to continuously groom your backlog

628
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,190
and be able to update it with the latest available knowledge.

629
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,720
For execution purposes, you want to have a model

630
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,520
that gives the team a longer-term roadmap

631
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,680
but creates the most amount of knowledge

632
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,680
towards the short-term tactical bits.

633
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,920
So to be more specific,

634
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,480
Microsoft generally plans at a,

635
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,280
not Microsoft, I don't think it's all Microsoft,

636
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,520
but certainly my division uses six-month chunks.

637
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,060
It's kind of a, more of a predictive model

638
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,820
where executives ask us,

639
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,300
hey, what are you going to do?

640
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:34,300
Okay, and honestly, what I do is I produce that and say,

641
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,860
hey, here's the direction I'm doing

642
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,260
and here's what I think is happening.

643
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,220
By the way, just to be super clear,

644
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,700
as I discover new knowledge, I will adapt

645
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,500
and I'll certainly set expectations,

646
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,140
clarify when I'm doing this,

647
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,620
but you should expect that changes will occur.

648
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,940
And all executives I've ever presented do just go,

649
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:02,340
well, of course, that's what you'll do, okay?

650
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,140
And then I wanna have a planning cycle

651
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,890
such that I'm producing the highest ROI first.

652
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,410
Okay, that's the principles that I operate under.

653
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,540
To build a roadmap, that's essentially,

654
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,670
I'm going to book out three months of effort, okay?

655
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:28,250
And the way I book it out is a month,

656
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:31,770
I'll take each month, split it into two chunks,

657
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,010
roughly aligned to two week sprints.

658
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,410
I really just, I don't really care.

659
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,610
I don't use a sprint model when I execute,

660
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,650
so I just split the month in half.

661
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:45,580
Whether or not it's actually two weeks, don't really care.

662
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,560
And then for the first month,

663
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,270
I will book work at 80% capacity,

664
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,670
second month at 60% capacity,

665
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,110
and the third month at 40% capacity.

666
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,990
Book those three months in advance?

667
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,160
Yes.

668
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,000
Interesting.

669
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,240
And so then the numbers may,

670
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,930
if you're gonna do three months in advance,

671
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,930
that makes sense,

672
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,170
because you have this care of overflow,

673
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,330
it takes care of discover to work,

674
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,570
which you're always gonna have.

675
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,410
That's interesting.

676
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,730
I don't like booking three months in advance.

677
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:23,090
But I, and again, understanding that you're not,

678
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,330
based on what you just said,

679
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:27,290
you're going to adapt and add and prioritize, et cetera.

680
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:29,610
So anytime you're doing, for me,

681
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:32,730
anything longer than, even a month is hard,

682
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,410
but the farther out you get, the less accurate it is.

683
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:40,120
And the more adaptability buffer, I'll call it, you need.

684
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,640
So I like, that's kind of an interesting way

685
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,760
to do an 80, 60, 40.

686
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,600
Right.

687
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:48,600
So you correctly identified why you do the 80, 60, 40.

688
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,720
The other thing is,

689
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,320
why do I book it out three months?

690
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,320
It's, book is how I communicate it to others.

691
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
Okay.

692
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,680
The primary reason why I'm laying out

693
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,760
a three month roadmap in that fashion,

694
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,280
is so that my team understands

695
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,920
sort of the quote unquote, long-term vision.

696
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,400
And the point of laying it out for three months

697
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,440
is that they can start their work for month number one,

698
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,280
knowing full well sort of the work

699
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,880
that we're gonna be doing in month number three.

700
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,360
And so if the work they're doing in month number one

701
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,680
could be influenced by that long-term work,

702
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,360
they know that beforehand.

703
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,200
All right.

704
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,560
So it's sort of a balance between strategic and tactical.

705
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,720
All right, so when you get to month number two,

706
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,880
do you, does that become the new month number one

707
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,040
for the next three months?

708
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,880
Do they overlap?

709
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,280
That's exactly what happens.

710
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,640
So the week before month number two.

711
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,880
Sorry, I keep on stealing all your punches.

712
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes, the week before month number two,

713
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,200
we rebuild the plan, right?

714
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,160
Because month number one, I needed 80%.

715
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,720
Month number two, I needed 60%.

716
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,960
If I executed on month number one perfectly

717
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,520
and I were just to move the month forward,

718
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:24,520
then I got 20 additional percent of capacity

719
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,280
that I need to fill out.

720
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,120
So I have a question for you.

721
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,000
So how did you come up with the 80% number?

722
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,880
That's 80% capacity, right?

723
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,120
So what you mean by that is you look at capacity

724
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:41,000
for the team, then you schedule based on 80% of that.

725
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,840
Is that correct?

726
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,760
Yes, so there's two cadences that we do

727
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,360
in terms of backlog planning, okay?

728
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,080
Number one, the roadmap building

729
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,940
that occurs once a month.

730
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,220
There's also a weekly backlog meeting, okay?

731
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,620
So we want to be able to continuously adapt

732
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,060
to current information, okay?

733
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,160
One of the single, in my view,

734
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,280
one of the single most important principles

735
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,920
to the ability to adapt and keep a sustainable pace

736
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,340
is you must have free capacity.

737
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:18,340
So 80% is not a buffer, which is often,

738
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,820
is what is considered in the old school world.

739
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:29,100
It's not sort of a, I'm sorry, it's not a buffer,

740
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,900
it is a buffer for sure.

741
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,900
It's not a buffer of, hey, my team sucks at planning,

742
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,490
therefore I'm gonna add a buffer.

743
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:38,330
It's not that.

744
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,530
Its whole purpose in life is unbooked time.

745
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:46,070
As I go through capacity planning, like for example,

746
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,550
if you were to go to my,

747
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,670
I don't think I've erased it yet,

748
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:53,150
if you were to go upstairs to my office right now,

749
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:57,310
you would see that I have the three months segmented,

750
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,230
or bifurcated, so I have six segments.

751
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,870
And one of the things I do is I then say, okay,

752
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,710
so roughly two weeks at 80% means

753
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,550
eight days available per person.

754
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:14,510
How many people will I have this time period?

755
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:17,950
I then say, okay, I write, say, number 24,

756
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,230
if I had three people.

757
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,630
Then I ask them, hey,

758
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,930
who's taking time off during this time?

759
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:24,490
That gets subtracted.

760
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,370
Then what we do is we look at,

761
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:32,950
there is a pre-planning process,

762
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,910
which is around what are the scenarios

763
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,830
that have been asked of us.

764
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,690
I go through an ROI process to determine

765
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,930
which of these things I should prioritize.

766
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:50,530
I do not use just a single stack ranking model.

767
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:56,530
I use what's known as WSJF as a model.

768
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:01,610
I find that extremely effective to rank these scenarios.

769
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:05,490
Then what we do as a team is we take this scenario,

770
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,330
even if it's ambiguous.

771
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,930
I bring my whole team in a room,

772
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,770
we look at the first scenario and say,

773
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:16,920
okay, what do we need to do to achieve this outcome?

774
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,660
And then we start discussing what the tasks are,

775
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:24,180
and well, I'll have a bunch of sticky notes.

776
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,680
I'll write down the task as it's mentioned,

777
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,440
put it on the board, book it in one of the months,

778
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,020
and say, how much is this gonna cost us?

779
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,860
And we-

780
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,620
And you book by our T-shirt size?

781
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:41,240
No, I go, I use Fibonacci numbers

782
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,200
and I estimate in days.

783
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,080
Okay.

784
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,160
Okay, so if it's really huge,

785
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,600
and we only use Fibonacci numbers for this

786
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:54,600
because history has shown that as things get bigger,

787
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,480
the more likely you don't have a clue how much-

788
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,320
Absolutely.

789
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,240
So do you have a limit on how long a work item can be?

790
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,240
I will only allow Fibonacci number up to 21.

791
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,360
Days?

792
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,680
Up to, listen, I'm not done.

793
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,540
So when we're going through the initial planning,

794
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:15,720
I will only allow it up to 21, okay?

795
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,800
But anything 13 or over,

796
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,840
when we've identified that it's a 13 or a 21,

797
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,180
it gets broken down.

798
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,420
Okay, so let me just give you,

799
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,980
I have a lighter weight approach we use on our team,

800
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,300
which is both good and bad, I think.

801
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,540
We also came up with the 80% number, seemed about right.

802
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,680
We're gonna do 75, but it seemed,

803
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,460
again, we're gonna experiment with it.

804
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,500
I like the idea of sort of booking things.

805
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,180
We have stuff on the horizon,

806
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,900
but it hasn't been estimated or costed at all.

807
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,260
So I don't know if it's gonna end up a 60 or not.

808
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,380
And again, based on our ship schedule,

809
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,020
which we talked about before,

810
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,820
we don't have a ton of time anyway to add a bunch of stuff.

811
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,100
So that's all the same.

812
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,250
We don't use Fibonacci.

813
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:10,250
We do make sure teams break down any items that are,

814
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:14,290
I'm a big fan of the two-day limit for a task.

815
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:20,240
I think even beyond two is when the odds

816
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,440
of your estimate being correct start declining rapidly.

817
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,240
But I don't make and break down things

818
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,800
unless they're five days or more.

819
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,840
The thing is for me is I don't prioritize very highly

820
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,120
that estimates are correct.

821
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,320
No, no, and that's true as well.

822
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,800
So we do it, you have to,

823
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,200
there's the predictable part where you want to figure out

824
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,520
how much work can we get done during this iteration

825
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,200
where you have to use the estimations and capacity

826
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:50,400
as a model, remember, all models are wrong,

827
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,480
some are useful, as a model for figuring out capacity.

828
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,140
Our team is, and I don't think this is a bad thing,

829
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,820
and this is where a lot of teams

830
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,180
get themselves in trouble.

831
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,700
Our team is particularly horrible at estimates,

832
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:10,580
but that just means we haven't learned a lot about them yet.

833
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,190
Or you haven't learned how to function

834
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:16,910
without requiring estimates.

835
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,470
Yes, correct, either one.

836
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:22,630
There is an amount of predictability

837
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,790
that executive leadership usually wants

838
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:27,310
around those estimates, knowing when things can come in.

839
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,110
And when you're working on a complicated product

840
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,710
where there are dependencies from team to team,

841
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,710
being able to estimate to some level of accuracy

842
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,310
when a dependent feature is going to be available

843
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,470
is important.

844
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,820
I want to clarify that very strongly

845
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:48,060
because that's another reason why I do the three-month

846
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:52,460
and I have the, we'll call the adaptation buffer

847
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,500
while it scales down.

848
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,780
If the direction doesn't change month over month,

849
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,300
then I'm able to publish a committed plan,

850
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,060
something that my team will commit to

851
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,980
if you add up all the numbers,

852
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:15,140
I'm basically taking one third of my team's capacity

853
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:19,020
off the table by doing this model in the three months.

854
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:25,810
So I'm confidently able to commit to what I laid out.

855
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:32,150
If month over month, if the roadmap changes,

856
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,430
then the people I'm committing to

857
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,550
are involved in that discussion.

858
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,390
I think you're, I agree completely.

859
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,990
I think I'm talking about different timelines here.

860
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,790
We're talking about dependent features being available

861
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,430
on a week by week basis

862
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,470
or sometimes even more granular than that.

863
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:52,630
I actually, so if you have a team

864
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,670
that has a high degree of dependency,

865
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,830
then there's another model from SAFE

866
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:03,230
that I much more prefer, which they call the program board,

867
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:06,790
which allows, it's,

868
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,910
you can think of it kind of like a scrum of scrums.

869
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,710
It's not, and it's super effective unlike,

870
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,790
well, that's further proof of why it's not a scrum of scrum.

871
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,450
And then lastly, and I'll close out

872
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,610
and you can have the final word on this.

873
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,600
As my team is working together

874
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,520
and we're decomposing these scenarios

875
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,260
into features and plotting them out, right?

876
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:40,650
We also write up, hey, what are dependencies?

877
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,410
We can move, we shuffle tickets around as a result of,

878
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:49,600
hey, we have to, if there's a natural sequencing, right?

879
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,260
Or if we need to get people involved, right?

880
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,580
We go, you know what, we need something from that team.

881
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,020
You know what we're gonna do?

882
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,580
We're not gonna start our portion of this until March,

883
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:09,220
but I'm gonna write a ticket in the start of February.

884
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,100
I'll write one ticket for each of these chunks in February

885
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,980
to say, reach out to that team

886
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,700
and make sure that they're progressing.

887
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,980
All right, one thing that's nice

888
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,980
or maybe a little bit different on our team is

889
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,420
the bulk, we do have dependencies on other

890
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:32,590
server products in Microsoft SharePoint, Exchange,

891
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,310
Skype chat services.

892
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:35,950
But for the most part, we're self-contained

893
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,990
and we're all on one, about to be two floors

894
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,550
of Lincoln Square, so a lot of these things

895
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,910
are just conversations in the hallway versus

896
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,630
you know, more formal tickets, et cetera.

897
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:50,630
But it's, the challenge is, the challenge can be

898
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:53,230
when you have dependencies, keep everything linked together.

899
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:57,430
One other thing Christopher asked was the role

900
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:01,180
of the generalizing specialists or specializing generalists

901
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,700
and how, if we use those skills in these meetings,

902
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:05,700
I want to talk just a little bit about that.

903
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,780
So one thing I do in the, when we're talking

904
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,260
about estimates of things is just reminding people,

905
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,060
remember I'm the quality and testing specialist

906
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,060
on the team, is they talk, somebody may be throwing out

907
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,780
estimates or something, it's about a day.

908
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,180
And I think, and I stop and I give them a look

909
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,980
and they go, and they'll look at me and they'll say,

910
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,540
Alan doesn't think it's a day,

911
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,020
but it's really pretty trivial.

912
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:33,980
I said, there's a world that you came from

913
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,260
which isn't the world you're in now.

914
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:40,810
So done, completing the work does not mean

915
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:44,800
it's working as the best I could tell.

916
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,720
It means you've written tests for this,

917
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,320
not just unit tests, but some integration tests

918
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,840
to make sure this works.

919
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,160
You have measured code coverage and looked at where

920
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,640
gaps are, you've looked, you've added the

921
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,440
instrumentation to this to make sure we can

922
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,440
monitor how it's working in the field.

923
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,310
It's hooked up, if it's part of a performance scenario,

924
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:08,590
that's measured and working and can be tracked end to end.

925
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:11,780
There's a whole list of things that goes into done.

926
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,980
And at first, I get answers like this,

927
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,220
well, that's why we have the buffer, right?

928
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,740
So no, no, no, no, no.

929
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,180
It's not that kind of buffer,

930
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:22,060
like what Brett talked about before.

931
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,980
It's just unscheduled time.

932
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,980
So we need to, when you think about the answer,

933
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,540
Christopher's question, one value I bring

934
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,820
is helping someone see holistically what it takes

935
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,440
for a feature to be done.

936
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,820
We had, and this has happened a couple times in my career,

937
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:43,660
once I watched it happen on my team last fall

938
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,020
and I will not let it happen again,

939
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:49,340
it was when the feature is done,

940
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,930
or almost done for about three months.

941
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,380
And I can't handle that.

942
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,140
It's too much.

943
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,540
You need, things need to get done done now.

944
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,700
Done, done, done, done.

945
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:08,830
One thing, one bit of color I'll add to that

946
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:14,090
is my definition of done is proof

947
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:20,260
that it added customer value.

948
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,420
That's it, right?

949
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,260
No, no, no.

950
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,700
Until you've tied the dots together

951
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,860
that shows proof that this has added customer value.

952
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,300
It's not done, go back to the drawing board, re-estimate.

953
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,380
Now, in the waterfall world, that's a pain in the ass.

954
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,620
Hey, we only ship once a year

955
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,820
in the more agile world, particularly in services.

956
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,700
I'm currently helping A-Team

957
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,300
that does an on-prem product

958
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:02,460
and they are going to ship monthly.

959
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,220
It has to change somewhat

960
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,180
how they're gonna view customer validation,

961
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,320
but they're going to be able to do it.

962
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,940
It's also helpful in terms of failing fast.

963
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,860
Like if you've just produced a feature

964
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,580
that you find that no customer's using,

965
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,100
you can discover that in two weeks versus one year

966
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,380
and go, okay, do we not actually understand our model?

967
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:30,380
Because we just spent a month testing this feature

968
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,300
no one's using, right?

969
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,460
For me, it is so much ROI-focused, it's pitiful.

970
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,590
But on the, I, as you know, have gone back to school

971
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:51,630
and weekly using Christopher's question

972
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,830
on generalists and specialists.

973
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,470
I've learned something interesting

974
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,390
that I wanted to share with you, Alan.

975
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,110
I can't wait to hear it, Brad.

976
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:07,110
So I'm currently studying business process management.

977
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:11,150
How to optimize processes.

978
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:15,910
It's all about systems thinking and it's fantastic.

979
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:19,260
As I was reading chapter one,

980
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,460
they started bringing up the topic

981
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,100
of generalists and specialists.

982
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:27,340
And I learned something, yes.

983
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,500
They mention these things outside of the AB testing podcast?

984
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:31,980
Outside of Agile even, yeah.

985
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:33,740
Whoa. Yeah.

986
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:39,440
And I learned something that I never knew before.

987
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,140
They know when management was created.

988
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,340
Do you know when this was?

989
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,180
No. Do you have a guess?

990
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,580
No. When was the first manager ever?

991
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:55,570
I think you'll find this whole thing fascinating.

992
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:56,610
I don't know.

993
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,250
A long, long, long time ago.

994
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:00,140
That's what I thought.

995
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,260
No. And thank you.

996
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,140
Cause all the other people I've done this with,

997
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,140
they answered correctly.

998
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:05,260
And I'm like, damn it.

999
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,420
How did your educational system not fail you?

1000
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:09,500
No.

1001
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,740
The first manager was created during the industrial age.

1002
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,840
I don't know if I...

1003
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,410
Nope. So I'll give you a name.

1004
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,050
Fellow by the name of Frederick Taylor.

1005
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:24,930
Wasn't like a medieval king,

1006
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:27,090
like the manager of his court?

1007
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,650
He wasn't a manager.

1008
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:30,570
He was a ruler,

1009
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:33,010
but manager in terms of command and control,

1010
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:35,820
like we're used to today, didn't exist.

1011
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,740
The king is the definition of command and control.

1012
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,800
I'm going to let you finish,

1013
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,600
but I don't believe the research.

1014
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,960
All right, go on.

1015
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,440
Fair enough.

1016
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,520
Actually not fair enough,

1017
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,960
but I'll send you links later.

1018
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,320
Yeah. Just cause it's written on the internet,

1019
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,160
it must be true.

1020
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,000
All right, go on.

1021
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,170
So the first manager was created

1022
00:51:57,170 --> 00:52:00,210
during the industrial revolution.

1023
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:04,410
Now, the reason why is because prior to that,

1024
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,430
things operated by guilds

1025
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,730
where you would have the barber's guild

1026
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,850
or the shoemaker's guild or the baker butcher

1027
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:19,290
and candlestick maker guilds

1028
00:52:19,290 --> 00:52:22,290
where they would work as a community

1029
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:25,170
and they would very deeply understand

1030
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,410
that whole process of barbarism,

1031
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:38,280
but not really understand how things got to them.

1032
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,480
Now, the guild model,

1033
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:46,930
you can view it as sort of a generalizing specialist model.

1034
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:49,490
When the industrial age hit,

1035
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:54,170
but there was no sort of manager of barbers.

1036
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,410
They worked together to determine

1037
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,840
what would set the standard.

1038
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:03,670
When the industrial age happened,

1039
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:07,130
Ford came in, the assembly line came in,

1040
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:12,130
and that's actually when specialists got constructed,

1041
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:15,870
at least to the degree that we're familiar with it today.

1042
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:20,760
This guy, Frederick Taylor,

1043
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,870
lived 1856 to 1915,

1044
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:27,950
created this topic called scientific management.

1045
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,870
And his purpose in life was,

1046
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,750
given this assembly line model,

1047
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:35,590
how do we increase productivity?

1048
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:39,310
And what they discovered is that

1049
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:44,340
generalists in that model completely sucked.

1050
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,820
That the ability for,

1051
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:51,740
since the work was highly repetitive,

1052
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,540
that it was much more productive

1053
00:53:54,540 --> 00:54:00,060
to have a single individual do that repetitive task

1054
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,380
over and over and over again,

1055
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,100
and then have chains of single individuals

1056
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:08,140
doing their own different repetitive tasks.

1057
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:14,430
Now, they could also optimize a way,

1058
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,790
so the dependencies.

1059
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:17,490
So if you were imagining you and I

1060
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:19,270
were working on the assembly line,

1061
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:23,470
your job was to take a doodad and put a bolt through it,

1062
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,030
and then I came after you,

1063
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:28,350
and my job was to put the nut on this bolt.

1064
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,740
We could put a wall between the two of us,

1065
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,100
I can still succeed.

1066
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:38,980
Okay, here comes a doodad with a bolt through it.

1067
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,500
Here's a nut, screw, screw, screw.

1068
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:46,500
Highly repetitive specialists in that model.

1069
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:53,600
Now, this is where managers came from,

1070
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,480
because now when you over specialize,

1071
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,660
these guys don't need to talk to each other,

1072
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,460
and if you change the order in which things are done,

1073
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,340
it goes out of control.

1074
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:10,740
So you needed to have a manager who's controlling

1075
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:12,700
who's doing what, when, and how.

1076
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:17,770
And as that boosted productivity,

1077
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,620
management became a science.

1078
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,700
How to command and control,

1079
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,320
things like even probably business process management

1080
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,120
came into fruition.

1081
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:37,240
Now, fast forward, thank goodness,

1082
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,240
fast forward to the 80s.

1083
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,080
Oh.

1084
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,520
All right, so what happened then,

1085
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:49,520
as they learned that this was creating efficiencies,

1086
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:54,640
they began to construct the functional model,

1087
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,640
where the departments would be invoked,

1088
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,760
where departments would self-optimize.

1089
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,080
So now we're seeing, okay, we're starting with specialists,

1090
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,600
and they're highly siloed.

1091
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,600
They don't need to talk to anybody,

1092
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,960
because their work is highly repetitive,

1093
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,800
and it's the same thing over and over again.

1094
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,640
Then departments got constructed,

1095
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,280
or then managers got constructed, then departments.

1096
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,040
And this created a fractal pattern.

1097
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,180
And in the 80s, it started to fail,

1098
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,700
because the number of departments,

1099
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,740
much like how specialists were not working well together,

1100
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,020
now departments aren't working well together,

1101
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,560
but now they have created such an immense system

1102
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,400
that departments failing to work together

1103
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,840
is causing failure, causing critical failure.

1104
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,840
I tried to wind this to the software world

1105
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,760
in a generalist and specialist discussion, right?

1106
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,920
And I started thinking through,

1107
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,020
in our model, right, what is the place

1108
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:10,750
where work is highly specialized

1109
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,960
in terms of the definition laid out here,

1110
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,720
which is highly repetitive,

1111
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,040
that doesn't require dependencies?

1112
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,920
Yeah, I think in that case, in this particular model,

1113
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:31,160
the metaphor between factory and software

1114
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:34,840
and knowledge work, it's obvious that it breaks down.

1115
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,310
Right, but I have the generalist

1116
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,350
versus specialist battle all the time.

1117
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:46,030
Whenever I'm onboarding a new dev team to Agile,

1118
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,030
they tell me, but I'm a specialist.

1119
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,030
And I'm like, okay, what is a specialist?

1120
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:56,030
A specialist is someone with very minimal dependencies

1121
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:59,760
and repetitive tasks.

1122
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,090
And I'm like, I firmly agree

1123
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:07,040
that you view yourself as a specialist,

1124
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,040
but the world that you're in doesn't operate that way.

1125
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,160
Right.

1126
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,200
Right, and...

1127
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,120
I think what they mean when they say specialist is,

1128
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,640
there's one thing I do really well

1129
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,280
and that's all I wanna do.

1130
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,120
Right.

1131
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,560
But you still have to adapt to be able to do that,

1132
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,720
and it's not a specialist

1133
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,680
in the terms you've described today,

1134
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,680
but within the context of knowledge work,

1135
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,760
they are a specialist.

1136
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,860
And honestly though, I think a pure specialist

1137
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:44,300
and a pure generalist are not paths for success

1138
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,300
in the software industry.

1139
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,380
They're not, and I don't even think a...

1140
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,030
No, they're absolutely not.

1141
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:58,350
I do think more of the guild model is worked better.

1142
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:01,430
Right, but once you recognize

1143
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,470
that really the generalist and specialist,

1144
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:06,710
not only is it, I do something really well

1145
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,550
and that's what I wanna do.

1146
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,390
Okay.

1147
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,750
But there's also this idea

1148
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,310
that's generally around the specialist

1149
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:18,800
and I don't wanna have to play with others.

1150
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,640
Right, there's a siloism that's generally involved.

1151
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,480
Could be.

1152
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,340
And what I'm basically stating is,

1153
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,960
in knowledge work and we're in knowledge work,

1154
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,820
if you want to go fast,

1155
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,860
if you want to be more productive as a system,

1156
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:42,580
you need to optimize for the reality,

1157
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,580
which is there are dependencies,

1158
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,580
there is communication required.

1159
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:52,100
And the only way to optimize the whole system

1160
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:55,100
is essentially to get rid of the specialists.

1161
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,540
You have to convert them to minimum generalizing specialists.

1162
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:03,380
They have to be able to optimize

1163
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,420
and reduce time spent on knowledge transfer.

1164
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:08,500
I agree.

1165
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:09,340
Anyway.

1166
01:00:09,340 --> 01:00:10,860
And we should talk about that some more sometime,

1167
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:12,780
but we are way out of time for today.

1168
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:13,780
Yes.

1169
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:18,540
All right, everybody, I am Brent's friend, Alan.

1170
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,500
And I'm Brent.

1171
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,380
All right, see you next time.

1172
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,220
Bye.
