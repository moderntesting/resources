1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,620
All right, let's dance. Let's go. Let's move it. Let's shake it

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,380
Welcome to a B testing podcast your modern testing podcast

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:17,160
Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:24,140
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey everyone. It's Alan and

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,660
Brent and we're here for episode

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,860
161 of the AB testing podcast as you can tell my voice is a little off today

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
COVID

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,320
You know, that's that's what I thought so I got back from Copenhagen had a little cough like a well, it's my turn I guess

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,360
Got a piece. So I had symptoms. Alright, so I had a symptom had a cough and I went and got a PCR test right away

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:56,690
It came back negative. I took a couple antigen tests and said including one just like an hour ago

11
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,810
Looking down. It's still negative. So I think I may actually just have a cold. I have no other symptoms out of cough

12
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:08,130
Yesterday and the day before my voice was really bad and this is kind of on the mend

13
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,250
So, I don't know

14
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:17,130
So maybe I have COVID and none of the tests will work on me and the tests give an amazing number as you know

15
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,690
If you know anecdotally from I'm sure as I do that a lot of times they're negative even when someone has COVID

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,850
So but I'm thinking not I think because for lots of reasons, but anyway, you have important insights to share

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,290
No, I was just gonna say so

18
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:38,730
So what happened to the team in Copenhagen? Were you were you yelling at them the entire trip? No, no the the

19
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,890
opposite the opposite there was too many fun

20
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:48,170
Conversations and hugging what happened what I think happens is this I have been in this office

21
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,970
Which Brent can see nobody else can see pretty much non-stop for the last two years

22
00:01:53,690 --> 00:02:00,730
With very few human interactions. I think I lost any immunity that I had to anything else in the world

23
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:07,130
I think anytime I venture outside my house and with people I'm probably going to catch something for a while

24
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:13,410
Oh, so you're like the aliens and what was it war of the world? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah something like that something like that

25
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,950
I think there's something like that going on so that you no longer have

26
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,530
immunity against

27
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,450
common human diseases. Well, I think I'll build it back up. I am planning to

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,890
travel I'm gonna get back to a

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,610
I don't know what to call it a

30
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,850
Regular but infrequent travel. I'm gonna head down to San Francisco for a day

31
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,250
Remember I used to do day trips San Francisco back in the before times. I'm gonna do another one coming up here

32
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,970
Yeah, yeah, obviously not till my voice is better

33
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,130
But maybe July sometime be a good good time frame and then heading to Montreal in

34
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,010
September for a week need to visit the team out there and then probably head back to Copenhagen

35
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,290
Maybe in October or probably probably November and I'll split it. I'll spend three days in Copenhagen

36
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,970
Leaving on the third day and then so two and a half days in Copenhagen and then two full days in Helsinki

37
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,490
I haven't visited that team in a while either and then

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,420
Gosh, I got a visit Brighton too. So I'm pretty well spread out

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,920
But the biggest pockets of people on my team are Copenhagen Helsinki and Brighton

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,880
But I have a lot of my leader

41
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,340
I have a couple leaders in San Francisco probably my top managers down there

42
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,840
I want to go visit them see some of the team there a lot of the partners I work with are there

43
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,600
So yeah, I just got to get out and see people it's

44
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,080
not surprising

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,750
but also

46
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,980
surprising how

47
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,180
Effective it is to see people face to face once in a while

48
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,860
There's stuff you get done in a in a conversation in a room full of people that would take

49
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,480
Half a dozen or ten zoom meetings to get through. I don't know why the other thing is

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,540
You're gonna comment on that. I'll go on there's absolutely you got a comment there, right? It's interesting as as as

51
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,580
As you know

52
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,980
I've been coming into work for pretty much all but one month of the whole COVID start and

53
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,620
and

54
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,420
Certain things are changing that are annoying. I actually have an old-school commute now when I go back home

55
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,540
Like 405 is is trash

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,780
and

57
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,500
I'm like, oh, yeah, I didn't didn't miss this

58
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,660
And every now and again, right? I've gotten to a custom like I'm not gonna mess with the camera

59
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,900
But I have a parking spot

60
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,020
It's been my parking spot for two years and now people are taking you had you had no

61
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,460
It's mine with nobody around probably even light security at Microsoft

62
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,500
You could have put an A B testing logo in that spot along with Brent only I

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Still good. That's

64
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,880
It's again

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,080
But but let me but it's different like there's a difference like like some people need to leave work and be it like you

66
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,440
Need to be in an office away from home to be productive. That's different

67
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,760
It's the it's the seeing people part and there's two things that one is just

68
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,280
having a proper debate and conversation in a large group is

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,760
Just more effective in person in my experience

70
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,960
But the other thing is that was really fun about the trip was in zoom or in your case teams

71
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,740
All you ever talk about on that 30 minute 60 minute video call is work

72
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,300
We net we just don't have enough of those non-work conversations, which are so important to get to know people and

73
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,820
They're more

74
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:54,480
Recharging then then work over zoom. Yeah, there's there is that there is that that's slow

75
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,080
relationship

76
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,320
building

77
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,720
That you just can't I can't do over over a cough call

78
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,560
It's exactly I had

79
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,160
I guess it's now about three weeks ago. I

80
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,000
Had I was in my office and I had someone knock on my door

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,000
And I'm like, whoa

82
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
What am I supposed to do?

83
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
like

84
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,240
And and she's like hi Brent I am random PM and

85
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,960
I was told that you might be able to answer. I'm like, oh wow

86
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,200
This is like I remember this when people would randomly stop by and interrupt you in your office

87
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm like, I'm doing that right now. Wow

88
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,440
Right. It was weird now on the other side though. There are certain people

89
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,300
That I realized I missed working with

90
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,290
Individually like standing up at a white board. Yes in brainstorming

91
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,370
brainstorming shit

92
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,170
That was fun

93
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,170
Yeah, yeah

94
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:09,050
That that that sort of creative energy, which is really hard to do over

95
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,570
over the cuff call that

96
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:18,450
For me we've talked about this before my number one strength is ideation. I'm all about brainstorming

97
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:26,010
Invite me to any friggin brainstorm event you want. I'm in because it's massively energizing, but it's just

98
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,040
It's flat over

99
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
At least I haven't I haven't

100
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,320
The white board in zoo, I'm sure it's the same in teams

101
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,480
They haven't figured out how to use it

102
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:43,560
Well, yeah now and really to do those like right you kind of need a tablet and a pin device

103
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,120
With that being connected to a shared whiteboard

104
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,600
We have one of our conference rooms in Copenhagen, by the way has that has a a touchscreen that you can draw on

105
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,920
And it shows up in the whiteboard for zoom which which kind of works

106
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,760
But it worked better if everybody had one and not just all the people in the conference room

107
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,240
It was also the first time I had a lot of meetings where like it's different when everybody's on zoom

108
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,840
What's a little weird? I think on both ends is when you have

109
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,080
10 people in one room on zoom and then

110
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,160
10 other people all on zoom like like individually

111
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:28,500
There's a weird meeting dynamic when everyone's in this hybrid world where everyone's not remote

112
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,900
I've experienced that same thing as well and as much one of the benefits of

113
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,820
This conference call world is it was a great equalizer

114
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,620
the remote people

115
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Didn't feel left out

116
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,780
and it was because

117
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:52,940
Hallway chatter you can't really call into hallway chatter. Of course

118
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,980
the problem is it's a great equalizer because it's

119
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,460
It's focused on the least common denominator, which is not something I've ever really been

120
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,860
Abort on you don't you don't equalize everyone by bringing the highest people down. You bring the lower people up. It's weird

121
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,580
We'll never gonna get and I'm okay with this. We're never gonna get to a world where

122
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,020
90% of all of us are back in the office again, just just not gonna happen

123
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,300
but I think we need to get better at

124
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,910
Figuring out what this hybrid world looks like like I'm going to the office two days a week now

125
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,110
So I'm doing some of my one-on-ones in person. I actually have

126
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:38,470
Two direct reports in Bellevue now weird, right? No, I thought you've always had no I didn't for a while

127
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:44,510
I didn't have any team members in Bellevue. Now. I have two direct reports. We hired a director of docks and my

128
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,690
Internationalization lead is in Bellevue. That was the consequence of your last

129
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:56,750
Last move right? It's too hard to keep track. It's kind of like a never-ending carousel of shifting

130
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,670
Gotcha. Anyway, um, no, you know some insights there good to be back. Sorry about my voice

131
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,190
I think they're wondering who is on the podcast with Brent this week. Who is this guy?

132
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,310
He sounds pretty smart. Maybe he should replace Alan speaking of I don't know about smart

133
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:19,910
But you got the voice growl there you definitely sound sexy. Well, there's a it's a fine line between sexy and smart

134
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,790
I think that's a lot of a lot of famous philosophers have said that

135
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,630
Well, then there's hope for me yet. Hey, I keep on digging on Microsoft

136
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,270
I'm gonna do it really quick here for a second

137
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,030
But then all right

138
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,030
I want to talk about like then you do some things that I like which freaks me out

139
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:42,910
So I want to one quick dig is I had to spend some time with the Windows machine this week for the first time in a long

140
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,990
Time and I am so glad we're on two tracks because Brent is like slurping coffee

141
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:53,590
Anyway, so I had to spend some time on a Windows machine had to troubleshoot my daughter's machine brand new machine

142
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:57,510
Came with Windows 11 installed could not connect to the internet

143
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,530
Wi-Fi card is working. It's connected to my internal network. It can't connect to the internet

144
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,340
Doesn't have an IP address did not get an IP address from my router. Well, maybe my router screwed up

145
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,620
I'll make a hot spot on my phone. Nope. Can't get one from there either

146
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,980
I download drivers to a USB stick for my Mac and move them over I install those I go through a bunch of

147
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,400
Unbinding rebinding things random solutions on the internet

148
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:31,580
People have asked had this similar problem on several different computers and they've all tried these different things which is bad enough and

149
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:39,300
The the error messages from Windows are I hope you realize this are I know you don't work on Windows are pretty horrible

150
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,320
I forgot how horrible they were you don't like

151
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,460
0 X e 8 9 4 C 0 0 8

152
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,780
I actually and then oh gosh my wife's computer is blue screening, but they've now hidden

153
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,100
I used to be able to kind of half debug from the blue screen what was going on and know what to go look at

154
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,420
Now it's all hidden from you because that's more user friendly God

155
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,540
It's like in trying to make things friendly to screw it all up. Anyway, networks not working

156
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,660
I have looked at everything to try and make this work. The internet is no help. It's just broken

157
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:19,500
So I go in old school. I get to the the the network properties dialogue

158
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Which coincidentally is unchanged pretty much from when I used to test that in Windows 95

159
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,780
But anyway, I go through there and I go I'm just looking at for something. I don't know what it was something

160
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:38,100
Yeah, a red a red bang someplace. Anyway, there were no red bangs. Everything was working correctly

161
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,500
It gets to my router wouldn't get an IP address. So a

162
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:50,300
Little voice in my head just something telling me it's probably gonna be the dumbest thing ever. It's Microsoft

163
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,620
It's got to be something stupid. So I disabled IP v6

164
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,340
I unbound IP v6 from the network card boom on the network in a second

165
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,840
No explanation. I'm sure I mean by the time she needs a daughter's computer by the time she needs IP v6

166
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,180
I'm sure there'll be some patch for it that makes it work. But that kind of shit infuriates me. So

167
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,420
Windows is a steaming pile of crap. However, when you tell me Satya is doing good stuff and I go near yeah

168
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,220
Whatever you're actually right

169
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,260
Like I see all kinds of great stuff coming from and the latest is and I want to talk about this a little bit

170
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
I think it's really important. I think every company should do this is

171
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,620
is

172
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,180
Going to post salary ranges with jobs

173
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,220
And there's a couple things I want to as we've helped people adapt to modern testing

174
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,220
I think I have a few tips on how to help people and help people adapt to

175
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,620
Salary ranges offer with jobs because there are a few traps there. Did you know about this?

176
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,620
It's announced internally to see the news on this. Yeah. No, I know about this. Okay. I think it's pretty cool

177
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,740
A lot of fairness comes out of this

178
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,690
What do you think?

179
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:58,740
Before I start with them, what do you think some of the traps are with that? I will say I

180
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,230
Supported but mostly from a principal standpoint

181
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:07,070
Transparency and data

182
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,540
versus

183
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,780
Invisibility and

184
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,300
subjectivity

185
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:17,380
I'm always gonna pick transparency and data. I don't

186
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,260
know

187
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,900
Why they're doing this move what problem it solves

188
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,080
And I guess time will will bear it out

189
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:34,180
I think I think it solves the problem of fairness that a lot of people are worried about

190
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,620
I think people feel often like they're low-balled for a job

191
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,300
Which I working, you know, I they happen. I don't know

192
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,920
But it gives you a range now. I think it's good

193
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,600
I think all companies should do it, but there are some traps in a job search. So what happens if

194
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,680
Okay, I've posted a job level n

195
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,960
we'll just make up a number level n and the salary range is between

196
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
135 and 185

197
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,490
You love the job description print you think this is a job I want

198
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,900
But you'd expect to get paid more. Do you just now? What do you do now? It's like the difference is

199
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,700
You may not apply if that salary range is too low for you. I think that's fair to do, right?

200
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,340
Right on the other hand think back to the days when maybe you looked at I think I don't if you ever looked at the

201
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:30,690
Internal job site at Microsoft and think people just came and got you and and and recruited you but I've done both

202
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,730
Often you'd look at a level higher than you were

203
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:40,930
Because something you stretch into right I think the thing to keep in mind in that range 135 185

204
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,690
Maybe I would just again transparency. I would be upfront just I would just contact the company say I love this role

205
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:53,850
I really want to do it. I think I can do more than here and my salary requirements are higher and

206
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,710
Maybe they'd up level the job like today often will in the background someone comes in and they're awesome

207
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:06,870
They've interviewed for a job. We haven't shared the salary range, but we up level the job in the background or to give them a fair offer

208
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,250
Correct. Yes

209
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,450
And the same thing can happen here's where it gets weird because the same thing could happen the other way say you a lot of

210
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,450
People apply for jobs are not

211
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,750
They're not qualified for it, right?

212
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,670
But I hire humble hungry and smart if you have the right attitude

213
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:29,470
You have a desire to learn and I can tell you make good decisions

214
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:35,390
I know you're gonna learn quickly on the job. I want to be able to I guess it just because matter of transparency

215
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,510
I say look, I can't bring you in at level N

216
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,390
I really want to hire you at level n minus 1 and here's why and here's the things you need to do and

217
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,950
Your and your salary may not fit in that range

218
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,910
I guess it just forces me to be transparent in that range too, but I guess the point I want to make is in

219
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,730
Publishing those salary ranges

220
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:01,070
I think people both below and above that salary range should apply anyway and just be

221
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,190
Transparent about what they want. I don't think when a company posts a salary range with a job

222
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,350
Can we post a job and same as Microsoft you post a level a job at a level?

223
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,350
You have a certain expectation of what you want out of that role

224
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:20,270
You may hire someone who's a little less than that or a little more than that because they're the right fit for the team, too

225
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,420
Right the one thing about salary ranges that I do think

226
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:29,020
will help in the fullness of time is

227
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,900
Essentially to sort of level set expectations each of the big companies in in Fang

228
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,500
I guess it's now main the empty MS for meta not right Microsoft

229
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,420
They don't get to be fang

230
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:51,500
No, actually so so he he updated it and Microsoft is now in the list

231
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,860
I think they're calling it mama now. Oh my god. Yeah, whatever and

232
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,980
Netflix got dropped the

233
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,460
Anyway, my point is you go when you find out Oh

234
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,460
Google's Google's got a perfect role for me. That's an L7

235
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,900
And I'm like, okay, well, what the hell's an L7?

236
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,200
right is

237
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,240
so for me in my roles

238
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Where where I might look into I want to know is this an executive position or not as an example

239
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,900
Right and in unlike you I

240
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,380
Will like the big money, but I don't want the executive position

241
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,770
Now it might depend on the the company

242
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,850
Right. It's one of the things I love about my job right now

243
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:47,810
I have broad scope but I get to sit in the type of role that that I love which is the ground level

244
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,050
Manager and so that kind of gives me a sense of okay

245
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:59,560
What would be the role expectations above and beyond what they're communicating here, right? If it's an executive

246
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,040
Okay, you're gonna be spending your whole day in meetings and and

247
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,880
This is where it levels FYI can help

248
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,690
What is that levels on FYI website where you can compare levels between companies?

249
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,910
Fan that'll help it figure it out

250
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,350
Yeah, I I honestly don't think I will ever I think when I leave this company

251
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,710
Well things could change

252
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:30,630
I'm in the best job I've ever had I don't I don't see any reason to

253
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,870
To move. Yeah, if you enjoy your work and your manager is not an asshole

254
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,670
I would keep doing it, you know, I can tease I can you know complain about windows

255
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:47,630
But that's it autonomy mastery and purpose if you feel like your work matters and you enjoy it and you're you

256
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,250
Given the freedom to do it in a way that makes sense and you balance that with accountability, of course

257
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,550
And you have the skills you need just keep rolling. That's the gravy train

258
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,140
right, no, it's

259
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,780
Chocked full of happy sauce, right?

260
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,540
There's a couple other things that Microsoft is doing and I'm wondering

261
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,780
Wonder if you so there's another one so like

262
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,220
the equity angle on terms of posting

263
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,180
Salaries that's an interesting angle. I hadn't thought about before

264
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,760
I think there's probably gonna be pros pros and cons

265
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,820
I think people end up doing a lot of comparing between companies and which is gonna be bad at first

266
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,820
they'd be good in the long run because

267
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,660
God, you know, this could go all the way from chaos to

268
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,280
Companies calibrating their their you know in it, you know indirectly calibrating their job descriptions together

269
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:51,840
Well, I think that for sure is gonna happen. Like I have no idea what what this will do in terms of our competitors

270
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Right as you know

271
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,880
Companies in fangs slash mama

272
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,360
They're constantly stealing employees from each other, right?

273
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,260
So I don't know if that's gonna make that easier harder what that's gonna do

274
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:11,250
right from a from a negotiation standpoint

275
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,800
Well, it'll change something but change doesn't necessarily mean good or bad now

276
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,000
Microsoft getting rid of the non-disclosure agreement

277
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,190
I'd love to see more details on

278
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,030
that one in

279
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,470
general what I understand of it is

280
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:35,430
Positive and you don't have to answer this what might take from the outside after me leaving and going through it is

281
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,710
I think it's just too hard to enforce

282
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:46,660
Why bother? No, so I don't know that they're going to do so that's the thing. I'm like, okay, is this all up?

283
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:55,450
Because there's certain clauses in your in your in your NDA. I think that they're striking

284
00:21:56,130 --> 00:22:02,970
Right. It's as for example if if you report to so you had this right you couldn't

285
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,690
You couldn't badmouth your old team for a year because that was part of your NDA. Yeah, I did anyway

286
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,690
What the hell see they can they don't enforce it

287
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,530
whereas

288
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,090
technical IP

289
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,090
Even though they don't enforce it

290
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:23,650
It's still probably wiser to keep that NDA there because once it's discovered if it is

291
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:31,250
Important then they still have action that can take the other move that's happening is a move. I

292
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,870
Don't like

293
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,870
So Microsoft is going through

294
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,190
We've I don't know how long how long it's been since you've been on campus

295
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,030
Long time the the big soccer field

296
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,910
Next to building 16. Yes, that's gone

297
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:54,430
I used to play soccer there like in the old days. I will play soccer there twice a week at noon

298
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,670
Yeah, it's a big parking garage now

299
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,310
and

300
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:03,970
Building with the soccer field on top. No building buildings one through four gone

301
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,670
With an indoor soccer rink rink soccer's in the bottom floor again. No

302
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:18,060
And buildings one through four gone. Yeah, so if I I they were I think they were like getting ready to tear them down

303
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:25,520
When I was leaving they've turned them down. They built them back up and they probably probably taller than two stories down

304
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:32,240
Way taller. I think they're I'm not in any place where I could see him, but I believe five to six floors

305
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:39,540
All right, so you don't like this change where is this going? No, so they're putting in they redesigned them to all be open space

306
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,140
Which again, I think we talked about this before in the computer science industry

307
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:48,380
There's multiple studies that show that that is

308
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,820
Anti-productive not productive, but they're now moving it as a response to covid

309
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,340
They're now moving at one level further and that is

310
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,800
You don't even have a desk anymore. So when you come in

311
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,280
You you reserve a desk and that's your desk for that day

312
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,910
Yeah

313
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:16,610
That's what I do. It'll work over time. I just I just want to see studies

314
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:21,470
Like I like that makes the company so friggin sterile

315
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:27,390
Like I don't even have a place to to put a picture of my family anymore. There's no personalization

316
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,070
Whatever put it on your phone like the rest of us. I

317
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,870
Do you get your phone into a little picture frame?

318
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:40,420
Little digital PF. All right, I guess you're not a board on

319
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,100
Well, humans are hugely adaptable and will adapt to that but doesn't mean

320
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,860
What I want to see is these decisions as they align

321
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,820
to key business criteria

322
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,700
above and beyond the short-sighted view of

323
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,060
Hey, we need to hire another 10,000 people. Where do we put them?

324
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,980
In right now I look around it in my building as I just talked about

325
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,700
Microsoft's been open for business since the big the end of March

326
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,420
Well, this goes back to what I was saying before we're never gonna go back to I don't think we're ever gonna go back to

327
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,620
You know 90 plus percent of the people going in five days a week. I think

328
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,220
Unity have stopped a lot of their office expansion even like the number of people

329
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,340
Associated with an office in many cases far exceeds the capacity of that office

330
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,860
But well, I guess it's a problem we can solve when we get there

331
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,260
But for today, there's today. There's plenty of room

332
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:44,980
Yeah, the thing I see this thing I see as a beginning trend and I don't know if Unity is seeing this

333
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,540
I see a beginning trend of

334
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,460
I'll just call it remote ism as a

335
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,500
as a requirement for the job

336
00:25:54,500 --> 00:26:01,060
I think that's one thing people learn from Kobe is hey, I can still get my job done no matter where I am

337
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,860
Yes, and no and here's an I want to move on to another topic here

338
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,820
But I want to there's something I've noticed here one is people can do their job from home

339
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,460
But also there's value as I talked to earlier in that human interaction

340
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,180
And what I worry about is there are people that?

341
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:23,460
Need to see people they need to be in an office once in a while who don't know they need to be in an office

342
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:29,620
Once in a while, I will tell you in terms of so you and I have worked together for a while, right? The

343
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,220
You know about Colosso, for example, one of the key things around around Colosso

344
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,500
Is that it helps to build a stronger team? Okay, and I will say

345
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,860
Covid has kind of shattered that

346
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,900
But it's it's harder for the team to become a team

347
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,340
and be a team in that

348
00:26:52,820 --> 00:27:00,660
Because you need the members of your team to create multiple different connections with the other members of the team

349
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,420
I can force it in some regards. I can set the stage and say hey Alan this week

350
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:13,220
You're going to pair program with Bob and next week you're going to pair pair program with Susan and etc

351
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,420
But that that whole knowledge

352
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:20,280
That that organic knowledge sharing

353
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,440
Knowledge sharing is the consequence

354
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,120
Now in some regards remote work is basically saying hey, I'm going to be a siloist and I'm going to stay that way

355
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:39,350
Or at least that would be my fear of it if that happens. I'm I'll just be fundamentally against it. All right

356
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,510
Well, yeah, I I think

357
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,980
As in all things the answer is it depends and it's a balance

358
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,820
I want to move on because there are a couple of the topics here today and

359
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:57,420
One is so we talked last time about Ken Johnston one of the authors of Howie Tussoff or Microsoft going to

360
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,260
Ford

361
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,180
And he's all over posting on LinkedIn, which is that's nothing to do with

362
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,580
LinkedIn has become nothing what it was designed to be but whatever but he's posting pictures of his electric Ford truck

363
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:13,980
He's been driving around. He's very excited and then he is working

364
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:19,190
On the test team on the dedicated siloed s debt team

365
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,990
and

366
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,990
He did a couple other things at Microsoft after that and then retired

367
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,580
I think he was in retirement and apparently

368
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
in a cryogenic

369
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,660
tube

370
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,620
For about 15 maybe 20 years

371
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,700
Basically, you know, I was working on a test team

372
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,060
For about 15 maybe 20 years

373
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,940
Uh based on the mail he sent

374
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,540
He said

375
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:53,420
I'm gonna read the I know I know he won't listen to the podcast and I think it says educational and like i'll give you the

376
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,300
Whole email conversation. I want to talk about this thing. It's interesting

377
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,940
He says I got pulled into this madhouse and have not had this much fun

378
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Pissing people off in a long time

379
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,340
Point number one is why why are we why are we pissing people off?

380
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,780
Why don't we work together then it gets better he says

381
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,880
Startingly, there is pretty much no software dev test knowledge here nor any consistent automation

382
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,060
Trying to bring in the concept of an s debt who makes devs cry

383
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,860
And I thought oh man

384
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,930
I I feel so 1999 right now

385
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,570
It's not worse

386
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,890
And uh, he's you know trying to recruit me to come be an s debt on his team

387
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,570
He says maybe you write how we test software at ford

388
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,000
and uh

389
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,120
Still

390
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,120
No, they found that

391
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,440
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait ford

392
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,040
Yeah

393
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,560
So he's he's that ford with ken johnson

394
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,870
Two of my previous managers are now at ford

395
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,590
Which I have absolutely no interest in

396
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,620
Are they somehow related to each other? No

397
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,880
Oh my god, anyway, I wrote back as you and I brought up

398
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,920
I said my views on testing have changed with the industry research shows for example that automated tests owned by developers have a high correlation with

399
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,760
Quality whereas automation owned by a separate team has no correlation with quality. So I focus a lot on helping

400
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:25,000
Developers test better and on giving them better development and analysis tools so they can move faster with higher quality

401
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,440
I imagine the process would vary in the automotive industry

402
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,560
But and there may even be regulations blah blah blah

403
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,320
I'm happy in the world where shipping a few dozen times a day is the norm

404
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,160
We're the only bugs that reach production or bugs that can't feasibly cop before release

405
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,400
The slow shipping world is something i'm happy to leave behind. So i'll see what his response is to that

406
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:50,310
So

407
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:53,670
We talked last time. I don't want to spend I want to move on from this before too long but

408
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,670
This is goes into what we talked about in the last podcast. There's this

409
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:04,070
You know, there's different bubbles of where people live and our next topic is going to talk about that some more

410
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,170
but

411
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:11,690
This idea of and this one thing I want to hit on is this idea of an adversarial

412
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,780
connection between

413
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,780
different parts of the team

414
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:23,420
It's so funny because you know, we lived that world a long long time ago, but it seems so foreign and wrong to me

415
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,980
like yeah

416
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,540
You know, it's weird how the how it like I I used to be that person

417
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,420
But now it's like we need to collaborate work together the more connected we are the better we're going to do

418
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,380
And it's like it's weird what you know a decade and a half will do to you

419
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,580
Yeah, it you you try things out you learn

420
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,060
right and

421
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,860
To me, I just I just think of that and I go

422
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
Wow, how did they isolate?

423
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:58,540
Because I I don't think we're in the bubble anymore as we talked about before drink

424
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:01,340
I I'm drinking tea

425
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,300
I think it's not helping if not taking the edge off

426
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:13,500
I think the perspective that we we have is far more mainstream and and that the the traditionalist point of view

427
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,540
Is is now

428
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,950
What do they call it the lagers?

429
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,220
right, it's

430
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,300
Certainly, it's going to be still there

431
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,740
Like as I bring up as an example all the time you can still go and find jobs doing cobalt programming

432
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,340
Absolutely

433
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:38,900
Right, and I can tell from the email that comes to my inbox every day that I can still go get a job as an estet

434
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,900
Because I get enough job offer. Well if I can pass the interview, but you know, yeah

435
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:50,820
I don't understand that why that's the case like you're linked in like why would anyone find you on linkedin and offer you an estet job?

436
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:54,420
Because i've been an estet in the past. I need to remove estet from

437
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,500
Everything in my profile. Yeah, but it says vp of engineering on the bloody thing. Why would it?

438
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,060
Oh, hey brent. Here's a news flash

439
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,540
News flash are you ready for is it now?

440
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:09,620
Yeah, some people are dumb. I am aware of this sadly

441
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,460
um

442
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,980
Statistically half of the people have a lower than average iq

443
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:24,940
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna say you don't have that quite right but yeah, I fixed it because I adapt

444
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,660
So yes, I want to you know, that's one bubble and i'm i'm if anybody from unity is listening. I have

445
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,420
negative

446
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:39,100
Interest zero to negative interest in joining forward because um, unless you all want to get rid of me you can let me know

447
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,620
When I also go to copenhagen, it's awkward because I bet nobody on your team listens to the podcast

448
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:48,060
I have people in my organization that listen to the podcast. Hi everyone

449
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,500
And it's a little awkward for me because I i'm just so anyway, whatever

450
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,500
I'm glad you find me interesting

451
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,980
This is how people find out what i'm up to how they get to know me better without spending time with me

452
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:06,780
My my my team do not listen to the podcast or at least they don't you should require it anyway, uh,

453
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:11,980
Our our buddy conference gerald who was in an abt 343 a while back

454
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,700
But I used to do those in fact if you want to be on if you want to like spend 30 minutes with me on a podcast

455
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,020
Ping me alan page on twitter

456
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,100
And we can set up some time. I'll do a little interview show with you when my voice is better

457
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,420
but uh connor's presenting at romanian testing days and

458
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,310
I think we is i've actually i've

459
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,590
Again, this is again the bubble, but this is somebody who

460
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:37,190
I i've worked with them respect that still is not quite

461
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,230
In line with all the principles and that's okay

462
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:45,590
We out when people want to debate the principles we say welcome to the conversation and it's okay

463
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,870
We want to be challenged. We want it to you know, make it real for you

464
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,190
but but but

465
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:57,430
Connor is in line connor is oh very much in line, but there was a reply someone took a picture of

466
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,950
Talking about the ab testing logo principles. He says

467
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,990
Modern testing principles being mentioned by connor

468
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,630
I still do not agree with alan page on principle seven. They never

469
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:15,830
Mentioned you it's always me good and bad. It's always me. Anyway, I still did not agree with alan page on principle seven

470
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,710
Not everybody contest which is right. Exactly. Which is not exactly principle seven says

471
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,870
Everybody can click around this wait, let me finish. Let me finish

472
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:30,310
Let me not finish go on brent. Okay. Thank you. Number one you look at the picture

473
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,550
and

474
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:40,150
This is this is this is your short form of the principles. I you know what I stand corrected

475
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,310
It's not

476
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,390
It's not mine. Now. I I still agree

477
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,190
everyone can test like

478
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:54,470
But my version of principle seven was fundamentally different. I kind of like yours better, but mine was

479
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,550
Uh, some of them lines of execute fearlessly

480
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,870
Right. It's it's like that's too far abstract from the original

481
00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:06,630
It's the but then if you think about principle seven

482
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,990
It's we're basically need to do this

483
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:16,150
Even because it's the right thing to do even though it may have these consequences

484
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,470
Yeah, and for those that haven't read the principles, they're on modern testing not over but principle seven

485
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,470
Basically is the one that says you may get so good at producing quality software

486
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:31,830
You may not need dedicated testers anymore and by everybody here's where it's the the semantics and get lost

487
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,070
I don't mean everybody

488
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,850
in the world

489
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:37,850
Everybody on the software team

490
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,690
Yes

491
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:46,250
I have taught so many developers to be good testers. That is far beyond an exception

492
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:52,650
For a developer to be a good tester. They're not all developers are great testers. Some are okay

493
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,440
but

494
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,160
Many developers i've worked with have become better testers than most testers. I know

495
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,040
Yeah in principle

496
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Actually, you know what? You're short for him

497
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,230
It's not

498
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,550
I get it. I get it. It's not it's it's I see what he did there and it's stolen from me

499
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,550
It's not exactly fair and it does I see where I see where it triggered

500
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,710
but also

501
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,910
Out of context from someone who's context driven a little bit weird, but it's okay. I love you but

502
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,910
The principle does not diminish the testing craft

503
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:32,440
Which is this final sentence there and even as written it does not diminish the testing craft

504
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,160
No, and I was thinking about that earlier today number one

505
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Principle seven says we expand the testing abilities and know-how across the team

506
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,260
okay, so

507
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,100
seven

508
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
You call it everyone can test

509
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,330
A better one. It's too long, but it might be

510
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:55,560
everyone

511
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,560
Can learn to test or something like that?

512
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,560
Right it's but that that softens it to regard it. I don't want to brainstorm

513
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,000
I think this is one more i'm okay having everybody contest on the slide everyone can test on the slide

514
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,440
But you have to add some context in the talk and I wasn't at conner's talk

515
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:14,360
No, do I have a recording so I can't tell if he said that but as written it's like

516
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,320
I could see why it would trigger but but again contextually we're saying that

517
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,120
It should be the goal of your team to get a whole team to get better at testing

518
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,320
I do not I don't care how good of a tester you are. I don't care if you are

519
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,120
You know the embodiment of the craft of software testing and you're like that

520
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,720
You're like your neil plugged into the matrix on software testing

521
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,800
You know everything if you're the only tester on that team, you are a bottleneck

522
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:47,800
So this is the thing it's like it diminishes if you're the only person doing testing you're a bottleneck

523
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm I'm I'm entering into rantville

524
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,320
Right this principle diminishes the testing craft. No, it does not

525
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
this this principle

526
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,140
Increases the testing craft

527
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
It is basically saying

528
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,520
Like they're interpreting it as oh testing something anyone can do

529
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,240
That is literally what is written there, right? But the way you're saying it is

530
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:18,920
Testing is not on this high ivory tower testing is something

531
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,280
Anyone can do correct

532
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,740
So it's not

533
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:31,540
It's not diminishing it in my view. It is strengthening it. Yes now more ideas to the party. It's strengthening

534
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:35,460
You're absolutely right. What diminishes the testing craft?

535
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,380
Is the testers that hold on to traditionalist?

536
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,940
Approaches with white knuckles. That's what diminishes it

537
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:49,220
They they sitting in their stupid codependency safety net loops

538
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,500
Sitting there patting themselves in the back not realizing that at lunch

539
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:00,180
The devs sit and talk and go. I can't believe I got this guy to do this fucking work for me

540
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,340
right, it's

541
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,660
like the as I've mentioned before

542
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,340
My humble opinion is that in the old?

543
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,120
traditionalist view of testing

544
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,820
Our number one value proposition was to be the scapegoat for the orc. Absolutely

545
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:23,860
Oh, I can tell you by the times like a bug was found after release and and the and this actual same test manager

546
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,860
I'm talking about and I

547
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,020
Sat in a room and got yelled at by the dev manager. Oh, yeah. Yeah

548
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,220
I've told you a story before where

549
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,220
um

550
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,700
uh

551
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,340
Where I had a dev lead come to me

552
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,710
And this was in the middle of our trend. This was in the middle of microsoft transition

553
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,070
I had I had joined the team after the transition

554
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,510
And I was set up to partner with them

555
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:57,190
To do some work. I wasn't a dev but I wasn't a test in this role

556
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,060
And they came to me and said

557
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,840
Hey, why wasn't this bug found before?

558
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,850
And I looked at her and I said

559
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,960
well, I

560
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,480
I don't know

561
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,600
um

562
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:16,760
If if if you really don't know then you know, let's pull up your unit test suite and let's figure it out

563
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,640
Basically, I very little little passive aggressive. Uh, I very passive aggressive go

564
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,760
Like why are you coming and yelling at me about what's something that is clearly your problem?

565
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:35,160
Everything we've talked about here on I I totally agree with and actually connor geyser as well. I want to just talk a little bit about

566
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:38,600
Um, I again, I haven't seen his talk yet

567
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,160
Uh, but he was interviewed about it a little bit for info queue

568
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,600
And I want to share a little bit of that article because I think it's a really good

569
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,160
How to deaden him a really good

570
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,800
grasp of

571
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,520
extension enhancement of modern testing

572
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,600
He talks about uh, the three S's and the three C's and he wants testers to move

573
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,520
Toward the three C's and away from the three S's

574
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,480
And the three S's so these are the things testers are moving away from we've already talked about first one's a safety net

575
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,860
Stop being the safety net

576
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:18,970
The next one is solo that solo knowledge that that single point of failure again neo

577
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:25,210
I know everything about testing. I know the product only I can make this work moving away from that towards collaboration

578
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,330
And then being static this is holding on with white knuckles be adaptable

579
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:35,850
Embrace change is what we talked about in the very first couple a b testing podcast

580
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:41,370
No, we've actually talked about all three of these in this episode. We have we have because they're all here

581
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:46,090
So anyway, these are this is but it sums up everything we've talked about

582
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:52,570
So yeah, these things move away from those testers move on stop being a safety net stop being a single point of failure

583
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,490
Adapt and change stop holding on and the three C's

584
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,610
We've also talked about coaching

585
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,310
I have coached

586
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,950
developers hundreds now maybe thousands to do better testing

587
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:14,150
Principle seven collaborating working together not making devs cry working with them. We're on the same team

588
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,550
We're trying to make quality software together

589
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,110
Principle four

590
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:21,590
And change which is principle three

591
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,710
Uh, yeah principle three

592
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:30,550
And he says uh, Connor says that testers are often the training wheels for the team

593
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:34,790
Which are like we need to thinking about how can we remove the training wheels?

594
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:40,870
This is really principle seven's about how do we get the training wheels off the team so it can be fully independent?

595
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:47,510
In producing quality software and there's some other really great terms and there it brings up accelerate which is always a way to get to my heart

596
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,110
but

597
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,230
really

598
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:53,350
Fantastic insights. I mean this is somebody who gets it and gets what it means

599
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,390
I mean some people probably look at the principles they go. Oh, yeah, okay

600
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:00,630
And some people look at them and go. Oh, I hate all of these. These are dumb. They're not in fact

601
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,150
someone on uh, linkedin said hey I read these

602
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:09,030
And they're not very modern and they're not about testing either and I know they say that but still

603
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,220
it's like um

604
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,820
What conversation are we having anyway? Uh, connor just just nailed it. He nailed the essence of

605
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:21,300
Of why we think about this stuff and the principles just came it isn't like we decided

606
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,420
Hey, we're gonna write some principles and figure out what they mean

607
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,460
We just tried to capture so the principles

608
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:33,350
God, when did we first start talking about those in the 70s 80s? I mean episode numbers. Do you remember?

609
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:39,750
Uh, maybe it was earlier good. We started going I think 87 was our deep dive. Oh my gosh, so

610
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,790
It's a summary of like everything we have been talking about like what are how can we?

611
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:51,530
Take everything we've been talking about and sum it up into some things that are communicable communicatable

612
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,710
And that's where they came from

613
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,540
All models are wrong. Some are useful. These are helpful

614
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,330
uh, and I think

615
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:03,610
Anything you disagree with look at both sides. Anyway, go ahead brent

616
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,900
no, and and connor even in the

617
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:10,900
the thread

618
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,900
All right, one of the things we talk about here

619
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,980
connor

620
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:22,180
Really has simultaneously represents our content very well and he's actually morphed it into his own

621
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,660
version

622
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,660
that is is

623
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:33,220
Fantastic, right? He's in that same twitter feed. He hashtag healthy discussion, right?

624
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,780
That's that's the whole point. Yeah of this is to encourage

625
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,720
a collaboration even

626
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,160
as

627
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,600
Even on the the principles, right? I was thinking about

628
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,120
Right that same person that you just said when we say it's not about modern it's not about testing

629
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,680
Right. Why did we give this name?

630
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,600
Well the original reason is because it was a particular set of people we wanted to target and that was one of the thoughts

631
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,120
I had on

632
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,400
On the problem nowadays when this came out

633
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,880
We were we were facing a community of testers

634
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:16,710
That for whatever reason saw change was on the wind right and microsoft had gone through it

635
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:22,230
Part of this was to attract the attention of testers and get people to understand

636
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:27,350
No, there is this is not a negative. This is absolutely a positive

637
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,750
Like don't fight this change, you know swim with the current

638
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,230
um

639
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,230
But it does occurred to me

640
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,110
People coming into the test industry

641
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,750
now

642
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,670
who may not

643
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:50,710
Have a view like the drama around these changes around testing that's dramatically gone down

644
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,550
Like the last news report I heard was like salesforce

645
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,320
Dropping all of their testers and that was like five years ago. Yeah

646
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,080
And also worth mentioning and we should really post these somewhere. Maybe i'll put them on modern testing org, but

647
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,680
That'd be a great place ago. We yeah, shut up

648
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,520
We um, I remember do you remember when we kind of rewrote and I wrote them down one thing I posted in our slack

649
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,400
Yes, um the dev the the modern testing principles that don't include

650
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,280
It's about the team not about testing

651
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:28,600
I don't know if they're modern testing principles 2.0 or some other principles, but we did think I mean most of them stayed the same

652
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:35,780
But we did things like change principle 7 2 we expand abilities and know-how across the team understanding

653
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:40,980
This may reduce or or eliminate the need for dedicated specialists, which is true for anything

654
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,420
Like you're gonna hire like give the example from from my work

655
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,460
often teams ask me across unity

656
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:51,960
Hey, we need to hire a dev ops engineers for our team

657
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,720
Can you help me with the job wreck? I go hold on

658
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,720
Why are you hiring a specialist for your team?

659
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,240
I said well, we need to know how to deploy this stuff and blah blah blah

660
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,000
I said we have you build it you run a culture my team

661
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,120
Gives you a good paved road to make that easy and they'll give you everything you need to get it up and running

662
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,720
but

663
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,320
In the long run

664
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:20,600
When you have a specialist you're going to be in trouble like what if they go on vacation and you rely on them for everything

665
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,920
Oh, well, we'll hire two

666
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,960
Okay

667
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,880
Let's let we're gonna need to sit down. This is now going. Yeah

668
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:32,760
But you don't you don't appear to be learning from the speech replace tester with dev ops

669
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,360
It's

670
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,200
And it's the exact same years ago as this behind me for now dev said well

671
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,200
I don't know anything about testing can't figure it out now. They're telling me. I don't know anything about kubernetes

672
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,680
So it's okay. We're gonna teach you it's not that hard

673
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,680
and I

674
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:53,080
Fully believe like we can't scale and give everybody their own little and imagine the chaos that would happen

675
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,720
If I we had 200

676
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:03,320
Embedded dev ops engineers around the company air quote because dev ops is a culture not a role, you know infrastructure people

677
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:10,760
Implementing various flavors and different things and in different ways with no consistency across it would be an absolute mess

678
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:15,960
But specialists you could hire a database specialist a perp or perf specialist

679
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,240
Sometimes you want to do that, but you want a generalizing specialist

680
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,920
so that they're not a bottleneck for the team and

681
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,760
so they

682
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,400
Don't when they work themselves out of a job, which all of us should be doing, you know frequently

683
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,120
They have other things they can do

684
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:34,840
I I think specialists are fantastic

685
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,920
For sort sort of outside in consulting

686
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:45,880
Unless you have a large enough company, it doesn't make sense to to have it in your organization

687
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,600
I've had similar

688
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,160
similar issues like I had a

689
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:53,940
I had a pm

690
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,420
Come to me

691
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:01,620
About a year ago and he checks in every three months to see if i've changed my mind. He's like brit

692
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,900
I am going to get you eight heads

693
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:08,280
I'm like, okay neat

694
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:16,760
right that would tremendously grow my team and tremendously grow the the type of scenarios and impact my team could have

695
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:19,990
why

696
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:21,590
and it's like oh

697
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,550
well, so we have all of this data stuff

698
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,550
and

699
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,710
We want you to use these eight heads to build us a data warehouse

700
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:35,990
And a bunch of power bi dashboards and and data movers

701
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,360
Why?

702
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,920
Why? Because it's too hard for pm to do

703
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:43,490
and I said

704
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,620
I see

705
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,140
Thank you for your offer. Uh, I'm I'm going to kindly reject it

706
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,520
and they're like

707
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,360
Like like they were surprised. They really thought like oh I could get you eight heads like that, dude

708
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,080
And i'm like, yeah, no i'm not building

709
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,920
There's no career for full-time power bi builders in my role

710
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:16,080
Right. I'm just like no like hire a vendor team manage it tell them to do your stuff. Right? Like

711
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,800
Like it's just that simple

712
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,400
now and I said

713
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,440
However, if you want to solve your your actual problem

714
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,600
Right instead of building a data safety net then i'm open to talk

715
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:33,910
and

716
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,550
He of course has clarity and I said your actual problem

717
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,710
is

718
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:42,630
The pm role is changing and you just told me your

719
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,150
Your pm organization doesn't have the basic

720
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:52,630
Skills to thrive in the new world every pm should be able to build their own power bi

721
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,790
report to judge the success of their features

722
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:01,510
Power bi is not that hard and if your pms don't understand the data

723
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:03,670
Then

724
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:07,030
I'm gonna i'm gonna tell you they're producing incomplete features

725
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,750
Yep, specialization bad

726
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,470
Yep. All right, man. I gotta go rest my voice. I've had about all I can take for the day

727
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,580
All right

728
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,660
Oh, maybe in post-production I can

729
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:23,220
Like there's like some fancy filter I can use to fix my voice

730
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,180
Ooh auto tune awesome

731
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,180
No

732
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:30,180
Go please go go

733
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,900
uh, I swear by this

734
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,860
gargle with with salt water and then

735
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,140
And then find some nice honey to

736
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,540
Soak your throat in and there I mean the stuff made by bees

737
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:47,620
But you could choose any version of honey that you would desire. All right, I think

738
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:52,500
Mine comes in a bot my honey. I think it's in a body that says quervo

739
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,420
Okay. Yep

740
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,420
That may work. I'll try some of that

741
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,220
If you if you do enough of that, yes, I can guarantee you the pain will go away

742
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,500
There's no pain. There's absolutely zero pain

743
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:09,410
I feel 100 fine. I just lost my voice a little bit of a cough

744
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,010
Gotcha

745
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:14,930
All right. That is it for this time. We'll see you next time on the next episode of

746
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:19,410
Ba ab testing ba ab testing. Yes

747
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:21,010
Bye

748
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,010
Bye all
