1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,660
Hey, howdy

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,980
From do a podcast sure. All right. Hey everybody gets Alan is Brent and we're here for episode

3
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,020
45 45 of a be testing

4
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:31,410
I was just thinking I thought 45 and just at this moment thought of like the kids listening today won't remember these but 45 records. Oh

5
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,860
Man the records like a CD but it's made of vinyl and they had a big hole in the middle and they played at 45

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,400
revolutions per minute and if you didn't have the freaking adapter

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,320
You couldn't play your 45. Yeah, I have it. I still have adapters. I'm sure you do

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,880
You're much more of an audiophile than I am. Yeah, I still have 45s

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,620
I'm sitting around I have about 700 CDs

10
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,200
Sitting underneath my bed wondering

11
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,500
What I should do with those so I have this I have like this pile of 45s a lot of them are collectibles

12
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,740
He's to get like these collectible import 45s

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,340
But I also have buried in there like a Van Halen dance the night away

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,300
45 that's pretty cool. I

15
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,740
Have all of the Van Halen stuff. That's great up until they

16
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:29,030
Changed to Van Hagar, which I was anti Van Hagar. I don't care Brett. Okay, then. All right then so

17
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,350
Shall we begin on?

18
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,780
our last episode

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,560
There's we don't have a recap because we don't have I don't know about you

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,660
I don't have retention beyond about 15 minutes. So I don't know we talked about last time but it was something around

21
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,940
How to become data-driven and I feel like we got a great start

22
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,500
But that maybe there's more we could talk about so I like to continue that topic if you don't mind

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,500
I've written on the whiteboard

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,780
pew

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,520
Ww. L. Oh, what's your thing means pick up where we left off

26
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,390
You want to start with the second one? No

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,320
Really?

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,320
Okay, cuz I can't it's too early in the morning for me to do the song

29
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,060
Later, that's a teaser

30
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,380
Later

31
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,580
alright, so

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,300
last time last time on episode 44

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,380
shots

34
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:29,960
we covered as Alan just called out how to

35
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,080
begin this journey and we

36
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,800
We addressed it by talking about

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,120
essentially

38
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,200
Leveraging the strengths of your team right now

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,280
beginning the journey and

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,230
We spent a good amount of time

41
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,030
talking around how to kind of clear the way by

42
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,190
connecting with your executive

43
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:00,010
Um

44
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,040
here I

45
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,040
started I am

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,840
Looked over our show notes. I actually relistened to the episode

47
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:17,760
We have lots of great questions and comments up on the slack channel one of the three dot slack calm. Yes

48
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,000
Actually it occurred to me as well we have a

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,240
listener who up on Twitter is very actively

50
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,120
Stating what episode he's up to and he's like up to 24 and

51
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,680
He was asking a whole bunch of questions and I'm like, why don't you just go to the slack channel?

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,130
And I realized oh if he's up on 24, he doesn't know the slack channel exists

53
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,170
Maybe we should add that on the eB testing. It's it's kind of a time paradox

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,570
Thing right it is. Are you giving me web administration tips?

55
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,530
Requests all right, maybe I can do that

56
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,590
I'm taking volunteer webmasters as well

57
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,800
Maybe Percy will sure

58
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,970
alright, so I was thinking about it and

59
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,450
one of the least useful things that I did over the weekend is

60
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Lots of

61
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Catching up on Xbox and those connections hit and it it

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,550
It occurred to me that really what we're sort of talking about is not

63
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,090
Unlike a tech tree from any game you've ever played ever

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,840
where what you're trying to do is

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,170
Master a particular skill and then when you have enough

66
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,790
Experience points enough mastery or experience points right then the next

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,730
Element of the tree opens up in general

68
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,870
Some questions I

69
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,500
Thought about is as you're pursuing

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,400
What exactly are you building? So what I don't mean the product here, but I mean the

71
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,360
the assets that you're putting together to be able to

72
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,930
Do data analysis

73
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,160
That of course leads into what are you're measuring

74
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,960
Another thought you need to think about is where does your team grow?

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,520
its competency next

76
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,060
Right. So let me just recap here. So you have I remember the steps are data oblivious, right? Then date was a data aware

77
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,890
That's the one I added in between there's data oblivious then what happens next data oblivious data aware

78
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,400
We'll go ahead and go with that

79
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,440
Then there's data driven then data centric. Okay, so

80
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,780
One of the techniques I like to help map out my tech tree

81
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
I like that is I

82
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,980
describe my

83
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:11,960
Current state how my team works today my desired state and then I know there's like 150 different paths to get there

84
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
Which is your tech tree? I like that analogy

85
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,760
So could you take a few minutes and describe what is the desired state if you are a data centric team?

86
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,180
Firing on all cylinders. Tell me what that looks like because I think a lot of people have a hard time imagining that

87
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,080
data centric team

88
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
first and foremost

89
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:39,670
Has a dependency on on the data. So the the one high order bit is

90
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,990
People feel like if they don't have the data

91
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,510
They can't move forward

92
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,110
Right. So there is that dependency that you can

93
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,680
You can use to detect

94
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
number two

95
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,240
In a data centric team

96
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,160
Most organizations have lots and lots of data you have

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,460
billing data you have customer data you have operations data you have a

98
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:15,620
Factory data and what I mean by that is how well you're able to ship a new product

99
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:24,320
You'll have all of this data and I'm barely touching on okay, so I have a bunch of data and I'm dependent on it

100
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
You'll have all of this data

101
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,360
Integrated in some fashion such that

102
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:38,260
There's a term called SSBI which stands for self-service bi and what that means is a

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,230
person who

104
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:47,590
doesn't have statistics or data science skills is able to consume the data and

105
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,360
Confidently and competently make 80% of the decisions with that data on their own

106
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,200
Okay, so the data has been integrated has been cure curated and simplified

107
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:09,280
Such that you can light that up so to paraphrase so far again because you use more words than I would

108
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,760
I'm dependent on the data. I have a lot of it and it's

109
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,320
Available in a format that could be consumed by anyone on the team consumed and acted upon. Yeah

110
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
What else is that it?

111
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,760
Confidently as well that because one of the problems with the data is

112
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,740
formulas

113
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,940
and and to tangentialize that a word to

114
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,220
Tangent we've made up words here before why not really we have tons

115
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,140
Now I forgot what I was gonna say

116
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,500
It's Tuesday morning after a long weekend ah and the kids are back in school rough life first world problem. Um

117
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,800
So

118
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,560
The tangent was that's important because I've seen so many over the last 20

119
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,300
Some odd years of being in software people

120
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:07,010
Using what he called confirmation bias look at the data and make it and make it say what they want

121
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:13,970
What they want it to say versus being able to use the data to make actual competent decisions that actually are true. It's like

122
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,410
years ago, I

123
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:24,490
Went to a leadership class and they gave me a definition of empowerment that I'm rather fond of which is

124
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,880
When you empower people

125
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:35,920
You are expressing a confidence in those people to make the same decisions

126
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,840
You would in your absence

127
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Awesome if they had the same

128
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,320
Information okay, so you can think of it here is sort of data empowerment

129
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,920
So you in that world you're setting people up to be able to make the same

130
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,320
analyses as a data science team would in the data science teams absence

131
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,090
So let me modify my paraphrase. So we have a lot of data and I depend on it and

132
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,920
the data is

133
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,800
consumable in such a way that anyone on the team can make

134
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,400
Make similar decisions based on that data. Yes

135
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,420
Anything else to it the the last one that's

136
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,730
The next

137
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,730
Three things that I would say are that are critical number one

138
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:40,600
Generally when you start this journey, you're gonna be working against what's known as cold path data and cold path data means

139
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,840
It takes a while before the data itself

140
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,560
Yep, I get that you kind of back into the how you get there

141
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,760
But I want to I want to make sure I understand what the desired state is. Are we done with the desired state is

142
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,450
near real time

143
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:02,780
real near real time hot path hot path a lot of

144
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,730
Action ability and decision makings is

145
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:14,240
Automated so you have things like machine learning algorithms or you have that's more the how

146
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,020
We can get there

147
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,860
I want to make sure I have a good decision that I can out because I really for me being able to describe this

148
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,380
Desired state of where you want to go and sort of an elevator pitch

149
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:35,580
I think I think any leadership over any change requires being able to articulate exactly where you're going and it's an adaptive problem

150
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,340
Meaning we don't know exactly

151
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,900
How we're going to get there or if or if the actual desired state is going to change

152
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
slightly or more that or

153
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
more dramatically over time

154
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:54,940
But we want to have being able to articulate that goal being able to tell people whether it's an executive for

155
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
bought enough for

156
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Didn't want a drink for

157
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,620
Whether it's anybody on the team just to explain kind of where you're going so

158
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,820
We could talk about I love the idea of warm path hot path cold path

159
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:13,780
I want to talk about those I used one time a Microsoft history called fast path and slow path

160
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,860
But I like the terms warm hot and cold much better. He explained what those are in a minute. Yep

161
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,900
But if I can I have a bunch of data that I depend on or to do our job and everybody on the team has

162
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,540
a way to consume that data in order makes the same decisions no matter who they are and

163
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,600
Those decisions are and then that data that we get is as close to real time as possible

164
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,020
That's a great state to be in yes

165
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:41,180
I rely on this data coming in in real time like I know right away when something's going on and I can make the decision

166
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,660
You can make the decision just down the hall can make the decision

167
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,060
Cindy upstairs to make the same decision because that data is easily consumable and interpretable

168
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,340
The last constraint or the last just when I thought I'd get it nailed you add more crap

169
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,300
There's one more. I said three start when well, you can't count

170
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,280
the last one is

171
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
event driven responses

172
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,520
So a lot of analytics will be when you first start off it will be everything's get pumped to a data store

173
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,960
and

174
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,220
It relies on a human to go in and do queries and say hey

175
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,920
Oh look something happened two weeks ago

176
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Here in this world not only do you have?

177
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,440
NRT or hot path, but you're going to have

178
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,160
Event driven

179
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
situations where

180
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Customer just did this and that kicked off on its own a whole new analytics

181
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,460
Path I'm gonna put that in the close to real-time umbrella fair enough

182
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:55,300
So I have to modify and once again try and restate my desired stuff and you did a very good job

183
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,660
Okay

184
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,460
No, I get and and what the things we're doing here and what I do in branch starts talking about either

185
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,820
One he's talking about stuff. I don't fully understand or two. He just doesn't make any sense regardless

186
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,540
I try and paraphrase parrot it back to him. So I'm going to make sure I understand things good technique to use

187
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sure all the all the three know how to do this

188
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:20,980
But you kind of make sure I'm in the right ballpark and it's it's useful for the three as well since

189
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,260
They're at least two days delayed on their ability to ask me questions

190
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,780
Are you making fun of my ability to get the podcast edited and out?

191
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,880
No, maybe sometimes do sometimes a whole week

192
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:43,260
All right, it depends how much it depends on how much of your idiot stuff and coughing I

193
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,940
Have to edit out. So what Alan just walked through?

194
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,750
Seems like 10 minutes ago is

195
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:59,320
How do you know if when you've got there we've already established Brent can't tell time the oh

196
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,400
That was before knowing the North Star knowing the North Star can be

197
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,640
helpful

198
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,960
I don't like the term North Star. I'm gonna stick with desired state. I like current state desired state path

199
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,080
I'm just gonna pick on everything you say for while till I feel better about myself

200
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,010
That shouldn't take long

201
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,170
Might take a long long time

202
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,170
So you're trying to understand what do we desired state, okay

203
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,810
And that frames it up nicely

204
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,790
One of the things from my experience though that if you do

205
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,970
in I would say 70% of the time

206
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,530
expressing the full richness of the desired state

207
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:54,880
When you are in a data oblivious team is a bozo bit flip flipping moment

208
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,080
That is

209
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,080
So far out there

210
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:07,570
People can't can't really visualize how to get there from where they are at

211
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,840
So I recommend a strategy

212
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,520
Around hey those who are the leaders who are pulling together this this strategy

213
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,120
don't go so far out of the box that you lose the attention of

214
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,400
What you hope to be your future customers

215
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,440
Instead do around the box thinking which is

216
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Kind of what we've been talking about. It's

217
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,930
Establish where you are today and what is the next useful step?

218
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,400
That moves towards this this long-term

219
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:53,440
Direction and that's that's how my exercise of current state desired state works is you don't it's always a

220
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
multi-step

221
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:02,160
Path to get from current to desired and desired changes as you go along the way which isn't to say if people ask you

222
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,120
What's what's your desired state and I am totally okay if I give them an answer and they look at me like I have two heads

223
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,440
Right because I can move them gradually in that direction. I've done this before and they get there and they go, holy

224
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:20,110
Heck the other thing to to assure them is

225
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,290
that

226
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:29,410
They are not going to get their value only once you've achieved that dire desired state

227
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,370
You're sure you have to get value along the way. Otherwise, you can't they won't continue the journey with you, right?

228
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,730
Alright, so you brought up cold path warm path hot path. Do you want to go into that now?

229
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:48,010
Sure, do you so yes for our look for the three should we just tell each each of them get one cold path warm path hot?

230
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,290
No, so what do you mean by cold path rent?

231
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,850
cold path data

232
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:59,460
is the easiest way to qualify it is it is a a

233
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
ton of data

234
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,120
And because it is a ton of data

235
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,920
It gets transmitted from your system into

236
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,480
this final or this

237
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,520
Final destination where people can use it

238
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,600
So we have a big

239
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,920
Data store that we've made in Microsoft for years

240
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,840
But you can think of a lot of people will use

241
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,600
Hadoop or elastic log search solutions or Azure data lake or Azure data lake

242
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,840
I get yeah, I guess there's an opportunity for us to

243
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,360
Hock our own wares

244
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,700
So basically some sort of massive storage where stuff sits for a while. Yeah a large data warehouse say based off of

245
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:56,820
SQL or an oracle type solution. Okay, so when when the data gets from your product into those

246
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,020
Storage locations and it's a large amount of data

247
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,940
That's typically called path and it's called cold path because by the time you can use it

248
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,700
The the data is multiple days old

249
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,860
Okay, a bunch again to paraphrase a bunch of data shoved into some big storage solution

250
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,380
Yep, where it sits for a while and becomes cold hot path is

251
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:29,810
The the opposite of cold path in its so the data comes from the big storage thing and gets no

252
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,770
No, not quite that opposite hot path is a small amount of data

253
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,800
that is

254
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,080
That lands in its store very quickly usually within

255
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,800
Five minutes or less and I would hope even faster some of those things are like site availability

256
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Yes

257
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,010
The

258
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,090
It isn't very rich

259
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,580
But it can tell you things like for example in Azure

260
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,900
We one of our big hot path

261
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,820
Signals is VM up or down

262
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:15,850
It's basically a list of its metrics in our team that we need to act on immediately. Yes

263
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:23,610
That's not everything you can measure it's it's for us. It's mainly things around site performance and site availability

264
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,370
now on warm path

265
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,250
there is

266
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:34,650
Of these names warm path is where there's sort of the semantic religious war

267
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,630
Now I also I'm blown away

268
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,270
There is something in software that has become a semantic religious war. Yeah, I know well just a minute

269
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,090
Okay, go on. Yeah

270
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,850
Well, I cannot represent

271
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,810
the other point of view because I

272
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:03,690
Because it's wrong and I semantically and religiously disagree with it, right? I I don't I don't even pay attention to it

273
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:13,400
So warm path is essentially when you mix cold and hot just like in my tub with my rubber ducky, right?

274
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:21,460
So in the data path there's these there's there's generally two types of data ones known as

275
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,660
Dimensional data and another one known as fact data fact data

276
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,690
is essentially

277
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,210
Transaction information this event occurred on this time

278
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,850
This VM was up this VM went down that sort of thing. Okay

279
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,190
Dimensional data is the metadata

280
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:47,180
So for example, which customer owns this VM? Okay

281
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,700
So a a

282
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,380
Strategy with with warm path data is essentially you reuse your hot path store and

283
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:03,930
You have cold path updates of the metadata such that you can then join these things together

284
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,890
And have a fairly good confidence

285
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,310
Of

286
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:18,630
Building new insights, for example, if you wanted to in my situation if I wanted to know which customers were down in near real time as

287
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,280
Long as the the customer didn't sign up in the last two days. I can do that

288
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,520
And a lot of times that's a that's a valuable and a reasonable miss

289
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,120
Okay. Okay

290
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,120
All right, so and and that's probably fair is cold path definite definition we can all agree with

291
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Hot path we grew it as well

292
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,310
Warm path is something in the middle. It depends on right? Hey one. So that's fine

293
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:57,770
Well, that's true with water as well. If I might digress cuz like what maybe warm to me may feel cool or hot to you

294
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,870
Yes, the the

295
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,800
You know what one of the things I say we can solve this

296
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,640
When we're done here, let's take a shower together

297
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,870
We'll see we'll see what how as long as the check clears first Alan. I'm okay with that

298
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,230
There's no check. There's no check

299
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:23,690
Our relationship is based on nothing but trust

300
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,060
Brent is frantically trying to look at his notes and get back on track

301
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,480
It's my job to not let it be that easy for him. Yeah

302
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,610
so another way of thinking of

303
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:42,970
I don't know how to incorporate data awareness, but when we talked about data oblivious

304
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,720
Data driven and then data centric

305
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,760
There's another terminology they think is a good synonyms for this one. So that oblivious

306
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,040
It's you're driving the business off of intelligent or off the intuition

307
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,370
that adriven you're dividing or driving it off of intelligence and

308
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
data centric off of

309
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,420
Smartness now define smartness. I was about to say

310
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,020
Several folks will say hey isn't intelligence and smart

311
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:23,820
Synonyms no in in the data in the in the data analytics world. They are not synonyms. They might be in a dictionary

312
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
They are not here. So

313
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,680
Intelligence is you can think of it's you can think about the difference this sort of book smart versus Street

314
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,240
That's exactly what I was thinking is the difference there

315
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,040
So when you have an intelligent system, you're basically book smart you you are

316
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,360
You now have the data where where you are able to confidently

317
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,240
Express what is happening and to some degree express why it's happening

318
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,300
When you're in when you're in the world of

319
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,080
smart

320
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,390
You have able you have been able to filter out which of those

321
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,390
Intelligence aspects you generated

322
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,830
You can automate and

323
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,770
drive action with

324
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,610
so

325
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:15,650
intuition

326
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:22,400
You don't they don't even have the data in an intelligence phase. You've got gain a mastery of

327
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,280
Curating the data

328
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:31,400
but you don't really know which of these data feeds really helps to drive the business or

329
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,630
any

330
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:40,070
customer set sense within the business and then when you're in a world of

331
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:43,870
Smartness you not only know which ones drive the business

332
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,790
But you've you've begun to leverage that data and automate that data

333
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,910
So let me moving the people aspect of there's an interesting

334
00:25:53,590 --> 00:26:00,910
I'll paraphrase but this time in with an interesting maybe insight maybe stupid comment sometimes hard to tell the difference but in

335
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:08,630
The first step is intuition only and then you're sort of you swing the pendulum all the way and it's all just like data only and

336
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,910
Smartness this street smartness comes from being able to combine intuition with that data

337
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,330
Yes

338
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:18,330
with and

339
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,170
Connect it to validated outcomes

340
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,530
Like you've but to me that's that's connection of intuition and hard data

341
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,550
No, you so you can connect intuition with hard data. Yes, that's intelligence, but then connecting it

342
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,830
to

343
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,450
proof

344
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,950
That responding to intelligence

345
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:43,930
Actually moves things forward one of the biggest challenges

346
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,570
there are there are

347
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:53,430
The two biggest challenges that I've encountered from data science teams themselves

348
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,930
Number one, I have produced

349
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,580
World-class brilliant insights and no one is using it

350
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,110
Okay, and this is this is a common phenomenon

351
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:15,710
People will leave their data science team because of this and the second one is all I do is reports

352
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,180
Right. So the the value proposition

353
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,780
To get to smartness is you got to get people to use it if they're not using it

354
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:34,890
Then you're in the wrong path. I agree and that usage criteria

355
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,490
If people are asking you for a lot of reports and they are

356
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,370
And you're generating a lot of insights

357
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:50,190
You're in the intelligence phase and you're working through how to get to smart a lot of data scientists will come out of school

358
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:56,990
For example, and they've been told by their professors. Oh when you join a data science team, it's all about ML

359
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,260
and it can be

360
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,770
That because we're in a phase in the worldwide where

361
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:13,290
Where there's sort of a shortage of data science teams and a lot of organizations are trying to build this up

362
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:20,590
Most teams aren't at most companies aren't fully at the smart phase. There are a whole bunch of them but most are so I see

363
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,260
and perhaps I

364
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,340
Think you'll agree with me

365
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,660
Although he may be offside of this and the data data science fairly new profession people come out of school with

366
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,540
degrees that didn't even exist a while back there used to be called just statisticians or and

367
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:41,460
But being able to apply what they do to provide value to an organization is critical, but I've interviewed

368
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,860
I was gonna say hundreds maybe thousands

369
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:53,100
But definitely hundreds and hundreds of people at Microsoft from very good universities with very impressive degrees

370
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,260
And these people were all intelligent in your definition

371
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:03,440
But not but not I shouldn't say all of them many of them were in very very intelligent, but not very smart

372
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,500
this is a good parallel for you to me with data science software developers who

373
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,290
Wrote papers on algorithms, but actually couldn't figure out how to apply them

374
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:17,290
I'm not talking about making the right code at the whiteboard just talking through like

375
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:21,490
How do you think through solving a problem with code was something?

376
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:28,130
Just they couldn't make the connection and the same thing with I see software testers

377
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:33,010
Who can't eat maybe they have certifications or whatever they've they'd know a lot of facts

378
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,770
They know to bring up things like boundaries and performance and but they don't

379
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,360
Know how to apply those things to actually test something. Well, there's a connection that has to happen to be successful between

380
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:52,880
This background these tools you have and being able to actually apply them in a meaningful way

381
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,640
And that's true with any knowledge work

382
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,720
but there's that connection and then data science is sort of on the edge of the same place and other professions have been where you

383
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,200
People have this background like you should be able to do this, but you're just not being successful at it

384
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:12,640
You're not crossing that bridge, but I've studied machine learning and I know how to use our but there's a leap from there to actually

385
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,710
Doing the work that provides value to your org

386
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,260
Moving something by by using that knowledge

387
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
right now the

388
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,500
The other thing that's just as an aside

389
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:33,190
most of the people that I interview for a data science position are PhDs and

390
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:40,470
Professional students. Yeah, there's there is a challenge with with those folks

391
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,090
I

392
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,850
Don't know if you were aware. I learned this just in the last year

393
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,490
that most

394
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:53,330
PhDs are encouraged by

395
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:59,500
say their prior sponsors to stay in academia and

396
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,280
heavily encouraged it's almost viewed as a

397
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,260
Desertion if you go into industry, so there's a big discussion between academia and industry

398
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,680
am

399
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:19,320
Academia is has a lot of value. I'm on the I talked about this a lot. I'm on the board for

400
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,720
the Alumni Board for my university's School of Arts and Humanities, which is a

401
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,640
Different side it's not in the computer science software world computer science side of the world

402
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,320
but one of the things we discuss a lot is

403
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,360
the ability to

404
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,920
Basically just talk about before the ability to apply

405
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:45,720
critical thinking to knowledge work versus just the thing on the theoretical side

406
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,360
Versus the practical side and we need people to bridge that yes, we do the academia is

407
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,720
Really good at pushing the edge

408
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:04,410
They have a whole engine around not only masters but

409
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,530
PhD students

410
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,050
Looking at the current body of research and creating new

411
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:17,690
Original work in the general way that you create a new original work is you look to see

412
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:26,600
Where there's unanswered unanswered open questions this this leads them to to push forward on the theory

413
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,030
And so some of these folks come in and they've spent the better part of the last eight years

414
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:39,630
With that is their personal culture and so when they come into industry

415
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,780
I

416
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:45,500
Spend a lot of time looking through

417
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,060
great like

418
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,380
Here's one here's

419
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,780
50% of my

420
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,860
interview

421
00:32:53,860 --> 00:33:02,960
In one single question great. How can I use that? That's fantastic. How can I use that? Okay, and

422
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:10,140
They struggle with that. Yeah, at least I want to get back on track here, but at least once a year

423
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,580
there's a PhD paper on

424
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,230
someone who solved the problem of making bug-free software and they haven't

425
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,540
some method whether it's an analysis tool or a new programming language that

426
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,540
eliminates the

427
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,080
functional bugs from their software, but

428
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,160
They're just oblivious to the fact that the software

429
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,320
They're describing in their paper is nothing anyone would want to use and we've talked about where quality comes from

430
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,640
People wanting to use the software

431
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,040
Either it has bugs not quality is value and you can make a bug-free program that has no value

432
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,640
therefore no quality

433
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,040
The other thing too though

434
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,860
Because when you say they want to use there's an element of proactivity the nice thing with

435
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,540
with the data space is

436
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,690
As you build up the assets and as you are working towards

437
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,160
making

438
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,920
your analyses more truthful

439
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,680
and

440
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:17,680
simpler

441
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,440
Then whether or not they want to use it if you socialize it correctly

442
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,320
It becomes more actionable and you can essentially force their hand on using it

443
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:34,230
most people when you have when they have a belief like

444
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,110
By shipping this feature. We will grow customer engagement by

445
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,750
Blah blah blah if you can show them the data

446
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,460
That says that does not appear to be true

447
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:53,260
Data

448
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,700
Well-articulated

449
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,700
defeats intuition

450
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,820
Almost all of the time correct

451
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
So let me let me do a couple things

452
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:07,300
First and foremost we talked about how do you know when you get to data centric?

453
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,610
when you get to data the way, you know you get to data driven is

454
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,890
You are doing a lot of what's known in the statistical world as

455
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:23,890
Hypothesis testing and what a hypothesis test is is you you've trained people to

456
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:29,170
Date their beliefs in the form of a sentence

457
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,120
So much like what I just said

458
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,310
this feature will increase customer engagement by

459
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,420
50%

460
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,460
then

461
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,460
So the PM or whoever is working on it will continue on building their features

462
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:54,700
But then they're gonna work with you to figure out. Okay, what's the data that needs to be done or

463
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,420
Generated in order to prove or disprove

464
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,520
that hypothesis, okay, this is different than say the

465
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,520
Gqm model that test was informed as

466
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:11,000
As the brilliant way of going years ago

467
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,950
Go question metric by the correct silly what I want to do

468
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,590
I guess in the remaining minutes is I want to walk through

469
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:27,620
Sort of the phases since we're talking about how do you know when you got there? I want to walk through there is jog through

470
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,460
jog through

471
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,180
Gallop through

472
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,380
the phases of a data analytics maturity

473
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:43,160
Now here I'm gonna talk about abstract stuff again the principles we talked about last time around

474
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,980
starting with what you have and

475
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,180
Building from that solidifying that then build again is the right approach here

476
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,460
Don't swing all the way over to any sort of these North stars

477
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:02,460
So the first phase is what's known as measure am

478
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,250
in

479
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,250
when you're in the measurement phase

480
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:11,640
Really what you are able to do is answer what questions?

481
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,360
What what feature is the most popular exactly what customer?

482
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,400
pays us the most

483
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,840
what

484
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
useful feature is

485
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
And come back combinations of those

486
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,100
One of the things a tool

487
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:40,100
That I've used in when we're in this phase. I call it real and it's an acronym

488
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,420
What it stands for is reliability engagement availability latency

489
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:51,980
So if you can pull together an asset that measures those four things

490
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,700
it generally isn't a challenge to

491
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:02,240
Get dev bought in and it also isn't a challenge to

492
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Provide useful value

493
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,970
so

494
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:13,370
You're using existing data. You're being reactive. You're not being proactive

495
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,810
You're basically saying hey dev that feature you shipped yesterday

496
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:20,610
Here's what the the real report shows

497
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,330
our reliability

498
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,450
reliability

499
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:30,530
Engagement engagement availability and latency. What's the difference between reliability and availability?

500
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:37,450
Let me go through them all. Okay reliability is a measure of the frequency in which

501
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,090
failures occur. Okay, okay

502
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,320
Engagement how often it's being used is

503
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:51,000
Yeah, it's like how many people so engagement is a measure of the priority of this path. Okay. Okay

504
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,560
so if whether it's used or not

505
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,720
Availability so if reliability is a measure of the frequency in which things are occurring

506
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,720
Availability is a measure of the consequence of failures. Got it

507
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:09,040
So the way you measure is it just an API failure or the site become completely unresponsive?

508
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:14,080
The typically the way you measure availability will be by downtime

509
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,690
Okay, this failure occurred

510
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:25,810
These these machines were damn down for two hours or two days. Okay, and then latency is essentially

511
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:33,900
A measure of the success path. Hey when everything's working. Is it zippy or is it painfully slow?

512
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,260
Yeah, so these four things together

513
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,240
really useful

514
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,190
then the biggest thing you can do in the measure phase is

515
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:51,350
automate this the visualization of this data end to end such that

516
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,680
whoever using it typically developers don't have to come to you and

517
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,680
As for this report you just you've strung it together you've worked through it you've you've

518
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:11,560
Talked with devs and found out that this is fact the truth. They began to leverage it. Okay

519
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,000
The next phase now great you can answer what questions

520
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,390
The next thing is that people will start ask want wanting to diagnose

521
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,890
How to fix that?

522
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,270
So you have you have all of these

523
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:36,810
Services, they're all failing dev wants to know what's the pattern? So you being able to drill down your aggregates and diagnose

524
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,230
It is the next one

525
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:45,610
Here you want to be able to automate drilled in an exploration in that context and

526
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,810
But your goal is to enable human beings

527
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:53,120
to do the root cause analysis

528
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,530
You do want to automate what's known as the Pareto order?

529
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,930
So as you work through debt with dev to figure out how to automate

530
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,450
This process and how they investigate it

531
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:14,930
You're gonna learn new knowledge and you'll learn that they have common patterns and then you can automate the Pareto order of the impact

532
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,010
You now have the data so you can create a new

533
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,530
report that that says

534
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,770
These are the things that should be worked on next and that's extremely valuable

535
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:32,150
The next phase is known as predict and optimize. So now you have all of this data

536
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,230
You you now want to be able to not react

537
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,320
But how do you know when you're about to encounter a reliability problem?

538
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,950
Generally, there's other signals perf counters

539
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,720
Traffic

540
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,200
Changes that you can use to sort of predict these outcomes

541
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
This enables you to answer

542
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,720
Not only why questions very confidently, but also what if questions so you begin to be able to

543
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,040
Predict the future

544
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,440
Okay

545
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,320
Predicting things is hard, especially about the future and with the what if questions you now are able to

546
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,480
address

547
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,060
Hey given two choices of the next steps, which choice should I take? Okay good and the next step which is there

548
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,480
How many more are there three more?

549
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,280
operationalize and integrate

550
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,920
But this means is data is easily integrated across all teams

551
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,760
and

552
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,360
here we're

553
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,360
decisions can be made on

554
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,720
Multiple different fronts as you go through this though

555
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,960
I started off talking about with quality of service the type of data that that

556
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,240
Us as testers are accustomed to why do things fail bugs, right?

557
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,880
Here between then and now you're gonna want to incorporate customer and business data. I

558
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,300
Will tell you nothing drives an

559
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:04,850
Action with a developer

560
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:12,690
Better than the ability to file a bug and say this bug cost the business this amount of money and be able to state it

561
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,250
with confidence

562
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:20,610
Then after that once the data is operationalized and integrated then you'll start getting into

563
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,810
What's known as automated decision-making?

564
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,810
This is the NRT stuff that we're talking about event driven decisions

565
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:34,210
Plugging the ml instead of the ml being something that drives decisions with humans

566
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:41,730
You plug the ml into a product right for example just to interject even though we're real short on time is that right now?

567
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:50,430
Our product gets released through rings of deployment pretty common and that is always a human decision at this point

568
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:57,760
It combined with data. Yep, but that could very well and I want it to be purely automated based on data and then the very last

569
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,690
step is

570
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,860
A lot of people you will hear them talking about data democratization

571
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,420
No, I don't hear a lot of people talking about that. Okay, a lot of people in my neck of the woods

572
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,420
Okay, we're data democratize

573
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,420
Whatevs and this is

574
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:21,220
Essentially meaning the data that comes from the service. It's democratized anyone can easily use it. It's a key part to the

575
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,780
operationalizing integration step

576
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:31,700
Like I want to I'm gonna add a survey to the slack channel and ask how many of you use the term or hear the term

577
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,980
data democratization in your daily work

578
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:36,220
the last phase

579
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,600
Which is known as transform is around knowledge democratization

580
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:45,940
So we talked about the difference between intelligence and smart you need to have data democratization

581
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,780
in order to reach the intelligence

582
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:53,260
When you're smart is you now have

583
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,940
Curated assets that allows you to democratize the knowledge gained

584
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:07,840
Does that make sense? It does make sense is democratization too big of a word for you. Not too big for me. Okay, and then

585
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:16,120
Hey, we just got just a minute left, but I want to make sure we cover one item as teased earlier from the mailbag

586
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,700
We

587
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,060
Got a question from Michael Rocha. He asks what?

588
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,020
resources articles white papers

589
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,940
exist on data driven testing

590
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:36,550
Unfortunately simple question and unfortunately I have a simple answer

591
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,990
I'm sure they exist. There's none of them that I'm aware of

592
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:48,680
But if I were to begin looking at this I would look into the concept of testing in production

593
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:57,240
Just search this just do I would say being in some good. I would do some Bing in on

594
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,880
effective means of

595
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,080
for testing in production

596
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,400
that we've

597
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,480
We've talked in the past the testing and production does not mean you move your test cases to the cloud

598
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,200
It's the testing and production done right is heavily driven off of data emitted from the product

599
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:21,560
That's where I would start the stuff we talked about in episode 44 is a bit different

600
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,920
It's sort of testing in production when you don't have production

601
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:34,040
Got it. Okay. There's our episode. There it is. Hey everybody. Don't forget to re-swizzle your thing about

602
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,300
Or whatever Jim Moore had us say. Oh, right. It's a little bit different

603
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,480
Oh right in in is a

604
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:49,890
Is star is the the star promo code still active should we do a reminder of this sure you can go?

605
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:55,090
Do if you go to the star to register you can use the code a be testing and get two to two hundred dollars off

606
00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:01,650
All right, then. All right. Hey everybody. I'm still Alan barely and I am confidently Brent
