Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:17,940
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,180
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hello Brent how are you

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:30,080
today I'm doing nifty and swell that's great you that's great welcome to

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,440
another episode of AV testing where we get together and we talk about nothing

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:44,100
at all how in the effin world do we get to 200 it's our 214 215 I don't even know

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:52,510
I'll count it off later it's a big number we we why do people listen to us this is

8
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,790
215 we are we're basically useless you could you could get a better conversation

9
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,590
just sitting in one of the restaurants near Microsoft actually people go to the

10
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:09,640
office anymore what's the what's the work situation there oh dude dude dude dude

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:21,700
yeah I went to an off-site on Wednesday was it at Microsoft it was but all of us

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,180
work it was a different building so it was off our normal site but there were

13
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:37,180
people there and we had like a lunch breakout and use the big projector and

14
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,900
talked and laughed and I'm like whoa and you talked about things that weren't

15
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,180
about work sometimes too huh yeah yeah all that stuff that never happens in

16
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,500
their moat role but what's the basic requirement there at Microsoft they ask

17
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,220
people to go to the office is it just pure hybrid go whenever you want is it

18
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,500
is it you'll come to the office couple times a week like what's the latest

19
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,550
there is such instructions the instructions okay let me know when you're

20
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:22,700
done working that out done okay okay you with manage manager permission you can

21
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:33,610
self-elect to do any degree of hybrid between zero and a hundred percent okay

22
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:43,100
okay and I have not met a manager but I assume there's certain there's certain

23
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,620
places at Microsoft where obviously for example if you are one of the folks in

24
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,940
the data center you probably can't do that remotely too many times probably

25
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,300
not right for the most part I'm guessing if there's a manager just being a jerk

26
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,220
and making their employees come to work with they don't need to those employees

27
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:12,810
are gonna go find the new manager they'll probably try this is the

28
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,250
internal job like it and for in the wayback machine our internal career

29
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,810
started Microsoft used to have like a thousand jobs any one time you can go

30
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,530
apply for across the company is that that getting less now with the it is

31
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,610
cuts and everything it is right with the with the cuts that we just went

32
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,290
through right yeah that's tailored back but to finish you answer your question the

33
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:44,860
only the only other issue is at Microsoft we have two types of space here

34
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,760
I'm not talking about office or open space but it's designated or

35
00:03:50,760 --> 00:04:04,600
undesolated mm-hmm and you have to work from work at least three business days a

36
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:12,900
week to to acquire and maintain a designated space that seems fair yeah

37
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,340
that seems like a fair thing if I'm going that often I would want a space

38
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,580
but if I'm just hopping in once in a while I just need a place to sit down

39
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:25,210
and plug in and hang out and I guess it's not free food it's a weird world

40
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:30,410
it's just weird so I'm glad I think that's a good way to work I had a

41
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,330
conversation this morning with someone in HR because we have I'm not gonna go

42
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,150
into the details mm-hmm on whether someone new to the junior member new to

43
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,510
the team would have to go to work every day or be remote and if we need to

44
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:52,400
relocate them and my whole org is remote and if they want to go to an

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,760
office they can and I have managers that can make sure they go to the office to

46
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:03,400
meet them but it's just it is weird and probably similar I guess Satya he gets

47
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,080
it he's an engineering leader it's I live in a world where I'm in a fully

48
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,280
remote org in a company that does not embrace remote work so you get to a

49
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,440
certain level up up the management chain and it's in the office five days a week

50
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,590
as the is the mandate or three days a week I guess would be probably more more

51
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,010
often so it's yeah yeah of course I live nowhere near an office so that would be

52
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:35,610
a tough commute for me I could go to a Comcast office in Seattle there's I know

53
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,570
of rent in office type places and there's one of them up in Everett I

54
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,010
think there's a ton in Seattle there's a ton of and I think I've shared this

55
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:51,490
business idea on the podcast before I would actually love to leave my house

56
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,820
sometimes to work I think back when we had an NBC News office downtown I went

57
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:02,960
there a couple times a week or once a week for a while it was fun just to go

58
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,260
to an office even though there's nobody there even though I didn't and nobody I

59
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,340
work with is there for sure in all the empty office spaces in I'll just pick on

60
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:20,470
Seattle but in these towns I would not only like more shared workspaces again

61
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,030
not having a dedicated desk place I can go plug in somewhere and just do my work

62
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,870
have a have some meeting rooms that could pop into for meetings but without

63
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,830
paying the full monthly rent rather than pay the full monthly rent of

64
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,830
something like we work or any of the other various clones of that what I

65
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:47,370
would do to to ensure occupancy and get breadth of people coming in is just go

66
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,690
to all the companies that have a presence in the area or not go to every

67
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:57,400
corporation and sell like here are by a thousand day passes for the company and

68
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,960
you could dole these out to employees who wanted to wanted an office to go to

69
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,720
just to get like me to get out of the house or something or somebody else is

70
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,160
doing like whatever wants to go work from an office for a while they're not

71
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,880
sitting with people they're working with but they're sitting with other humans and

72
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,040
getting some of that social interaction that's just missing from so

73
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,480
many people with remote work and again you have to do some governance to make

74
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,040
sure not everybody's using their passes on the same day but I think if you did

75
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,240
it wide enough it would even out and maybe you have to get a reservation in

76
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,840
the middle of the week they're gonna they're gonna fill up faster than Monday

77
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,560
or Friday because they like take those days off or two days off to work from

78
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,290
home those days but I want to solve the problem of the empty office buildings

79
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:44,250
and getting some money going in there but do it in a way that doesn't lock people

80
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:49,370
into a huge outlet like I can't afford to go pay even more of the local small

81
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,400
places for co-working space it just doesn't make any sense I'm not bringing it

82
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,200
just doesn't make any sense at all and I don't want to go to the office very

83
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,840
often but some days some days I like to get out of the house and work I'd

84
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,120
like to I like there for being an option that work at NBC here's here's 10 10 day

85
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
passes to use over the next you know the quarter that'd be great I would I would

86
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,320
use them it to me it would make sense as sort of like a mental health benefit

87
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,640
type of thing right that the thing like the thing I was really excited about

88
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:31,220
about the off-site is number one hey people okay but number two hey people

89
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,850
having a conversation around things I care about all right and I'm networking

90
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:44,770
I'm simultaneously socializing networking and getting shit done and and that

91
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:51,740
killing of multiple birds with one stone really appeals to me yeah let me

92
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,620
talk about something I've done remotely you can get there too there's a sense of

93
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:59,220
self-accountability you get when you're in an office around other people a bunch

94
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:06,370
of stuff I want to get done there is a a significant amount of

95
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:12,500
administrative that's part of my job whether it's submitting contracts or or

96
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,280
filling out forms for vendors it's a lot of stuff I'd rather not do in a

97
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,620
million years also nothing I can really delegate unfortunately so I need to

98
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,980
just force myself to do that stuff one way I've done that in the past remotely

99
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:33,860
is for a while my leadership team and I we set up like a twice a week I can't

100
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,940
remember what we called it just an hour call we did a slack huddle cuz they're

101
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,780
easier and team sucks even though I worked on it ten years ago we just did

102
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,220
a slack huddle where we're on the call we were muted but we kind of all just

103
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,140
did a quick little dump of what we're gonna work on for the next hour and

104
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,090
there was no accountability from others but it kicked in that self-accountability

105
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,970
I could say okay I'm gonna do expense report approvals and get these three

106
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,760
contracts into our tool and it would by committing to my peers or my team that I

107
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,120
was going to do that I would sit down and work on that and crank that out and

108
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,520
get it done and it felt good to get it done everybody else had similar stuff

109
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,040
they wanted to do I'm just kind of hung out in a quiet study hall remotely

110
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,600
now if I go to an office even with people I don't know the fact of me

111
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,700
going there I'm like honestly in my if I'm at home I'm working from my kitchen

112
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,580
I got man I have to do expense reports I think I'm gonna go make some coffee

113
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:35,460
first and then maybe a sandwich and then I'm gonna pet the dog and then I'm

114
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,340
gonna go sit there and look at it again and go you know I'm sure there's

115
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,100
some email that needs to be read and deleted first like I don't I don't have

116
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:52,220
the type of things I hate it's like for me I can't think with all those dirty

117
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,300
dishes in the sink right this house is a mess like how am I gonna efficiently get

118
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,980
this there's something to that though yeah yeah I go I I will do these expense

119
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,300
reports as soon as I wipe off the counters and scrub the sink yeah so I

120
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,560
think getting out and again sometimes I can do it but sometimes it's that it's

121
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,400
not like I don't get the work done from home but sometimes I just need to get out

122
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,680
for like I said it's a mental health thing so I'm not sure how it's gonna work

123
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,680
out long run I think some people can work really well efficiently long term

124
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,600
remotely I think I'm pretty close to that but I'm not that I need to like just

125
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,240
sometimes I go to a coffee shop and get a cup of coffee it's loud and I

126
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,640
can't do meetings from there but I can kind of focus and get stuff done

127
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,320
because I'm not distracted by anything around you know one thing that I have

128
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:51,830
done in the past that's in alignment it's like okay I need to focus I want to be

129
00:11:51,830 --> 00:12:00,970
near people but it's you know the stuff I don't want to do right so I have to

130
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:09,300
find a dish a a distraction free environment right and and because I am

131
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,340
really clever like I can find ways to procrastinate the thing that I have to

132
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:23,260
do really well yeah a secret I've learned is essentially a public library

133
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:31,430
like I will often go to like the Bellevue library and nowadays it's well the last

134
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,910
time we went there after Covid like friggin ghost town just like everything

135
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,990
else that's a good idea just getting out it's kind of a free long enough to do

136
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:46,830
meetings because it's kind of a free office space I've done really well my

137
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,630
kid took a motorcycle safety class a month or two ago and it was just far

138
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,750
enough away that I didn't want to drive home so I just kind of hung out but I

139
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:04,230
would coffee shop didn't work I found I actually did most my work from the car

140
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,900
just headed to my phone just there's nothing else to do I wasn't distracted I

141
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,400
could just do the work anyway interesting ideas I think everybody some

142
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,400
people want to go to the office every day some people never want to go to an

143
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:23,160
office I think there's a spectrum I live like 95% on the on the remote side

144
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,670
but sometimes and maybe I satisfy that itch the times I do go to the office to

145
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,990
work like I go to New York or LA for a week but it's it's a different vibe

146
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,230
sitting at a desk not that I'm not sitting at a desk right now but this

147
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,230
no you are this desk is filled with my crap I want some random desk with

148
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,150
nothing but a coffee cup on it no there's another problem too right at the

149
00:13:51,150 --> 00:14:00,460
rate the more and more it's hard to belt or hard to how do I used to say this

150
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:08,040
when COVID happened right I end up amongst multiple different reasons but I

151
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,600
ended up going to work the entire time during COVID because number one work

152
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,680
allowed me to do so of various other reasons but one of the things that I

153
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:31,280
immediately recognized that I missed was the the the commute the time I spent

154
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,400
yeah thinking about what I was going to do and then and then retrospecting on

155
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:44,460
the way back yeah I fully agree that was it's that's a transition time yeah when

156
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:49,260
I first started course now at Unity is different because there was never the

157
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,540
org was not remote there were offices but I was my team was in 17 different

158
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,100
countries so it was always remote but what I found I in not going to the

159
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,640
office I and I lost this somewhere along the way but I had a pretty steady

160
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,900
routine in the morning that would transition me from sleepy time to work

161
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,980
time and especially given my days started at 6 a.m. most mornings I would

162
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,570
you know I would I would not get up it I could not function in that 6 o'clock

163
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,090
meeting if I got up at 545 I would have to get up about 515 530 at the latest

164
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:31,410
kind of be awake and around and try and you know do the wordle or something to

165
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,410
get mentally sharp and then I could hit that 6 o'clock meeting with the ground

166
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,410
running there was always even though I wasn't going to work this is interesting

167
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,480
sorry if you're all bored out there but I would get up I would shower I would

168
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,800
get you know I get dressed or be that transition there I would you know drink

169
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,560
a bunch of water get the brain ready and then start going usually my first break I

170
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,480
would have coffee sometimes I make coffee right before I don't like to drink

171
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,760
coffee first thing in the morning but I like to have it within like an hour I

172
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,800
think I read somewhere that's the right way to do it but I'm not sure if

173
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,640
that's true or not and that was then somewhere along the way like I just

174
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,100
took a shower today about 45 minutes ago sometimes I don't get to it all five or

175
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,780
six at night I just I just kind of get up and I still get up a half hour before

176
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:22,920
my first meeting but I kind of get up and I just just sweats in a t-shirt and

177
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,020
I now that I have short hair I splashed some water on it to get lay down from

178
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:33,680
my bedhead and then I'm off for the day so I wonder if it would help me again I

179
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,960
don't feel like I'm not hitting the ground running with that first meeting I

180
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,080
start a little later my first meeting usually 7 30 or 8 but I wonder if I should

181
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,120
go back to showering and actually putting reasonable clothes on in the

182
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,880
morning anyway we'll let our we'll put that in a poll question our listeners

183
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,580
decide I don't yeah I've I've noticed a similar behavior like Fridays now is a

184
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:01,340
work-from-home day and I'm still in my pajamas I've only ever seen Brent in

185
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,040
his pajamas like the last three months yeah and and I'm trying to think through

186
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:13,720
okay when did I just start making that transition like it's I still get the

187
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:23,140
same amount of work done but for me like just making guesses I'd like okay the joy

188
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,100
I would feel about going in engaging with my team which is a lot more awkward

189
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:37,170
now it has it has to be more scripted right in some regards right I've it's not

190
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,330
nearly like I love it when my whole team is in town and we all go to work and

191
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,930
lunch and like it's fantastic I'd prefer that above anything else but I'm like oh

192
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:55,180
well yeah being able to be in my pajamas all day long on Friday and getting work

193
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,490
done right does actually make me happy too not nearly as close as the other

194
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:09,320
thing but yeah the one thing one thing I have noticed though and I wonder if

195
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:20,190
you've encountered this as well I ever since I started working solidly two days

196
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:28,390
a week from home when I am done with work I don't want to come into this room

197
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:33,900
this room has now become work yes that happened to me during the pandemic

198
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,700
especially in our old house I work from the kitchen a lot here but those two

199
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:44,420
years working in my office on my old house I could not go into the room after

200
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,100
after work was done I could not return to that room it was wasn't fun for me I

201
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,950
don't know the the the positive or negative reinforcement I don't know what

202
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:01,030
it's like I absolutely know my subconscious has shifted yeah because I

203
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:05,870
had to I stopped playing PC games during the pandemic because I didn't

204
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,750
want to be near my PC I started playing Xbox exclusively because I did

205
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,430
not want to go back I didn't want to look at my computer after the end of the

206
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:20,350
day right because like this setup right in front of me is work yeah and

207
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:24,190
fortunately this is like I said I work now every so often my son of the time

208
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,070
from this desk most time I'm sitting at the kitchen and for me it's well I'm

209
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,740
mostly doing it here I've I've tried to like take my laptop to the kitchen and

210
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:45,300
know like the the call of doom scrolling on YouTube off of my TV is just too

211
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,620
enticing so I'm just like no this is my workplace plus I also don't want this

212
00:19:51,620 --> 00:20:02,230
like work aura going wider than this room yeah I get that it's definitely it's

213
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:07,870
a work-life blend and yeah I'm gonna find your boundaries so anyway that's our

214
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,950
episode on working remotely no that's our that's our intro talk on working

215
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:19,350
remotely I let me see I had a vacation last week it was great I am recharged

216
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:25,110
lots going on blah blah blah for someone to be charged like I know don't

217
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:32,190
sound it right no you sound you sound drained AF we need to we need to like

218
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,230
record go back to recording in the morgue like Friday afternoon I'm fried

219
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:39,710
at the end of the week you are all lucky that you can even understand my

220
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,550
English or maybe the baby is not English anyway um you know do you want to talk

221
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:55,090
about something else no I mean I do like that idea right maybe considering going

222
00:20:55,090 --> 00:21:03,360
back to like I still have your bag of crap I know I haven't seen Brent IRL

223
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:15,020
since 2019 yeah probably fall 20 yeah probably maybe 2020 but no we did not do

224
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:20,460
any podcast in 2020 I don't think well COVID didn't start till till literally my

225
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:26,620
birthday 2020 so I like maybe we did something early in 2020 I don't anyway we

226
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:33,930
may have you may have come to hmm cuz we did a couple recordings at unity was

227
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:42,280
I there in 2020 where was I yes I was yeah I'm looking at brain fart I've gone

228
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:52,820
back to 2020 on Spotify riveting podcast material so yeah oh that was a 343 I

229
00:21:52,820 --> 00:22:00,180
missed three three three eight they require effort and we actually have guests

230
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,260
lined up for the show too but those require effort and rescheduling and my

231
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:09,540
assistant is doesn't exist to go figure that stuff out so as the producer

232
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,540
assistant I've failed I just I just show up here and talk about stuff so I have

233
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:21,670
found it yeah our last I don't think this was the one because it was episode

234
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:34,250
116 but our last episode before COVID was titled what's the deal with I stqb I

235
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,530
don't think it was the the fun one where you drop the quiz on me no it's not I

236
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:44,590
can't remember who knows what that was about that really in the one teens 115

237
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:52,690
116 oh my god we've done almost as oh my god March 2 2020 yeah Wow we've done a

238
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,640
lot of within a hundred episodes and said okay so I want to talk about some

239
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,320
so I was on vacation last week off the grid I mean I was on the grid I just

240
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,440
didn't turn my computer on okay and except to watch some YouTube shorts you

241
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,880
know they'd be important stuff and apparently well I wasn't paying attention

242
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:17,170
there was this thing out of China that wasn't COVID it was deep seek deep seek

243
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:22,930
and here's what I know about deep seek I want you fill in the gaps deep seek is

244
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:31,590
yet another LLM Gen AI thing what sets it apart is two things one it's

245
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:38,190
run by China and highly censored and two it apparently runs and one of my

246
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,830
biggest complaints about all this Gen AI crap and the bullshit people are doing

247
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,990
with it is the amount of energy it takes and the amount of environmental

248
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,950
resources it takes to run this stuff apparently deep speak deep speak deep

249
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:57,710
seek is cost-efficient much more cost efficient with much more resources uses

250
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,150
much less energy I don't know if I believe all that but curious because you

251
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,490
probably pay attention to stuff more than I do can you catch me up on deep

252
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:09,390
seek and let me ask some dumb question not I still have a lot of open questions

253
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:29,680
okay because number one it is well known that for things like this for

254
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:42,170
tech IP the Chinese government will absolutely steal and claim otherwise okay

255
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:52,360
and I haven't seen there there there are suspicions that the reason why their thing

256
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:58,560
is so cheap is because they did exactly that they trained it on opening eyes all

257
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:08,640
I don't I don't we don't know for sure we don't know for sure I don't like to

258
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,560
tend towards conspiracy theory I will hypothesize that it's not oh come on

259
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:23,820
come on it is as a data scientist I will say from the data that I know I

260
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:32,020
cannot refute or support that position whatever yeah and I would very much like

261
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,260
to do one or the other okay so getting past any potential conspiracy theories or

262
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:43,300
lies coming how it works like I have not and will not plan to play with it at

263
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,300
least for now I have not used it once okay so what else you know about it what

264
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:53,500
what should educate me educate me someone who doesn't like I'm so freaking

265
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,900
burned out on Gen AI and sick of people looking for magic there are a few good

266
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,780
applications coming out which is great but I'm just I'm freaking done I'm tired

267
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,500
of people I had dinner last night was Wednesday night with someone who was going

268
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,940
off on how Gen AI was changing the world and which is a great stance as long

269
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,700
but they knew nothing about Gen AI so I was just kind of annoyed and pissed off

270
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:25,630
so what should I know about deep-seek whether it's real or not okay in terms

271
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,710
of how they developed like let's just talk about number one they open

272
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:39,460
sourcing that okay this means Gen AI is going to there's going to be a lot more

273
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:49,240
competition around Gen AI okay now I am a huge supporter of enabling competition

274
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:56,830
to bring about innovation and price competition how many layperson

275
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,310
understand what is it they're open sourcing that the LLM the code that

276
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,270
generates the LLM what's actually oh that the chat bot what's open source to

277
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:14,020
my deep-seek they are so I'm looking at our article right now and again I have

278
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,300
not followed up on this number one all of their models are going to be

279
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:24,990
available open source okay to use you could argue well GPD does that no it

280
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,030
doesn't right you can do a certain amount of it but then like they're

281
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:35,190
doing the the freemium model right I have a subscription to open AI and

282
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:42,390
allows me to do everything I want to but they're going to open source everything

283
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:46,310
and the article I'm looking at is saying that they're gonna open source

284
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:52,790
their methodology which is something that I'm gonna want to dig into a lot

285
00:27:52,790 --> 00:28:01,300
further hmm right the because now so they were to they their claim is that

286
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:08,170
they were able to build something that one tenth of the the that's their claim

287
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:21,520
yes the price tag and without using GPU okay now in in data science I'm not

288
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:29,120
using GPUs crazy talk it is I was from the articles that I read they used GPUs

289
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,770
they didn't use they use cheaper ones but still I don't think how do you do

290
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:39,000
without the floating point speed I think they use GPUs if you're smart

291
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:47,800
well no no no so I don't know if you're aware of this but it's an export what

292
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:57,640
is that thing GPUs are in the export restriction thing yes like US is not

293
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,960
allowed to export GPUs and I can tell you for example we operate a government

294
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:13,860
cloud for China okay not one damn GPU in that club okay now that doesn't block

295
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:20,740
them they have all kinds of friends that they can go and talk to right to get

296
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:26,540
access to the compute power of GPU so I just thought just to back up my claim

297
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:31,060
here and suit to think company claims to train this model for just six million

298
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,740
using 2,000 Nvidia h800 graphics processing units okay is the versus the

299
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,300
80 to 100 million cost GPT for and the 16,000 h100 GPUs required for a mid

300
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:48,590
is llama 3 so they are using you they're using cheaper GPUs okay so

301
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,190
anyway that's what that's how they got around that but much cheaper and in my

302
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,470
much less energy consumption I don't know how to try guess I guess it's gonna be

303
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,470
open source you could test well you can't test those you're gonna go spend 6

304
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,710
million dollars to go build the LLM and see if it's see if it's right or not I

305
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,870
guess you could model that I don't know anyway what else now so now

306
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:18,210
basically they've opened the world up the make your own gen AI world to

307
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:24,250
smaller companies right which which creates disruption which creates

308
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:31,760
competition which creates innovation right even though I love what the

309
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:39,240
connection to open AI has done for the Microsoft stock price in the long term

310
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,840
competition is going to bring this stuff down is gonna create a differentiation I

311
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,840
want to take this and maybe leave deep-sake in here and build on the topic

312
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,320
we talked about last time which is the AI apocalypse AI apocalypse industry is

313
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,160
changing and there aren't there are new and again my hypothesis was that we are

314
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,480
not out of different business ideas we there are new businesses that can be

315
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,240
enabled by gen AI which I would really love to see and I see a few pop

316
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,520
up here and there which is actually really cool but I feel like the

317
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,400
basically my conversation I was a stranger on Wednesday night I feel like

318
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:25,440
maybe I'm in a weird bubble I feel like the general world is still looking at AI

319
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,350
to be magic that does really simple things that could be done without AI

320
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,670
and I'm worried about the ability of those people or okay I'll back up

321
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,110
because I got the majority people I talked to you about gen AI it's

322
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,790
basically magic to them it's gonna solve all their problems that are and

323
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,550
the problems I want to solve are simple problems that could be solved via an

324
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:51,750
algorithm not gen AI yeah I how do we get people to think differently or just

325
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,950
it's just a time thing when people think differently about this stuff and

326
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:02,230
begin to innovate like very little innovation on gen AI I think I'm still

327
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:09,550
waiting for it I think we're gonna find two things okay number one we are

328
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:20,960
already in a world where gen AI is okay I'm gonna go back to an old speech of

329
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,840
mine back to the s-debt days I thought I'm an engineering tester a term coined

330
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:36,880
at Microsoft circa 2004 sooner than that I was an s-debt in the 90s dude oh yeah

331
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:46,280
oh no you had a flash you had a flash it was sde flash T it was not a slash yeah

332
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:55,560
we took the dash away the one thing that happened on Thursday yesterday Thursday

333
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:06,040
yesterday for recording time yeah yeah I hit 30 oh well congratulations yeah so I'm

334
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,720
gonna get I'm gonna get a different you can't see it on the camera I'm gonna

335
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,660
give a different version of those yeah I have a couple on my shelf up there but

336
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:19,420
one that looks all sparkly and fiery Wow you used to be like 30 was like oh my

337
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,060
like didn't 30 used to get in the old days when wouldn't you get like a plaque

338
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:29,810
in the conference center oh I already know you that sooner I got it at 25 you

339
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:34,610
have a plaque in the conference enter not a not a plaque but there's a there's

340
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:43,160
a crystal that has every everyone's name that celebrated 25 and as Microsoft's

341
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,200
gotten older like the font has gotten smaller yeah you can still read my name

342
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,600
without glasses but I don't know not two years after me all right well

343
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,160
congratulations on 30 years I guess if I would have stayed I would be at 30 when

344
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:04,280
did I start 95 2025 I'd be coming up on 30 years think you started full-time

345
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:11,870
about six months before I did yeah I I literally joined the company in 94 but

346
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:20,350
there was weird oddities so my official start date is 75 or yesterday 95 all

347
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:27,900
right sir back to the topic and well we're good at this but I am so uh let's

348
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,300
not go all the way back to deep-seek we are talking about how I'm just waiting

349
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,460
for people to begin to innovate on AI versus seed as magic is deep-seek gonna

350
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:40,770
help with that just more fuel to the magic fire it's not gonna be more fuel

351
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:52,120
to the magic fire so what it will enable direction changes this is why I

352
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,440
was talking about it's gonna enable competition right because other companies

353
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:03,040
smaller companies that couldn't get into the game of creating models will now

354
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,840
be able to do so assuming everything that we've heard about deep-seek is true

355
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:23,300
right now in my view if it's chock full of of China you know CCP censorship then

356
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:29,780
everything I just said is is wrong because like I'm not gonna use this but

357
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:37,540
if the methodology is open source and and somebody else comes in and trains it

358
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:43,960
and still maintains that price tag then yeah this is gonna open up to to people

359
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,520
creating their own model generators and in one thing I think that could be

360
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:58,610
particularly interesting is generating deep topic knowledge instead of how GPT

361
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:05,580
right now is sort of generalized however we're gonna hit another thing that I

362
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,860
think is gonna be problematic and maybe I brought it up last time there's this new

363
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:17,060
concept that I bring up AI litter last time no okay I forgot because I'm old

364
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:23,100
and then I may be but it you know fills a couple more minutes of the podcast

365
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:31,820
so yeah AI litter so AI letters is concept where essentially because AI is a

366
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:38,200
hot new thing oh that's where I left off my speech from the old days automation if

367
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,120
you're not careful anything that you build with automation to do good will

368
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:49,550
also reduce the friction on doing bad like if you're not careful around how

369
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:55,950
you apply that automation oh yeah right I wrote a I wrote a blog about this got

370
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:04,190
probably a decade ago where where as you know I have a I have a patent for a test

371
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:13,040
architecture that that used to be well used at the company and when I left the

372
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,200
team where I build it they took it further and it became a situation where

373
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,520
dev would just barf code and then just said submit it to the automation and go

374
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,850
off to lunch right and they wouldn't they wouldn't code review they would

375
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:35,690
because they had confidence that the automation would catch anything it

376
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:41,770
encouraged intellectual laziness and I definitely think that that will happen

377
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:47,720
here as more and more AI comes out yeah I think it's a good parallel I think

378
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,800
intellectual laziness is being encouraged I totally agree with that

379
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:59,590
and if it's intellectual laziness around things that we don't care about

380
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:08,180
I'm cool with it I'm cool with it but what's happening and here's a very

381
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,940
specific case there is now a group of people I believe there's a reddit for

382
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:19,940
this there's a group of people that have mastered and share their mastery

383
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:33,390
around how to use Google and force it to the index pre 2023 oh okay why why do you

384
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:42,490
think that they would want this give me give me some insight because 2023 and

385
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:51,010
after it is filled with AI litter as in litter like on the internet highway AI is

386
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:59,600
dumping potato bags and bottles right they so these popular tools are now filled

387
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:09,760
with AI generated crap yeah right yeah and it is so easy to generate like the

388
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:21,080
problem right now today is no one has really solved the quality problem right

389
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:30,570
open AI is like oh yeah GPT-40 can pass the LSAT okay great that's nifty it

390
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:38,530
can pass the SAT also nifty okay but I don't know about you Ellen I will never

391
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:47,490
need to pass the LSAT and I only never say the SAT only once well also I had a

392
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,370
friend who's on a fantasy football team volume like 40 40 50 year olds and the

393
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:56,030
loser of the league had to go take the SAT of a bunch of high school kids so

394
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:02,340
you may have to take it again I would I'm just saying you never say never I

395
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:16,280
would never take that back ever so but right it and that's an impressive goal

396
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:23,570
and a prep and impress a statement but it doesn't necessarily equate to that this

397
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:29,410
thing is a low friction answer of the of the questions I have for my day-to-day

398
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:35,650
problems and as a matter of fact it doesn't and there's not really a scalable

399
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:43,050
way to define the quality I'm looking for let alone how to measure it yeah and

400
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:48,490
so so people were like well fuck it I can just I can just give it a prompt

401
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:56,690
generate a graphic and generate a bunch of text like a couple podcasts ago like

402
00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:04,000
you you you did that fake podcast with Google okay that's a fun toy but it's a

403
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:11,330
toy it would get redundant and boring very quickly right I was that was part of

404
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:18,320
the argument I had with Gen AI man the other night it can create art I said

405
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:25,740
yeah not really anyway I don't know that it can create art well it can

406
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:31,500
create decoration for sure the point is the point I think the majority of people

407
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,420
well probably the majority don't give a crap about or don't know enough about it

408
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:40,380
the enthusiasts if you look at the cost of Casa crib the enthusiasts all think

409
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,140
it's some magic that's gonna do very basic things for them the people who

410
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:52,300
can use you does not believe it's I don't know like when I see the people

411
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,580
who say they're really into Gen AI and chat GPT and and and all this stuff all

412
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:03,690
they're doing is using chat GPT to answer dumb questions I have I think I

413
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,140
might have mentioned this last we're talking about copilot yeah but and this

414
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:15,460
is the way I describe it it's copilot's great but essentially all it's done is

415
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:20,620
save time by not making you go to stack overflow to copy and paste that code

416
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,730
there's some subtlety and nuance there it does do better but in the you know four

417
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:31,370
years ago three years ago the way to program was this is hard

418
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,290
stack overflow well that'll work copy paste into my code yay it works debug

419
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:39,510
debug today it's let me let me ask copilot or one of the other code gen

420
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:46,470
tools to help us solve my problem there are there are two things that I have

421
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:55,410
found Jenny I works really well hey it works more works well for more than two

422
00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:00,050
things but you have to apply some systems thinking critical thinking and add some

423
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,170
skepticism to what it produces that's all I'm saying let me let me change the

424
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:09,770
scope of my turn right thanks I was thinking in more in general terms if I

425
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:20,740
don't think like the the Q&A strategy that the most are building off of GPT chat

426
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,100
bots chat bots chat bots I don't think that's a very effective one I don't think

427
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,260
so either people like it though it's a good demonstration of magic the scenarios

428
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,260
and I don't know I I spend a lot of my time thinking about okay what other

429
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:44,640
scenarios are like this okay the github copilot experience that is phenomenal

430
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:55,850
right it's so there's one the experience where me and GPT are kind of playing

431
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:04,210
opposite roles I don't like that it's like I asked it it says something that I

432
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:09,050
know you're full of shit and then it argues with me in that funny story that

433
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:15,580
has actually happened my daughter was in the car at the time and she's like dad

434
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:27,910
you just pissed off the AI right I remember that story okay but where where

435
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:38,790
essentially GPT is alongside me and pair programming with me that is an experience

436
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:42,790
I can't live without anymore well why is it you think then if that's the

437
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:49,070
experience on average if I trust the internet so like 20 to 30 percent of the

438
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:53,450
suggestions are actually accepted and as we know canonically from that data some

439
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:57,910
of those still have buggy code so if it's phenomenal why isn't it suggesting

440
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,430
more applicable things more often I think I feel like we talked about this last

441
00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:09,790
probably did but I'm just I'm asking my little feeble mind we did talk about it

442
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:14,860
but I'll remind you because I remember you argued about it I remember that

443
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:23,650
discussion I remember winning but go ahead Salesforce it doesn't matter what

444
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:31,230
actually happened that's what you'll remember the Salesforce actually did an

445
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:35,910
approach where they measured it okay and and found that their software

446
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:39,790
engineers were getting a 30% productivity boost and then I went into a

447
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:46,410
diatribe around no in terms of how Salesforce operates right with a with a

448
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:53,070
combine and a scrum model is it is actually measurable but anyway I don't

449
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:58,110
remember where I found this but there was a study that showed that that 30%

450
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:07,550
increase is common and known when it's an experienced developer using GPT oh yeah

451
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:15,740
yeah but when it's an inexperienced developer it falls flat and that is

452
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:23,340
hypothesized to be an experienced developer can look at what was

453
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:30,040
generated and very quickly go this is a bug or oh great you saved me time

454
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:35,850
whereas an experience is still constantly learning and doesn't know good or bad

455
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:42,610
patterns doesn't know good or bad code but um all right fine you're okay I'm

456
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:49,410
not gonna harp on that so to summarize as we get to the end here deep-seek is

457
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:52,930
gonna it's gonna bring more LLMs to the masses because it's open source and

458
00:46:52,930 --> 00:47:00,700
runs cheaper it's gonna bring more good and and more bad more of everything yeah

459
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,980
I think that's the way it's gonna bring more all right I hope we get I hope we get

460
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,460
to a point someday or look back and go remember when everybody's all excited

461
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,060
about Gen AI and they're doing shit with it now look what we can do right I'm

462
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:18,600
waiting to get there I've heard I've seen a couple good examples come out to

463
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,760
like this is a good application of this solving hard problems that you got oh yeah

464
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,980
I would solve this with an all-out so we're getting there I just I don't know

465
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:33,250
I'm sort of frustrated with where we're I'm frustrated with the pace at which

466
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:42,330
people are figuring out how to leverage a technology that's far more than a quick

467
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:52,160
look-up tool I the way I hear you saying it is the killer app that uses

468
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:58,160
this from Alan Page's point of view does not yet exist correct yeah yeah that's

469
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,760
true that's true and it should do this by now stupid people get out there and

470
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,420
innovate you keep telling us AGI is coming by 20 people are people are too

471
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,480
dumb to get there whatever all right we're gonna we're gonna call that it

472
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,680
thanks for listening to our podcast on remote work and deep-seek and the death

473
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:20,680
that will come to all of us from AI I am weasel Alan
