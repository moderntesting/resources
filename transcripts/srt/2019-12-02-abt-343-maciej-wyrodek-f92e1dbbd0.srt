00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,270
the AB Testing podcast three questions about almost anything.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,590
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing.

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,770
Let's get started.

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,930
We're back again for another episode of ABT 343, and I'm here this time with Machi

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:28,930
Zarek.

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,610
Hi, thank you to be here.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,610
It's very exciting.

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,570
And that was to see how it go.

10
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,810
It's more exciting for me.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,210
I am excited about this series.

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,170
I think they a lot of good insights from listeners of the podcast and people

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,170
practicing modern testing.

14
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,930
I'm also looking forward to maybe in the future, having people who don't agree with

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,930
the principles, who have some conflicts, think that'll be fun thing to do.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:57,130
But I don't think that's going to be the case today, but we'll see how things go.

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,520
Yeah, we'll see.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Great.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,320
So I know that one of the things is you, I named dropped you in my recent

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,120
Ministry of Testing course on modern testing because you took, Brent and I did

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,800
in the eighties of our podcast, a lot of deeper dives into each of the

22
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,280
principles and you created a mind map of that, which is super helpful.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,520
And just I want to thank you again for doing that work.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,360
And I think it's going to be continually valuable for people trying to get their

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,360
head around how these principles can be applied and how they work with each other.

26
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
So thanks again for that.

27
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,720
My pleasure.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,240
I will admit I am, I really like to learn from mind maps.

29
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,760
So that's why it was created.

30
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,880
Well, I was trying to do article for one of the, let's call it a blog scene

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,200
Paul, Paul and about modern testing.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,280
And I needed to, you know, sorry it's in my head.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,320
So I walking my dog, I was taking notes from your past episodes and I was

34
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
complaining, giving that mind map.

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,560
My only problem with it is that the current format is not very good for

36
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,400
you know, contribution from other people.

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,440
I'm trying to figure out some better ways for it to work in the future.

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,760
But for now I don't have any ideas how to tackle that problem.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,280
That's interesting.

40
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,200
We need a mind map diff tool.

41
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,100
Yeah.

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,340
You know, actually I found some way.

43
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,100
I found recently that there is some plugin for the X mind to use

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,260
Python to, you know, to make a different format from it.

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,060
And I'm thinking if it's possible to, you know, to use it to start the

46
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,700
mind map in getting some other format and shows, you know, auto-generated.

47
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,460
But I haven't yet started looking at it.

48
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,180
I would probably use it as one of my programming challenges in future months.

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,180
That is super interesting.

50
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
Speaking of, we're going to start right off with tangents here, but

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,380
speaking with about programming challenges.

52
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,980
Uh, in case I forget to mention on the podcast next week, it's almost time for

53
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,060
the fact tomorrow, the advent of code programming challenge starts.

54
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,260
I don't know if you've ever done that before.

55
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,350
No, I was listening to when you were doing it last year or two years ago,

56
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,310
but I haven't taken time to participate in it last, uh, last year.

57
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,150
I am thinking about trying it this year, but I don't know if I will have time

58
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,710
because I'm doing my own challenge in the meantime.

59
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,190
So we do.

60
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,070
I've never finished it.

61
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,950
I've started it every year for about the last three years.

62
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,750
And it's a lot of fun.

63
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,710
It's, uh, in my current role about the, almost the only programming I get to do.

64
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,350
But it's, it's fun.

65
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,590
Last year I did it in JavaScript and which was both good and bad, but it worked.

66
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,350
I might try.

67
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,270
Why did you choose JavaScript for it?

68
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,430
That would be challenging.

69
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,670
Uh, I don't know exactly.

70
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,750
It was convenient.

71
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,150
I think it's, I don't recall my reasoning.

72
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,270
I think it was convenient.

73
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,630
I was on.

74
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,700
Yeah, I don't know.

75
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,620
JavaScript is popular.

76
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,140
Maybe see what's going about it.

77
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,420
And that means no, no, no.

78
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,580
Why I didn't choose that.

79
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,820
The advent of code always has two challenges.

80
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,820
One that's kind of hard.

81
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,660
There's always a follow-up that if you're lucky, your initial solution is,

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,060
it's easy to bolt on, but if you're unlucky and you solve the first problem

83
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,260
in a weird way, you have to basically rewrite something.

84
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,580
And there was one where you had to figure out where someone would be on the

85
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,700
thousandth iteration of some complex maze or a thousandth step.

86
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,380
So did the code to figure that out.

87
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,620
And I say, now imagine the character has gone.

88
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,700
It was like 10 million steps or no, it's more than it's like,

89
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,260
it's like 10 billion steps.

90
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:34,980
Okay.

91
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,980
If I was in a type, a strongly typed language, I would have to change my

92
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,940
integer types and redo a whole bunch of stuff with large ints, et cetera.

93
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,500
But JavaScript doesn't care.

94
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,340
I just added a bunch of zeros and ran it again.

95
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,500
And it took, took three minutes or so, but I still got the right answer.

96
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah.

97
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,140
And that is the power of the soft typed languages that you can

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,820
do lots of that kind of stuff.

99
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,380
I'm not saying it was a good thing.

100
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,540
I'm just saying it worked.

101
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:01,960
Yeah.

102
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,440
I am currently playing with the JavaScript because we are taking look into the

103
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,280
puppeteer and other solutions.

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,360
And my biggest pain is that the bug fortunately,

105
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,280
Visual Studio Code is giving some good options, but it's still not on the

106
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,360
level that other languages and other IDs have for that.

107
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:25,420
I definitely hate JavaScript more than I love it, but let's have a three for

108
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,060
three podcast.

109
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,460
And, uh, I'm not going to edit any of that out because I think it's all

110
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,700
super valuable and interesting, but ABT three, four three is a podcast for

111
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,180
people who have at least some knowledge of modern testing.

112
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,340
And I know you have, as we've spoken of before, uh, more than above average

113
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,700
knowledge.

114
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,100
So for the first question, can you talk a little bit about two part question

115
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,060
about how you've seen modern testing work and how you can maybe some ways

116
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,340
that you've got teams to where you've snuck it into the job, where you've got

117
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,900
teams to adopt some of the modern testing principles without knowing they're

118
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,260
doing it.

119
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,220
Okay.

120
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,860
So, um, I will start with the second part because he's much more

121
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,300
a recent situation for me.

122
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,460
Um, there is currently a new project starting.

123
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,140
Well, it's not exactly new project.

124
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:19,220
The old project is returning for another release and they had few problems.

125
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,020
Basically regression was taking five hours.

126
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,860
And since this would be the probably the last release for that customer,

127
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:33,580
you wanted to know, to improve it, to leave him with some better positions

128
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,220
in the future.

129
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,220
And the plan was to try to put automation there.

130
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,740
And I wasn't too keen on that because well, since this is a rest release, I

131
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,380
wasn't seeing the proper value of, you know, giving the end to end tests

132
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,140
there and after lots of discussions, we came to conclusion that actually the

133
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:00,580
biggest issue for the customer is that basically, um, the process when they

134
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,140
find the bugs because due to the fact that the lots is dependent on the data

135
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,820
and we don't have that data and we can't have that data is found in the

136
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,060
production by them and they have to report to their representative.

137
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,140
He has to do quite a lot of checking and then, you know, it has to go to our

138
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,660
support, our support is reserving the issue.

139
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,140
So my proposition was to change an approach.

140
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:29,780
Let's look into, you know, improving our logs to create some alerts.

141
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,780
So when we see some suspicious situation in production.

142
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,460
So our customer support will know about it before the customer representative

143
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,620
even will know about it.

144
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,540
And maybe we even be able to go with it so fast that they will be able to fix it

145
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,380
before anybody contacts us.

146
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Interesting.

147
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,240
Interesting.

148
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,640
Yeah.

149
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,040
We will see how it will work out because you know, um, I was introduced to

150
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,200
the project last week and the project is starting in the Monday.

151
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,320
So we will see how it goes.

152
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,560
But so far I was talking with the architect and he says that it's quite

153
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,160
possible to fix the logs because right now the information is that in them

154
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,680
are not enough to even reconstruct the situation to see what happened.

155
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,760
So, you know, there is a lot of discussion.

156
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,320
So what did you do?

157
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,280
What happened?

158
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,600
That's etc, etc.

159
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,080
So, you know, shorten the feedback loop by making the logs better.

160
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,520
The whole situation can be resolved faster, which means the client would

161
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:37,320
be able to make more money and it means customer would be happy, which

162
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,760
means he will stay with us and we can make more money because our support

163
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,520
instead of the fixing the issue in let's say five hours, they can fix

164
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
it probably maybe our.

165
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,500
That sounds like principle number one, your, uh, your priorities

166
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,420
improving the business.

167
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,540
Exactly.

168
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,790
Nice.

169
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,430
Do you have other examples of how you've got teams to adopt modern

170
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,350
testing or?

171
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,270
This is maybe not exactly modern testing, but something very connected.

172
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,350
Uh, I am community leader of the test automation in the objectivity

173
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,230
company I work for, which means I have a lot of contact with testers

174
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,950
that wants to learn automation.

175
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:19,230
And what I am trying to show them is learn how to code this ability

176
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,870
will be helpful for you in much more aspects.

177
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,580
You can write some small programs that will help you with your testing

178
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,420
will enhance your testing will, will allow you for the faster feedback.

179
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,580
We allow you to better communicate with developers to better understand

180
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,980
what's going there and make you pretty much more productive.

181
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,460
The automation, the end to end tests is not a way to go, especially

182
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,980
that I agree with you that in my opinion, this is the stuff that

183
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,180
should sooner or later go back completely to developers because let's

184
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,100
be honest, this is the hardest code that you will ever write.

185
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,780
Yeah, I've made that comment before.

186
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,500
In fact, there was, uh, and I'm going to, we're going to dive in here a little bit,

187
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,220
but I remember talking to, when I was writing a chapter in, I was asked to

188
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,820
write a chapter in Dorothy Graham's book, experiences and test automation.

189
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,380
And I am always of the camp that focusing on writing automation is the wrong goal.

190
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:22,460
You're trying to make it easier to do your job well and automation can help

191
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,820
there, but that's, that's what it does.

192
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,500
And the story I wrote, I was interviewing a former tester who was an architect

193
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,140
on the windows team at Microsoft.

194
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,100
And he talked about a, um, sort of a mock driver framework.

195
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,820
They wrote that allowed companies like Intel and these people making

196
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,020
hardware that was going to be available, uh, much after the release of the OS,

197
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:50,340
uh, being able to test that hardware through a pretty sophisticated

198
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,700
mock driver framework.

199
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,580
I forget what it was called time was escaped me,

200
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,180
but that was a good example of accelerating the achievement of a book

201
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,500
quality and it's just much more valuable.

202
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,340
My experience has been writing tools to help me test has been much more valuable

203
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,180
and serendipitously to this conversation.

204
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,960
I just, I, I saw a few more tweets this weekend about testers

205
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,720
focusing on automation and that's so weird testers.

206
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,720
It's odd to me.

207
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,360
It's not big.

208
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,640
You look at the state of the industry.

209
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,040
It's not odd, but testers, as you've seen, they go, Oh, I want to make

210
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,400
themselves more valuable.

211
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,000
I want to learn automation.

212
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,790
And what they really want to do is they want to make themselves more valuable.

213
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,600
And there's a, they're focusing on the wrong goal.

214
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,580
I'm to be honest, I'm not entirely sure because from perspective of value

215
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,060
for the customer, I agree with you, but we are also in the let's

216
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,540
call it corporate world when you are just a number in the table.

217
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,740
And let's say, let's be honest, having that automation in front of your

218
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,460
title quite often means you earn much more money.

219
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,500
It doesn't matter that probably as you know, manual tester of human tester,

220
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,300
you are much better.

221
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,340
You can do much more, but for the payer, you are just the number and you

222
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,680
may hit the glass ceiling very far, very fast for the tester, but you

223
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,340
know, this is the problem of the industry that also needs to be

224
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,680
tackled sooner or later.

225
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,960
Yes.

226
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,620
Any other examples of applying modern testing principles in your, in your

227
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,740
roles and actually answer that question and doing that, I'm not exactly

228
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,660
sure what your role is.

229
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,500
Sounds like you're in a sort of a consultant role, but I'd like to

230
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
hear more about what your, what your day to day job is.

231
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,540
My title is simple.

232
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:47,940
I am senior automation quality engineer at objectivity, but my role is,

233
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,060
I would say automation expert.

234
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,500
It would be the easiest way to describe.

235
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,220
I am responsible for this automation community in the company.

236
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,260
So I am responsible for helping with their equipment, with sharing

237
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,620
knowledge, with trainings, and I am also, you know, expert.

238
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,540
So when there is some situation that requires someone much more knowledgeable,

239
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,780
I am the one that is called for to, you know, to help preserve the situation.

240
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,780
We, for example, had a situation when we were passed the, you know, asking

241
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,980
question if we should be doing, but if we were in the point, we have to do it.

242
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,940
Basically there was platform that we couldn't do performance testing using

243
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,860
the JMeter or the gut link because the like was, they were messed up and we

244
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,300
had to do something that is completely against the books, you know, use

245
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,180
Selenium for the performance test, but actually it wasn't completely

246
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,020
another option. And for example, I was the one that has to design some

247
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,180
solution, how we can even tackle this problem.

248
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,660
I was screaming in my heart that I have that we are in situation when we

249
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,420
have to do it, but you know, client needs some information about how

250
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,980
the application is performing and we haven't another option to provide

251
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,940
him that information.

252
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,880
Cool. Cool. Before we go on, but were there any other examples of

253
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,320
modern testing worth sharing today?

254
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,340
To be honest, I think for now we can stop with this because I haven't

255
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,300
answered the first part of your question, which I can't remember.

256
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,620
That's right. Which was how have you seen modern testing work in

257
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,380
software houses?

258
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Some success stories.

259
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,650
To be honest, this is the place when I see the most problem, because

260
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:37,890
when I look at the DevOps, when I look at the software houses, the

261
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,890
problem is the DevOps, even if you read the Phonics project, they are

262
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,290
saying that the most core business you should keep in hand, you

263
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,810
should keep at your site so you can develop fast, you can release

264
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,210
it to production often.

265
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,330
And this is the problem I see, because usually when you outsource

266
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:59,970
something, you need to have some kind of contract, some kind of

267
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:05,290
working with the organization to be able to, you know, to have to

268
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,050
trust them.

269
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,050
And usually most software houses I see are not at this level of

270
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,490
trust, because they are either working in the bottle using

271
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,610
model, in which case, you know, they don't care because all

272
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,250
management is on the side of the customer.

273
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,450
But in case of time and material or fixed price, which are, I

274
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:27,010
think the two most popular models, there is the problem how

275
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:31,410
to actually implement properly DevOps, because you are still

276
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,010
you still are very dependent on the customer and how they are

277
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:38,530
willing to trust you with, you know, the access to production,

278
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,610
that kind of stuff.

279
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,730
And it's additional barrier that needs to be broken.

280
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,330
I essentially read that there is another model of cooperation with

281
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,290
the customers, which is called, I may, I may screw it up.

282
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:56,450
I think it's outcome based model when customer is basically paying

283
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,370
depending on the outcomes that you are achieving.

284
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:03,210
And I think this is the only way for the software house system

285
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,170
forward to be able to work in the DevOps and hands also apply

286
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,730
mother testing principles, because we need to build that trust.

287
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,530
And I think that's the point of the first principle, we have to

288
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,370
improve business.

289
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,410
And when we improve the business, we are able to build the

290
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,650
trust, you know, to be able to even improve the business even

291
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,610
more due to the other principles.

292
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,040
Thank you for that.

293
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,440
In that you mentioned the Phoenix project.

294
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,040
And I know from our conversation that you recently read the

295
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,680
unicorn project still on my list.

296
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,560
Uh, tell me just curious on your take on that and what would be

297
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,840
the interest of that, of that book for people who are

298
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,080
listeners of this podcast.

299
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,120
And to end the preface, while you think about that Phoenix

300
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,240
project is all about the theory of constraints, which is a big

301
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,920
part of accelerating the achievement of customer quality or customer

302
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,320
value.

303
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,000
So I'm curious where the unicorn project takes over and what sort

304
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
of the main lesson and gist of that book is.

305
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,040
That would be quite a tangent because I must admit, I don't

306
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:09,680
like this book.

307
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,720
I read it and I think this is still got a book, but it's the

308
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,880
weakest book about the DevOps from Gen Kim Eats.

309
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
It has its problem.

310
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,240
Uh, I think for starter, we need to start with the goal

311
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,800
because Dr.

312
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,760
Goldratt, one of his ideas for the goal was to share that

313
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,200
stories are good material to even about hard concepts in the

314
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,480
management of other stuff.

315
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,440
And the phonics project took much of that.

316
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,000
It completely ran with the idea of the, uh, story as the

317
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,160
method of presenting the information.

318
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,520
Unicorn project is also making the same way.

319
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,600
It's also the story.

320
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,520
And here is the problem.

321
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,920
The book starts with disclaimer that you have to leave your

322
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,760
so that you will have to use your suspension of disbelief.

323
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,830
And this is the big problem for me because at this point you

324
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,310
are basically saying you screwed up as the storyteller that you

325
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:14,870
need me to completely use my suspension of disbelief because

326
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,630
the book is happening at the same time as the unicorn

327
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,150
project.

328
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,150
It's, I would say as the unicorn as phonics project is

329
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,750
about the bridge crew with the managers and how they are

330
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,150
dealing with the situation.

331
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,910
The unicorn is about the, as they calling here, red shirts,

332
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,630
the normal people down in the system, the teams that are

333
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,390
actually dealing with the problems.

334
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,900
And here I have quite a lot of problems because, uh, the

335
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,580
model I'm trying to look at the characters.

336
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,860
I see, for example, the time is completely made from the

337
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,300
rubber because I cannot imagine how the original characters

338
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,700
would have also time to participate in this events.

339
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,110
And I think my biggest issue is I cannot say for whom is that

340
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,710
book, because at first I thought it's the book for the, you

341
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,710
know, for the laggards, for the late majority, for the

342
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,350
developers, how they can learn about new technologies and

343
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,470
how to use them.

344
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,910
Because basically every popular technology right now,

345
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,790
Kubernetes, Docker, et cetera, is named and explained in

346
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,190
the book.

347
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,830
So it's kind of seemed to me like it was addressed to

348
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,550
those people.

349
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,710
But then I came back, can see it because those people

350
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,830
won't probably have contact with this book since they

351
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,910
are in the laggards, they are still quite far away from

352
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,710
the DevOps.

353
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,580
And even if they hear about DevOps, probably they will

354
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,180
hear about the other books first.

355
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,950
And my problem is also what this book tries to teach

356
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:50,230
because the only worth, I think, that was the how

357
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,950
it called the five ideas for them of the work.

358
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,670
And the ideas itself were great.

359
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:02,910
Oh, yeah, local localities simplicity, that was one focus

360
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,670
flow and joy was the second.

361
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,910
Third was improvement of daily work for was

362
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,910
psychological safety and five was customer focus, which

363
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,830
the five is very similar to first principle of the

364
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,590
modern testing.

365
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,380
And they were a great idea, but the way they were

366
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,660
introduced in this book, there was too much noise

367
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,460
to actually see them in the work.

368
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,020
The authors were tried to put them in the spotlight.

369
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,940
But I kind of didn't feel like the spotlight was put

370
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,780
on them properly.

371
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,060
I'm still building my my final opinion of the book as

372
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,620
I'm writing the review for it.

373
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,660
But at this point, I cannot say for whom I would

374
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,620
recommend that book.

375
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,420
I don't see, you know, the targeted audience for it.

376
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,740
Fair enough.

377
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,740
It's something I think because I like business fables,

378
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,740
I've read all the Lynch, Yoni books and the Phoenix

379
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,340
Project and the goal, of course, I liked actually I

380
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,580
like the goal the best because it wasn't about

381
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,180
software.

382
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,050
Yes, I agree.

383
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,530
Because I could I could form the metaphors and the

384
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,770
patterns myself.

385
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,210
And I think that makes it a lot easier to adopt.

386
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,010
Plus, I was listening to go recently as the audio

387
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,210
book. And what was impressive for me, it was

388
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,530
proper audio play.

389
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,570
I think there was something like 12 voice actors

390
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,810
there and white array of sounds.

391
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:24,850
So it was a joy to even listen to it.

392
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,130
It was treated as the proper audio play.

393
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,930
And that was also interesting.

394
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:32,170
I've never had an audio book experience like that.

395
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,650
So I might have to check that one out just so I

396
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,250
can I think it sounds great.

397
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,690
So it's like, yeah, I do a plan, especially when you

398
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,210
hear the doctor, how it was just what, John,

399
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,410
and he's speaking with heavy accent.

400
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,250
He's really just showing to listen to him.

401
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,930
I'm going to check that out.

402
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,410
I'm going to definitely check that out.

403
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,530
One last question while we're kind of on and

404
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,250
thank you for that.

405
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,050
I'm like I said, I'm still going to read it.

406
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,170
But yeah, I want to form my own opinion.

407
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,970
But I think it's I was a little worried about it

408
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,090
earlier on. But I will form my own opinion and

409
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,330
probably share it on the podcast.

410
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,170
Yeah, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinion

411
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:09,690
about it.

412
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,650
All right. One last question for today.

413
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,090
And I'm going to give you an option to rant a

414
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,490
little bit and I'll probably join in.

415
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,170
But you had mentioned to me on Slack that you

416
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,330
read an article in Polish today on the state of

417
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,730
testing. And can you talk about what you read

418
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,850
there and your reaction and we can both I'll

419
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:27,690
help you tie it into modern testing if and where

420
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,010
needed.

421
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:32,330
Yeah, basically, there was an article called State

422
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,210
of the Testing.

423
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:38,530
And I started reading the article and basically it

424
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:41,330
was about testers, testers, testers, testers,

425
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,530
testers, and even more.

426
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,090
It was about traditional testers.

427
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,370
Then it starts going into different things that

428
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,610
are happening in the market.

429
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:55,530
Outer himself is stating that the market is not

430
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,570
satisfied with traditional testers and they are

431
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:00,930
doing other things like monitoring DevOps and

432
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,690
this whole little of things which I could see

433
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,490
their testing.

434
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:07,610
And he said that the testers are staying behind.

435
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,970
And he ended basically his essay with saying that

436
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,930
testing is in the defensive right now, which

437
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,850
kind of triggered me because looking at even

438
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,850
things that he has mentioned from my perspective,

439
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,290
adding to it even the test of smother testing, I

440
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,530
think testing wasn't ever better than it's now.

441
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,610
The teams see the value of actual testing.

442
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,450
The teams are going forward with quality.

443
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:37,530
What I'm seeing is that actually the traditional

444
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,170
testing is in the defensive.

445
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,890
And as I've already said, the fact that he put

446
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,130
equality mark between tester and testing was the

447
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,890
thing that pissed me off the most.

448
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,090
And you know what Brenton I say and more and

449
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,490
more and I have to continue a little Twitter

450
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,010
battle after our talk here today, but I'm

451
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,530
caring less and less about testing and more

452
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,490
and more about quality.

453
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,450
Testing is one method to reduce risk.

454
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,250
That's a very good method and good testing

455
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,090
reduces a lot of risk, but it's not the only way

456
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,450
to reduce risk and improve the business.

457
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,370
Exactly.

458
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:16,450
Yeah, this is something I'm kind of mentally not

459
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,970
ready because I'm still putting the equality mark

460
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,210
when it's not between quality and testing.

461
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,170
I'm trying to disconnect this, but you know,

462
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,570
the years of the training makes it hard to

463
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,570
remove that quality mark there, but I am

464
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,410
seeing it as less connected lately.

465
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,250
I agree about you can achieve quality.

466
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,450
When we talk about accelerating the

467
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,010
achievement of a more quality, it's

468
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,810
definitely, I'm figuring out more and more.

469
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,690
Brenton, I've been saying that phrase for

470
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,330
years.

471
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,450
I think Brent just reposted his blog post

472
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,570
re-coin that phrase maybe 10 years ago.

473
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:52,890
Over time, I'm realizing more and more

474
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,090
what that means is less about testing, more

475
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:57,250
about the other ways to reduce risk.

476
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,690
And you look at testing and testability

477
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,730
are one way and the traditional way we did

478
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,890
it when we were shipping things every

479
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,290
couple of years, but operability and the

480
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,250
ability to deploy safely and monitor and

481
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,560
learn are just as big, if not more,

482
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,800
actually more important, I would

483
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,200
argue, in some businesses.

484
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,440
Yeah.

485
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,000
Plus the thing that was actually in the goal,

486
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,650
because one of them, well, that will be

487
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,250
a mouthful, the goals of the goal was not

488
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,450
only to present the theory of

489
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,530
constraint and show how the stories can

490
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,610
be used as teaching method, but the

491
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,090
culture also wanted to show people that

492
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,770
the science is not only what the

493
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,530
scientists are doing, that everybody can

494
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:42,170
experiment, every can learn from the

495
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,970
experiments.

496
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,690
And here is the R-set value.

497
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:48,490
We, you don't have to be tested to

498
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,010
experiment and to check the results of

499
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:51,930
these experiments.

500
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,970
And lots of quality is coming from that

501
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,130
fast experimentation.

502
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,250
Yes.

503
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:57,810
Yes.

504
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,290
I love it.

505
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:58,690
I love it.

506
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,090
I love it.

507
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:00,470
All right.

508
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,670
Well, that's, that's it for today.

509
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,550
So any, actually before we finish any

510
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,470
blog sites or Twitter handles or anything

511
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,870
else you'd like to share with listeners?

512
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,230
Yeah, I am on the blog.

513
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,550
I'll talk on the blog on the Twitter as

514
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,430
much ever attack.

515
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,790
I have blog called the broken test where

516
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,430
I recently went on quite a long essay

517
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,870
around for dedicated for the people that

518
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,350
wants to go into the testing where I'm

519
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,390
talking about different myths connected

520
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,830
to that because I'm thinking that we are

521
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,830
sending too much snake or to them lately.

522
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:35,070
Yeah.

523
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,350
And, uh, I nodded my head so hard.

524
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,430
I almost hit the microphone.

525
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,050
Yeah, exactly.

526
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,490
And, um, basically I am lately happy.

527
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,090
You can see me on a lot of

528
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,370
conferences in Europe.

529
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,010
I am, my plan for the next year is to

530
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,730
finally tackle the West of Europe

531
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,930
because on the East I have no problem

532
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,370
of getting into the conferences on the

533
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,450
West, I have a little problem.

534
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,410
And again, I will try to go with some

535
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,170
subject topics connected to more than

536
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,970
testing on our sub developer conferences.

537
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,010
We'll see how it will go.

538
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,290
Sounds awesome.

539
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,490
Let me know if I can help at all.

540
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,010
Try and grease some wheels somewhere.

541
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,690
If I know the people.

542
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,720
Yeah, I would probably ask the free

543
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,560
way to help with the, um,

544
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,160
abstracts for the call for papers.

545
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,760
But today I am lazy and I'm not

546
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,440
writing and I will be doing something

547
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,240
tomorrow.

548
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,960
Well, thank you, Mashi.

549
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,600
It's been fantastic talking to you today.

550
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,520
I know we both have to go take our dogs

551
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,920
for a walk, so I'll try and edit out

552
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,440
mine crying in the background earlier.

553
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,120
I'm sure that'll work out.

554
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,440
All right.

555
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,960
I don't know if you could hear that or not.

556
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:38,840
She had a little wine.

557
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,400
Hey, okay.

558
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Okay.

559
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:41,640
Good.

560
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,160
Good.

561
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:42,920
We'll see what happens.

562
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:43,480
All right.

563
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,240
Thank you again.

564
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,000
Have a wonderful rest of your weekend

565
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,800
and, uh, we'll talk again soon.

566
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,920
Thank you for having me here.

567
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,360
Bye.
