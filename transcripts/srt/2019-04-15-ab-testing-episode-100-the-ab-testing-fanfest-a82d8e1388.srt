1
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,660
A.V.

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,660
Testing, the modern testing podcast.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,910
Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,910
I am Mindless Agile Robot.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,900
I must iterate.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,740
As we talk about software engineering, software quality, leadership, and whatever else comes

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,740
to mind.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,380
Now, on with the show.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,740
Hey, everybody.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,740
Howdy.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,010
It's episode 100.

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,890
Three digits of A.V.

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,890
Testing.

14
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,610
I'm here with Brent and we have all three of our listeners on the line as well.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,050
And we will hear from each of them throughout this episode.

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,490
So I say we...

17
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,370
Do you have anything to say, Brent?

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,370
Are you here?

19
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,650
No, let's go.

20
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,650
I'm very excited about today.

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,710
Okay.

22
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,030
I cannot believe it's been 100 episodes, but I would...

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,790
I'm going to take some glory away from the three.

24
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:10,260
And because this feels better for me to say it, but Brent, it is only your 99th episode.

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,260
I hate you.

26
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,620
Just for the record, the look of despair on his face was priceless.

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,860
Real quick, before we get started, I want to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor,

28
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,020
which is PractiTest, from Joel, who is one of the three who could not make it today.

29
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,380
And PractiTest, triple dub dot practice test dot com.

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,180
As you are aware, there is no one size fits all in testing.

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,940
That's why they built PractiTest, to be a centralized solution that supports testing

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,980
of different types and sizes.

33
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,780
Scripted, exploratory, automated, whatever.

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,940
They envision a place where all testing data will reside, so stakeholders can generate

35
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,000
the information required for their needs.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Another issue they're trying to solve is that as you create more and more tests and more

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,600
types of tests, you end up having a lot of data in the system.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,840
And if you have too much data, it can be harmful because you may end up just not looking

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,360
at it at all.

40
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,520
That's why they introduced a revolutionary approach to data organization.

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,840
Instead of burying the data in folders within folders within folders, they allow users to

42
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,160
work with hierarchical filter trees that are based on the same data you are storing.

43
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,360
This enables you to organize information in more flexible and even multiple ways, helping

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,920
you to generate better reports and visibility into your product and process.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,480
They also believe that a tester's job is to not test for the sake of testing, as

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,400
we believe on ABI testing, but to create visibility and provide information that will

47
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
help the team release better products and do it faster.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,280
For that reason, having a platform that supports testing is not enough, and we put a lot of

49
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,720
effort into the dashboard.

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,520
They put a lot of effort into the dashboard and reporting metrics to make sure any stakeholders

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,240
can get the relevant information they need, in the format they need it and when they

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,340
need it.

53
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,100
Brent and I got a tour of the product.

54
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,700
We love it, and we think you should check it out.

55
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,940
Again, it's triple dub dot practice test dot com.

56
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,420
And now, on with the fun part of the show.

57
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
Brent, you taking selfies?

58
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm just going to post them to Slack.

60
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,040
We have a couple of our three listeners on the line.

61
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,680
It looks like a whole bunch of them are in chat.

62
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,960
I'm not sure how to do this.

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I'm just going to call on people.

64
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
Is that cool?

65
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,280
If you don't have any, if you're just here to listen to everything to say, maybe that's

66
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,120
cool and we can always come back to people.

67
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,560
Maybe I'll follow chat after I kind of go through everyone in alphabetical order and

68
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,360
just say if you have something you want to say, a question you have for us.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,890
If you have a question, we will try and be brief.

70
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,290
As I stare at Brent, we'll try and be brief.

71
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,610
We must be brief and I will jot down notes of anything that we should dive into later.

72
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:42,900
And maybe we'll just go through it that way.

73
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,420
As you can tell, we're carefully planned and meticulous.

74
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,140
Actually in a perfect world, our A.B.

75
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,180
testing assistant would be here to, in like a green room, like they have on the radio

76
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,070
shows to kind of pre-screen the calls and bring them to us.

77
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:04,070
So I'm going to go in alphabetical order, as I said, and we'll see if we can hear

78
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,950
people and get them on the show.

79
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,150
I pressed the total wrong button.

80
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,030
Antonio, why don't you unmute and say something to Brent and I?

81
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,830
I just want to thank you guys for everything you do for the community.

82
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:21,110
You guys, between the five and five thing you do on your blog posts and all the podcasts

83
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,110
you do, the talks you guys give at different conferences, you guys put a lot out there

84
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,990
and you guys are trying to really make waves and evolve the testing community to be more

85
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,710
as basically the technology evolves and as everything evolves around us.

86
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,070
I'm not going to lie, I don't agree with everything you guys say, but I do love the

87
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,310
fact that you guys are doing a lot for the community and I've learned a lot in these

88
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,870
past, I'd say two years since I've been on the podcast listening to you guys.

89
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,870
So thanks.

90
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,870
Thank you, Tony.

91
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,550
And after I heard you talk, I go, that's not on Tony.

92
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,550
Oh, that's Tony.

93
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,930
Thanks, man.

94
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,890
That's really cool to hear.

95
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,570
And then one thing Brent and I both brought in and for those not in the Slack channel

96
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:07,050
and not in the big well planned out far in advance thing, we have postcards.

97
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,570
We both thought to bring in today because a bunch of you send in postcards thanking us

98
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,570
what we're doing.

99
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,570
It's really, really cool.

100
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,450
I tweeted a picture of one set that I received.

101
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,970
So thank you everybody for that.

102
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,170
That's super cool.

103
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,410
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

104
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:31,090
As Alan and I have said on multiple times, oh, we should have brought the tequila today.

105
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:35,460
We do this for this.

106
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,220
This list of postcards I have on the desk right now is the whole reason why I'm in this.

107
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Cool, man.

108
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,340
It's not for dealing with you, which by the way has been five years.

109
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:50,020
And we've known each other longer than that.

110
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,180
I never thought it would be like this, man.

111
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,180
No.

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,770
It's not going to be like this.

113
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,770
Alright, who's next?

114
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,770
Cycling through.

115
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,770
Andrew Morton.

116
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,000
Hello.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hi, I'm Hi, Brent.

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How are you?

119
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Very well, Andrew.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Thank you.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Cool.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,560
So I'd just like to echo Antonio and thank you both for the podcast and especially for

123
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,200
the modern testing principles.

124
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,600
I certainly managed to distill a lot of my own thinking in a much better, more eloquent

125
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,120
way than I ever could.

126
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,320
So that's brilliant.

127
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Thank you very much.

128
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,080
I don't know that everyone's ever called me eloquent before.

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Definitely not.

130
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,640
I mean, people have called us charming, which we reject this notion.

131
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah, actually, it's been an interditive process.

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,960
We started, we went through it.

133
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,320
Like I do like a lot of how the three have contributed.

134
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,920
The MOT publish has really helped to simplify the language.

135
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,920
That's Ministry of Test?

136
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Yep.

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Yeah, I should know.

138
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,320
I work for them, which is a disclaimer.

139
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:58,590
So I don't know how much credit is us versus the community because that's really been an

140
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,590
iterative process.

141
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,590
Yeah.

142
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,550
And please reflect back on those of you that were around a year or a year and a half ago

143
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:09,530
and we first started coming up with the idea of principles, the community helped vet the

144
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,950
crap out of those.

145
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:17,760
So a lot of the eloquence came out of a lot of debate and discussion, which I think

146
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
is great.

147
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,160
It's like the way I like to build software is the way we built the principles.

148
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
Yeah.

149
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:30,000
And it's interesting that it's viewed as its own thing now, given that a non-trivial portion

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,840
of it was just blatantly stolen from people like Lisa and others.

151
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,560
All right.

152
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,720
Moving on down the list.

153
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,960
Amanda.

154
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,720
I wonder if you guys would get back to me.

155
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,640
You disappeared down my list for a minute.

156
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,180
I tend to be towards the top.

157
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,180
Can you speak up?

158
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,180
You're pretty quiet in our headsets.

159
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,470
Okay.

160
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:02,470
I just switched machines to a new Windows 10 machine, so I'm still figuring out.

161
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,470
Yeah.

162
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,750
I blame Windows, but anyway, go on.

163
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,750
This is actually my first Zoom meeting with the new machine.

164
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,430
So we're all testing here.

165
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,670
I have been listening for quite a while.

166
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:22,990
I don't think quite all 100 episodes, but it's definitely my favorite podcast.

167
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:30,870
It even beats the West Wing weekly, as in the order of excitement when the new episodes

168
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,870
drop.

169
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,060
And disappointment after you listen for a while.

170
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,100
Yeah, I'm thinking Amanda likes punishment.

171
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,380
That's what it describes.

172
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:51,230
Well, it's comforting to hear the rambling that my own brain rambles quite a bit, so

173
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,790
it's nice to hear the stream of consciousness isn't just confined to me.

174
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:06,040
But I really appreciate the conversations that have happened on the podcast.

175
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:15,520
In the time since I've started listening, I've taken over as a manager of a QA team, and

176
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,000
our previous manager had been managing since the 90s.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,720
So I really related, especially to the episode where we were doing the modern testing versus

178
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,160
old school testing.

179
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,520
Yeah, that was fun.

180
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,320
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:41,280
So I've that some of the things that were said in that episode in particular have really

182
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:48,240
helped me articulate why we need to modernize in some areas.

183
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:57,120
I guess the, not really a question, I guess, but the challenge I'm facing right now is

184
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:05,370
how to have some of the tough conversations with my team who has been here since, not

185
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,130
since the 90s exactly, but they're very comfortable with the old school way of doing things.

186
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,570
And I think that's really the change or die.

187
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,930
I think I'm having to get increasingly frank with some people on that.

188
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,850
So that's the current challenge I am dealing with.

189
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:34,730
So I'm willing to hear more from the three as to how they've dealt with that either now

190
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,780
or online later on.

191
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,940
It's interesting that you mentioned that because I've been talking...

192
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,100
I've sent a few samples in our Slack group, but I send a weekly newsletter to my quality

193
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
community.

194
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,740
They're not even mine, the quality community at Unity.

195
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,620
And one of the things I've been talking about quite a bit lately has been feedback and

196
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,400
how to give good feedback.

197
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,880
And the other thing I do is I consider part of my job is growing leaders.

198
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,040
We talk a lot about, there's this line from a book by Heffetz, which I've mentioned

199
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,720
50 times on the podcast.

200
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
I mentioned, again, leadership on the line, which is, leadership is disappointing people

201
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
at a level they can absorb.

202
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,520
And I love that line because you can't push them too hard or they freak out.

203
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,120
But if you don't push them at all and they're complacent, you don't get any results.

204
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,840
So it's just finding that right balance.

205
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,320
We'll dive deep into that in an upcoming episode.

206
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,160
But yeah, happy to help out there.

207
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Cool. Thanks for listening.

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,800
Yeah.

209
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,240
All right. Let's move on.

210
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,360
Butch.

211
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,400
Howdy.

212
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,320
Happy 100th episode.

213
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,120
Thank you.

214
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,200
Yeah. Thanks for all that you'll do for the testing community.

215
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
I do have a question.

216
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,480
Awesome.

217
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,440
I've got leaders in my organization, one in particular I had a conversation with.

218
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,800
He's a developer lead.

219
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,800
And how would you respond to someone who's in that role that says to me when I'm talking

220
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,760
about testing, you know the old saying, the person who wrote the code shouldn't be the

221
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,920
one to test their code.

222
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,880
They've got their blinders on.

223
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,390
How can I help drive a quality culture with that leader?

224
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:21,520
The thing I do the most in that situation is one is I stop myself from rolling my eyes.

225
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,920
I don't.

226
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,860
But pairing, pairing, pairing.

227
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,620
I think pair testing with someone like that is so advantageous for both of you.

228
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:36,220
You as the test specialist learn more about the ideas, what's going on into the implementation

229
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,460
of the code.

230
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:44,960
But what I found 1000 times out of 1000 is that people are able to defocus, take those

231
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,520
blinders off and actually test their code pretty darn well.

232
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,120
There are things that a good testing specialist will find that that developer won't find.

233
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,720
But boy, they can.

234
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,270
I have found again, every single case, no exception.

235
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,710
Through pairing, I have been able to convince developers that not only have they been able

236
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,320
to test, but been able to test their own code.

237
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,090
There are multiple techniques that I've seen that work very well.

238
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:22,680
I'll say the ones when I'm in the management role, the one that I found the most effective

239
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:30,920
is I just basically say you're going to own the quality and we're not going to we're

240
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:35,800
going to my test resources are going to spend time on by resources.

241
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,580
He means human beings.

242
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:48,860
My test, Peter's, yes, are going to spend more of their time evaluating data in production.

243
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,860
And so what we're going to do is grease the wheels for when they do check in, they go

244
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,940
straight to production.

245
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,860
So I try to create a little bit of a fire saying, hey, I'm tired of test being a bottleneck.

246
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,420
That's going to be able to check straight in.

247
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,380
Here's the mitigations that I know of that work very well, as Alan pointed out, pair

248
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
programming.

249
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:20,480
Although here, I would probably do a mob and have two devs pair programming with a tester

250
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,800
looking behind them asking questions.

251
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,440
Because what you're really trying to do is is make them realize that that objectivity

252
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,680
or lack of objectivity mantra is baloney.

253
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:47,030
Another great trick is just get a couple people going to and getting TDD training.

254
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:54,420
TDD is absolutely my favorite way to start people into this.

255
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,100
Alan's giving me the shut the hell up sign.

256
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,140
I know how to recognize, oh, Brent's going to keep going, man.

257
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:07,100
That's a start if that's not enough, ping us and we will talk more about that later.

258
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,940
I want to make sure we don't skip the people whose name begins with Z.

259
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
Awesome.

260
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Thank you all.

261
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
Yeah, you're welcome, man.

262
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
Thanks for listening.

263
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,680
Chris Blaine.

264
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Hi.

265
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
I'm happy 100th.

266
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,960
I really enjoy the fact that I think you've been able to move the testing conversations

267
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,920
forward that were probably stalled for a while in the testing community.

268
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,480
That's something that I think is really important and it's fun to check in every week and hear

269
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,240
your thinking of all, see how you're moving through your careers.

270
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm very interested if we can get more this week about the end of the transformation that

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,840
you're doing, Alan, if you can talk about that yet.

272
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Oh, yeah.

273
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,840
Yeah.

274
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,080
One of the things I want to do is work on having that quality culture and building that

275
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
and things like that.

276
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,190
So I'm always very keen to hear that when you talk about that.

277
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,630
In the podcast each week, it's been really valuable to me and I think it's a great way

278
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,390
for the testing community at large to move forward.

279
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,540
Alan, you're inspiring threes of people all over the world.

280
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,540
I am.

281
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
I am.

282
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,540
So I finally officially start my new role at Unity on Monday.

283
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:30,980
And I took job B, which is basically a director of delivery, working across our monetization

284
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:38,300
organization, which is largely ads, just helping that team of 160 engineers work together better,

285
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,940
increase velocity, increase quality.

286
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,340
So obviously I have my quality slant in there.

287
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,180
I've described this as an iceberg job, meaning I go in knowing what about 10% of the role

288
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,340
is and as I start exploring that 10%, I'll discover eventually what the other 90% is.

289
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,220
And I really like being in that situation, so I'm looking forward to that.

290
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,840
But really that's all I know about it.

291
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,560
I know I will spend the first couple weeks talking to a lot of people, figuring out what's

292
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
up.

293
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,080
And these are teams I work with before and people I work with before, so I have some pretty

294
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,880
good ideas going in.

295
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,400
But there'll be a lot of discovery, figuring out what's going on.

296
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,510
And there was some bureaucracy and red tape in the way of getting it over.

297
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,030
The Unity is a new enough company, a small enough company, that internal transfers are

298
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,030
fairly rare.

299
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,470
And internal transfers of senior roles are, I could be the first one ever.

300
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,710
So there was some stuff involved in that.

301
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,190
It's all taken care of finally, so I'm looking forward to get going.

302
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:40,710
And I will be talking about that more and more as the episodes go on, so I'm looking

303
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,710
forward to that.

304
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,430
Well, congrats on the role change.

305
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,430
Yeah, it'll be fun.

306
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,320
I'm pretty excited about it.

307
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,680
All right.

308
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,800
The one and only Chris Canst.

309
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
Chris!

310
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,640
Wow, that's a great intro.

311
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Thank you.

312
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,960
I want to know, I'm going to mess up so bad now that you said that.

313
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:08,760
But no, I wanted to come on and say thanks to both of everything that you both are doing.

314
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,360
I think the modern testing principles are great.

315
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:19,320
I like that there's this North Star that people can use to understand what the future

316
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,280
of modern testing looks like.

317
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,290
Even though a lot of these aren't new, the fact that they're all combined and packaged

318
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,090
makes a lot of sense.

319
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:35,290
But my question is, have you seen from the people that you've talked to and the responses

320
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,810
that you've got, are there certain industries that are actually better able to adopt the

321
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,090
modern testing principles better than others?

322
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:49,450
Are consumer internet companies able to make that transition better than say, healthcare

323
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,050
companies or are mobile companies, that kind of thing?

324
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:56,850
Are there specific industries where it's much easier for them to go, oh, this makes

325
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,040
sense?

326
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Yes.

327
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,290
All right.

328
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,290
Next person?

329
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,290
No.

330
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,480
I'm kidding.

331
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,080
I'll go first.

332
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,480
I do think it's very tightly aligned and there's a lot of literature on this around even

333
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,900
agile.

334
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Right.

335
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:25,020
As you all know, modern testing principles has a strong foundation in agile and lean processes.

336
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:35,630
I will definitely say if your product is something that's service-based, if you're not on something

337
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,710
like modern testing, you're already behind the times.

338
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:48,550
And then going to the final scaler where there's something that's very, has a long lead time.

339
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:58,300
For example, I saw a message recently about automated airplanes.

340
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:05,900
Doing reactionary stuff, there needs to be a QA department for something along that line.

341
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:13,080
To assure you minimize what we've called here as sort of catastrophes in production.

342
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:23,420
The way I would phrase that is that the larger the risk, the more likely you need a dedicated

343
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,860
testing specialist or specialist.

344
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,280
Yes.

345
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,960
So that can be true in other aspects of software also.

346
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720
I will add to it in the larger the lead time.

347
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
Yes.

348
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,000
There is, I'll just throw another book reference out real quick.

349
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,560
Steve Denning, I became a fan of his when he wrote a book called The Leader's Guide to

350
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,160
Radical Management.

351
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,840
He's a business author, writes for Forbes, but he had discovered agile and seen a lot

352
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,400
of applications for it in business.

353
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,920
So it was very early on, well fairly early on in the world of agile.

354
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,600
So he didn't call out agile as much.

355
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:00,600
But his latest book is called The Age of Agile or The Speed of Agile or something.

356
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,720
You can look it up, Steve Denning.

357
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,560
There's one profile of a team at Microsoft, but there's profiles of different industries

358
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,560
applying agile.

359
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,640
And of course, as Brett mentioned, we're built upon agile.

360
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,800
We're built upon, I mean, if you've read the lean startup, you can see where we stole a lot

361
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,800
of stuff from.

362
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,120
And we also build a lot on what Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory wrote in agile testing.

363
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,000
Full, stealing, you know, steal like an artist.

364
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's what that would be.

365
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,720
Oh no, I mean, the people we've stole from is long.

366
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,920
True, true, true.

367
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,280
We're near to seeing pop and dikes.

368
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
It's long list.

369
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,370
Shall we go on?

370
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,370
Yeah.

371
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,370
Where am I?

372
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,660
Connor.

373
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,660
Hey guys.

374
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
Hello, hello.

375
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,660
Hi.

376
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,660
Can you hear me okay?

377
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,950
Yes.

378
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,950
Perfect.

379
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:52,590
Yeah, I just said it, John, because I'm enjoying the podcast and I want to thank you for it.

380
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:56,830
I kind of got to a point in my career where I no longer wanted to be the bottleneck.

381
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:59,070
I wanted to learn more about coaching teams.

382
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:05,750
I started to use analytics to develop how customers are using the product and also getting more

383
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,190
engaged with customers, getting on customer calls and getting involved more in beta.

384
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,630
So at that point in my career, I saw the modern testing principle the first time, started

385
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:14,630
listening to the podcast.

386
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,910
So it was really good at that point to make sure that I found modern testing principles.

387
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,010
So I want to thank you both.

388
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,010
Oh, you're welcome.

389
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,010
You're welcome.

390
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,010
Brent's tearing up a little just so you guys know.

391
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,010
I am.

392
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:30,410
So I have to listen to everyone coming in and say, oh, I want to be just like you, Alan.

393
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,650
I want to be a coach too.

394
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,130
But I absolutely love it when I hear people saying, oh yeah, I'm moving into the data.

395
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,290
I'm moving into the customer analytics.

396
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:44,450
I haven't yet heard anyone saying, yeah, I've dropped it.

397
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:51,330
I'm following, I'm going into a data science role yet, but I've still got my fingers crossed.

398
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,530
Lisa's the closest one.

399
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:58,460
But even then, I think what's her title?

400
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,860
I'll ask her in a minute.

401
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,990
Yes.

402
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,990
Right.

403
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,390
Where was I?

404
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,390
Thank you very much, Connor.

405
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:06,390
We're glad to have you on board.

406
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,390
We'll grab our help once in a while.

407
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,390
Emma.

408
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,390
Hello, everyone.

409
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,550
Hello.

410
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,550
Can you hear me?

411
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,550
Yes.

412
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,640
Yes.

413
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Congratulations to this episode.

414
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
This is my first time live with you.

415
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,640
I'm very interested in modern testing.

416
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:32,640
I'm following your video in YouTube and also in Slack channel.

417
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:44,640
I have good news that I'll speak about modern testing in a conference, in IEEE DTS conference

418
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,640
next.

419
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:55,640
I'll talk about the transition from traditional agile and modern testing, also the role of

420
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,640
a Gila coach.

421
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:06,640
So, I'm very glad to be here and hope to, it's a challenge, modern testing, really a big

422
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
challenge for me.

423
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,640
And I'm learning a lot when following you.

424
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,020
Thank you, everyone.

425
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:21,020
I'm so excited to hear about, this is not the first time, but I'm loving that other

426
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,020
people are talking about modern testing.

427
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
It's exciting to me.

428
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,020
It's fantastic.

429
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,020
Grant, we made a thing.

430
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,020
Yeah, I know, right?

431
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
It's really cool.

432
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,020
We're very excited.

433
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,020
Please let us know how it goes.

434
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,020
I'm both flattered and excited and all those things.

435
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:43,020
Yeah, I'd love to, when you've done the presentation, I'd love to have the, to get

436
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:50,650
the deck up on the Slack channel and as well as hear your sense of how it went.

437
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,650
Awesome.

438
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,650
Thank you, Emna.

439
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,750
Glad to have you here.

440
00:24:54,750 --> 00:25:01,750
And then someone who gets name dropped on the show more than once, Lisa Crispin.

441
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,580
It's so exciting to be here.

442
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,580
Congratulations on number 100.

443
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,580
Yeah.

444
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,580
Thank you, Lisa.

445
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:14,580
I'm trying to remember why I started listening to your podcast.

446
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
I'm not going to say that.

447
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,580
I'm not going to say that.

448
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
I'm going to say that.

449
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,580
But I happened to start listening right at episode 60, I think.

450
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,580
And you did that.

451
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:27,580
You did mention me and Janet in our book and I was like, wow, they have, they have

452
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
found value in our book.

453
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,580
And of course all the other people who contributed to our books.

454
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,580
And so that was exciting.

455
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,580
And of course, flattery gets you everywhere.

456
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,580
So I started listening, but, but really truly, you know, I was listening to that justice.

457
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,580
Like I had just heard Angie Jones on a different podcast talking about testing

458
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,580
artificial intelligence and machine learning.

459
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,580
And, you know, I was getting interested in data science.

460
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,580
And hearing this hearing you talk about the next step after being an agile

461
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,580
tester, you really need to learn this data science thing.

462
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,580
You need to ramp up the coaching thing.

463
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,580
And the coaching thing helped me right away in the job I was in because, you

464
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,580
know, I was supporting up to 20 developers at one time and kind of switched

465
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,580
over to that test consultant role there, which is something Janet and I

466
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,580
always had promoted, but not to that extent.

467
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,580
And that worked really well.

468
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,580
And then just getting interested in the data science and machine learning

469
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,580
led me into my current job.

470
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,580
I was testing advocate for a vendor whose tool uses data science and machine

471
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,580
learning.

472
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,580
And I have not learned about enough about those things yet, but it's super fun.

473
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,580
So thank you.

474
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,580
You've like helped me transform my career, which is really exciting.

475
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Well, yeah.

476
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,580
As you know, we stole a great deal from it.

477
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,580
You know, in a lot of contexts, we do frame what we're talking about as sort

478
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,580
of the next logical step from agile testing.

479
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,580
Right.

480
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,580
They're not mutually exclusive by any means.

481
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Exactly.

482
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,580
And then one thing I wanted to mention, I mentioned this once before on the

483
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
podcast.

484
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,580
It's worth mentioning again because I mentioned my community, my quality

485
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
community at Unity.

486
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,580
And it was about maybe two or three months into my role there.

487
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,580
I started there over two years ago when I realized, oh, I really have a

488
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,580
community, this matrix organization.

489
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,580
I'm big on building communities, as Brent knows, and that's helped connect

490
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
people.

491
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,580
But it was then like maybe three or four months later, I was rereading

492
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
agile testing.

493
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,580
And then right there, maybe it's chapter three, the book on managing

494
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,580
teams talks about the manager runs a community.

495
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Totally paraphrased.

496
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,060
I thought, yes, yes.

497
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,060
And maybe, I don't know if it was something I'd read and forgot about,

498
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,060
something that was like in my subconscious.

499
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,060
But I love when I read a book and it reaches the same conclusions I

500
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
reached on my own.

501
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,060
It feels validating.

502
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
Worth mentioning because I mentioned community earlier.

503
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Well, that is nice to hear.

504
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
And it's nice to hear it works for other people.

505
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
Yeah.

506
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,060
That's exactly what we think about modern testing.

507
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,350
Very cool.

508
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,350
Thank you for listening, Lisa.

509
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,350
It means a lot to us.

510
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,350
Thank you.

511
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:11,350
And Lisa, let me know how I can help you on understanding the

512
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,350
data science part deeper.

513
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,410
Awesome.

514
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,410
Thank you.

515
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,410
Yeah.

516
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,410
We will.

517
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,410
But happy to make that happen.

518
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,800
Cool.

519
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,180
Matt.

520
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,620
Matt Dills.

521
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
He might have fell asleep.

522
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
Can I come back to Matt?

523
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
He says he doesn't have a mic.

524
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Oh, that's cool.

525
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Cool.

526
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Thank you for listening.

527
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
Thanks for being here.

528
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,620
Thanks for listening in.

529
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,620
If you have anything you want to say, you can check it in chat

530
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,620
and someone can read it to me.

531
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:44,620
But it looks like there's a Real Salt Lake fan on the podcast.

532
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:47,620
And as you all know in our prediction episode, I predicted

533
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,620
good things for the sounders who are doing very well as opposed

534
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
to Real Salt Lake.

535
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,620
But Michael Richards, what do you have to say?

536
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
You had to bring that up, didn't you?

537
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,620
Yeah.

538
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,840
Long time listener, first time caller here.

539
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
But not first time on the podcast.

540
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,840
That's correct.

541
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Yeah.

542
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,840
Yeah.

543
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Considering that, you know, happy 99th, Brent.

544
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Anyway.

545
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Yeah.

546
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,840
So we're done.

547
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,910
Long time listeners.

548
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,910
We did like in the 40s.

549
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,910
I was at Test Bash Philly and I recorded a whole episode of AB

550
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,910
testing podcast without Brent.

551
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,910
That just means I get to do this twice.

552
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:20,910
So I'll do it next episode.

553
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,910
Percy and Michael and Vernon joined me for a podcast recording.

554
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:23,910
It was a lot of fun.

555
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,910
Anyway, go on.

556
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,910
At some point, Brent, you're going to be doing a test

557
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:28,160
test.

558
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

559
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

560
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

561
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

562
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
I'm going to be doing a test test.

563
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
We're going to be doing a, a podcast recording.

564
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,660
It was a lot of fun anyway, go on.

565
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,160
At some point, you're going to have a deal.

566
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,160
And without, without Alan somehow some way you can't figure out how to use the equipment.

567
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,600
No, I can figure it out.

568
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,120
I have a teenager and we started the equipment in my office.

569
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,540
So maybe that's what I'll do.

570
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,480
Is I'll just meet him, we'll just record one.

571
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
Sure.

572
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,880
Anyway, please go ahead.

573
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,920
I really appreciate all the, the guidance on that.

574
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
That's the best thing I can say.

575
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,920
Alan, you specifically have been kind of a mentor to me,

576
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,080
and I appreciate that because it's really helped drive

577
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,500
the last three to five years of my experiences

578
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,880
in the testing world and where I've come

579
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,920
and where things are going.

580
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,440
And I really vividly see how the industry

581
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,800
is gonna change in the next five years,

582
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,320
and it can't be stopped.

583
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,680
And I really appreciate everything that you have done

584
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,460
and how you kind of coalesce all the ideas

585
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,160
that are out there into one central point.

586
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,200
I love how he phrased that.

587
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,500
One of the things that I think we've been trying to do

588
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,360
for the last five years is just get people to see this

589
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,460
and that it's not a negative thing.

590
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,320
It is, in my humble opinion, just a matter of time.

591
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,800
It really can't be stopped

592
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,440
because it doesn't make business sense.

593
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,360
There's context, as we covered with Chris's question,

594
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,300
there's context where it makes sense and it doesn't today,

595
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,690
but I think even then it's gonna change over time.

596
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,690
And so hopefully we've inspired several people to,

597
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,370
there's a phrase I use,

598
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,270
you can either be the butterfly or you can be the wind.

599
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,210
And I'm hoping we've inspired a lot of folks

600
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,340
to be the wind instead of the butterfly.

601
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,340
And I will say in my closing is,

602
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,640
let's hope there's a hundred more.

603
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,320
Here's 200 more episodes.

604
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Ooh, another five years with Alan.

605
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,320
Another five years.

606
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Oh my God.

607
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,440
Yeah.

608
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:32,210
Luckily it's only once every two weeks.

609
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,530
So we may be able to survive.

610
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,690
As long as you don't die before then.

611
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,530
Or you.

612
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,290
All right, back on positive notes, Mohammed.

613
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,600
Hi, I just wanted to say thank you for the hundredth episode.

614
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,720
I've been hearing your podcasts since a while

615
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,040
and has been amazing.

616
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,120
And I just want to say to Alan that is article fear factor

617
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,520
and the sentence for making the job obsolete

618
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,600
and I just have like been an eye opener for myself.

619
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,160
So thanks for that.

620
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,730
And can you hear me by the way?

621
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:04,090
Yeah, we gotcha.

622
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,930
Awesome.

623
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,290
And the modern testing principles,

624
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,450
I mean, they're quite interesting because you know,

625
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,290
we've never met and this is how somehow we drive

626
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,370
our testing in the company I work for,

627
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,890
which was like quite interesting.

628
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,690
So thanks for that as well.

629
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,610
Yeah, this is everything I have to say.

630
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,450
Thanks.

631
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,970
Hey, Mohammed, just making sure,

632
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,810
I think I know who you are from the Slack channel.

633
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,770
Are you a developer now?

634
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,330
No, no, no, I don't think you know me.

635
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:35,290
No, I work for a company called Acres Global.

636
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:37,560
I'm a key principle guy there.

637
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,880
Okay.

638
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,840
All right.

639
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,160
Wrong fellow, but thank you for listening.

640
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,430
Glad we're able to help.

641
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,430
On the podcast for the second time ever,

642
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,070
along with Michael Richards, Percy.

643
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,030
Hey, hey.

644
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:58,100
Hey, Percy from New Jersey.

645
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,460
Percy from Jersey.

646
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,260
Thanks for getting that dad joke.

647
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,860
Of course, takes one to know on, right?

648
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,020
Yes, absolutely.

649
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,100
Love dad jokes.

650
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,580
All right, man.

651
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,900
So I actually remember when I started listening

652
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,340
to AB testing, I'm gonna give credit for,

653
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,540
credit is due and that's to Michael Larson

654
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,300
for putting up a blog post on,

655
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,420
I think he wrote like an end of year blog post that says,

656
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,140
these are the best podcasts that you need

657
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,660
to be able to listen to for the incoming year.

658
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,460
And on that list is AB testing.

659
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,860
And I think you guys just put out

660
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,940
the last episode of 2014.

661
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,780
So that would be somewhere in the teens still.

662
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,620
So that was the first time I actually-

663
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,280
It wasn't even very good back then.

664
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,840
Well, that was like, I got lucky with that episode

665
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,520
because I think you guys were talking about,

666
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,000
you know, the fundamental differences

667
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,920
between generalizing specialists

668
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,120
and specializing generalists.

669
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,760
And then it kind of, my interest just kind of

670
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,160
ballooned from there.

671
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,440
Was that the one where Alan and I finally close

672
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,980
on the debate between him and I on this one?

673
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,860
It might have been.

674
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,980
I mean, you guys were still both in Microsoft

675
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:15,460
and well, of course, it kind of was a tangent fest too.

676
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:18,020
So it was a typical episode.

677
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,140
I must say, right?

678
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,000
But yeah, I can't thank you guys enough for,

679
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
you know, the amount of work that you guys have put in,

680
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,640
you know, the fact that you guys listened to us

681
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,760
or even take the time to listen to us

682
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,440
with our really highly opinionated,

683
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,960
you know, ideas sometimes completely canner

684
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
against what you guys are thinking about.

685
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,400
It did force me to think about a lot of stuff.

686
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,920
And I've gone to apply specifically a lot

687
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,240
within the data science stuff

688
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,640
that Brent has been talking about,

689
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,080
you know, how we were able to improve,

690
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,360
you know, simplifying our regression strategy

691
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,040
and looking into, you know, customer usage data

692
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,160
as well as performance testing.

693
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:02,620
Actually that did streamline a lot of the stuff

694
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,020
that we work when it comes to performance test design

695
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,900
and looking into how our customers actually use the product

696
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,260
instead of just thinking,

697
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,380
maybe this is how they will use our product.

698
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,780
So we have, you know, very decent source of truth,

699
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,620
you know, from there.

700
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,460
Man, I can go on forever,

701
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,020
but I'm going to yield the floor to whoever's next.

702
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,140
Again, thank you so much for, you know,

703
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,420
putting up with everyone else

704
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,180
and making sure your ideas are being known

705
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,540
to the rest of the world.

706
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,580
I will say before Alan has a chance that of all the three,

707
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,820
I actually think Percy has personally put more effort

708
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,780
into the podcast than Alan or I have.

709
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,380
He created the Slack channel.

710
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,900
He actually even invented the hashtag one of the three.

711
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,660
Thanks for being with us all this time, Percy,

712
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:59,320
and thanks for being such an active participant.

713
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,280
Yeah, thanks, thank you, thank you.

714
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
And I would also say that, you know,

715
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,120
you thank us for like listening to the community,

716
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,880
but we can't do it without you.

717
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,040
So we need, we rely on your feedback.

718
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,560
We rely on your strong opinions.

719
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,400
We rely on what you like and don't like.

720
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,630
That's, it's principle number five.

721
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,990
We, only you, our customer,

722
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,190
are able to evaluate the quality of what we produce.

723
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,030
So we want to take your feedback

724
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,870
and use that to answer questions,

725
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:33,110
to figure out topics we need to explain better,

726
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,750
where we need to dive deeper.

727
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,110
Which reminds me, I have to make an announcement later,

728
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,660
I forgot, but remind me.

729
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,500
Okay.

730
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
It just popped up, that was a tangent.

731
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,100
I didn't go down there, I shelved it.

732
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,380
It's an A-B testing first.

733
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,540
Yeah, this is hard.

734
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,120
I was going to give an introduction,

735
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,040
but I will wait till after he talks,

736
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,080
and then I'll talk about some stuff that Rob's been doing.

737
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,940
So Rob.

738
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,820
Hello?

739
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,660
Oh, you can hear me.

740
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,380
Am I the only Rob?

741
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,780
You're the only Rob.

742
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,020
Oh, okay, yeah.

743
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,580
So I love the podcast actually, guys.

744
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,740
So I wanted to thank you, like everyone else.

745
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,300
And weirdly enough, I think I was doing modern testing

746
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,500
before I even knew what modern testing was.

747
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,060
So I started hearing some interesting things around

748
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,980
about modern testing, now rent and stuff.

749
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,390
I think I'm doing color actually.

750
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,830
I've introduced the modern testing podcast to me.

751
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,750
You know, I've had huge interest in testability

752
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:32,550
and a huge interest in quality coaching and test coaching.

753
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,510
And I've been working as a test coach now probably

754
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,430
for two years.

755
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,710
Talk a lot about that.

756
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,790
Connor as well works on that kind of stuff with me

757
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:40,830
and quality engineering.

758
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:43,270
And what we've been doing is working together

759
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,150
to build a vision for the future of testing

760
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,070
in our organization and the principles

761
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,510
and your podcasts have influenced that greatly as well.

762
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,350
So it's been a big, big factor for us.

763
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,350
So I just really wanted to thank you for that.

764
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:02,110
Really, really cool ideas, pushing the boundaries

765
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:05,030
and there's so much in common with my own beliefs

766
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,990
and thoughts around testing that I had to be

767
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:11,030
on the call today to just say thanks as well.

768
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,310
Totally appreciate that.

769
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:16,990
Where are you in your business culture change?

770
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,630
So yeah, so as I said, I'm head of testing

771
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,150
and a quality coach.

772
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:26,030
So I work with a team of testers

773
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,910
and we're trying to influence the change

774
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,510
and testing across the organization.

775
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,550
So I actually work with the development teams

776
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:35,510
to actually build testability into the product,

777
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:40,510
identify quality goals and I'm more influenced

778
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,430
to teams rather than actually test anymore.

779
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,790
So I do very little testing anymore, unfortunately,

780
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,670
but it's more around strategy and direction

781
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,060
and developing, identifying goals

782
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,820
and building good practices that allow our teams

783
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,580
to deliver quality quicker.

784
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,980
Awesome, love it.

785
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,660
That's a such a.

786
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:05,260
That mantra, I think is the single most important thing,

787
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,540
what you just said is, right?

788
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,260
So for so long, test has been accused of slowing things down

789
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,620
or stopping ship and we need to change that direction.

790
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,460
It needs to be quality and speed, not or.

791
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,380
Yeah, yeah, so the maintenance.

792
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,820
So what's great for us now is we've moved away

793
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,020
from the area from focusing primarily on automation,

794
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,540
maintaining debugging and automation.

795
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,100
And we're going and doing the things

796
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,140
that you're discussing like the looking at data analytics,

797
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,100
driving our understanding the user using the data analytics

798
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,940
but also things like ethnographic research, things like that.

799
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,820
So we go and use the research talk directly to them.

800
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,660
We were very big, I pushed user story mapping

801
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,100
in a big way so we get different elements

802
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,940
of the business involved in the conversation

803
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,220
before we build anything

804
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,660
and getting those diverse perspectives involved

805
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,580
is hugely important to understanding quality,

806
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,740
not just from a user's perspective

807
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,180
but from the perspectives of everyone

808
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,780
who interacts with the product.

809
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,660
So there's also things around building skills

810
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,820
across the teams in deep exploratory testing

811
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,020
and risk analysis and a whole host of things.

812
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,180
Very cool to hear.

813
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:19,060
And the introduction I was going to add is like,

814
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,660
I know from talks you've done, I think at Test Bash.

815
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,180
Yeah.

816
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,020
That you're doing that,

817
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,940
you're into that coaching consulting world,

818
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,060
which I think is at some point,

819
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,460
maybe that's the next talk I give about modern testing

820
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,980
is postmodern testing

821
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,340
and talk about what roles people move into.

822
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,940
I can talk about myself of course.

823
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,100
There are other people like,

824
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,860
I can talk about Brent moving into a data science role.

825
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,020
I can talk about you moving into a coaching role.

826
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,660
I think there may be something there.

827
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,540
So I'm glad you're doing what we're doing.

828
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,180
Yeah, it's very interesting

829
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,220
because Test just have these critical thinking skills

830
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,940
and analysis skills that can be applied

831
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,460
in a fractal manner across businesses

832
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,260
with different layers in different ways.

833
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,940
So whether you start with hypothesis driven development

834
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,700
and others just loads of stuff that we can use.

835
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,700
I love everything you're saying, Rob.

836
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,700
Everything.

837
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,140
Brent's giggling.

838
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:15,980
All right, man.

839
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,820
Thanks a lot.

840
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,660
Thank you very much.

841
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,260
Is this so cool to hear?

842
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,940
We should have 100th episode more often.

843
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,980
We could do it next time.

844
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,580
It'll be mine apparently.

845
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,420
Yeah.

846
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,420
There'll be one, we'll move on.

847
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:34,690
We have the infamous and up.

848
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:38,090
I guess it's not too late in Europe.

849
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,970
As Brent refers to him, Pratrick.

850
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,810
That is the rest of us calling him

851
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:48,210
the test pappy himself, Patrick Prill.

852
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,050
Hi guys.

853
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:49,890
Hi Patrick.

854
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,130
Or Pratrick.

855
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,730
Pratrick.

856
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,570
Hi, Pills.

857
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,410
No.

858
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,800
Cheers guys.

859
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,960
No, thank you guys for 100 episodes.

860
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,200
It's really great to be there from, I don't know.

861
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,760
I think I started around episode 15 or so.

862
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,910
So it's really great how you evolve the podcast.

863
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,230
And I really have to say that the six little words

864
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,350
of accelerate the achievement of show up with quality

865
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,490
really changed my world.

866
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,450
And these six little words really influenced my attitude

867
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,930
and how to approach my daily work and my decisions.

868
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,860
So thank you for those.

869
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,860
You're welcome.

870
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,110
I think that was a breakthrough for a lot of folks.

871
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,510
Certainly was for me.

872
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,700
Yeah, it definitely was a change in the discussions

873
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,020
in the podcast.

874
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,020
When you guys found that very short summary

875
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:54,140
and you were, I remember that you were very happy

876
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,980
when you found that.

877
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,780
And I think that influenced all that modern testing

878
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,140
principle idea.

879
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:05,540
So that was really, really great.

880
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,140
I was just, my mind was wandering back

881
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,840
and of course you've been listening for a long time.

882
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,240
You've kind of seen, just seeing it guys know,

883
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,400
Brent and I rarely talk outside of the podcast recording,

884
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,080
especially since I left Microsoft.

885
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,680
Occasionally there'll be a message back and forth on Slack.

886
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,680
Maybe I have something I want feedback on or an idea.

887
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,680
But really everything we've, you've witnessed as listeners

888
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,840
the development of everything we've done

889
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,180
because we've done 99% of it recorded

890
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,500
and then published to the internet.

891
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:43,940
So I just kind of thinking back,

892
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,240
I remember having the notion,

893
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,160
I think I just read Ray Dalio's principles

894
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,400
and having a notion that we should have modern,

895
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,720
we've been talking about modern testing for a while,

896
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,480
we should have principles.

897
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:57,960
And then I wrote some out and Brent-

898
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,000
Slaughtered them.

899
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,040
Yeah, which I love.

900
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:05,040
I think I really believe in good ideas

901
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,640
coming from fierce debate.

902
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,080
And then we brought them to the community

903
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,120
and there was more debate.

904
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,480
Then we talked about them and they got tweaked more.

905
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,520
And we thought they would keep on changing

906
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,440
and changing and changing,

907
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,680
but they've been solid now for like a year?

908
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,840
No, more than a year.

909
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,940
As I get older, I refuse to stop,

910
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,180
to look back in time and go,

911
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,660
how long has it been since?

912
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,940
No, I'm just, the reflection was not the time.

913
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,780
It's just the...

914
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:39,060
When you see something come as the evolution,

915
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,380
it's like, how did these start?

916
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,020
What's the origin story of these?

917
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,300
And how did they evolve into this?

918
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:45,140
I don't really recall all the details.

919
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,180
I'd have to go back.

920
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,380
But the cool thing is I could go back

921
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:51,860
and listen to all of our episodes and figure it out.

922
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,140
Yeah, and I still think it's a living document.

923
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:56,980
For sure.

924
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:00,460
The thing is, as mentioned,

925
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,420
for a lot of folks,

926
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,660
modern testing principles are the past already,

927
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,020
but for a lot of folks,

928
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,020
it is still very much sort of a North Star visionary

929
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,220
statement.

930
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,100
And so I think it'll probably still change

931
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,640
as the world shifts towards, well duh,

932
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,480
on where it stands.

933
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,340
So for Patrick,

934
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:32,420
one of my favorite things is,

935
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,460
yeah, he joined the Slack channel early on.

936
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,300
And

937
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,380
if there was,

938
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:42,620
I'll just put it this way,

939
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,380
if there was something stupid, Alan and I said on the podcast,

940
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,660
I could always count on Patrick to call us out.

941
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,700
And then we could fix it,

942
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,980
adjust it or clarify.

943
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,980
Early on in the formative days,

944
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:02,980
Patrick was super important to us.

945
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,460
Thank you for that, Patrick.

946
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,700
You're very welcome.

947
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:12,100
I hope you stick around for the next 100 or 10 or one even.

948
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,320
Of course.

949
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,240
Cool.

950
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,840
I'm gonna mispronounce his name,

951
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,040
so please correct me.

952
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,880
Is it Yuros?

953
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,840
It's Yuros, but

954
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,400
thanks for trying.

955
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,240
Okay.

956
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,680
First of all, I want to congratulate you guys

957
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,280
on a 100 episode.

958
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,120
Thank you.

959
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:40,280
And I was introduced to ABA testing podcast by Patrick

960
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,760
as a matter of speaking.

961
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,060
So thank you, Patrick, for that.

962
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,740
And it was right around when you started talking

963
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,410
about modern testing.

964
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,610
And what struck me most about it is

965
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:58,770
that I felt like I was doing a lot of things already

966
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,850
that you were already talking about,

967
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,710
but you put it so nicely into the words.

968
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,950
And to be honest,

969
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:12,070
I'm still distilling all the principles

970
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,950
and all the, let's say, important details

971
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,280
that you are talking about them.

972
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,360
And if you're okay,

973
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,200
I would like to also contact you in the future

974
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,480
about some things that I have in my mind.

975
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,880
So maybe some details to discuss about.

976
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,200
Of course, of course.

977
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,100
Okay, thank you.

978
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:33,420
And the last thing I wanted to say,

979
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,860
I enjoy your banter at the beginning of the episodes.

980
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:42,180
I learned some important stuff about cooking,

981
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,660
about music and whatnot.

982
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,900
So thank you for that as well.

983
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,140
And I wish you many more episodes.

984
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,020
Thank you very much.

985
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,100
I do have to admit,

986
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,420
sometimes they go on a little bit too long.

987
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,660
Yeah.

988
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,580
I do know there are listeners,

989
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:57,500
probably none of you,

990
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,660
but I do know there are listeners

991
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,260
that kind of skip the first 10 minutes

992
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,380
and wait for us to talk about something interesting.

993
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,990
And that's fine.

994
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,830
I will say,

995
00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:08,110
like one of the first reviews we ever got

996
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,550
for A-B testing was something along the lines of,

997
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,110
it's two guys babbling about,

998
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,350
their vibe was two guys babbling about testing over beers.

999
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,580
We've never actually had beers here,

1000
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,940
but I do like that spirit.

1001
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,460
I do think it's part of the charisma of the...

1002
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,860
That was Michael Larson.

1003
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:33,860
That was the post from Michael Larson.

1004
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,100
I was like, two guys having beers.

1005
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,700
Not knowing we recorded eight o'clock in the morning.

1006
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,150
No.

1007
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,990
Thank you.

1008
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:41,830
Thank you, Eros.

1009
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:44,110
And one thing I wanted to mention,

1010
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:48,790
and before, I'll make sure I haven't missed anybody,

1011
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:52,310
but it was Test Bash one year ago,

1012
00:48:52,310 --> 00:48:55,390
almost exactly where I first gave a talk on modern testing.

1013
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,630
We haven't talked about it for a while,

1014
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,670
but we've been talking about it when I submitted,

1015
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,030
and I'm glad they accepted the talk.

1016
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,220
And it was fun to talk about,

1017
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,220
and this is on the dojo.

1018
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,180
It's their only,

1019
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,020
as far as I know,

1020
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,060
it's still the only ministry attest talk on their dojo

1021
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,500
with an explicit tag on it.

1022
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,670
I got excited.

1023
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:17,510
And when I gave that talk,

1024
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:21,980
the thing that really struck me,

1025
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,820
and people came up to me,

1026
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:23,940
they weren't freaked out,

1027
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,820
but I had people come up to me and say that,

1028
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,140
thank you for giving a label

1029
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:30,820
to the thing I've already been doing.

1030
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,340
I thought, oh my gosh,

1031
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,040
it's not, I'm not scaring the crap out of people.

1032
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,400
This is something they're actually,

1033
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,880
they see happening, something they're already doing.

1034
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,200
So that was really great.

1035
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,520
Then the one, actually, did I skip anybody?

1036
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,880
If I skipped you because I'm blind,

1037
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,560
please unmute and talk.

1038
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:54,690
Otherwise, I'll make a quick announcement.

1039
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,650
Okay, I'm good.

1040
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:57,970
I mentioned Ministry of Test for Big Fans,

1041
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,810
Ministry of Testing, Test Bash,

1042
00:49:59,810 --> 00:50:01,570
big fans of that conference.

1043
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:04,130
I don't know if I've even mentioned this to you, Brent,

1044
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,490
but I am working with Ministry of Testing,

1045
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:08,410
literally as we speak.

1046
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,090
Sometime in 2019,

1047
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,170
Ministry of Testing will debut

1048
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:17,050
a nine-part course on modern testing.

1049
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,930
Whoa, cool.

1050
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:21,930
An introduction episode, one for each principle,

1051
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,570
and then a recap on post,

1052
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:25,730
or talk about post-modern testing, as we call it,

1053
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,570
what happens after modern testing.

1054
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:29,330
So there'll be, the plan is,

1055
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:32,300
each is only about five minutes long,

1056
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,420
and the idea is to give people a lot more.

1057
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:37,860
It'll be, I expect it will be,

1058
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,500
each course will be the super condensed version

1059
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,500
of the deep dives we did on the podcast,

1060
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,540
and I'll use those for resources.

1061
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,820
Lesson plans are done,

1062
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,260
that course is planned is done,

1063
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:50,580
working through those,

1064
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:51,780
it'll take a while to get the work done,

1065
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,300
but I'm pretty excited about that.

1066
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,860
Do you wanna send that to me?

1067
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,980
I will send you a link to the lesson plans,

1068
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,660
you can start giving me feedback.

1069
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:01,220
Okay, cause one of the things

1070
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,380
that I intend to do this weekend,

1071
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,940
and I'll do it just before we publish,

1072
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:08,180
I've decided to,

1073
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,380
that my penultimate blog post

1074
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,900
on Testastic will be this weekend.

1075
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,060
It will be the document we've been

1076
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,260
working on around modern testing.

1077
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,120
That will be,

1078
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,160
I will write up my final words on that one,

1079
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,480
post it as a blog post,

1080
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,280
and that I intend to be the last

1081
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:32,360
blog post I ever do on Testastic.

1082
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,640
When was the last blog post ever on Testastic?

1083
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,680
Wasn't that a long time ago?

1084
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,650
It's two or three years now.

1085
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,860
It's the,

1086
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,940
it doesn't, the brand is a great brand,

1087
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:52,940
but it's not who I am anymore.

1088
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,190
And your announcement?

1089
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,110
That was it.

1090
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:56,950
Oh, okay.

1091
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:57,790
That was it.

1092
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:58,830
And also one big shout out,

1093
00:51:58,830 --> 00:51:59,950
not on the podcast today,

1094
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,190
but one thing,

1095
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,190
again, our community and you guys are

1096
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,590
just huge for us.

1097
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:08,430
And if you're not on the Slack group,

1098
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,390
you should really get on there,

1099
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:11,870
cause I'm gonna totally butcher this thing.

1100
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:15,900
It's Massiej Rodek,

1101
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,900
and that's probably wrong,

1102
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,620
but that's the best I can do.

1103
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:21,740
He listened to all of our principles episodes

1104
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,900
and the follow ups,

1105
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,060
and made a magnificent and huge

1106
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:30,500
and detailed mind map of modern testing.

1107
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,340
And that will get referenced and credited

1108
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,540
throughout this course I'm building,

1109
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,780
cause it's just a really nice,

1110
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:37,460
it's just a fantastic job.

1111
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,020
So thank you.

1112
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,860
As you listen to this,

1113
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,500
please accept my thanks,

1114
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,220
even though I probably pronounced your name horribly.

1115
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,620
It's really incredible.

1116
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,060
It did a fantastic job.

1117
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:54,500
I recently saw that he did a post on it as well.

1118
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:58,460
I haven't yet gotten Google to go and translate it,

1119
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,180
cause he wrote it in,

1120
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,140
I think he's Polish.

1121
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,540
Check out the Microsoft employees in Google.

1122
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:04,620
That's nice.

1123
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:06,940
Oh, we're a different company now, dude.

1124
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,620
It's all about what it takes to get it done.

1125
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,700
Yeah, yeah.

1126
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,940
We'll talk about other things later.

1127
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,860
This was fun.

1128
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,300
I just wanna thank all of you.

1129
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,220
You can unmute and yell stuff at us in a minute.

1130
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,940
But just for being a part of this

1131
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,140
and kind of taking this crazy idea

1132
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:27,260
to have a bunch of listeners talk to us on the show.

1133
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,620
And I would say this even if a lot of you

1134
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,580
didn't give us praise.

1135
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,180
Just, I'm glad it worked out.

1136
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:35,260
Hopefully the recording comes out.

1137
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,060
Otherwise, this is just a private show

1138
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:40,420
for about 20 people and we call it good.

1139
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,900
Or we can do it again next week on The Real 100.

1140
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:47,660
But really appreciate it.

1141
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:51,420
This is, it's, we never thought it would be,

1142
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,540
the podcast would be a thing.

1143
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:53,900
So it's just super exciting.

1144
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,340
And really, I just have a lot of gratitude

1145
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,180
for everyone who's even listened to one episode.

1146
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,020
So thank you.

1147
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,770
Yes, absolutely.

1148
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,490
All right, we're gonna call that good

1149
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,410
and I'll get this edited and published

1150
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,050
to the Slack channel hopefully tonight,

1151
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,170
but over the weekend for sure.

1152
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,330
And then out to the masses on Monday.

1153
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,410
Hopefully it includes all three of our voices,

1154
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:15,290
or 20, whatever they were.

1155
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:18,010
And we'll see you next time for 101.

1156
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,690
Do we wanna let the, you wanna unmute all of them?

1157
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:22,290
Let the three do the sign off.

1158
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,450
All right, three, sign on and give everyone a big goodbye.

1159
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:28,290
Good luck.

1160
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:32,920
Just letting my dog say goodbye.

1161
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,560
All right, goodbye everyone.

1162
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,400
Thanks.

1163
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,920
See you guys next week for The Real 100 and 101.
