00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:12,380
Welcome to AVE testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:19,340
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,500
We are back. Yeah, how are you man?

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,740
Hey, it's summer

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,380
Depending on you know what depending on the table

6
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,860
depending on

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,630
Guess where you're at. It's either summer now or summer yesterday

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:42,940
Yeah, it's by the time you hear this it's summer for everyone. It was summer a day or three ago for everyone

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,780
Yeah, I was yeah, so that's our weather forecast. That's the weather forecast section

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,720
So many stories on I have lots of feedback about the podcast. I want to share. Okay

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,960
You ready? I so I don't know where to start

12
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,360
I was gonna let's do that first and then I'll talk about what I did and then I'll talk about what we're doing

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,320
And then we'll weave in some AI and by that time we'll have done nothing for 45 minutes and we'll end the podcast

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,080
It'll be great

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,340
so

16
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,640
Seems like we should have a theme song for feedback like we

17
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,060
We know it

18
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:26,540
You know what we embrace it and here's the deal. I was talking with my ever supportive family this week, okay, and

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,140
None of which who have my wife accidentally listened to part of an A B testing pod. Oh

20
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,760
Let her know that nobody else has heard

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,220
Sorry of an A B testing podcast and we're talking about it with my son at dinner the other night

22
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:51,100
And you know, I have friend I have friends that listen and they like it. My wife says like my son asked

23
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,530
I think my wife said you knew dad has over 200 episodes on his podcast

24
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:01,130
Because that's great. What's the podcast about and she looks at me and I look back at her

25
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,830
I said, it's kind of hard to tell

26
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,100
It says it right in the intro

27
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,640
Whatever comes to mind that's what happens if you skip past there

28
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,620
And whatever comes to mind it is kind of what we do

29
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,060
but the reason is and she's not listening to this one so and

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,180
Anybody that's already given up on us isn't listening also. So just to satisfy my own ego

31
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,000
the reason

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We discuss stuff like this is because in these discussions as where the nuggets come out

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,120
Brent and I did not start this podcast ten years ago and start

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,320
building modern testing principles and talk about how delivery was changing over time and try and

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,320
Find ways again. We don't event we find ways to talk about what's going on in

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,270
In those discussions

37
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,150
We have to have the back and forth and me making fun of Brent and Brent calling me names and show me

38
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,510
I'm number one and in that we find the nuggets that are worth listening to and finding out that we can build on for the

39
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,950
Next recording so this is all for us

40
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,010
because we're good at kind of balance and stuff with each other and figuring stuff out and going from there and

41
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,870
Eventually coming up with some ideas that some people

42
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,860
kind of like

43
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,860
Brent disagrees no

44
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,390
We go wrong this is the last episode of the A.B. Testing podcast we're breaking up

45
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,740
B for that

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:42,140
A will be Sam for ADHD and B will be I guess random brainstorming with whoever Alan finds

47
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:50,540
The yeah, no, I agree with everything you said just got on smart then just without the heavy

48
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,740
tinge of like self-esteem issues like

49
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,740
No, dude, have you is it your first time meeting me? Oh

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,860
Wait, no, just podcast podcast Alan not have self-esteem issues. I

51
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,940
Did I let the other Alan leak in I do not

52
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:17,140
Apologize in any way shape or form for what we are like that's I mean it is what it is

53
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,580
No, and it is what it is on purpose and I would fully understand it would be it

54
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,500
it's gonna be a hard podcast for some people to listen to and

55
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,880
I'm speaking to what's the opposite of the choir cuz I'm speaking to the people who are not

56
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,620
Listening to this episode because they chose to opt out at some point and that's totally cool opposite of a choir

57
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,220
Like preaching to the choir or what's the opposite? Well, so if your patients acquire

58
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Right, I guess not

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,040
Because it's not preaching to the people in the pew because they're still listening

60
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,020
it's kind of like when the when the

61
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,120
One kid gets is really rowdy in class and gets sent to the principal's office

62
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,120
Then the teacher punishes the rest of the class

63
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,280
Or when somebody's late for work and everybody gets in trouble those sorts of things like it's the wrong. It's the con

64
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,840
Anyway, I have to do the podcast and doesn't matter

65
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,880
It's not a captive audience. Okay, you're correct. Yeah, you're correct. The

66
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,240
Point is that I wonder if my little pop filter worked on that

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,200
I will fall find out in the recording now that I don't really edit anymore

68
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,560
The point is that we have to

69
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Discuss and meander because if we don't do that, we'll never find the great ideas now

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,720
We could you and I could just talk not recording for

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,400
Hours upon hours and then eventually like once every four months collect our nuggets into one

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,240
Into one little thing nuggets are diary

73
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,250
Yeah

74
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:06,900
So that's that and let's move on to a new topic. I had something else to talk about. Oh, do you ever write?

75
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,100
Just stupid code because it like yes, of course you do because you're like me and you hate an efficiency

76
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,780
Can't resolve the idea of stupid code. I know I

77
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,780
Give you an example. I'll give you an example of the kinds of things I do because they're kind of fun

78
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,780
well, one thing I do at work is I

79
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,900
Probably shouldn't be writing code in my position

80
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:37,860
But sometimes I like doing some little things like querying github API to find some things out because I know I know

81
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,580
Python and graph qls that are etc. I

82
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,500
Don't know if I told the story on the podcast before but

83
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,860
My son is very anti big company refuses to have a Google ID on his computer

84
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:57,060
Does not want the tracking him and yet we need a way for him to

85
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,120
View and add to our family calendar

86
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,280
Now I can give him a link that allows him to view what's in it read only

87
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:13,520
But I don't have a great way for him to add things to our calendar without a Google account. Okay, you follow him

88
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,040
I am and

89
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,200
so

90
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,420
Huh, I got an answer. So Google has this thing there

91
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,100
It'll probably shut it off at some day because it can only lose money. Are you familiar with?

92
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,740
Google app script. No

93
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,180
So Google has this app script thing that integrates with their apps and you can just write stuff and have it run basically as a

94
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,100
Cron job or on a trigger to do stuff and I wrote one that looks for

95
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:49,820
Males coming in sent you I could give the address but an angry weasel comm address and when they come in there

96
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,380
Can they come in as calendar invites or they're rejected when they come in?

97
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,730
They're parsed and added to the shared calendar. Okay, so pretty easy to do works out great

98
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,450
He can just put as far as calendar he invites this address and it shows up

99
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:12,330
It's great and it just I just got an error. It just started failing which means that Google changed something in there in their app script

100
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,130
Api, so I have to go fix that I was just fixing that when you showed up

101
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:19,130
So anyway, I write so many little things like this

102
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,850
Like I kind of enjoy it because I don't get to really write code as part of my job anymore

103
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,570
And I'm far enough removed. I probably shouldn't but I do like little hacks like this

104
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,810
So do you have any little fun little hacks like that, Brent? I

105
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,460
spend a lot of time writing

106
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,490
Code, but I make sure

107
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:47,810
Like the difference I guess I make sure the difference between the two of us in this case

108
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,700
Right, um is I can still make sure that the code that I'm writing

109
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,740
I'm not critical path

110
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,230
Right. Yeah, there is a lot of

111
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:07,700
So like in my particular team, I think I've made some this before and my team's improving

112
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,860
Rapidly, but I mostly have a team of data scientists

113
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,000
But we are a full stack data science team meaning

114
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:27,100
We build our models, but we also build the services and and ship those services that use those models

115
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
right, and so that means

116
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,650
Unfortunately most data science programs

117
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,140
Don't train on oop don't train on

118
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,660
Hell don't even train on C. See anything C sharp C flat C

119
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
anything

120
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,180
So and in I have

121
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,580
Spent time in dev so a lot of the times

122
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Like I'm spending time

123
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
refactoring code

124
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Which I enjoy because I I

125
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,160
absolutely love fixing broken things I

126
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,470
was telling one of my my

127
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:18,150
ICs today who who got so inspired that he went back to he's got his PhD in

128
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,580
I

129
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,660
Forget the official title, but it's essentially in supply chain management

130
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,420
So he's well trained as a data scientist, but that doesn't teach him coding and he's decided

131
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
He's gone back to

132
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,550
Illinois

133
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:38,350
University to get a masters in in

134
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,070
In computer science and I'm like right on

135
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:48,490
Anyway, I was telling him one of the one of my measures of a good versus great dev

136
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:56,060
Have we ever talked about this? No a good developer writes code a great developer

137
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,810
Deletes it. Oh, maybe you've held that before. Yeah, but that's that's not universally true

138
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,010
There's some nuance in that answer. Yeah, it's I mean

139
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,950
No of all developers write code

140
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,010
Like my to me a great developer does delete code

141
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:19,570
I completely agree with that one and it is hyperbole but just because you're right good doesn't mean you're a good developer

142
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,410
Like that's the only part of that little cliche thing. But the whole point the punchline is

143
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,100
Deleting code is a bigger art form in my view than writing it

144
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:41,200
And I think it's knowing which code to delete. It's understanding. There's a lot that goes into that. Yeah, that's

145
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,580
There's some missing parts of the story. We all get what you're saying

146
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:52,460
There's it's about refactoring the designs of the things are cleaner like number

147
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,540
More often than not the things I'm deleting are duplicated code or oh if they had designed it this way

148
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:06,220
Then this whole other function wouldn't have been needed right up. But yeah, I'm not doing

149
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,180
So I do a lot of refactoring after the teams got going and I use that as educational moments

150
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,560
But yeah, yeah, yeah way back when I worked on teams, I did a little bit of

151
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,260
hands-on stuff

152
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:26,420
But I always pick what I always described it as do the important because nobody wants to do unimportant work do the important

153
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,290
but not critical work and

154
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,890
if it ever becomes critical and I haven't finished it note that in advance and

155
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,540
Pass it off, right?

156
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:43,940
Right, which I've had to do a couple times. I can probably do on Xbox once give your heads up to to the victim

157
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,020
to be

158
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,460
Yeah, and we had a pretty good collaborative team there. And again, I always create I

159
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,700
Somehow I create little utopias of folks that work within chaos and we did that there

160
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,420
so it wasn't really an issue there is one of my old employees by the way, we keep on connecting and

161
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,180
They said we should get together and we go to get together and then kind of the our message dies and he never follows up

162
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,620
So Dan if you're listening, we're supposed to hang out sometime

163
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,220
Something else I was gonna tell you Oh

164
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,140
Have you heard of modern testing?

165
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,780
modern

166
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,900
Right you're such a

167
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,980
So I

168
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,660
Know one of our listeners

169
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,820
Asked me to give a talk at a Leon asked me to give a talk to their company just remotely

170
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,620
We had a the Juneteenth holiday here. So Wednesday morning

171
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:50,060
I gave a little webinar to a bunch of folks at his company in England. I talked about now it was interesting. I

172
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,260
Don't like I don't give that many talks anymore. And I don't know what to talk about anymore because

173
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,580
I don't know in a way. I'm tired of modern testing principles, but I'm not tired of them and I want to get to that

174
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,080
So this podcast is looking for a topic. It's modern testing principles. So it's really nice

175
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,840
He gave me like it'd be go for our company to hear about these three principles three and

176
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,760
three three of the seven Oh three three of the seven principles. Yeah, and

177
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,800
When I kind of put it together, I realized they went together

178
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,270
Kind of well, and it was principal one are which is Brent

179
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,620
Businesses everything. I mean I'm paraphrasing

180
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:40,570
Yeah, yeah, this is everything so our priority is improving the business. Yes

181
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:47,410
I believe it was then pretty which one is the acceleration principle we accelerate the teams now. I don't even know three

182
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,350
three and then

183
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,670
six we use data to

184
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,710
to help to

185
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:01,120
We should memorize these we use data, you know data that good

186
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:12,220
Brand either. Yeah, we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and close the gaps between product hypothesis and business impact

187
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,780
Yes, you with me now one is already

188
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,230
Continuously accelerate. There is no accelerate. So can you do some for me? I think is what you're talking about because accelerate. Yeah

189
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,580
Yeah, so what I found when I put these together

190
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,140
was that

191
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,820
They're all kind of about you know, we improve focus on improving the business

192
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:43,060
We work on it and we can't do enough there. So work on accelerating the team so they can move faster and then data for decisions

193
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,840
It really comes down to those three principles by themselves are a lot about the feedback loops

194
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:55,860
Yeah, lean thinking and theory of constraints especially are about they build on improving the business and we're trying to

195
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:02,500
Increase the feedback or increase decrease the length of the feedback loop increase the efficiency of the feedback loop

196
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,060
And then when you're able to use data to understand

197
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,260
how

198
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,740
That gives you the way to quickly like super quickly understand because you deploy a little bit of a bit of a thing and then

199
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,950
You can get feedback right away if that thing's working for a customer. Yeah, it's it's

200
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,770
It's interesting you just bringing it the three and I'm looking at this and I'm like, okay

201
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,480
And now looking at NTP with a totally different light, right? I'm like, okay

202
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,450
Like if we just had those three

203
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,310
Right. Let's say monetize some vegetables were just those three

204
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,190
Now I'll tell you I'll tell you what happens when that happens, but you go ahead and with your thought. Oh, okay

205
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:49,680
No, just tell me because

206
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
well, right once

207
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
once the police officer and

208
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,160
Oh

209
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,120
Do you hear the sign? Yeah, I'm being arrested

210
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:06,160
so what I found when I was going I did those three and talked about them and then I realized I was putting together my

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,470
presentation is

212
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,110
you know, we had

213
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,550
somebody pointed out many many years ago that

214
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:19,350
The principals were very close to or had a lot of overlap with the three ways of DevOps from Jean Kim

215
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:23,530
Don't know if you remember those at all, but no it those three especially

216
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:31,170
But I talked about the modern testing principles being not that modern not that much about testing their delivery principles and they're very good delivery

217
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,970
Principles, but the three ways of DevOps from Jean Kim's I think it was in his first book on DevOps

218
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,450
Probably I think it predates

219
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:44,430
Us I think it's 2012 2013 that came out. But the first way is systems thinking

220
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,200
Which is seeing in his case seeing

221
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,440
Development and operations as one big thing not as separate things being thrown over the wall

222
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,140
The whole idea behind DevOps was get rid of the wall between Dev and ops

223
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,600
It's all about delivering value to the customer. So system thinking see the whole thing right in there

224
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,160
And this was the key thing because like the the wise guy

225
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:17,400
The sorry, I don't want to say that way the guru in Phoenix project kept on talking about oh

226
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
You've just figured out the first way

227
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,240
Yeah, and because same author same is it's a way of putting that in there right and then

228
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,400
The the second way is to amplify the feedback loops

229
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,720
Make sure that they're apparent and obvious and we're trying to learn we deployed ops we learn comes back to dev

230
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,920
We learn more we give it to ops to learn more and give it back to dev learning and cycling

231
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,920
And then the third way is a culture of continual experimentation and learning. Mm-hmm

232
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And I just found it interesting

233
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:55,720
How well those those lined up with especially principles two and six it's a lot about let's make sure well one

234
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,320
Systems thinking is we focus on improving the business the business is the system

235
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,740
Three whichever one or yeah three continuous improvement

236
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:11,220
That's amplifying the feedback loops and six is a way for us to enable continual experimentation

237
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:17,060
It is hard to do continual experimentation if you don't have the speed of using data for your feedback loop, right?

238
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,290
In the know there I might with you like like it even says in in

239
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:31,490
Principle like close the gaps of being product hypotheses if you mention the word hypotheses like you're

240
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,610
You're thinking about experimentation

241
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,410
Yeah, yeah

242
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:42,450
And so anyway it I it popped into my head when I was working on the presentation

243
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,930
because I haven't looked at it in a while and I looked at it and was kind of

244
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,850
Pleasantly surprised maybe blown away is too hard, but very interesting to see how those line up

245
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,490
So there is a nugget of takeaway

246
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:02,290
That you all can take who are looking for valuable content in the EAB testing podcast. Yeah, it's interesting before you vote

247
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,090
Jean Kim I was thinking of our near to right and

248
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,770
And you could take the same three

249
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,720
and

250
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,120
In kind of plug-in right here and said but the thing is actually I guess that shouldn't be a surprise

251
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,760
right because

252
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,760
angel and lean

253
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:32,620
It had a lot of different folks with different voices in a different view points all very much

254
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,620
In alignment with each other but different language around how they explained

255
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,800
What it was about right? Um

256
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
right, Brennierdson

257
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:51,440
Is fantastic like he was very quantified like I nearly got his his chapter around small batching

258
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,840
Memorized like that was like how he described why you do small batches

259
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,720
Which in my view is is in alignment with continual learning?

260
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,880
Yeah, his whole book is around flow and systems thinking like he he would be a massive

261
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,940
Yeah, it all fits together and what it comes down to

262
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Dear listener is

263
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
remember Brent and I

264
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,980
Don't really have many original thoughts

265
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:25,980
But we bring in all what we know and kind of regurgitate it in a way

266
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
We think makes sense to our audience

267
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:34,060
So the number of the other four there's two things I'm thinking about now with MTP, okay, I

268
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,380
Kind of wish we had this insight that you just shared like what is it seven years ago?

269
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,700
Because now I kind of want to find a way to slightly rewrite principle one

270
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:54,540
Dude, we can rewrite anything we want. No, I know I know that like it's ours

271
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,340
You wish you would you wish you would have gone back in time kind of like in Deadpool 2 and

272
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,140
When Ryan Reynolds goes backs and fixes the whole Green Lantern crap. Yeah

273
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:16,970
No, I'll start thinking about this because I like our priorities improving the business like when we originally wrote that at least

274
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,970
What was in my head was?

275
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,240
We need to get testers

276
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,230
Thinking about the system

277
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,850
not about their small part like

278
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,770
If you got if anyone listening to this podcast still believes

279
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:45,480
That it's testers job to provide information. I really have to wonder at this point in time

280
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,040
Why you still listen number one number two?

281
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,420
Like you got to realize that that point of view is now

282
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Absolutely. No longer mainstream. Well the things we were trying to remember going back to the context on this

283
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,340
It's probably good to go over this once in a while is that

284
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,460
We were trying to help testers at the time navigate into this new world

285
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,760
And we were clearly saying if you keep doing what you're doing now

286
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,200
If you were your jobs at risk, it's not

287
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,720
Unless you keep on doing exactly what you're doing now and hope it to keep working

288
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,800
Testers have always been good at systems thinking so these were not reaches these weren't like here's your career change

289
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,480
These are things you're capable of doing now

290
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,160
If you do them you you are safe your job is secure. You will stay employed

291
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,760
systems thinking super important and I get and I have been

292
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,680
Messaged in and a little passive aggression from the world that I've talked about it before is I bring a principle one

293
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,280
That's that's ridiculous. We can't improve the business. All we can do is provide information

294
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,000
It's like maybe in 1994, but thank you very much

295
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,400
And you know what if I knew what I knew if if I knew back then what I knew now

296
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,320
I think I would have fought that too. I think so too, but

297
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:18,080
There were different constraints right there was a lot more things we had to do proactive the feedback loop was a lot slower

298
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,050
but

299
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:28,060
You know, I honestly believe that the role of Q of QA being information providers

300
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,400
was always wrong it is

301
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:39,050
Absolutely wrong today. I think you know, I used to talk about this and just felt very

302
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,710
Passive and the way it always felt to me. I want to get deep in this people people really feel this way

303
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:48,110
those people don't listen to the podcast so it's fine, but it's

304
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:54,670
It's like and then what like that's really all that's I mean, okay

305
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:58,430
has always been my feedback on that even going back to

306
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:05,870
Lessons learned in software testing which honestly has some good nuggets in it. It's a little repetitive

307
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:11,110
It's kind of funny in some places purposely I give them full credit for that but

308
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,820
providing information

309
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,700
now

310
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,700
No, no, no

311
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,100
It's never been correct. It's never been correct like

312
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:29,940
My very first podcast like not podcast but blog was around now our job is to remove risks from the system

313
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,020
Right. It's not but we don't own the decisions

314
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,690
Then what's wrong with you own the decisions

315
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:43,490
Like we we we've agreed we shouldn't be owning the decision to stop ship or not

316
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,770
But it is our job to remove to remove risk from the system

317
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,530
Yeah, why can't why can't why are we where people trying to be information providers?

318
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,490
Why can't you be part of the decision making progress? How come like I would feel so

319
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,610
Unempowered if my job was say Brent. Here's everything I know and I

320
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:08,130
I'm not I don't I don't have an opinion because it's not my job. Please make my choice for me

321
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,210
It's probably that and I'm sure you have the term

322
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:18,290
Memorized but that that bullshit was a cognitive distance or whatever the hell it is. Oh

323
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,840
Critical this is yes, this is why developers can't test they don't have critical distance. Well, I'm being sarcastic

324
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,640
It's also probably why we're just information providers because no we can't make the decisions around

325
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
What's good for the business? No?

326
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,600
Anyway before we get to like right now I'm thinking

327
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,390
Principle number one somehow needs to term systems thinking in it. Oh

328
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:54,020
Yeah, okay, right I like you want to take up like right well, let's do it later like right sure

329
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,380
I'm like it's short and sweet. It's the only one of the damn thing that's sweet. So like

330
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,100
Adding systems thinking is probably gonna triple the number of words

331
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,300
But I wish it were there

332
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Yeah, but when we look at

333
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,780
When we look at how these work today, so make these are

334
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,420
apply these to the team like we wrote these as

335
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,710
the

336
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,030
Tester trying to figure out what to do is your audience

337
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,150
Today, they're kind of a message for the team

338
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:29,190
This is how you deliver in a way that won't get you all the way back to

339
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,310
2004

340
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,270
So it's the team's priorities improving the business

341
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,910
now if you consider yourself to be in this separate little silo of testing and

342
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,050
Even then you should have an opinion but the team like can everyone on the team have good systems thinking

343
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,220
Yes, I would hope so

344
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,680
Why don't they?

345
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:03,380
I do believe systems thinking is trainable

346
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
But I do also think

347
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,890
But from my experience

348
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:17,010
there there's there's kind of the forest people in the tree people like the people who kind of see the forest and people who see the

349
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,010
trees and

350
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,090
And I do think we need both

351
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:28,770
I don't think one's better than the other because I like if I keep this awkward metaphor going the tree people are very good at the details

352
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:36,850
Whereas the the forest people are good at the abstract and the strategy but suck at the details like for me

353
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,730
Devils in the details is the bane of my existence. Yep. Me too. It drives me crazy

354
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,410
we're doing but as I were doing budgets right now and

355
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,050
they're in Excel and

356
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:56,210
It's an absolute madhouse of chaos and I look at it and I just cry I

357
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:01,170
Curl up in a ball and I decide to try it again another day that I understand

358
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,210
The other thing you might try is

359
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,350
drugs delegation

360
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,350
That that also works as well

361
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,440
There's such a you may know so there's I can say this fairly there's a lot of

362
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,140
hierarchical

363
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,860
Non-transparency so some of this stuff I cannot delegate because

364
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:31,980
I'm told not to delegate it because there's fear that someone may see something that I'm supposed to in the budget and

365
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:38,060
So yes, but normally absolutely delegate. This is right. This is what managers do and

366
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:42,180
Once again, the podcast goes all over the place. I'm gonna reel it back in in a second

367
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:48,300
But we I mean any manager like you delegate the stuff that not just you don't want to do

368
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,700
But the stuff that'll help somebody grow and that they could actually do better than you

369
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
I have a couple directs who do some things

370
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,340
Made most of my directs do so many things

371
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,700
So well that are things I can't do. I'm very very fortunate. I

372
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:09,320
To me this is the lesson of strength finders that I walked away with right? It's essentially

373
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,780
I'll tell a very quick story. I probably have already told it before one of the strength chapter 27

374
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,300
One of the one of the strengths is one called communication

375
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:27,550
Okay, and I was once on the team that we had did every manager had to

376
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,310
send a

377
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:32,710
Weekly status report. Okay, I

378
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:40,030
Would rather shoot myself on the head then sit down and write status reports, right?

379
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:45,610
Because the are I am so this is one of the things that lean and agile has done to me

380
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:48,430
I am so ROI focused

381
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:57,800
Unlike no one reads these I'm just invest I'm just investing in it. I'm doing it because I've been told I have to

382
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:05,480
The only thing that I can tell from the past experience is that the only thing is done with the status reports is that

383
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,550
My management chain knows who's done it or not like there's some tracking system in place. Okay, and so

384
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:15,390
One of my IC had communication

385
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:25,190
And I this was early on in my my journey and strengths and I read it but the book what communications about

386
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:27,540
and I

387
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:31,700
Connected the dots because that's one of my strengths is connecting dots and I said hey

388
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,070
according to this

389
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:41,230
This guy might be good at it. Number one and number two love doing it

390
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,700
Okay, whereas I have always like the other thing I do

391
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:51,700
Is I take on the bullshit work that has to be done that no one really wants to do

392
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,370
So like I okay, I could delegate the status report

393
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:04,180
But I hate it and I'm not gonna pass on shit work to my people who's trying to do things that they're proud of

394
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,460
But yeah, I wouldn't talk to him. I'll finish the story. I wouldn't talk

395
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,740
No, good. I have a follow-up story as we continue our trip to tangentown. I

396
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,420
Wait to him and I said

397
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:27,820
Hey, his name was Renee Renee. I hate doing this. I do it because I'm told to do it

398
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,580
Would you like to take it over I didn't delegate it to him I asked him would you like to take it over and

399
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,740
I even explained to him why

400
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
And he looked at me

401
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,540
like I

402
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,880
Just offered him the best

403
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,960
Sweetest candy that could ever be given to anybody ever

404
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,720
Okay, and he's like

405
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,680
He no thought process about it. Yes. I want it

406
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,860
Okay

407
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:08,020
He started taking it over and it is the only time in my career

408
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,760
Where I had external teams that I had never heard of before

409
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,280
Asked to sign up for my goddamn status report

410
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:25,610
That is the stupidest damn story in the world no I get it I get it and I don't really like them I think

411
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,350
But I have an interesting story. I want to share as an alternative

412
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:35,110
A lot of my team just post some recaps end of week recaps in slack which I can catch up on

413
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,090
I don't require them to I have Jira. I talked to them. I could figure out what's going on

414
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:43,070
I can get answers everything. I need to know it's it's it seems more like

415
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:51,810
Box checking than anything else one thing my last manager did at Unity which was actually fun

416
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,690
you know, I blog every week and I like to write and

417
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:03,430
What he asked me to do and I'll I save the doc I'll scroll back I have a hundred page doc here

418
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:05,610
I didn't write all at once

419
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,800
but

420
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
He just asked me to write

421
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,600
Once a week

422
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Send me what you're thinking

423
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,740
and

424
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:21,500
like organized like I called him my my org name organizational notes and it was

425
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:28,500
Sometimes about things going on on the team some things about something on our leadership team thoughts. I had about

426
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,140
strategy or

427
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,380
Whether it's organizational strategy or product strategy

428
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:41,660
But I just every week I would write a list of top-of-mind topics and he would read it

429
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:48,700
Every week and sometimes it'd be often but not always we stuff that would be discussing our one-on-ones go a little deeper into

430
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,020
But it was more about it was less about

431
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,240
Well, I think the difference is it's fair to say this now that we know that I have a job

432
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,840
that's a little weird, but okay is I was in much more of a leadership position there and a little bit more of a

433
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,800
management position here if that makes sense and so a lot of our discussions around the

434
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,760
Moving the company and how can we do this and how should we work here should be what what?

435
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,160
What organizational changes should we make across the org? What products should be billed?

436
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,640
What things should we go invest in potentially buying or I bounce head like when I had org change ideas

437
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,480
I could bounce them off of them. We'd have discussions. It was a good way for him to kind of know

438
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,040
Just it was like we had a 20 minute

439
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,000
Hallway conversation about something that I thought was super interesting during that week

440
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,320
and that sort of thing I like doing I hate status reports and I

441
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,000
Don't like them. I don't ask my team for them

442
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,720
But I do like the idea of I haven't asked my team for these either. I'm kind of more

443
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,480
Making sure the work gets done. But this idea of organizational notes was

444
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
was pretty

445
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,340
I

446
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,580
Could just finish what one last thing before I forget is as I mentioned before just kind of capital up here

447
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,220
It's one of the docks I saved when I left

448
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:15,680
It's I just added to the same dock every week so I could keep my progression

449
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,940
so I have little like this hundred pages of of notes that I sent him and

450
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:24,060
It's it's I just kind of scrolled through our talking. I forgot about it. And it's

451
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,700
You know, it's it's interesting. It's how I you know, you know, my leadership style of planting seeds

452
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:34,340
It's how I'd plant seeds with them here. Here's the way I'm thinking about reorganizing the team

453
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:40,580
I won't mention this again for another two months. But now it's not now it's it's in a cell in the back of your brain

454
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:42,090
anyway, go

455
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,810
No, so I like that. I don't know that I could do that with

456
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,920
my manager because

457
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,750
It depends on the manager a lot of what they want

458
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:58,550
They don't want a wall of text like I'll and Steve. Hello Steve. Steve wants to be on the podcast sometime

459
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:02,870
I'll let you guys talk but Steve does not want a wall of text

460
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:08,550
Steve wants Steve wants little nuggets and that's fine. So you have to do it Luke at unity

461
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:12,950
He wanted a wall of text. He was a thinker and he was not that Steve you're not a thinker

462
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,750
People people want their information in different ways. I'm gonna shut up. Go ahead

463
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:24,690
I'm more of an alignment. I think with Steve on this one with with my reports. I don't want a wall of text

464
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:31,890
What I want to know is that you've thought about the agenda in that we have something useful

465
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,610
interesting and or important to talk about like for me it's around

466
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,010
Getting my people to be proactive around how they want to use their time with me

467
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:49,570
I don't want to read at the point of a 101 is to talk through it and have an interaction and

468
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:56,530
Part of it is for me to be a mentor part of it's me to be a manager part of like status

469
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:03,650
Like I've I've explicitly told them like I don't want status reports. I don't

470
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,230
want

471
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:09,590
them even in the our 101s

472
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,730
right because we have a daily stand-up I have a

473
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:22,170
Separately scheduled office hours with with my team like status that I need to know about I'll know about

474
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:27,530
But I like this idea of

475
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:35,010
What's on your mind now the thing the thing I would like to do

476
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,560
Because if I were to say it that vaguely

477
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,270
They would probably think of it as again agenda items for our 101

478
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:52,470
It depends it depends on the manager in the relationship and it's gonna be different because on both people

479
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,230
It's gonna be different in every single case

480
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:59,230
I know Luke asked for this of all of his directs and I'm probably the only one that did it regularly

481
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,230
I know that a lot of people

482
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,270
Luke would send them to me to show them minds they get some ideas

483
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:11,070
So it's just I like writing and I like writing in paragraphs and prose far more than bullet points

484
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:16,670
So it worked out really well for me. Yeah, and so that worked it was the right combination and

485
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,630
You're always adjusting

486
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:25,670
It's like it is a how the hell do we get from modern testing principles all the way to manager employee relationships?

487
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:33,750
But here we are, but there is a lot that's important and just you just have to figure out what each other want to move forward

488
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:39,710
And that's it's an art but we everybody does it 20 or 30 times in their career and it's fine

489
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,440
Just recognize that people are different strengths finders people are different. They want different things. They're motivated by different things

490
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,880
They enjoy different things and they hate different things

491
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,420
Don't as long as you don't think immediately assume this is where Myers-Briggs versus well

492
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,520
just don't assume that everyone's exactly the same and

493
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:06,670
You'll be fine and I can even tie that back to make a big loop and get back to AI which we haven't talked about

494
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,590
It's been 45 minutes. Oh my god. If you can get all the back to AI

495
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:16,350
That's the problem when you have AI right pros AI. There's no human element. It's like you're

496
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:20,770
It's it's good. It's kind of good. It's accurate

497
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:25,570
But it kind of doesn't look like something a human would write yet

498
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:34,310
I don't know if I agree with I do agree you do I do you do agree with your own statement?

499
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:40,110
Because I use well, you know, we use chat GPT and the thing I wanted and I want to add a whole thing

500
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,670
I asked before I'll just shut up in a minute here

501
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:45,310
But I was trying to weave it back to AI but it's far too late

502
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:46,810
We have to close up in a few minutes

503
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,310
But the the people are coming in from the street to figure out what's going on. I

504
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:58,990
Asked chat GPT before we started I did I use the Allen bot that Jason Arbin made. Thanks Jason and

505
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:05,790
I can't find the window anymore. I have so many tabs open and I asked it for some topics

506
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:09,570
So what are some new and interesting topics Alan and Brent should discuss?

507
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:16,560
On the A B testing podcast and we're gonna do this next time and then I'll get all your thoughts because I've used like

508
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,800
80% of the

509
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,720
recording time on this podcast

510
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,740
It said given the wealth and experience and evolving perspectives of Alan Brent in the field of software quality a fun new and relevant

511
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,120
topic for the A B testing podcast could be

512
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:38,070
Worth the drumroll sound effect. Good. It's good. The role of AI in modern testing hype or hope

513
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:43,950
It which is a discussion and a talk I would never give we haven't done that

514
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:47,030
I do I do want I think there is

515
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:55,030
strong potential for AI in testing and the strong potential is in none of the things people are talking about and

516
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,580
How's that for a teaser?

517
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:01,150
Brent what's on your mind?

518
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,630
What topics can you remember from this podcast?

519
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:07,390
AI

520
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:13,430
The one from 30 seconds ago nice nice work. Give me one second. I'm trying something out right now

521
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,190
Brent is

522
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:23,750
Well, we're talking before well, he's trying that we were talking before the podcast started and I Brent stood up to go get the door

523
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,990
He's wearing pajama pants cuz it's Friday, you know, it's we're working from home

524
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:32,470
Friday and I'm wearing shorts because I took a little break to go to the gym later and

525
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,310
I

526
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:38,430
Learned a phrase. I think I might have shared this before we're sharing again

527
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,070
For those of us that work from home and we wear shorts and sweats all the time and then we decide we're gonna go out

528
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:46,110
In public we have to put on our hard pants

529
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,040
That I completely understand and everybody knows what it means as soon as you say it even though it's a made-up board

530
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,340
I love it. I gotta go grab some hard pants. I'll be ready in a minute. I

531
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:03,080
often

532
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,940
Forgo that just to be quite honest. I'm like, you know what all of the naughty bits are hidden. I'm going outside screw it

533
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,660
You know, I'm trying to look good

534
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:21,180
Hey, if you I do have one thing I want to mention at the end here once you're done here with your little chat

535
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:25,620
GPT thing which is providing no value right now. What's the thing you want to mention Brent? Oh

536
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,080
Okay

537
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:33,480
No, you you so I'm an ideater like the strength stuff, right?

538
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,070
Am

539
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,390
You're an idea monkey

540
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:39,630
Which means I connect the dots between things and when Alan says oh

541
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:47,310
I can't write it like a human being and we we had just briefly talked about Myers-brakes. I'm like, oh I have never tried

542
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:55,880
But what I just did is I said, all right summarize AI and testing and it wrote a bunch of words

543
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:00,680
And I don't really care. Okay, but then I said now rewrite it as an ENFP

544
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,590
Okay, and now actually rewrite as

545
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:10,290
I am

546
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,090
TP that's both of us. Oh, yeah

547
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,740
Riveting

548
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:23,780
Now what would be interesting in pattern matching and maybe I don't know if a gen AI could do this or some some graph paper

549
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:27,740
But take all of things strengths finders working genius

550
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,020
insights

551
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:36,500
Myers-briggs plot them all because we're different we're the same on a Myers-brake but different everywhere else kind of map

552
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
the the

553
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,820
Communication work what and what Alan enjoys DNA

554
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,920
So I

555
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,120
Whoa

556
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,880
That's getting another homework assignment. No, no, that just registered like for me like

557
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,230
so

558
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,870
You've made fun of me on this in the past like straight. I have Myers-brakes

559
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:05,170
I think in a general sense is actually really good

560
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:10,950
Strike finders as you know, I think it's a lot better, right?

561
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:18,330
What was the the the big big five big six is another one? Yeah, right and I'm like

562
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,520
What fun for for me on this one is?

563
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:25,630
Okay, if I had Alan

564
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:30,380
Take all of these tests and then I betcha

565
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:35,460
I don't even need to feed the data on it because I bet you open AI already knows

566
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:49,920
I'm like, whoa

567
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,140
What could I do with that? Yeah, it knows it like

568
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,060
So now I have your test. I just

569
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:05,720
Narration what it knows is Brent types in what is ideation and it kind of explained it in the whole Strix finders way

570
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Can I go? Yeah

571
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,680
Like the fact that it knew I didn't tell its strengths when it pulled it up like it knows what I'm talking about

572
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,460
well, except it's a

573
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Anyway

574
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,970
Ideation kicked in I haven't gotten to the end result

575
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,530
but my

576
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:35,010
Ethicometer just triggered. I'm like, oh shit if I had that plus open AI I

577
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:42,180
Bet you I could do a lot of really cool, but also a lot of really dangerous things

578
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,140
Well, there's some there's again there's power in knowing

579
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:52,020
What how that people are different from you and how to work with them and what motivates them

580
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,620
There's a bunch of different tools that let you figure that out

581
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,040
Some tools are about figuring out what you're good at

582
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,860
Which is also what gives you energy some are purely about what sorts of activities

583
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:09,900
Give you energy or are difficult for you to do about figuring out what you what's in your wheelhouse dial it in as a manager

584
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:16,580
It becomes a cool orchestration device. So all good stuff. We've talked about this stuff before we're running out of time

585
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,740
We did not we got to get out of here Brent. This is all good stuff

586
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:24,060
We forgot to mention last time and we will not do another recording in June

587
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,500
But I did want to call from a be testing a happy pride month everyone. Oh, yeah

588
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,480
Yep, I think I

589
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:38,380
Can cut this Brent if you want, but I think it's no for Brent and I we both have gay children and we're

590
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,980
We love them just as much and they're awesome

591
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:46,100
And I'm happy we live in a little bubble of a part of the world where they're they're safe doing that

592
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,100
It's not that way everywhere in the US or in the world. So

593
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,340
Just get out there support your support your community get out there for your pride parades. We have a

594
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,740
block party up on the hill just just treat people fairly and be nice and and

595
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:05,700
Just everybody's different, but they're all awesome. Well, they're not all awesome

596
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,380
I know a couple people who aren't but most people are awesome

597
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:15,490
Most all people are awesome in their correct environment

598
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:22,090
Yeah, sometimes in prison right? You know that anyway, I think this has been episode

599
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,770
204

600
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:31,410
200 and whatever 200. Well, it doesn't matter because they're all the same. We'll see you later. I'm out

601
00:48:31,730 --> 00:49:05,140
I want to know your name
