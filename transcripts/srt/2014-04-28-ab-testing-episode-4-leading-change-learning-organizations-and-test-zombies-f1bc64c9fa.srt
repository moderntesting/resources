1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,920
Hey everybody, I'm Alan.

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,920
And I'm Brent.

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,040
And we're here for episode four of A-B testing,

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,080
because you couldn't get enough of the first three.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,080
We're back here again.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,800
And we're already at episode four.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,120
Very, very soon we're going to get to the point

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,720
where I can no longer count that high.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,240
I know.

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:33,440
I know.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,000
What are we going to do?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,280
We're going to.

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,480
Oh, you know what we should have done?

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,840
It's too late now.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,260
We should have counted all of our episodes in binary.

16
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:42,100
No?

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,300
I have a on my floor mat in front of my office downstairs,

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,780
I have a welcome mat.

19
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,500
And it's the word welcome written in binary.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,180
And people stare at it.

21
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,940
And they go, what?

22
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,400
ASCII or Unicode?

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,280
The leading zeros aren't in place.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,280
So they are 8-bit values.

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,800
You have to count, because the welcome map doesn't

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,880
wrap on 8-bit boundaries.

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,480
So you have to look kind of closely.

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,880
You have to notice that there's 15 characters in the first line.

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,360
But it doesn't take a lot of knowledge to go, OK.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,400
There's a pattern here.

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,880
If I break these into 8 bits, I can find the pattern.

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,840
I go, OK, it all starts.

33
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,080
They're all kind of the same.

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,960
And most people, without even having binary code memorized,

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
I shouldn't say most.

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,360
A lot of people can figure it out.

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,680
They kind of stare at it for a while, look at me, and go,

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,880
is that a welcome mat?

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,280
I said, of course it's a welcome mat.

40
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,800
What else do you think it is?

41
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
It's interesting, given the context

42
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,920
of where you have that thing, and that's

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,760
at your office at Microsoft, that people don't get the binary code.

44
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,240
The funny thing is sometimes somebody will mess with me

45
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,080
and turn it upside down.

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Does that make it an unwelcome mat?

47
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,480
Well, it makes it just asky gibberish.

48
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
Whoa!

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,280
Yeah, I know.

50
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,320
I wonder, as an experiment, can you

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,040
get the hexadecimal version and see

52
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,320
if people get that one sooner?

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,920
I could.

54
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,240
I think we're off track.

55
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,160
No, actually, the theme of this podcast

56
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,080
is to not be ever on track.

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,840
And we do that famously.

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,880
So we decided that this is something

59
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
that we're good at, and we're just

60
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,360
going to measure our ability to produce this

61
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,640
by what we're good at.

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,240
Yes, we are.

63
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:33,420
So we do have, we practice sort of lean coffee sort

64
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,100
of approach here.

65
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,820
We have a list of topics that we kind of dot voted.

66
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,420
But dot voting doesn't really work when you have two people.

67
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,820
So I choose which order we go in,

68
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,660
and Brent patassively agrees.

69
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,100
So the first thing I want to talk about is,

70
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,100
I don't think we're going to get another recording in before I

71
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,900
head off to the Star East Conference in Orlando.

72
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,820
So I have little heads up for in the weird.

73
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,220
You know what I'm going to do?

74
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,180
I am going to promote this.

75
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,140
I'm going to put a link to this podcast in my slides,

76
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,020
and maybe we'll gain a listener.

77
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,820
Oh, wow.

78
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,860
That'd be fantastic.

79
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,140
Maybe we'll lose a few.

80
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,380
So it's interesting.

81
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,300
So you're doing Star East.

82
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,220
Yes.

83
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,220
I do it all week.

84
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,580
I'm like a traveling road show for the whole week.

85
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,140
And is this primarily to get a free trip to Disneyland?

86
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,980
Disney World.

87
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,180
No, you know, here's the deal.

88
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,700
And Lee Copeland is probably not one of our listeners,

89
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,940
so I can say this.

90
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,460
Actually, I love the Star Conference.

91
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,460
I've had a long history with them.

92
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,980
At Star West last fall, I gave a keynote and a tutorial.

93
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,820
When I signed a little paperwork for the tutorial,

94
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,140
the fine print that I, in hindsight, was very clear.

95
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,220
But that I missed is that when you do this particular

96
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,820
tutorial, you sign up to do it at Star West and then Star

97
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,490
East in the same year.

98
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,730
I'm giving a tutorial on testing,

99
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,610
where I talk about whatever I want for four hours.

100
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,220
I have a format that actually works really well for that.

101
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,500
Yeah, I'll just go ahead and share it.

102
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,180
Well, what I did for Star West,

103
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:04,940
I should talk through this.

104
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,140
I have a little plan here.

105
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,340
What I did for Star West is I took questions

106
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,180
at the beginning of the talk.

107
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,100
I took about 40 questions just to start off the ballot.

108
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,780
What do you guys want to talk about?

109
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,300
And I wrote them all down,

110
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,380
gave them about five minutes off to get a drink of water.

111
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,500
I sort of equivalence classed them into buckets

112
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,460
and figured, okay, there's about three or four

113
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,730
or five talks I can give.

114
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:26,770
How many people in this room?

115
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,010
There were about, oh, 75, 80 in the room.

116
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,690
So you're basically doing lean coffee

117
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,130
with everyone at the same table.

118
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,370
It was great to talk on the fly.

119
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,770
And I won't go into the classes to questions.

120
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,010
They're all stuff I was comfortable talking about.

121
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,570
And then I, at the end, we kind of made sure

122
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,530
we covered everything.

123
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,690
And it worked out really well,

124
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:52,450
but what was interesting is I had two distinct classes

125
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,290
of feedback on that session as well.

126
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,730
One was, I love the unstructured format.

127
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,330
It was great to get my questions answered

128
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,490
and have the context of the tutorial,

129
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,530
meet whatever everybody wanted.

130
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,650
That was one class.

131
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,970
The unstructured format is fantastic.

132
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,130
I need more of this.

133
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,250
And then some people said,

134
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,290
I would have preferred a more structured format.

135
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,450
The slides did not match the content

136
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,930
because I had to prepare some slides in advance.

137
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,870
So I'm not as stupid as I sound.

138
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,230
This time I made up slides,

139
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,710
sort of matched what I talked about at Star West,

140
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,510
assuming the questions would be about the same.

141
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,030
And now I'm gonna do the same thing.

142
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,510
I'll take questions in advance, all equivalence class them,

143
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,390
and then I'll go through my slides in order.

144
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,630
And on those slides, or like discussion slides,

145
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,310
well, I'll basically do the exact same format,

146
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,990
but hopefully anticipating,

147
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:45,310
not that the reviewers, the feedback,

148
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,990
I take with all of the grain of salt,

149
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,670
but that's my plan.

150
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,830
So very free form.

151
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,830
I want everybody that comes there,

152
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,550
if they're coming to see a stupid talk

153
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,910
called Alan Page on testing,

154
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,710
the least I can do is try and answer your testing questions.

155
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,550
A pot?

156
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,670
Yes, a pot.

157
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,630
Are you going to a pot?

158
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,950
To make it even more interesting,

159
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,910
I'm taking the red eye Sunday night,

160
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,230
and then my talk is at one o'clock on Monday afternoon.

161
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,570
So could you just do your slide deck,

162
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,890
just be one slide with a gigantic question mark?

163
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,100
I could, but I'm trying to be

164
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,460
a little bit more proactive than that.

165
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,220
So anyway, I got that thing going on, kind of fun.

166
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,340
There is a, one cool thing Lee does

167
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,260
is lightning strikes the keynotes,

168
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,940
and he gets a bunch of people who are already there,

169
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,820
who typically give keynotes at conferences

170
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,980
to just each give a five minute lightning talk.

171
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,140
Doing that Tuesday night.

172
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,180
So I got the tutorial Monday afternoon,

173
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,100
I can sleep in Tuesday morning,

174
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,180
attend some sessions,

175
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,380
and then Tuesday evening for the closing

176
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,020
Tuesday keynote, lightning talks.

177
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,260
Is this sort of a soapbox format?

178
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,140
Soapbox format, anything I want,

179
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm not going to use slides because,

180
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,560
one, I'm not really, I can talk about anything,

181
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,500
but mostly because I haven't decided on a topic yet.

182
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,820
So I'm going to use this time

183
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,180
in front of our massive audience to ask Brent,

184
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,460
if I had five minutes,

185
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,160
if I have five minutes to talk about testing,

186
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,080
what should I talk about?

187
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,260
Oh, I should talk about anything I want,

188
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
doesn't have to be testing.

189
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,860
I can talk about the-

190
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,700
Peaches.

191
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,840
Peaches and peanuts and other P words.

192
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,800
Peanuticle.

193
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,940
Peanuticle.

194
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,280
Based on blogs and based on the podcasts

195
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,240
and based on feedback lately,

196
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,080
I think probably the most valuable thing

197
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,560
is what we've been talking about,

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,730
which is leading change.

199
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,570
And-

200
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,610
I thought you were going to say,

201
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,970
talk about nothing for five minutes.

202
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,170
No, I said most valuable.

203
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,490
Oh, gotcha.

204
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,010
If I were to pull together that talk,

205
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,610
the first thing is,

206
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,050
it would be something along the lines of,

207
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,130
wake the hell up.

208
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,590
Someone has moved your cheese,

209
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,590
and you guys should be focusing on

210
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,490
how you're going to lead your people

211
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,170
towards this new world,

212
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,410
towards modernization versus the path

213
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,970
of the COBOL programmers.

214
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,360
Yeah, I think the challenge there is,

215
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
people are still eating their cheese

216
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
from the same place,

217
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,560
and even if it's there or not.

218
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,900
And I think there's a missing step there

219
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,060
of getting people used to,

220
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,100
things are changing.

221
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,220
How we do testing is changing.

222
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,620
Okay, so here is the title of your lightning talk.

223
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,940
Test is still dead.

224
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,780
Test-

225
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,280
Test zombies must die.

226
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,370
It's been three, four years since

227
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,330
Whittaker did his test is dead thing.

228
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,250
And we're both friends of James.

229
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,930
We know he added his own,

230
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,530
you know, drama and excitement to that.

231
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,890
But I was surprised with that,

232
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,890
how many people couldn't see past

233
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,010
the pomp and circumstance,

234
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,290
to the actual parts of what he was saying,

235
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,950
which were true and predictive of,

236
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,090
in some ways predictive of where we're going now.

237
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:56,410
Yep, but test is still dead.

238
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,690
But remember what I said,

239
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,770
test zombies must die.

240
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,090
Zombies are dead,

241
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,210
but they're still so moaning around,

242
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,910
causing the old world to still stay around,

243
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,210
causing friction towards where we need to go.

244
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,390
Zombies are, I almost said brainless,

245
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:21,150
but not well known for their thinking capacity, right?

246
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,690
These are the people that we need

247
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,090
to flush out of the system,

248
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,850
which by either killing them dead

249
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,490
or figuring out how to resuscitate them back to life.

250
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,650
Yeah, but if you look at the world of software,

251
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,570
one thing is looking at the context

252
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,450
of where all these people are coming from.

253
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,990
You have big companies,

254
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,230
you have your Googles and your Netflix

255
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,430
and Amazon and Microsofts.

256
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,050
And you also have, on the other end of things,

257
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,570
you have a ton of people who are making

258
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,330
and testing software that is just for internal IT apps.

259
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,850
It never sees an end user base

260
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,150
beyond a few hundred or maybe a thousand people.

261
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,460
So the audience, are these generally folks

262
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,300
who are concerned about the role of testing

263
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,140
or are they testers?

264
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,660
No, it's, star is interesting.

265
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,700
When Lee, typically,

266
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,140
I've been going to stars off and on for a decade,

267
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,140
and Lee Copeland usually kick it off.

268
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,220
He asks questions like,

269
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,860
how many of you have been testing software

270
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,940
for less than a year?

271
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,120
And half to three quarters of the hands go up.

272
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,840
And usually it's someone just been hired as a tester,

273
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,160
just been converted to a tester,

274
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,540
just part of a company that formed a test organization.

275
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,560
They said, we need you to learn testing,

276
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,630
go to this conference.

277
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,470
That's a star.

278
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,330
So there's some weird context there.

279
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,870
Well, you know what?

280
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,330
That's probably cheaper than existing models,

281
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,890
given the ROI.

282
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,770
If companies are insisting

283
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,390
on having dedicated folks around testing,

284
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,030
then yes, they should spend as little money on it as possible.

285
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,190
Well, it's funny you mentioned that.

286
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,150
I saw a tweet this week in reference to,

287
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,870
again, in reference to James Whittaker's

288
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,630
three or four year old talk.

289
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,050
And the statement was,

290
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:09,830
I'm gonna paraphrase it wrongly,

291
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,550
but it's something to the effect of,

292
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,750
companies who advertise that they don't use

293
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:18,470
skilled testers for testing aren't making good software.

294
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,930
That's not the exact quote, I'm sorry.

295
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,430
But with the point being that you have to,

296
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,310
I think the assertion was,

297
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,510
that you have to have skilled testers looking at a project,

298
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,590
for it to be a quality project.

299
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,780
How many testers does a company have to hire

300
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,500
to fulfill that advertising criteria?

301
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,340
I don't know.

302
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,180
I don't know.

303
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,020
But the point is that you and I know

304
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,940
is for a lot of things,

305
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,620
of course you need people looking at things.

306
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,180
And of course there's a human factor.

307
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,140
I'm not going to dismiss that.

308
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,140
But you could actually get a lot of information

309
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,300
about product quality,

310
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,980
and even how useful people find it,

311
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,060
through inference from data.

312
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,900
And I think that's the-

313
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,500
And all sorts of data,

314
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,340
pre-production, post-production,

315
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,140
customer data, service data.

316
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,260
That is a huge leap that,

317
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,620
and you and I both know also,

318
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,460
that can be done,

319
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,500
that's been done for services forever,

320
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,340
but you and I are both,

321
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,840
we can do that for connected devices

322
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,860
of any kind, anywhere as well.

323
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,300
I think that's a leap that a lot of people

324
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,860
aren't quite ready to make yet.

325
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,960
Yeah, no, one of the arguments I get all the time,

326
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,020
but we're a client application.

327
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,940
We can't do it.

328
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,140
I'm like, why not?

329
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,100
Because-

330
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,140
Because we're a client application.

331
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,220
No, that just means you are slow.

332
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,620
Well, usually it's worse.

333
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,900
Usually not just client,

334
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,100
not just their client application.

335
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,260
They go, well, we're really unique,

336
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,700
and we have special needs

337
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,180
that aren't covered by anything else

338
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
that's been done and proven correct in the industry.

339
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,660
Yes, you do have special needs,

340
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,540
but perhaps not the ones you're referring to.

341
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,220
I was on vacation last week,

342
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,060
just as a quick aside, and then I wanted-

343
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,980
We are a podcast full of quick asides.

344
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,180
Please continue.

345
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,700
I was on vacation last week,

346
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,180
and the one thing that I did

347
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,180
that was work related is one of the,

348
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:14,270
how do I obfuscate this sufficiently?

349
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,550
One of the Apple related groups

350
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,730
asked me to come and do a presentation.

351
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,010
And I got that question,

352
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,650
but we're a client.

353
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,610
How do we do this?

354
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,130
The only thing that's relevant

355
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,770
because you're a client

356
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,050
is the fact that you have a slower release cycle.

357
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,930
And I'm going to argue

358
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,380
that that means that your telemetry,

359
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,380
your telemetry investment needs to be even greater

360
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,180
because you don't have the ability

361
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,850
to quickly enhance your telemetry.

362
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,370
Even client teams can go into this world

363
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:57,090
of using the data primarily to derive direction.

364
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,210
But if you have a slow release cycle,

365
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,450
then that means you need to have

366
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,450
a bit more precise data.

367
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,730
You have less room,

368
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,890
a little less room for experimentation

369
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,530
and for your margin of error is a little less,

370
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,770
but you can still,

371
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,930
there's still a ton of value you can get.

372
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,490
Absolutely a ton of value.

373
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,290
So the on test things,

374
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,530
are you, is there any of your topics

375
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,290
that you're willing to talk about

376
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,770
here today?

377
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:24,610
Like what do you think is,

378
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,090
what was the number one question at West?

379
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,730
I can put them into two main groups.

380
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,250
And I think my slides are associated this way.

381
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,170
One is a lot of questions around

382
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,480
testers rolling on Agile team.

383
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
And you and I have talked a lot about that,

384
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,680
kind of where that's going.

385
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,200
And I think I'll answer a lot of questions about that

386
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,760
and how that should work.

387
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,360
Remind me, I had an estimation followup from last week.

388
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,880
I'll get back to that in a minute.

389
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,840
So a lot of stuff about rolling on Agile team.

390
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,680
What does it mean?

391
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,520
And I have a lot of, you know,

392
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,680
lot of advice there.

393
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,520
The other one is-

394
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,200
Is it essentially C Lisa's book?

395
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,970
I definitely referenced the Lisa Crispin,

396
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,330
Janet Gregory Agile testing book

397
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,410
are some great things to learn there.

398
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,410
It's a great start.

399
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,130
But just thinking about things like,

400
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,090
I love testers being involved in defining

401
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,330
what done looks like

402
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,290
and having a say in that.

403
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,850
And because there's traps that teams fall into,

404
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,410
the fragile kind of things of,

405
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,610
oh, test is going to test in iteration N plus one,

406
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,850
what was written, was coded in iteration N.

407
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,250
And you have stabilization iterations.

408
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,090
Those kinds of things,

409
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,050
we just kind of just,

410
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,690
we talk about why they don't work,

411
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:34,450
talk about some leading change and change management

412
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,290
and how you get the team all on the same page.

413
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,730
It's the any Agile coach,

414
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:41,730
anybody who's been on an Agile team for a while,

415
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,450
it's just talking through the people

416
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,810
that are new to the process

417
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:47,690
and kind of their problems and those kinds of things.

418
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,220
It's been a while since I've read Lisa's book,

419
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,140
but it does remind me of a continual debate

420
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,700
between Alan and I.

421
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
And that's the concept.

422
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,740
One thing that he and I both agree with,

423
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,700
in an Agile team,

424
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,500
there is no world for people who are pure generalists

425
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,220
or pure specialists.

426
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,180
Agreed.

427
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,140
What we disagree on is generalizing specialists

428
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,420
or specializing generalists.

429
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:16,800
Generalizing specialists.

430
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,280
Specializing generalists.

431
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,960
Are you great?

432
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,600
What I think you need to do on any team

433
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,880
is build the right pieces of the puzzle.

434
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,360
You need a lot of things done.

435
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
You need people that you need,

436
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,200
you need backup,

437
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,360
you need complementary and both complementary skills

438
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,760
and diversification of skills.

439
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,040
And Brent's having technical difficulties

440
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,640
because he can't stop talking with his hands.

441
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,730
So yeah, anyway, a lot of questions about Agile,

442
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,770
moving on.

443
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,290
Then I get a lot of questions.

444
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,570
Sorry, the reason why I brought that up though,

445
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,660
is Agile, when you say testers in an Agile team,

446
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,290
is that a specialist,

447
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,250
a testing specialist inside of an Agile team?

448
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,410
Generally a testing specialist within an Agile team,

449
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,610
but they haven't quite figured out that transition yet.

450
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,930
I think when a lot of teams first moved to Agile,

451
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,490
they stick with the strict role definition

452
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,870
and role responsibilities with walls in between.

453
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,570
The walls in Agile more than any place else

454
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,010
need to go away.

455
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,370
Yeah.

456
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,370
Or blend.

457
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,490
Blend is probably a better way

458
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:26,090
because you do have generalizing specialists

459
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,770
and that's where the blend comes from.

460
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,410
I am my role on an Agile team.

461
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:32,370
I'm holding back from diving into this argument now.

462
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:36,650
You know, my role on an Agile team is I am,

463
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,970
I'm the testing and quality

464
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,890
and often process and efficiency specialist.

465
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,490
Those are things I'm good at.

466
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,810
And I think it behooves anyone,

467
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,130
if you're part of a team,

468
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,410
leverage your strengths,

469
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,570
find the things you're good at

470
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,610
and use those to make the team better.

471
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,570
There's additional challenges.

472
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,410
So it's great that we're both in agreement

473
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,370
that the pure tester specialist must die.

474
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:03,470
One of the things that happens,

475
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,010
if those guys are there,

476
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,970
then that encourages the need for us

477
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:14,170
or it encourages the dysfunctional stabilization period.

478
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,330
And once that bad boy's in there,

479
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,970
you're never gonna get out of Scrum or Fall.

480
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,730
And one thing you said,

481
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,250
I want to clarify in a little bit,

482
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,530
is you said the pure testing specialist.

483
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,730
You're right in your mind and you're right in general,

484
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,610
but I think what a lot of the meaning of what test is

485
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,610
and what testers do is so bizarre, bastardized, freaked out.

486
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,810
Oh, I saw a blog post today.

487
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,010
Someone said, stop sending me recruiting memos

488
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:44,890
for a software engineer and test.

489
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,850
I am a software quality engineer.

490
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,810
I go, what the hell does it matter?

491
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,180
Titles don't mean anything.

492
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,780
I wrote a blog post this long time ago.

493
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,500
But the point is that you can say,

494
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,260
I'm a pure testing specialist,

495
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:00,140
but in that I look at code flow and process

496
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,660
and this and that and you actually know

497
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,930
you're actually a specializing generalist

498
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:07,360
or a generalizing specialist.

499
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
I like watching.

500
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,560
Great.

501
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,480
Did you just agree with me on the air?

502
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
My eyes go up and down.

503
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,840
So wait, there's even more.

504
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,240
After my Tuesday night,

505
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,000
so that's, and I'll talk about those.

506
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,440
I have some career advice that I like to share

507
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,080
at these things, especially for new testers.

508
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
I have things about how to grow in your career.

509
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,480
I didn't plan on talking about those at Star West,

510
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,880
but I had the slides in my deck

511
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,960
and one of the questions was,

512
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,040
what the heck are these slides for?

513
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:38,440
I said, oh, let me talk through those.

514
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,840
So I wanna be a little bit more purposeful about it

515
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,000
and it went over very well.

516
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,840
So I'm gonna be more personal

517
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
at talking about career advice.

518
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,200
So that's on Monday afternoon,

519
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,920
Tuesday night got the lightning talk.

520
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,680
I get Wednesday and Thursday.

521
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,080
I could go to Disney World,

522
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,280
but being a 48 year old man going to Disney World

523
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
by yourself seems a little pathetic to me.

524
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,320
So I'm probably just gonna do what I,

525
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,880
I'll go to sessions.

526
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,960
I will talk to people.

527
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,560
I'll probably get a bunch of work done

528
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,200
because my day job continues.

529
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,920
And then on Friday of that week,

530
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,160
Star does the leadership summit,

531
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,040
where a portion of the people of the conference

532
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,360
hang around for one more day of stuff.

533
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,480
And I went last year, I was a member of the panel

534
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
answering random questions from the audience.

535
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,560
And I was impressed by the,

536
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
say it's a leadership conference.

537
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,920
So it's, you never know what's gonna be there

538
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,840
in test managers and test leaders,

539
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,720
but very mature audience with great questions

540
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,880
and great insights.

541
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,480
It was fun to be part of that crowd.

542
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,760
And I was asked to come back

543
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,480
and give the keynote, opening keynote,

544
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,960
or actually the only keynote for that talk this year.

545
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,880
So I'm talking about leadership on Friday.

546
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
Test zombies must die.

547
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,860
And I think the thing is, and again,

548
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,020
it goes back to the, a little back to our leading change,

549
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,340
actually a big part of it.

550
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,780
And if you see my talks before,

551
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,780
they'll reference books I like and books I've read,

552
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,020
but some of the main points I'm gonna talk about there are,

553
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,860
you can't, you know, getting rid of command and control,

554
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:04,900
you know, software engineers are knowledge workers.

555
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,760
You can't manage them like you manage factory workers.

556
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,440
My big thing is give people a framework they can work in,

557
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
let them know the rules of the game,

558
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,560
be transparent about what you value,

559
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,620
and then get out of their way.

560
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,300
So you just listed off two of the three things

561
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,660
we talked about last time.

562
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,500
You said-

563
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,340
Accidentally.

564
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,180
People-

565
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,100
I can't remember that back that far.

566
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,390
You said the people and the processes.

567
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,870
And you also got to get the right technology in-house

568
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,670
to support those other two aspects.

569
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,190
The most important thing is,

570
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,710
the most important thing to get right

571
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,180
is the people behavior.

572
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,140
And making sure that they are working towards

573
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,020
the common goal, which I believe is all about

574
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,780
people moving in this new world.

575
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:57,340
Our job is acceleration.

576
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,340
Our job is to look at what is the behaviors

577
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,020
of everything that's involved,

578
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,660
whether it be dev behavior,

579
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,140
or product behavior, or the customer behavior.

580
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,940
And making sure that we're clear on what is the goals

581
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,180
that are valuable to the business,

582
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,740
and that we're helping to accelerate

583
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,980
those things towards that.

584
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,260
But it's how you do it that's critical.

585
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,020
You can be a leader and say,

586
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,860
there's a couple things that happen

587
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,980
when leaders try and do this, that don't work.

588
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,860
One is they tell people what to do and they don't do it.

589
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,820
Well, that's command and control, it doesn't work.

590
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,660
Right.

591
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,300
And these are knowledge workers.

592
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,020
We have creative people, we have people

593
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,140
who can figure things out on their own.

594
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,660
We need to let them do that.

595
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,460
So the things that are very prescriptive

596
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,620
and some practical advice there is,

597
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,180
one, as a leader, be transparent about what you value.

598
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,220
Just make sure people know that they're not,

599
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,660
I value output, what you get done,

600
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,220
I value that you have business impact,

601
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:59,220
customer impact, and collaboration working with others.

602
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,380
Those are the three big things I value

603
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,420
people I work with.

604
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,740
But it's not just value.

605
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,740
You gotta put muscle on it.

606
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:06,900
What do you mean by muscle?

607
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:07,740
So you don't have to fight with it.

608
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,260
You just say, hey, I believe in fuzzy bunnies.

609
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,340
Well, great.

610
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,700
But if you don't give the same people a framework

611
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,740
for which you're measuring it, or the definition of success,

612
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,740
this is how I know if we have achieved it.

613
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,940
And visibly recognize and celebrate

614
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,580
when people are demonstrating those values.

615
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,420
I don't like carrots and sticks.

616
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,820
I believe, I'm a big fan of, if you've read

617
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,820
beyond the five minute video of Dan Pink's drivebook,

618
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,700
people are motivated by progress.

619
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,460
People are, when they see things working,

620
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,300
people get excited.

621
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,820
You don't need to give them, hey, you got all your estimates

622
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,300
right last week, here's a $100 bonus.

623
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
It's stupid.

624
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:54,340
No, but they want to know that the work that they're doing

625
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,860
is contributing to the greater good of the people

626
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,620
around them, which is generally the teams

627
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,460
and the team's cohesive goal.

628
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,060
You just mentioned, like yesterday I had a fantastic event.

629
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,420
So I, on a weekly basis, attend, it's essentially

630
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,700
an exec status report meeting.

631
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,860
I thought you were going to say drum circle, but go on.

632
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,320
No.

633
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:21,240
And one of the guys presented a report that says,

634
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,850
we are able to measure something.

635
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,290
And it is only ever working.

636
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,890
All of our customers, only 10% of our customers

637
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,660
ever have a good experience.

638
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,460
So 90% of the kind of customers are using this particular thing.

639
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,320
It's all on the floor.

640
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:46,830
That initiated from the VP a 15 minute praise storm

641
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,720
towards that individual for being brave enough to bring in

642
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:57,720
that bad news to showing that they have the technology now

643
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:04,280
to prove that we suck and that it was truth-based.

644
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,720
The VP was like, finally, we're able to measure

645
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,680
the customer impact of this thing.

646
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,920
And that is a massive win.

647
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,520
And that is happening.

648
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,680
This is the first time I've ever done that.

649
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,520
I've seen a VP do this.

650
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,360
But I'm seeing the incidence of that type of thing

651
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,720
happening over and over again.

652
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,880
What's important, green means how close do you

653
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,720
map to the truth as opposed to how on track are we

654
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,960
or any of these other sort of bullshit vanity metrics?

655
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,720
You need to walk the talk.

656
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,640
You need to walk the talk.

657
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,720
If you say you're going to do this, and I'm sure you and I

658
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,280
and many others have been a part of trying

659
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,360
to tell people what they think they want to hear versus telling

660
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,280
them the truth.

661
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,880
And until you visibly recognize and reward

662
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,600
is not the right word, but recognize and celebrate,

663
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,360
this praise fest was a celebration,

664
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,670
recognize and celebrate the culture you want,

665
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:03,670
it's not going to happen.

666
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,470
That's a really huge part of that.

667
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,350
And this VP, just to be clear, the reason

668
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:13,070
why I went on this diatribe, he has made it very clear,

669
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:18,230
his high order principle is that we keenly understand

670
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:24,960
customer impact, that we keenly understand customer pain.

671
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,000
And if that's the things your organization cares about,

672
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,600
which it probably should be for most organizations,

673
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,080
you have to be transparent and honest about that.

674
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,800
You can't go into that meeting thinking,

675
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,400
well, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news,

676
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
because that would make me look bad.

677
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,920
So I'm just going to tell, I'm going to gloss over it

678
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,600
and kind of find the right way to put lipstick on the pig

679
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,800
and make it look all right.

680
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,920
That's the wrong thing to do.

681
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,720
And the other challenge leaders have,

682
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,120
they'll say, Ellen, I get everything you're saying,

683
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,680
but I have a hard time getting my management to buy off

684
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,000
on this.

685
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,700
And I say, yeah, I see Brent about to jump in,

686
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,410
but that's your job.

687
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:13,210
You as a leader, you constantly need to manage up,

688
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,890
not in a suck up kind of way, but being honest and transparent

689
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:19,770
about what's going on and about what your expectations are.

690
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,730
It's part of what you need to do.

691
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,730
And I hate seeing, and I see us on Twitter all the time,

692
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:28,810
and it bugs the crap out of me, is constantly throwing,

693
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,330
I want to do x, but management won't let me.

694
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,770
It would be great if we do x, but our management

695
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:35,730
is not supportive.

696
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,690
So what I heard you say, what I heard you say initially

697
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,910
is, I would love to remove command and control,

698
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,470
but management won't let me.

699
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,460
It's a while one loop.

700
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,820
And the only way to break out of a while one loop

701
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,170
is control out, delete, and kill the damn process.

702
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:01,770
The problem with that guy, so I get those type of things

703
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,530
all the time.

704
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,690
And I go, OK, here's a couple of techniques you should try.

705
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,890
Number one, if your management won't do it transparently,

706
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,210
it's probably because he's risk adverse.

707
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,810
Everybody is built in different ways.

708
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:19,410
I can kick Mr. Risk Adversus ass every time

709
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,610
by showing success.

710
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,810
Yes.

711
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,810
And what you need to do is, can you

712
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,610
fund a small pilot project that will resonate

713
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:34,170
with your management that will say, hey, look,

714
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,130
this same team tried it one way.

715
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,290
They tried it another way.

716
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,770
And look, it's better.

717
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:42,010
Maybe we should try to scale this up to everybody else.

718
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:45,370
The Risk Adverse people, they're always

719
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:49,570
going to leverage what they've known that works.

720
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,970
They're going to be fond of best practices.

721
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,050
At that level, their decision-making framework

722
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,010
is entirely based off of their experience.

723
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,770
And you're asking them to improve something

724
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,210
they have no experience enough, and neither do you.

725
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:07,850
And also, I can share a story from real life right now.

726
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,130
We have at Microsoft a lot of people

727
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:12,450
with a lot of experience at very high levels.

728
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,090
And guess what?

729
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,050
All that experience is at Microsoft.

730
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,330
Where I'm getting to is, I've done the same thing

731
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,540
for a long time, and they've had success doing that.

732
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,580
And they think the way forward is just

733
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,420
to keep on doing the same thing.

734
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,540
Because that's what got them there.

735
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,980
Must be able to get them there.

736
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,140
But that's not always the case.

737
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,540
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

738
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,140
But what do you mean if it ain't broke?

739
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,500
Well, look at our metrics.

740
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,900
They've been green for the last 15 years.

741
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,460
How do you know if it's broke if you don't know anything

742
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,380
but what you're doing?

743
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,220
I think my car is supposed to go rattle, rattle, bang,

744
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,620
rattle, rattle, bang when I drive it.

745
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,540
Because that's the way it's worked for the last 10 years.

746
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,220
You don't know what you don't know.

747
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,180
Exactly.

748
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,380
One of the speeches that I've been given a lot lately

749
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,560
is around a heuristic that I've discovered.

750
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,880
And I first discovered it with Agile.

751
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,880
And it's just simply this.

752
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,160
When you try to deploy a tool or a framework

753
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:16,720
within your current team, and it's painful as all hell,

754
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,800
do a quick search to see what the world feels about it.

755
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,520
And if you discovered that there are

756
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,240
a nontrivial number of people who are very happy with it,

757
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,560
then odds are the way it's deployed on your team is wrong.

758
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,560
Very well put.

759
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,600
Is there anything else I was going to say about?

760
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,320
Leadership.

761
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,080
Cover Star.

762
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,440
Yeah, leadership.

763
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,600
I think we covered it.

764
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,520
So when does Star become Squar?

765
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,760
Scar.

766
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,560
Not my decision to make.

767
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,160
It'll be fun.

768
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,960
I hope to meet some people there.

769
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,240
I could bring my stuff and record a little BOTUS edition

770
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,200
podcast there.

771
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,720
I could grab a random tester and interview him.

772
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,880
And then we could over-dub you later going, bullshit!

773
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,260
We could actually do a link session.

774
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,100
No, it makes for coming recordings.

775
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Yeah.

776
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:16,500
So Alan is the technical recording engineer.

777
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,420
There's a crapload of credits that we haven't given him here.

778
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,500
I am the prettier one.

779
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,980
His job is to do the technical stuff.

780
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,380
Yeah, that's the way my career works.

781
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,300
So anyway, that's Star.

782
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,860
It's coming up the first week of May.

783
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,780
I'll be in Orlando.

784
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,540
If any of our three listeners wanted to go there,

785
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,580
is it too late?

786
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,540
No, I don't think so.

787
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,900
I think you just show up and give them a bunch of money

788
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,300
and do what you think.

789
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,700
I'll be hanging out in the lobby.

790
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,220
So it doesn't cost money to see me.

791
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,940
But I don't know how it works out.

792
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,980
All right.

793
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,820
Oh, I'm going to save.

794
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,620
I'm pointing at the Kanban board.

795
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,700
I'm going to bring up number two as a mail bed question.

796
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,020
So I'm going to save that one.

797
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,970
Let's go on to Brett.

798
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,370
What have you been thinking about lately?

799
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:04,450
Well, so nothing.

800
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,010
Yeah, that's what you did last time.

801
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:08,010
I'm not going to go too deep on this.

802
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:12,450
I'll tell you the type of things that I'm focusing on lately

803
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:18,130
is number one, the current shiny thing that I'm diving into

804
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,090
is engagement more deeply.

805
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,010
So engagement, I've talked many times.

806
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,010
What does engagement mean?

807
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,810
Are you getting married?

808
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,290
I'm already married, Alan.

809
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,290
Thank you.

810
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,250
All right, so then what does engagement mean?

811
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:41,180
Engagement is sort of the study of how users behave

812
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,820
on all sort of aspects of life.

813
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,040
If it's the study of, would it be engagementology?

814
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,560
Is it always a la-cheek?

815
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,200
I don't know.

816
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,880
It could be engagement tree.

817
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,820
So engagement is customers?

818
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,420
Yeah, so engagement is whether or not your customers,

819
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,660
in our context, it's whether or not your customers

820
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,820
are having a delightful experience.

821
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:16,300
Like one of my favorite stories is that we learned here

822
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,380
years ago there was a product we had,

823
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,020
and we compared it to a competitor's product.

824
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,820
We'd have customers come in, and they

825
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,940
would evaluate both products.

826
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,180
Our product, people were 90% successful,

827
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,140
more successful on performing the tasks.

828
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,500
A typical usability study, we'll walk people

829
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,220
through doing things like, hey, calculate one plus one,

830
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,940
or schedule a media request, or make a phone call,

831
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:49,060
or save a spreadsheet, things like that.

832
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,620
This particular product, we were 90% more successful.

833
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,180
People were able to achieve those tasks.

834
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,980
But the thing that was fascinating

835
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:03,420
was that 70% of the people in that particular study

836
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,820
walked out of the room saying, wow, I

837
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,620
have to go buy that competitor's product.

838
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,220
That didn't work out very well, did it?

839
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,860
No, because the pivot was wrong.

840
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:17,420
We were much more successful at getting work done,

841
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,260
but the other product was fun.

842
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
It was engaging.

843
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,100
It made people want to come back.

844
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,340
So they were perfectly happy being less efficient

845
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,780
on getting the effort done, because they

846
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,740
were having a fun time exploring,

847
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,460
a fun time figuring things out.

848
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,860
That's interesting.

849
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,780
Logically, that's counterintuitive.

850
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,180
When you sit back and think about what products you like,

851
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:43,060
you go, oh my gosh, that makes sense.

852
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,340
I want to have fun using this product, even

853
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,260
if it is a spreadsheet app or some business-y thing.

854
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,580
That's a great point.

855
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,900
One of the topics that I'm beginning

856
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:58,940
to dive in a bit more deeply on is this concept of gamification

857
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,860
for engagement.

858
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,860
And so one of the things that they found out

859
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,780
is people like games, all people.

860
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,580
They like games.

861
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,820
They like little reward systems.

862
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,700
Different people like different games.

863
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,380
I'm not super fond of trivia games,

864
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,180
but I love puzzles as an example.

865
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,060
It's a sort of a scientific study

866
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,380
around how to use this concept of games

867
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,340
to improve engagement on whatever you want to engage on.

868
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,980
After spreading the last five years, or two years

869
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,300
physically, on Xbox, obviously there

870
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,820
is where those gamer points that are worth nothing,

871
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,900
that's sort of the root of gamification.

872
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,700
And I've applied that sort of concept

873
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,780
on lots of different things.

874
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,500
People will do amazing things for points

875
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,650
that aren't worth anything.

876
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,410
So I also used to work in Xbox.

877
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,570
And I remember one of the team meetings

878
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:00,680
I had where I explained that games, one of the patterns

879
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,800
that I had noticed, is that games

880
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,640
were the inconvenient tax that allowed people to convert

881
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:11,220
dollars to achievement points.

882
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:14,940
Because there was a lot of users who just go and buy

883
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:18,620
the $1 stupid game just to pound through it,

884
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,060
just to get the extra 200 achievement points.

885
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,020
And Microsoft as a business is quite OK enabling

886
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,740
that behavior.

887
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,500
Yeah, it's interesting though for engagement.

888
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,180
I wonder why more applications, more like line of business

889
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:39,940
and not games, don't have some sort of gamification aspect

890
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:45,000
to encourage usage and learning the product.

891
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,520
One of the case studies, so right now there's

892
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,400
very few platforms doing this.

893
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,240
Badgeville.com is the primary platform

894
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,320
for enabling gamification.

895
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,800
And one of their major case studies

896
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,690
is gamifying knowledge management.

897
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:03,730
So you get points for creating a post.

898
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,490
You get points for reading posts.

899
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,650
You get points for editing posts.

900
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,890
And I said, wow, I wonder if that will change the sort

901
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:16,610
of typical Wikipedia contribution percentages.

902
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,390
It's like 1% contribute and 90 zillion percent.

903
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,030
Just good math there, Brent.

904
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:25,190
Yeah, plus or minus a few zillions.

905
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,870
Well, this is why I think the Stack Overflow and Stack

906
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,470
Exchange family of websites have been so successful,

907
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,230
is they've taken a question and answer forum concept

908
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:37,390
and brilliantly applied gamification.

909
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,070
I mean, I don't know if you know how this works.

910
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,110
It's not only points you get for being.

911
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,870
You get points for answering questions

912
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,310
and doing the right things and having good questions that

913
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,510
are upvoted, et cetera.

914
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,790
But as you get more points, you

915
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:50,870
get more privileges on the site.

916
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:54,430
So the top contributors become basically the administrators.

917
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:57,230
And as you get farther up, you go, oh, I can now edit posts.

918
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,550
I can now look at the, without too much,

919
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,990
you get fairly involved.

920
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,550
And you start getting the, when you log in, you can see,

921
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,110
oh, there's been suggested edits that you have to approve.

922
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,270
And it's fun.

923
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,510
You get, oh, I feel important now.

924
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,870
Now I want to be more engaged.

925
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:18,030
So there's a book that I'm reading as well called

926
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:22,790
a Gamification by Design, which I found there is a website.

927
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,630
I think it's itbooks.com.

928
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,790
Might be IT Dash Books, where they have the book available

929
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:34,190
for personal use only, but free as a PDF format.

930
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,590
So you work at Microsoft.

931
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:39,760
Why are you so freaking cheap?

932
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,880
I am one Microsoft, and I will eliminate costs as I see it.

933
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,480
Anyway, so one of the experiments

934
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,400
that I'm going to be doing, incidentally,

935
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,280
I buy all my own books with my own money.

936
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,740
So when I get fired, I can keep them.

937
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,540
But anyway, go on.

938
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,940
I buy all my own books with Microsoft's money

939
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,140
so that when I get fired, I will still keep them.

940
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,020
Different values.

941
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Anyway, by the time that I plan on getting fired,

942
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,340
those books will be irrelevant anyway.

943
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,140
One of the things that I'm experimenting with,

944
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,900
so I don't know if I told you, but I

945
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,460
have a confirmed new listener to our podcast.

946
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,920
And that is my eldest son is now a big fan.

947
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,280
It's mainly for me, I know.

948
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,420
Yes, it's all about you.

949
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,780
And one of the things that he recognized,

950
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,780
because I'm about to gamify our chores system.

951
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:47,060
So right now on my blog, the second most popular blog post

952
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,740
on my site is the Canban for Chores.

953
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,660
It's a system that works very well.

954
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,740
It was inspired by Alan.

955
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,700
I only tweeted about it.

956
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,580
I didn't blog about it, so I don't have any copyright.

957
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,540
It's still inspired.

958
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,520
I love Canban for Chores.

959
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,000
The kids still love it.

960
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,400
But engagement on the Chores system has dropped.

961
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,440
You know why they love it?

962
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,790
I'll tie it back to my leadership talk.

963
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,670
One of the big rules of Canban is

964
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,830
limit your work in progress, but visualize your work.

965
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:23,390
And by visualizing your work, you see the progress.

966
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,990
People are motivated by progress.

967
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,750
People like seeing stuff moved to the done column,

968
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:31,230
whether it's work that we do every day at work or chores.

969
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:35,630
You know, with my kids, I don't think that's the main reason.

970
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,430
The main reason is because they get

971
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,390
to pick what they want to do.

972
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:44,570
Well, the main reason is exactly that.

973
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:48,570
So me and my wife will put a various number of chores

974
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:52,290
into the ready column, and they get to pick.

975
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:55,890
And so when we batch load the ready column,

976
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:56,970
they're in there.

977
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,410
They're like, oh, I want that one.

978
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:01,530
I'm not taking that one.

979
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,730
The other thing my kids have learned from that as an aside

980
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,970
is how to break down tasks.

981
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,490
We'll put even homework into ours,

982
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:10,810
but we'll work together on how to take a long thing,

983
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,490
like a book report, and break it down into chunks they can do.

984
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:16,250
I'm going to do this chunk of my homework.

985
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,770
I'm going to write down the outline for my report.

986
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,530
And then I'm going to go pull weeds or whatever.

987
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,850
And then I know I can put it off till tomorrow.

988
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,690
I can go through it.

989
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,970
I can write the first draft.

990
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,490
That's another task on there.

991
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,850
But then I can break things down because my kids are

992
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,530
a little younger.

993
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,970
The oldest just turned 10.

994
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,010
And they like to do everything, whether it's

995
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,050
a chore or homework, in about half hour chunks.

996
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:42,540
And they want to be done with it and do something else.

997
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,540
I'll need to talk to you about that later

998
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,060
because my youngest son, I think

999
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,700
it's a clever idea putting homework up on that board.

1000
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,500
Anyway, one of the things I do want to do

1001
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,540
is gamify the board because now what the kids are doing

1002
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:00,520
is there's certain minimums that they

1003
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,000
have to do to get the rates across.

1004
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,240
And they've lost their initial glossy feel

1005
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,160
about how the system worked.

1006
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,400
And now they just want to do the minimum

1007
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,020
because it's still a chore.

1008
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:15,260
And so what I want to do is use gamification

1009
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:20,540
to see if I can't improve their throughput rate on how

1010
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,340
chores get across.

1011
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,060
Very interesting.

1012
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,700
I love optimizing processes, whether it's

1013
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,170
home life or software.

1014
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,570
We got about eight minutes left here.

1015
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:35,440
I want to get to the mailbag.

1016
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,040
That was fantastic, Ellen.

1017
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,840
You're getting really good at this.

1018
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,960
I practice it on the car on the way to work.

1019
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,640
So the first one is from my own mailbag.

1020
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,840
And this is one is addressed.

1021
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,320
Dear Dr. Brent, Mr. Brent.

1022
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,760
Oh, it's your mailbag.

1023
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,070
It's my own personal mailbag.

1024
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:59,310
We talked last week about estimation quite a bit.

1025
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:00,670
They want to dive deeply into it.

1026
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:01,670
We didn't talk about it.

1027
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:05,230
You made fun of me 20 minutes last week on estimation.

1028
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,510
I make fun of you all the time.

1029
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,630
All right, fair enough.

1030
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:11,100
What do you hear the overdubs I add to this one?

1031
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,980
So I had a mail this week and said,

1032
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,380
didn't quite say, dear Mr. Brent.

1033
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,460
But I'll phrase it that way.

1034
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,740
Anyway, the question was, Alan, get to the point.

1035
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,380
The comment or question was, I want

1036
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:31,870
to have accurate estimates in hours or days for my team.

1037
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,710
And then because I want to do that because I want to hold

1038
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,300
them accountable for their estimates.

1039
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:43,330
What do you think about that?

1040
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,670
Brent's boiling.

1041
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:50,430
I would like to have a personal one-on-one conversation

1042
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:52,430
with this individual.

1043
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,150
And what would you like to say to them?

1044
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,550
Something along the lines of WTF.

1045
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:07,450
So what I heard you say is, I like how the sun's shown in 1996.

1046
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,810
And I'm going to continue to pretend the sun shines exactly

1047
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,580
that same way.

1048
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:19,100
I want to have accurate hourly estimates.

1049
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,900
So just to make this extra fun,

1050
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:26,340
can you tell me how long their milestone ship cycle is?

1051
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,380
When he does planning for how many weeks?

1052
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,740
I'm expecting something on the order of months.

1053
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,900
Well, and let me finish my conversation,

1054
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,100
finish the statement here.

1055
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,020
His team works on one-month iterations.

1056
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:45,260
But he does do his, air quote, costing three months in advance.

1057
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,440
So to the good employees of that manager,

1058
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,320
I and Alan both have open positions.

1059
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,240
And we'd happily talk to you about how

1060
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,680
the hell to get out of hell.

1061
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,620
So that is absolutely not helpful.

1062
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,980
So you're saying, hey, I want strong estimations.

1063
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,260
I want my guys to know upfront three months of advance things

1064
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,260
that they cannot possibly know.

1065
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,980
And I'm going to hold them accountable

1066
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,300
to their estimations, which means in addition to that,

1067
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,060
I'm going to hold them accountable to them

1068
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,900
being on track.

1069
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,060
So what's going to happen in order for them

1070
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,220
to have that accountability, that guy

1071
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:41,220
is going to have massively bloated estimates.

1072
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:41,900
Absolutely.

1073
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:46,260
And this is my calmer, yet inspired by the same fire

1074
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:50,220
response to this was predicting things

1075
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:53,060
is hard, especially about the future.

1076
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,660
Estimates are educated guesses.

1077
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:01,210
And it's not only going to be wrong.

1078
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:04,090
It's not only acceptable that they're wrong.

1079
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,210
It's expected that they're wrong.

1080
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,810
And you're going to learn from them.

1081
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:10,690
If you hold people accountable for estimates,

1082
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:15,050
100% of the time, OK, 99.99% because someone's

1083
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:16,450
going to be an outlier, you will

1084
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:18,610
drive the wrong behavior, which means

1085
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,250
extra padding on estimates.

1086
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:23,410
Somebody working all weekend because they

1087
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,970
got their estimate wrong.

1088
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,410
And just everything will be wrong.

1089
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,250
It just drives me nuts.

1090
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,970
So that was anyway.

1091
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,930
That model isn't encouraging.

1092
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,370
It is blaming people for being wrong.

1093
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,250
It's not encouraging learning.

1094
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,610
I believe in a learning organization where you have these,

1095
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:45,810
especially when you're trying to predict the future,

1096
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:46,890
it's going to be wrong.

1097
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:47,810
And it's OK.

1098
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,970
You can't hold people accountable for it.

1099
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,690
Like it's like, I'm going to predict

1100
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,850
who's going to play in next year's Super Bowl

1101
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:54,810
and who will win.

1102
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,330
And if I'm wrong, Brent has to punch me in the face.

1103
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:01,700
Yeah.

1104
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,180
Yes.

1105
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:06,700
That will result in my knuckles being sore repeatedly.

1106
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:09,700
This is not going to be a happy event for the person who's

1107
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,700
being blamed.

1108
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,020
So I did write a blog around the,

1109
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,340
it's like you included all kinds of things

1110
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,180
that I'm allergic to.

1111
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:19,260
Number one, the word accountability.

1112
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,140
Accountability, guys, does not mean who do I get to blame.

1113
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,140
Accountability means who's going to stand up and take

1114
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,580
responsibility and fix it.

1115
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,180
You can't top down, enforce accountability.

1116
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,060
Number two, this guy wants absolute estimates,

1117
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,780
not relative.

1118
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,220
Guys, we don't do.

1119
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:46,940
Humans aren't capable of doing absolute estimates

1120
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,620
to any degree, even on an hourly basis.

1121
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,220
This is not what we're built for.

1122
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,340
We're built for relative estimation.

1123
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,900
We're very good at that.

1124
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,740
Three, he wants to do three month out plan,

1125
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:03,970
or he wants hour by hour estimation

1126
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,770
for a month long milestone for a project that

1127
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,410
is likely to entirely change in the next three months.

1128
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,900
All correct.

1129
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,340
And he wants it to maintain accurate.

1130
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:20,340
And he's not building in a feedback system

1131
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,740
so that when his team goes into the weeds,

1132
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,220
his strategy to fix it seems to be finger pointing

1133
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,580
and not encouraging them to learn what

1134
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:33,860
causes the delay differential between their estimation

1135
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:38,020
and the actual and improve it.

1136
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:38,620
Absolutely.

1137
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,860
So this is fun.

1138
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,900
We're not going to get to our second mailbag question.

1139
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:42,980
We're running out of time.

1140
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,820
But I want to get some context on this question

1141
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:49,780
in that normally Brent and I sort of talk through our list

1142
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,180
and what's going to happen.

1143
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,700
And for this particular one, I said,

1144
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,060
I'm going to bring up a mail I got about estimation.

1145
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,580
But that's all I'm going to tell you,

1146
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,660
because I want to get your real time reaction.

1147
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:03,980
And Brent, you did not disappoint.

1148
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:07,380
Yes, thank you for that, Alan.

1149
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,220
We can dwell on that some more afterwards.

1150
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,180
But we're going to close off for now.

1151
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,900
Thanks everyone for listening.

1152
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:13,860
I'm Alan.

1153
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,780
And I'm Brent.

1154
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:15,780
And I'll see you later.

1155
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,300
Bye.

1156
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,780
I'm working on it.

1157
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,220
I see you sitting in.
