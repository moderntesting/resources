1
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,060
So I'm Alan. I'm Brent and together we do something called the A B testing podcast

2
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,600
We've done it for a couple years now pushing two years

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,880
almost two years and

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,820
Just for fun today. We're going to take a recording of this and make this episode 29 of our podcast and

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,620
Evan will send you a link. I'll edit out the parts that are that Brett will be probably inappropriate at some point

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,550
So we're gonna cover that

7
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,990
Honest, I'll be honest. Yeah, okay

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,710
So the way we do our podcast is the way we're going to do our presentation today

9
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,430
You don't see a big slide deck behind us

10
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,030
you see some things we're gonna talk about about surviving software in the

11
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,110
Being software engineer in the 21st century fancy fancy title to get you here

12
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,230
Although I know the pizza is what you got you here

13
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,950
We're gonna talk about we talked about a B testing and cross that off

14
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,210
We'll talk a little about what's changing in software engineering

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,770
then we're gonna talk a lot about how you survive and adapt and change and the process is people in tech and then most importantly

16
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,600
We'll take questions at the end, but even most er

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,600
No, yes

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,820
Good thing I can edit the podcast right even more and more importantly is that this is gonna be totally interactive if you

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,240
You don't have to wait for the end to have questions

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,000
Given that we don't have slides to go back and forth on and we just we have notes on things we want to talk on

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,400
but if you like I don't get that or tell me more about that or

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,880
In my group we have a situation close to that but it's different what we do here totally interrupt us and

23
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,440
After we're done yelling at you will answer the question to our full extent work for you, right?

24
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Yeah, that works the you shouldn't you should feel welcome to interact, right?

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,280
We have a list of topics both Alan and I could probably do for every one of these bullet points

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,000
I think we could probably do a whole day talk mostly brand. He talks a lot. My job is to keep him in line. I

27
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,550
Do blow VA? I apologize

28
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,290
So

29
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:19,650
If we hit on a topic that seems particularly relevant like speak up, it's okay. If you want to go deeper, that's fine

30
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,490
Well, we'll go broad across this space as we go through it

31
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,250
But we encourage interactivity

32
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,610
Alright, so if you want to talk a little bit about do a plan here. What's going on? Yeah, it's right there

33
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:40,410
Red my also our podcast is very low budget and we refuse to prep and we're well known for

34
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,130
Ad we actually prepped very well

35
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,930
Brand has a nice list here again

36
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,410
My job is to fold three fold one give you some good information

37
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,370
To keep Brent in line three give Brent a bad time any chance I can

38
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:01,370
And he does all of those quite well. So shall we start by enumerating kind of what's what's different?

39
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,450
This like 20 years you've been so let's let's talk about ourselves a little bit. I don't like talking about myself

40
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,970
Okay, I'll talk about you. Okay. All right, so

41
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:18,970
Both Ellen and I have been in the software industry for 20 plus years. I'm not as old as I look

42
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,700
He's the way around he's older

43
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,950
the

44
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,590
Most sorry, I'm gonna interrupt you. Yes

45
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,700
I

46
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:37,420
When you should that one just for those that maybe didn't hear the question was what were punch cards like

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,780
There's a certain gesture I could use but

48
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,380
No, I've been doing this for 20 years

49
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,700
I'll jump in so

50
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:56,260
You all mostly look pretty young some of you probably weren't born in the early to mid 90s

51
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,100
90s kids raise your hands

52
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:06,020
Yeah, yeah, I'm old. So when your parents bought a computer in the early 90s it came with some music software

53
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,820
All right

54
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,460
No, actually you had to buy a sound card separately

55
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:15,820
So it came with some software from a company called MIDI soft and that crummy software. I tested it

56
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:22,730
That was my intro. So I was beyond punch cards. I got to use I was pre win 3.1

57
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,070
I got to use Windows 3.0 with multimedia extensions and that was my beginning

58
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,490
I joined Microsoft about two years after that and I've been there ever since all right brand blah blah about yourself. I'm done

59
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,030
Good question, by the way. Yeah, fantastic question. Let's have some more of that

60
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:45,450
In on the podcast like he he does use those hand gestures just interpreted it as your number one

61
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,450
That's that's what I do

62
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:50,500
So we've been in this

63
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:55,260
20-plus years the majority of the time we've been wearing the the title of

64
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,620
test

65
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,620
Alan's been test director

66
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,500
Up until about five years ago. I was middle management and test

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,530
and

68
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,570
Then Microsoft began to go through a transition. Okay

69
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,790
You want to talk I was gonna but I'll stop okay

70
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,130
Alan and I during that period of time even up until the transition we had been talking about this transition

71
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,250
I think what three years before it actually pulled the trigger because a lot of come it was happening in a lot of places

72
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,250
It's been sort of a slow wave across the industry. So it has

73
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,740
as part of that

74
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,700
Microsoft not only went towards unified engineering model, but they're shifting much more towards using agile practices

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
Yes, and in a lot more

76
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,660
Data stuff so five years ago I transitioned into a dev role into Bing

77
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,760
I was a dev manager and not that team

78
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,100
And then a couple years later

79
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:05,620
I've now transitioned into a data scientist role. I'm currently a data scientist manager

80
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,580
For the Azure compute team at Microsoft

81
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,770
Also in that same period of time

82
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:19,410
I've gone deep in in agile. I am a certified

83
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,450
agile trainer I

84
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:31,360
We don't like neither of us really care about certifications, but it does give me permissions to train other trainers

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,180
And Alan does stuff too I give a lot more detail. So no, but you know, the data scientist is

86
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,260
Anybody it's a statistician who lives in Silicon Valley

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,880
But all right. Yeah, so Brent talked about I'm gonna move on a Brent talked about some of the

88
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,120
Stuff he's doing some of stuff Microsoft is doing but

89
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,080
It's important to think about why

90
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,740
teams and companies and organizations are moving to using more agile stuff and and

91
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,020
maybe unifying engineering teams and blurring the lines being what Devin tests do and a lot of that is because

92
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,690
people see the value in shipping faster and

93
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,650
And I'm a big fan of a book called the lean startup you guys read the lean startup anybody

94
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,650
I know Evan hasn't cuz he doesn't do anything

95
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,180
but

96
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,340
There's I promise Evan. I give him actually five jabs today who in here was on Evans interview loop

97
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,770
Nobody. All right. Okay. Can we talk talk later? Yeah

98
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,090
I

99
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,130
There's a lion I thought horribly paraphrase from lean startup

100
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,450
But you just don't get value from your engineering effort until it's in the hands of customers

101
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,330
So if you can do that

102
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,330
Get get customers your software

103
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,930
Faster in a safe way where you can roll back if you screw things up and in a way

104
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,810
but you have the potential to learn from them there's all kinds of good things that come from that and

105
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,250
So I guess that drives a lot of the why on getting value to customers

106
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,090
They stick with your product longer because you're getting continued upgrades and value

107
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,610
All kinds of good things happen. What are some other reasons?

108
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,610
So it's not just speed

109
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,210
Also from from Reese's book

110
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,330
adaptability so it's

111
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,210
A lot of folks view agile as about oh, we got to go as fast as possible

112
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,250
It's that's a wrong way of looking at it

113
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,610
You have to be as adaptable as possible and when you are you end up going fast as possible

114
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,460
Okay, it's an important distinction

115
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:43,940
Adaptability right now is a huge business imperative in in any service environment your competitors are

116
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:51,770
Very likely, but let me put it this way. So you guys who's your number one competitor?

117
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,380
Someone speak it out who?

118
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,260
Zillow, okay. I've heard of them. Yes

119
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:07,870
How long how much time does it take to some are for one of your customers to come to Redfin and

120
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,470
Decide to go to Zillow

121
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,340
Even even that long

122
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,070
Right, right. So I hope this is going somewhere

123
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,510
switching what the switching costs in an internet enabled service world is

124
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,220
Like that so you have to constantly stay on track

125
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,420
You have to constantly adapt to what is the value that your customers are getting out of your product

126
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,540
The

127
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,020
World that we used to live in 15 years ago

128
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,460
Where you could win by being the first to market doesn't work anymore you could win by

129
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Microsoft strategy used to be

130
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,500
We had a whole lot of money. So we would let our competitors go find the successful market and

131
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,580
Then we apply our resources and then go steal it from them, right? So we didn't have to invest in their indeed

132
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,860
Hey, didn't you work in Bing? How'd that work out for you?

133
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,050
It's still ongoing

134
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,890
But I was the last test manager for the the Zune

135
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:22,250
PC client how about workout for you not quite as well. Did you work on Ken also?

136
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,090
Actually, yeah, I did

137
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,380
No, so Ken the Ken product unit had been dead, but there was one deal we had with Verizon

138
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,140
I ended up being as a test manager at the time

139
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:40,340
I was actually the last person to do a test pass on kin because there was no way I was gonna have any of my

140
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,340
team do this

141
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,560
Kin I'll paraphrase and put up on the internet a

142
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,790
Can I call it a failure? Yeah, I a colossal failure

143
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
We actually ended up making money with

144
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Microsoft's gonna make this phone for tweens

145
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:10,090
And they're very excited about how lots of cool features and it made it almost a week or two in the stores where they pulled them

146
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,730
All in it was essentially a smart dumb phone

147
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,460
So it was a dumb phone, but you could still do some things you could go up on the internet

148
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,580
You could do some email, but the big deal was at that time a tween could go buy it for 40 bucks

149
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,520
right

150
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,320
Completely failed. All right

151
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Quite a history there. Are you gonna screw up Azure to know? Okay. No

152
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,720
The other thing so if adaptability is a business imperative

153
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,180
Then one of the problems is that the traditional methods the the waterfall methods the

154
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
the engineering methods

155
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:57,380
Invented say 20 years ago no longer scale if you are competing with your competitors on

156
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,860
Features on a day by day basis. You can't afford a month-long test pass

157
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,020
Okay, just simply you can't

158
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,470
When I went to being

159
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,470
That's where I took my job job

160
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,790
When you shift to a world

161
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:22,630
Where the the scale of the problems that you have go a couple of orders of magnitude bigger

162
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:25,740
Then you have to start inventing new techniques

163
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,260
right in Bing

164
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:36,540
We ingest thousands of data feeds every single day the size the number the shape the schema changes every day

165
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,960
In in addition to that we have all of our developers within 15 minutes any single developer

166
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,360
can check in and it goes to prop within 15 minutes and

167
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,080
Any developer can do that within the stack?

168
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:56,250
We have multiple layers in the stack and of course that can change at any moment and

169
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,120
In addition to that it's Bing. It's a search engine. We have a machine learning engine in the background

170
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,000
That's also trying to take customer input taking the new widgets that

171
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,700
Individuals developers have put together and combining them to create a UI experience that changes every refresh

172
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,730
How do you test that you don't you can't?

173
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,840
Bugs in Bing are completely worthless you file a bug in Bing a dev will come to you and say why are you doing this?

174
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,840
I can't act on it

175
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,960
What what then becomes more valuable is the patterns data analysis data analytics?

176
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,120
Understanding when is this when is the system making these changes?

177
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,130
That's fixable bugs

178
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,650
Again you could have a bug in one refresh you hit refresh it goes away

179
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,450
But the pattern that caused that initial bug is still in the system. That's what has to be rooted out

180
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,120
like

181
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,290
the

182
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,250
What are you looking at me for you're in the middle of a story? I'm babbling a lot

183
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,690
I'll go to the next thing then the other thing I would say that is a big shift

184
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,350
I'll go I'll just finish this off the other thing that I that this is how we roll

185
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,510
Another thing I would say is just there at my watch in a minute is quality

186
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:28,560
Quality the definition of quality changes in this world like in the world where bugs don't

187
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,760
matter

188
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,120
What matters?

189
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,110
right

190
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,210
There's a phrase that I use now. I don't I no longer refer to bugs and quality as synonymous

191
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,550
I talk about quality and code correctness

192
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,750
quality is a

193
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:55,730
Subjective point of view if you have a bug in a feature that no customer has ever used or does ever use

194
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,990
Then it has no impact on quality

195
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,610
okay, a

196
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:07,640
piece of software that everyone uses is of higher quality

197
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,040
Than a bug-free piece of software that no one's yeah, and that depends it

198
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,480
Given you know because there's like if I asked this room

199
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,360
I get probably a hundred definitions of what quality is but if I use Jerry Weinberg's which is quality is value to some person

200
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Can I get done what I need to get done?

201
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,710
you can have

202
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:33,350
Pretty high quality products that if nobody uses them you're not nobody's getting value from them or all of the elegance

203
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,640
How many have iPhones do you love your iPhones? Do you love iTunes?

204
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:41,150
Really, you're like the only person ever

205
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,110
That's weird so but what else you gonna use right?

206
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,800
soon

207
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,760
Didn't they deprecate the software so even if you have a zoom you can't like doing with it because we still we haven't exceeded the

208
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,040
time limit on the devices

209
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,040
Let's go for bureaucracy. So

210
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,970
What were you talking about you were babbling about something quality? Yeah, it was me definitions. Yeah

211
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:21,570
So I'm reminded of I clicked in I am I am approaching 50. No, I'm beyond Weinberg. Okay, there's in Brian Merrick in

212
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:31,810
1998 somewhere in late 90s introduced what we called the agile quadrants which in these books called agile testing and more agile testing

213
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:38,010
Janet Gregory and Lisa Crispin talk about a lot which goes to your point which is when you think about quality you have

214
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:43,850
Engineering quality on one side and you have a customer facing quality over here

215
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:49,770
They're different and you also have technology facing and customer facing kind of going the other way without me drawing everything out

216
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,630
Your customers don't care what your code coverage is. They don't care how many tests you ran

217
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:58,090
They don't care how many failed and how many passed they care about

218
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,190
Do the experiences provide me value you think about all the different things that cover

219
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,910
what quality is and things we've done in testing and in in

220
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:14,190
Author testing out of not something just testers do but like unit testing very much in that technology facing

221
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:21,730
Engineering facing quality right good unit test. It could go coverage make sure they pass kind of that other quadrant way up here

222
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,050
You think about performance testing reliability even monitoring is up there

223
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:33,210
Those things are a lot closer to measuring what the customer perception of quality is but at the very end

224
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,890
What's the best way to get the customer perception to quality?

225
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,430
Measure from the customer right we can try as hard as we can as as engineering teams to go

226
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,490
okay, this is going to be the customer perception of quality and

227
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,370
Brent's a

228
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,400
Data scientist so we can probably predict

229
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,600
What the customer perception is going to be but that's certainly part of a big part of my my challenge

230
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,660
The so is there anyone here who's agile trained raise your hand if you are

231
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,870
Just just brand to one person know that all right

232
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,150
What are you all right now a couple of the people stepped in do you guys know about the pop and dikes?

233
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,870
I don't marry

234
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:23,110
Yeah, so her husband Tom in terms of his description of quality. I'm very very fond of it

235
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
Or it's not new description

236
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:33,430
But a quote he said everyone in software engineering needs to remember that no one ever

237
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,990
in the history of time

238
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,350
Has ever wanted software?

239
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:44,440
No one wants software. Okay, what they want is their problem solved

240
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,990
Okay, software is a means to the end bug correctness bugs

241
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:56,740
May or may not be a means to the ends if they get in the way of their problem getting solved, right?

242
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,640
the to continue on with less so what's changed there's

243
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,260
So we we talked about there's a lot of new engineering methods

244
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,740
Waterfall thankfully is slowly dying, but it's it's holding on with waterfall is awesome

245
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:18,970
We didn't need to hire testers till the end the docks always got done because we couldn't go on until they were done

246
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,210
So it's great. Yeah, I know what you're talking about

247
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,550
When you shift to this dry sarcasm it just bothers me

248
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:32,110
The you know what bothers me like an interrupt

249
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:37,150
It's like I think in some vague power play you scooted your chair farther forward than mine

250
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:41,300
I just noticed that I just wish the chair was a little bit lower

251
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,800
No, I'm using this as a desk me tired of holding it. Well stop looking at it the

252
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,880
So there's there's lean

253
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Lean and fast agile methods

254
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,600
That is a new engineering model. There's there's safe Kanban scrum

255
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:06,000
There's about ten that are really popular. These are really coming in and helping businesses to be adaptable in addition to that. There's two key

256
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,540
New engineering roles that we now see in sort of my you know

257
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,440
Don't you think that and this is actually being a real question that I'm has to be brewing and somebody said

258
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:21,630
Don't you think these all these processes and names kind of almost get in the way sometimes

259
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,010
I think people get so stuck in trying to go

260
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,710
Oh, we're gonna do this process and they get married to the process and they forget that they're trying to make software to solve

261
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:36,060
Somebody's problem. There's the process is help. I mean if you want pick one there is a bit there is a

262
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:42,200
There is a bit of that of the the monkey's experiment. Do you guys are aware of the monkey's experiment?

263
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,860
You will be in a minute. What's that?

264
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,400
No, not that one

265
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,240
That's a Shakespeare or something or other

266
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:57,640
The monkey's experiment in a nutshell is essentially they did an experiment years ago

267
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,920
They got I'll just make up a number. Let's say five monkeys into a cage. They put a ladder and a bunch of bananas

268
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,190
Okay, I like this story. I'll let it all what they did what they did is

269
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:16,830
Monkeys of course like bananas and so they'll go after the bananas climb up the ladder and acquire the bananas

270
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,150
What they did though is any monkey that did that they would spray it with cold water

271
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,790
okay, and

272
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,750
Monkeys don't like cold water and started getting trained at going after the bananas was

273
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,350
an upsetting experience

274
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:38,790
Then they changed it then what they what they did because monkeys still try they really like bananas

275
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,500
Then what they did is when a monkey went after the bananas they would spray every monkey

276
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,400
But that one right the first one was the first

277
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,280
Stimulus was to train the monkeys to get them to realize hey, there's a punishment associated with going after the bananas

278
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,800
Now they shifted to oh and by the way

279
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,170
That punishment that you got used to avoiding

280
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,300
Now if someone else goes after it, you're gonna get the punishment. Okay monkeys

281
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,180
Didn't like that and they very quickly got trained

282
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,060
to

283
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,180
Beat up the monkey that went after the banana. They didn't want to get squirted

284
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,320
Then what they who wants to get squirted, right? All right

285
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:29,360
Then what they did once they had that is a stable behavior inside that cage

286
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,640
They swapped out the monkeys they would they would take one monkey out put a new one that's never experienced it

287
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,040
but they didn't change anything so they put the bananas in and

288
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,180
The old monkeys would if that new one went after the bananas, he'd get his butt kicked

289
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,920
They kept on doing that until eventually

290
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,780
none of the monkeys

291
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,200
Had ever been squirted with water

292
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,910
But the behavior persisted and that's kind of the same thing when we talk about processes

293
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:04,070
It's you it's it's an encouragement to

294
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Sure, you're used to things

295
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,530
Think about why?

296
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:15,050
Does it still add value and in the environment that you're in today? What can you change in?

297
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:19,690
Terms of the names like again as an agile coach, I would say

298
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:26,770
The first thing you should do if you don't have an agile coach in-house if you don't have someone who understands this topic

299
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:29,290
very deep higher one

300
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,430
It is hard to just shift it is very easy

301
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,870
Agile is actually a much harder practice than waterfall waterfalls very structured do this then this then this then this

302
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,630
Adapting means you have to know when to change

303
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,670
When to change when to say that rule that we had last week is no longer applicable here

304
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,550
So how many have ever like to have tried to change something and work like let's let's change the way we do X

305
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,350
Anybody ever how many of you have heard?

306
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:03,730
The biggest resistance was but that's the way we've always done it

307
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
It's there it's it's a

308
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,300
Name for that but I don't know my name is I don't like it

309
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:17,300
But it's it's common and you that that organizational change part that convincing part is a big challenge

310
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:23,420
But people can get really stuck in that's the way we've always done it. I've heard it, you know at Microsoft a few

311
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,960
100,000 times there's there's a phrase right if it ain't broke don't fix it

312
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,840
if you think it ain't broke then my question would be

313
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,800
How are you measuring that?

314
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,170
Okay, you want to kick stuff I don't even know where you are on your little note list

315
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:50,230
I'm done talking about the I got my list over here. All right, do you want to talk about kind of what's how you survive this stuff?

316
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:56,590
Yeah, so I should talk a little bit about what I'm doing now and that may kick some of this off. So

317
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,490
We're changing Microsoft a lot of teams doing

318
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:04,330
unified engineering big fan of it. Oh, it's like it like so

319
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,890
You know if it's the name I use because I hate the term combined engineering that Microsoft uses

320
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,410
Just means we have a software engineering team not a separate dev and test team

321
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:17,710
A lot of teams are going that way in various different flavors like Windows has check this out

322
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,710
Or the operating systems group they have

323
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:27,030
engineering teams or software development teams, I guess and then

324
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,290
Because we got rid of testers. They have quality teams

325
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:33,390
who

326
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,750
Do

327
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,350
Not as much

328
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:41,390
They do mostly some data analysis some to let adding metrics measurements to the code

329
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:46,110
User experience testing etc. Perf reliability those things all happen there

330
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,490
Devdiv has this developer division has the same thing

331
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,530
Where they call it the E&I the experiences and insights team does sort of the same thing

332
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,730
So if you're a developer know if you break something you break you fix your own stuff

333
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:01,690
the intent of the quality team is that

334
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,620
they would focus mostly on

335
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,260
Customer focus purely on data science

336
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
analysis telemetry

337
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,020
It is the illities

338
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,500
And that the development team would own testing

339
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,420
You know most of the testing of their own code, but I won't say they've done that transition particularly well yet

340
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:32,290
Not windows. Yeah, so I was in windows for a little while by I like to say that my

341
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:40,180
Two and a half years in Xbox was the best five years of my life and that my two years in

342
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,920
Windows was the longest five years of my life. Oh, that's gonna go on the podcast. That's cool. All right, so I

343
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,160
Which makes you what 60 months ago?

344
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:58,460
Brandt you're number one. Yeah four months ago. I joined a team that was all engineers all developers all former developers

345
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:04,220
But they were smart about it. They wanted to adjust an engineering team for the devs own their testing

346
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,500
But they realized very early on hey, we don't know a lot about testing

347
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,980
We're not so good at this and I'm sure there's a lot of stuff

348
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,380
We're forgetting letting through the holes. So my job is to be the quality guy on this team. So I'm the combination

349
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:23,250
Test manager test architect release manager probably something else. I wear a lot a lot of hats the team

350
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,850
Small team Microsoft size probably huge everywhere else. It's about

351
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:31,700
65 engineers

352
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Evan knows that small for Microsoft

353
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,600
And my job is to make sure the developers know how to test so they have the right coaching and training to do that

354
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,200
The developers own all their own testing all the way up through integration testing including some performance from reliability testing

355
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,960
And then I have a handful of

356
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,600
vendors we use for some extra customer focused experience testing and for some extra stuff, so

357
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,960
So my role has been to be part of an engineering team. I'm a peer with all the other engineering leads on the team

358
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:09,760
so we have a director of development and all the engineering managers who run the different feature teams and I report to him and

359
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,130
So it's been a good experience and working in an engineering team figure out how

360
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,680
What it means for a development team to own

361
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:23,760
Testing their own code and sort of some of the challenges they go through and doing that

362
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,190
I think one of the reasons it works for me is Brent and I have talked a lot about this idea of

363
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:35,350
Generalizing specialist or specializing generalist meaning you guys know this term. Have you heard it before?

364
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:37,030
I was gonna talk about it. Shut up

365
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:42,510
So it means I've described my role for a long time as someone who does you know is a little about a lot and a lot

366
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:47,670
About a little meaning I can cover I can I can really kind of help out a lot of different areas

367
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:52,140
There are some areas I go deep on and the areas I tend to go deep on may

368
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:58,140
It may change depending on context when I joined the link team

369
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,420
It's called Skype for business now, but they had a team a very

370
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,700
junior test team who were doing a lot of

371
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:15,220
Manual tests all day and didn't really know a lot about test techniques or they just needed a lot of extra work

372
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:20,740
So my job on that team, I just left engineering excellence where I was a sort of a trainer and a coach and a consultant

373
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,140
So I went into that team and I spent about a year and a half

374
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:30,500
Helping that team become sort of better rounded testers only had approach automation throwing out most of their manual suite because it was useless

375
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,820
and

376
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,420
Kind of turning them into was a I thought a pretty well oiled team

377
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:43,100
Then so but very high level kind of organizational change and training kind of stuff then I went to Xbox where it was

378
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,920
We need someone who knows see really well

379
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,920
We can write a lot of tools and test tools and things to get Xbox one out the door

380
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
So I did that for two years and it was a blast

381
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:58,960
And I'm doing sort of a and I did sort of a combination of that on the but that my transitional team in Windows

382
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,440
I'll help us call it the transitional team. That's better and then I'm and then I'm like I said

383
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,160
I'm doing sort of a release management quality architect sort of role in this team. So

384
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,940
the the line that runs through there is I think no matter how your

385
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,000
Engineering team or your development team or your team is put together

386
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,560
You need in addition to people that can just crank out good code because you always want some of those right?

387
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,800
I won't ask you to raise your hand if you're really good at cranking out good code

388
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,000
We always need those people but you also need people who can plug holes

389
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,480
once I changed my my LinkedIn profile at the hole filler and

390
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,290
Because that's kind of my job. I've told all my managers

391
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,570
I figure out what's not getting done and make sure it gets done

392
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,610
Whether I do it myself or work through others to make sure it gets done

393
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:52,610
So my role is to recognize what those holes are and then get them filled. Oh, and by the way, I have a tangent

394
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:53,930
We were famous for our tangents

395
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:59,910
Do you guys get like a lot of unsolicited LinkedIn recruiter mail? So I know how to fix that

396
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,760
Change I changed my LinkedIn title to generic employee. I don't get any more emails

397
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,080
That one's free. You can do that

398
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:16,570
So you're gonna add something. Yeah, I want to shift a bit deeper, right? Cuz um

399
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:25,240
Alan is in a unique situation his last team change right most of the teams that we go and talk to

400
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,300
Are in transition they already have

401
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,180
say

402
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:38,400
Dev test p.m. And they're trying to figure out how do they move into sort of a more of efficient

403
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,280
team model, right

404
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:48,420
Alan got lucky in my humble opinion is that you started off it was a lock

405
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,780
It actually wasn't he was looking for he was looking for the perfect job for him

406
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,380
Is serendipity

407
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:00,780
What's the quote about luck that says luck is I can't even paraphrase it

408
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:05,560
Yeah, something like that. Like I was ready for luck to strike me

409
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
so I

410
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,080
Think straight I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna anyway. No, I was gonna go back to

411
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,560
So one of the experiences after I left Bing I

412
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,850
was

413
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,090
instrumental in helping the SQL server team

414
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,690
Go from sort of the similar point that you guys seemed like

415
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:34,130
That you guys are at now where you have these combined roles or not combined separated roles. How do you merge towards?

416
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,350
More efficient team for lack of a better word

417
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,090
There's a lot of struggles

418
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:49,580
Dev for example that will constantly ask well, what does QA do now?

419
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,260
Yeah, even when QA knows what they're gonna do now and explain it

420
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:58,300
they still ask this question because one of the biggest problems is

421
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,980
In essence a lot of deaths and I'm sure it's not here but a lot of devs for you testing as

422
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,180
Menial work, right? Why do I have to do that? It's below me. Okay

423
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,100
and

424
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,660
It's really not but you actually had a quote

425
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:26,180
Piggyback off of the the quality speech who owns quality the Twitter that you did a few months ago

426
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,300
I don't know what you're talking about fair enough

427
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,180
You said something if quality is

428
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:41,260
The customer subjective value something something something then who on the team owns quality

429
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:47,220
Producing that if quality is producing value to some customer then who on this team owns quality

430
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:56,250
Right. All right rhetorical question everyone owns creating value for the customer, right? I'm sure I said that I don't remember it was on

431
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,690
God you're old

432
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,850
The

433
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:09,550
So dev goes through a transition period if you guys choose to go with this sort of model tests will go through a transition period

434
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,510
I am a

435
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,990
huge proponent of

436
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,250
of the unified

437
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:20,220
Engineering model

438
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:26,880
I am too, but I don't know that it matters and I'm gonna interrupt cuz it doesn't matter as long as the roles are

439
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,740
Efficient and working together the second the roles become silos

440
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,780
Dev throwing stuff over the fence to test that's the exact work

441
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,780
I think the key is that engineering team is regardless of what you call yourselves

442
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
I was talking to Evan earlier and and

443
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,300
Everybody's just get to make up their own title because titles get in the way sometimes of engineering you think oh you had

444
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,860
You have this title whatever it is. And so I don't have to give you the time of day

445
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,900
But I remember in when I worked on Windows CE

446
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,200
That's an eye roll for people that missed it. I

447
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,640
helped this is probably 2004 I

448
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,360
Trained our dev team to write unit tests and

449
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,980
This is new to them. It's weird because

450
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,380
Developers about every other company in that time period were running right in their own unit test

451
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,780
But it's this brand new thing for these Windows CE developers. But the weird thing that happened was I

452
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,380
Developers come to me and say hey if we're writing unit tests, what are the testers gonna do?

453
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,860
I thought I can explain this and the reasonable question

454
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,940
What scared me more is when a tester came to me and said hey if the developers are writing unit tests, what do I do?

455
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,500
And oh, that's an interesting way to look at that

456
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,740
But when I think of my career I spent probably the first at least

457
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,780
Five years writing unit tests. We played this game of

458
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,860
Codependent ping pong I call it

459
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,540
where the developer gives me some code and

460
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:02,030
I quickly write a little test for it to prove that it's broken and I feel good because I found a bug

461
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:07,390
I'm validated. I give my code give the bug to the developer goes. Oh, thank you for finding a bug

462
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:12,270
Thank you for being my safety net. That's great. I love you and he fixes it and then he gives it to me again

463
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,350
I go I

464
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,310
Put a little more time on it and I find another bug I go that's great

465
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:21,190
He fixed it and I found another bug. I feel more validated here. Here you go again. He goes why thank you

466
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,950
This is great. I love you more and this goes back and forth and

467
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,310
It's really

468
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,990
Maybe the codependent metaphor is too far of it not too far off

469
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:35,670
But this ping pong when you think about efficient software, it's really inefficient to do that, right?

470
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,580
So a couple things come out of developers

471
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:43,180
Writing a lot of their own tests is one

472
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:48,380
I'm a big fan and I'll say everybody asked this a big fan of test driven development and especially

473
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,540
Even more behavior driven development. I'm talking about what those are in a minute for this

474
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,340
You guys know these I said I just talked about these in a minute for those you don't know what they are

475
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,900
But I said I wish I said I'm we're I'm there already know

476
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,200
Okay

477
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,680
That was Brent's attempt to giving me a bad time so

478
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:14,070
Keys here. It's very efficient for if I'm gonna write this code if I write some tests for it before or while I'm writing it

479
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,070
Make sure it works

480
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,080
Developers that write begin to write good unit test

481
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,860
End up writing more testable code

482
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,740
Because a lot of times I'm sure developers in the room have done this like I'm gonna write some code

483
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,700
You think I'm gonna write a test this. Oh shit. I can't test that

484
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:33,460
They go. I'm gonna refactor this which end up with this better code in the first place

485
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:39,580
Because you have to write testable code from the beginning and that code ends up being more usually more maintainable

486
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,130
Let's roll out the people yeah

487
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,810
Yeah, so

488
00:37:55,370 --> 00:38:01,770
That's a good way and I take that one go ahead go ahead yeah, so better to have two minds yes

489
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:05,170
separate no, so

490
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,850
Huge proponent of pair programming where you have two people looking at at the same time

491
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,210
But the the trick with TDD

492
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,730
The the the brilliance of TDD is you test your code first?

493
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,160
So you writing up the test cases that need to pass before you write the code

494
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:29,390
Since you haven't written the code yet. You haven't yet been

495
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:34,200
Perverted by the assumptions that you're about to write so one of the things

496
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:40,480
That I did and then I want to piggyback on this and and that that's a great question because that ends up being

497
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:47,440
One of the challenges with the shift when I went to Bing I told you I went into dev

498
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,380
This was at the time where Bing was going with combined engineering

499
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,100
My team was 50% dev and

500
00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,530
50% test is this a long story no okay the testers ended up being

501
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,340
the

502
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,740
Better developers in the world where we have to ship every 15 minutes

503
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,220
right the the because the

504
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,180
Turns out writing code in

505
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,820
in small chunks

506
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,600
Is not that hard if you have a rock star?

507
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,640
dev architect on the team and say you need a

508
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,680
You're using an n log n and union log or a O of n algorithm

509
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,280
You you need to have the ability to have that second person to go and ask you need to be able to do knowledge sharing

510
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,250
But other than that the 80% of the coding problems anyone can do

511
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:51,710
But the thing we're testing it up being a huge advantage is they already understood the value and how to test

512
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,410
it ended up

513
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,180
What happened is my team first came first were very polarized

514
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,340
Had a bunch of devs that say we're specialists. We are the ones that own this code up and down the stack

515
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,540
But we're not going to do our testing because we own enough complexity and I said

516
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,740
Honestly what I did is I ran my team if you guys are familiar with Kanban

517
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,100
I ran my team with a Kanban model as highly transparent. Yeah, and

518
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,140
You only ship in two week chunks. Okay, so anybody does something wrong?

519
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,740
it's only

520
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:34,640
Two weeks of one person's code that that could have an impact and it's very easy to react and and repair

521
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:42,060
But what ended up happening is is I I didn't force these guys to shift

522
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:49,260
I forced them to communicate be transparent walk through the board and as they went through that as everyone was transparent

523
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:58,340
These guys were realizing that the testers were getting their stuff out faster. They were getting more features done faster

524
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:05,370
And then they started shifting right once the team started sharing knowledge

525
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:14,920
The people with the super awesome very highly specialized algorithms started leveraging and learning from the test guys and once that

526
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,120
Tests are that knowledge learning goes

527
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,600
Then this team becomes a rock star. I when I left being I'll close with this when I left Bing

528
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Alan really wants to interject something

529
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,700
When I left being I had one of my peer teams came to me a PM came to me

530
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:35,400
I had a team of seven at that time and he said Brent

531
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:40,840
I don't know what you're doing, but your team of seven is kicking my team of 30s ass and

532
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:47,940
I said we should meet because I know what we're doing. It's not magic. We just think about it in a different light

533
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,840
Go ahead. Let me give you also a sort of a pragmatic

534
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,340
Answer to that from my recent past we had a

535
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:01,690
Bad bug in our product. It's not released yet. So it's tough back gonna be right?

536
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,610
but our VP was pissed so it was that bad and

537
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,490
There's like how is this and I got the how did we miss this?

538
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:11,490
How did this get through and it turned out that?

539
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:19,170
Developers who are learning to write tests like our team was they're very they were really really good happy path tests

540
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,610
Our product as long as you use our product as expected

541
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,330
No, it's not even close to the edge stay in the middle of the room. It ran great

542
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:32,130
But it wasn't until then that hit me because I'm doing all these hats that I realized

543
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,650
Oh, yeah, there's a whole bunch of other testing. I've been doing my whole life that we're not doing yet

544
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:43,970
So what I did there easy thing I met with the engineering managers and people on their team little half-hour meetings

545
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:50,210
We did a brainstorm made a mind map of all the edge cases and things like that looking at quantity if you want

546
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,130
I mean you're thinking about

547
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:57,130
We'll look at places where concurrency that can happen places where large amounts of data can cause a problem

548
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:04,050
Things like that, you know look at you know non English characters or if it applied etc

549
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,050
and all those things that were

550
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,290
testers are traditionally really good at helping the deal don't me just think about those because

551
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:16,690
one of the things that a generalizing specialist does that maybe a pure specialist doesn't do is we go into the the

552
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:23,090
10-foot level and dive in and then go back out at 10,000 foot level look around and kind of see how stuff fits together

553
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,530
so

554
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,930
Yes, it is

555
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:29,370
You could say that you're biased to your own code

556
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:35,810
But you can there's plenty of ways to get help on that because I think I know plenty of developers who are really good at testing

557
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:42,410
Their own code. So I think it's certain. I know for a fact is certainly possible and for those where it's difficult

558
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,930
I think it's a learnable trait. It is absolutely learnable trait and then there's always the model of pair programming

559
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:50,770
Although it's much like

560
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,410
my experience with TDD and in helping

561
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,210
Say specialist devs learn it's much like

562
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:04,250
The speech you can lead a horse to water right it they have to be motivated to want to drink from and if they're not

563
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,730
It's it's it's going to be a hard-fought battle. The other thing I'll also share around TDD

564
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,820
No, I want to highlight the benefit

565
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:17,350
Evan has a question

566
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:18,470
Okay

567
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:23,750
the other thing about TDD or doing this test having the test and their developer owning it and

568
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:30,050
When not with a model where again within 15 minutes it goes to prod it creates a

569
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:36,620
Sense of ownership on the individual first and foremost if they're checking within 15 minutes can go to prod

570
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,660
Then they don't have to worry about the blame game of oh, no

571
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,640
My fix is fine is that you didn't integrate right?

572
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:48,420
Right. It's there's their control of their own destiny and as they learn

573
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:57,980
So I'm a big proponent of balancing the preventative and reactive measures and as you learned where your preventive measures weren't working

574
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,660
You add tests and as you add tests you realize oh my god

575
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:10,060
The way I've written my code makes it a real peony ass to add tests. I need these tests

576
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:15,460
I'm gonna refactor my code and what I've what I have noticed that every team that goes into this

577
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:21,620
That that code gets refactored into much more maintainable much more testable

578
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,900
patterns across the entire team and when you have

579
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:33,300
That type of code your ability to produce new features and change features starts to go like this

580
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,070
getting in a rhythm is is

581
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:42,360
Actually key. I think ever you don't know what the customers are going to do so

582
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,740
Oh, actually, that's a that's a really good comment

583
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:51,500
The comment was repeat what the question was the question was if customers aren't going to try those crazy things

584
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:54,300
Why bother testing for them and it goes back to the comment earlier?

585
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,140
But if a but nobody finds a bug does it affect quality?

586
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:59,000
I

587
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,360
Don't think is a real reason to go super crazy on the edge cases

588
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,860
But like there is a particular object we could pass to a message as long as we had one or two

589
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:09,860
Which was the normal usage case?

590
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,160
Everything was fine. But when someone added four of those or five of those everything broke

591
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,550
So that's not really on the edge. So a little bit beyond the center happy path

592
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:24,390
It gets to a point this is gonna lead into what I'm gonna force Brent to be the next section

593
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:30,590
Which is there's a comment. I heard probably seven years ago, maybe a little longer at a GTAC conference in

594
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:37,110
San Jose a Google test automation conference where says sufficient monitoring is

595
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:43,820
Equivalent to testing. So if you have the monitoring in your system to know when

596
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:51,440
Every failure has happened to get and get the right alerts on that and know what paths are being used and what's happening there

597
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,320
Sufficient monitoring to cover all those cases

598
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:02,420
Can replace testing? I want to be careful with that one though. I need say that I'm trying to tee up here

599
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,060
Go bright. Right. So you guys have heard I'm sure by now this concept of testing and production

600
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,620
Yes

601
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,500
Okay, it does not please dear God

602
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:18,680
It does not mean take your test suite and turn them into monitors that are on production

603
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,420
Okay, it means you do need those monitors

604
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:28,720
But it means you're looking at the the you're using your customers as your testers

605
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:36,260
It means that you have a much alone statement to write people freak out about that. No, okay. Go go go

606
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:43,480
Customers are fantastic testers. They are that and this is a point I always make for test reason go

607
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:48,880
I am the voice of the customer. I am the customer advocate. I am the customer and you're not

608
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,280
That wasn't very nice

609
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,000
But yeah, you if you can use the real customer as your proxy for the real customer

610
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,720
Yeah, it's always gonna be better off than using a proxy for a different proxy. Do you guys do flight control here?

611
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:13,960
Yeah, so imagine that you have a whole bunch of monitors that can tell you

612
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,720
What's your name?

613
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,200
Kevin, okay. So Kevin just did a check-in 15 minutes

614
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,480
It's now in prod. How does Kevin know that he just broke?

615
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:35,220
All redfin customers in Georgia. We have monitors that would allow you to know that in that type of world

616
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:42,930
Kevin kind of needs to know that right we need to have the ability to detect that something that the business values

617
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,800
Just is on the floor

618
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,920
now

619
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,720
So flight control also known as exposure rings is what you do is you?

620
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:55,600
Take Kevin's code you put it on

621
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:04,270
Call it exposure ring you put it on a segment of your customers say only a hundred people

622
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:09,530
Can see Kevin's code and then you have important signals if it passes those signals

623
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,490
Then you broaden it to an order of magnitude and you keep doing that until there's

624
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:21,120
Some some threshold where it's no longer value to keep just flip it all along

625
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,520
right

626
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,880
When we talk about tests in production really really at the end of the day what a test case is for is

627
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
to reduce business risk

628
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,960
That's the whole point you can do some of those things you need to do to do it preventively

629
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,320
It would not be a good idea for Kevin to do something

630
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:46,800
Where he checks in this fix and then anyone signs in and it deletes the customer database. This would probably be a bad idea

631
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,480
Right, but he has a unit test for that. That's all right, right

632
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:57,960
But he should have a unit test for that and and some mechanism as part of that 15 minutes to prod

633
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:04,080
Should be in place to check that no one can take out the entire business

634
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:10,970
Then things like okay, someone just signed in with some weird character

635
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,160
right that you can use your telemetry and you can use a

636
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,160
a reactionary process to

637
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:28,400
Get that going Google for example, one of the things Google does they used to be well known for shipping crap

638
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:34,260
All the time. They were always in beta. Okay, and I used to have arguments with people at Microsoft

639
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,220
He's like, oh, they're always in beta. They don't ship high quality

640
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,250
They're a fat

641
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:45,650
Okay, they're not a fad. I had actually these arguments and I'm like, you know what?

642
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,380
Their stock price and the number of users does not align with your statement

643
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:57,910
Right and the only way to make that for that to make sense and this is still in one of my test gigs

644
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:04,770
the only way to make sense is that bugs don't necessarily equate to quality or

645
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,730
Perhaps what's more important is?

646
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:13,530
As a business you're working to not prevent pain but minimize overall

647
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:18,370
Pain and what Google is masterful at they instrument everything

648
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:24,330
So they have a belief a set of hypotheses. It's like we think these are our

649
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:31,250
Catastrophic we're gonna pretest this code's not gonna go out but the amount of those test cases is not very large

650
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,270
Much much much smaller

651
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:39,430
They'll use exposure rings. So look at that instrumentation and they'll go. Hey looks like

652
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:44,730
We have more than we expect of people from Georgia

653
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:51,810
That's not are getting sign-in failures. Perhaps we should investigate that and see if we revert the code

654
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,280
so if you think of the purpose of tests is minimizing business risk and you think about

655
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,440
customer value as

656
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,960
Increasing it then you then you have the liberty

657
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,580
to start applying sort of an ROI through to

658
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:16,500
How you are doing everything you can use ROI to reevaluate your processes reevaluate your practices

659
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,920
the

660
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:25,320
The other thing Google is very good at is they can they can make a decision to revert the build right as I talked about

661
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:33,000
It would not go to the next exposure ring or yank it out. No, this is a bad build. We just destroyed

662
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:41,200
The experience for a hundred people in Georgia, but they can also go. Oh, it's not bad enough to stop it from moving forward

663
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,200
But it is bad enough

664
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,040
We're gonna get this

665
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,160
Fixed in in the next iteration and their iterations are either one or two weeks long

666
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:57,680
One of the things that I will say is that a huge time saver something. I'm very proud of

667
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,880
In the last five years. I haven't had a bug database

668
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,120
because I deal with it in real time I I

669
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,360
First got test clean. I first got bug clean then I started a cadence around shipping

670
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:18,680
Small chunks because if you ship large chunks, it's really hard to disentangle

671
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,960
But if I have someone on my team of seven and each one is going to ship something new on a daily basis

672
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,320
If I come in the next morning and it's on the floor

673
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:38,580
It's really hard are really sorry really easy to fix it because it's one person's one code

674
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:44,180
He might even be able to because the complexity is so small. He might even be able to fix it in line

675
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,240
very quick QFE

676
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,510
as

677
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:55,470
We go through that doing it. What QFE mean quick fix engineering release. What's the equivalent here? How fix?

678
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,980
the

679
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:03,830
I forgot where it's good. I can I can take a turn so

680
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:09,300
So I think we probably want to wrap up here and then take a bunch of questions

681
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,420
I think I think we want to get your questions and try and make sure we can adapt those so start thinking of those now

682
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:20,880
What works for us is I can go back to pragmatic our product hasn't shipped yet, but we're

683
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,720
I'm thinking hard about the plan to get there

684
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,140
And so we have you guys use continuous integration server you guys are shipping often

685
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,040
so we use a big fan of this this is where you catch all the

686
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,540
all the kind of devastating things that could happen you never want to get into a flight and

687
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:43,660
You're not really reliable tests there because we gate the build on these we gate deployment on these so it's like someone submits a change

688
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:51,520
It goes through this gate, which is a build unit test these all these other tests these their protractor tests running against the web page

689
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:58,130
If all those pass the bill gets deployed to our continuous integration environment, and that's updated all the time

690
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:04,190
So there's always a build out there with the latest check-ins in it. So that's going on all the time and then

691
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:08,950
What we're gonna do I know you guys are working on shipping much more frequently

692
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:12,550
But we're just my team is gonna start with one release a week

693
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:19,650
So and the good thing that happens from that is our team has been doing sort of for term on agile transition

694
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:24,130
I joined the team in the middle of their their love of what I'll call Scrummer fall

695
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:28,380
Which is we have a full week iteration?

696
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:35,020
Where there's some planning at the beginning and then the devs right and bunch of

697
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:37,620
Do a bunch of work and I make sure they're adding tests

698
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:42,220
But they still create a bunch of debt in there in there and then they try and cram in the rest of the debt at

699
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:47,820
The end at the end of that four weeks have a really crummy product that stabilizes the first week of the next iteration

700
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,500
Being transparent it's not perfect

701
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:57,380
But by moving to this by we're gonna shift to some internal customers coming up soon and by moving to that model

702
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:00,100
I got everyone bought off on shipping once a week

703
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:04,120
Which means whether they want to think of things as a four-week iteration or not

704
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:10,380
I can now in caps things kind of line up into a weekly rhythm and that's when Brent mentioned that earlier

705
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,860
I really clicked on that is having a shipping rhythm is really important

706
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:21,860
Teams can adapt to that like we know we have a one-week rhythm where you know, we're doing a bunch of validation on

707
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,540
Monday and the bill and we do some self hosting dogs

708
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:31,220
But on Tuesday and then we promote to production on Wednesday and then features are finished up for the next thing Thursday and Friday

709
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:34,380
And we start all over again. It's very nice so we can crank that up that

710
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,260
Speed up as needed but it gets

711
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,450
One of the things I'm looking forward to in that is like Brent said I don't

712
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:45,650
Well, first of all, we have a bug database and it's populated with more things and I'd like right now

713
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,930
But we're gonna I'm in the back of my head to put about

714
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:52,930
Organizational change my plan is

715
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:58,330
Little by little without the team realizing it because I'm not even gonna tell them they're doing one-week iterations

716
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:03,410
it's just gonna happen and a little by little we're gonna become a little bit more agile and and

717
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:05,890
eventually I

718
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:12,170
It's gonna be like the perfect team for me. I'm trying to mold them to be like what I want

719
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:14,170
I want to be clear though

720
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,150
Clear all day. I'm gonna try now

721
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:25,850
My teams I saw we don't have a bug database and I've haven't in five years, but that doesn't mean so

722
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:33,670
My teams still have developers in them and they still are human which means they write bugs

723
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:38,830
So my team still writes bugs, but the way we treat bugs is when we encounter a bug

724
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:47,120
That we have validated as customer impacting that we have a process. We call it the swarm process

725
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:53,440
Any bug that comes to my team the whole team jumps on it and that thing is gone within 48 hours

726
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:01,210
So bugs we viewed not only something that's harming our customer, but it's harming the overall

727
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,160
Process

728
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:12,660
And quality of not just the code but everything so I'm an efficiency geek and I mentioned earlier the the codependent ping-pong game

729
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:16,080
which is very inefficient and also it's very inefficient and

730
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:21,680
But by the way that that cost of a bug curve, it's mostly a myth don't draw don't draw that ever

731
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,680
Holding on there is a cost

732
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,600
accruing debt

733
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:33,280
So if you're gonna yep, that's a great bug. We'll get to that when we get to it. That's inefficient

734
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,120
It's so much more efficient to go. Oh, there's a bug. Let's fix it

735
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:41,520
Let's get it. Let's we don't want we don't want those when you can get to that zero and there's a transition step

736
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,140
To get there doesn't happen all at once. I've known teams that have gone through this and you kind of go for

737
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:50,140
Okay, let's have and what I'm doing right now is we have zero bugs at the end of our iteration

738
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,380
usually it's about two days into the next iteration and

739
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:57,080
Eventually, we're gonna be at zero bugs every Friday for the weekend

740
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:03,660
Our sappin and now eventually move into zero bugs all the time. I was planning my head all worked out

741
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,900
There'll be bumps along the way

742
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:10,260
But this is this is where I want to get to but you can't just go to the team and go

743
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:12,780
That's it. Everybody fix all your bugs. I'm not gonna have anymore

744
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:27,620
I think that's a typical I my team customer impact 100% my my team fixes a hundred percent customer

745
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,360
impacting but so what we will do though is

746
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:33,580
the bugs where

747
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:42,620
Hey, if a customer does this sequence of clicks at exactly midnight on February 29th it using a by dye character set

748
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,700
Yeah, I will make the call that that's

749
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,180
That might be a bug I can look at your code. It's absolutely bug

750
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:55,060
We're not going to fix it until we have proof. There's somebody impacted

751
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,060
I'm sure a lot of people in this room. I've worked on products have had multiple multiple releases and

752
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,220
I'm sure a lot of people in this room have bugs like we don't want to fix that

753
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:09,220
But we're gonna hold on to it because we may get to it next time then next time rolls around and you go. Yeah

754
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:14,560
We're gonna do that next time and you end up with this bug. It's like 40 years old

755
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,800
Okay, four years old but and it's like yeah, we're gonna get to that note. That's one thing

756
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,240
that I'm very adamant about and it's

757
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,000
My bug triage like this is customer impacting. Yes, we're gonna fix it and we're gonna fix it very soon

758
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:35,720
But we're not gonna fix it at all. So and that's the thing I want to I want to get a couple other things number one

759
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:43,510
We won't fix it if that bug comes in the February 29 scenario. We'll go. No, it's fixed

760
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:50,870
Okay, we track all of our bugs as tickets on our scrum board. Okay, I will take that ticket and it goes the trash

761
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:56,270
I'm going to completely from here on out ignore its existence if it comes up again

762
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:58,750
I'll say okay that we have customer impact now

763
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:03,430
Hey, and if the answer is still no it's gonna go back into the trash. Would you I have a

764
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,790
Would you

765
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:13,970
Could you would you could you dr. Seuss on a boat with a with a boat add?

766
01:01:14,610 --> 01:01:17,170
I'm gonna go add a little bit of instrumentation here

767
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:23,850
So I know if this I'm gonna track how many people February 29th at midnight are are are entering but yeah, yeah, absolutely

768
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:27,190
it's so

769
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:32,670
Me that's what I most bugs where I would have with with one of my reports isn't gonna be so

770
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:38,790
Hyperbolic right it's going to be hey, but it could if this this and this and there's this other thing

771
01:01:38,790 --> 01:01:45,310
And there's a reasonable expectations could but we don't have any proof that any customers encounter that I'll say you tell you what

772
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:48,170
Go refactor it go ahead and add instrumentation

773
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,870
We're gonna keep the code the way it is

774
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:54,270
But if if you're proven to be right I want to be able to switch on a dime

775
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:56,550
So make sure that the code can switch

776
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:02,510
And you can go the other way on that too. So imagine I'm gonna this is purely I'm gonna make up a bad example

777
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,710
That's what I'm best at like say you

778
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:11,930
Somebody comes says hey look I found this bug where if someone searches for a house that has an odd numbered address

779
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:17,790
In a state where the abbreviation has an a is the last letter and it's over a million dollars

780
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:24,050
This weird thing happens to the page or something bad happens again totally made up not a great example

781
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:31,490
But ideally you could go you could you guys fixing it's gonna be a real pain like okay. What's the impact?

782
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:38,370
Ideally you want to be able to go to your data that you've clicked it from your site and go how how often does this happen?

783
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:43,170
How likely is this to happen and use data to help you make a decision on on the customer impact of that as well

784
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:50,170
Yes, and if you have that data, then you should be able to align it very readily to what will be the business impact

785
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:53,010
Because you also have if you have that data

786
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:58,290
Then you have the data of all the other type of bugs and now you have the ability to sort of work through

787
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:03,470
Customer impact in what's on this parade order or the 8020 rule the other thing

788
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:09,010
I also want to bring out around this process that really makes things super sweet at the end of the day is

789
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,050
It's really it makes

790
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:20,630
Bug-free code or bug ish free code is much easier to add features to

791
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,560
Much much much easier

792
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:27,380
Yeah, and that's what the business is really valuing

793
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:33,700
I've been preaching that to my team as we knock our our bug debt down is that you guys we forget ship once a week

794
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:39,820
it's much easier to give value to customers if we're doing that on top of a stable code base and they all down their heads and

795
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:46,770
Slowly too slow for me whittle down that debt. Okay. I think we've covered pretty much. Oh, we've everything

796
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:50,970
We've covered more you don't get to bring your little note sheets anymore

797
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,600
I'm still bringing them. All right

798
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,320
We do some questions. Yeah, please. Yes

799
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:12,020
Yes, so I like to think of that sort of like a two-axis. Oh, sorry

800
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,740
Wow, they're watching me closely

801
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:22,100
So how do you how do you differentiate between the bugs that are minor but a lot of people hit and they're and the kind of the

802
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:25,820
Really bad ones and I like to think of bugs on that that to access

803
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:32,260
Scale of like how many people does it hit and you can get that from data and then how bad is it houses severity?

804
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:36,340
So is it is the the crash that only happens at midnight?

805
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:40,460
on the February 29th when you're entering bite-eye characters versus the

806
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,740
Cursor that disappears for five seconds for every single user using your page

807
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:50,890
One is not very severe, but you really want to fix it it

808
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:57,480
In my current team. One of the things that we're working through is something that we're calling a pain index

809
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:03,100
We have every team. I think I've been on at Microsoft has built a pain index

810
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:07,260
Yeah, I'm gonna build one. All right, cuz it's never been done before no

811
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:13,380
But I get to do it data science II way not a god old-school test way no spreadsheets this time

812
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:17,520
Gonna use our if you think of risk

813
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,760
You're number one too well if you use if you the biggest thing about risk

814
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:33,760
Right is how frequently does this thing occur and then what's the severity?

815
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:40,400
So all sort of impact statements it can be measured by frequency and severity now

816
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,320
you guys got to transform or translate what severity means in terms of

817
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:49,120
An impact to the business or the impact of the customer now

818
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,520
I'll also tell you the more you can make those things synonymous

819
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:58,160
The more you are measuring the business in terms of impact to the customer

820
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,460
then the more

821
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,660
this

822
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,660
really flows I

823
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,420
had the

824
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:09,580
Talking about the glory is again when I left Bing I had the ability

825
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,420
to in essence

826
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:16,440
When I was doing some of the the data science stuff that I was doing in Bing

827
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,540
I had the essence the ability to tell individual dev teams

828
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:24,860
the consequence of this bug yesterday by dollar signs

829
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,080
and once we had that and

830
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:35,330
And the ability to sort of argue through that no that wasn't just a random number generator

831
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:37,540
a

832
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:42,500
Dev started engaging because no one in this room wants to make unhappy customers

833
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:48,380
But a lot of what we do is based off of an intuition a base off of belief

834
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:52,660
Well, this would really impact me if I was that guy in

835
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:58,500
In that situation on February 29th. This is how I feel empathy is high

836
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:03,380
the data allows you to get much more accurate and get to the

837
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:07,940
Truth and the once you get closer to that you can really iterate faster

838
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,540
So I believe the answer to the question was yes next question. Yes

839
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:24,430
so what about the this is actually a

840
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:29,910
Tailor onto that question, which is we do with the gray area bugs that are like this is wrong

841
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:36,550
But you know the devs to the hopefully just the dev team doesn't have the only choice on what gets fixed

842
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:40,480
Here it should be for my team

843
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,420
We have a design team that would make that call and my design team is

844
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:51,060
Massively anal so that bug would get fixed all the time. So ideally, you know for me it's

845
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:57,660
It sort of depends on the team culture and what you're building but the way I think he was addressing it is great

846
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:02,420
I think we all know how to solve any decision making in any sort of command and control structure

847
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,680
So you had a design team? Well, they're the winners. Yep

848
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,960
How do you do to have the customer be the winner?

849
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:21,570
So, how do we make the political decision to fix all the bugs design team files luckily the design team fixes in themselves

850
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:30,190
They own are they not only design but they actually know the magic of CSS. So yes

851
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:46,560
So the question is do we have any experience in property based testing using some tool? I haven't heard of right

852
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,620
I'm not familiar with property based testing and I'm pretty sure that we understand what you're talking about but not in the way your phrase there

853
01:08:55,460 --> 01:09:03,670
Oh, so test generation libraries not necessarily fuzzing but test generation like for for any sort of test data

854
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:12,630
Yeah, I use a tool a colleague of mine. I wrote when I worked in engineering excellence work with a guy named

855
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:16,770
The BJ Rellison who's one of the authors on the on the book I wrote on

856
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:19,530
One of the books you can buy no don't buy them

857
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,530
like

858
01:09:22,410 --> 01:09:26,370
That was that was like Google AdSense just popping in and put that ad there

859
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:31,570
He wrote this tool called babble, which I believe you can still find on his website

860
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:34,550
But it generates strings in any language

861
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:38,890
So I use like that and it has an API as well and I use that today

862
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:45,930
I also use a tool believe it or not that James Bach wrote called pro clip and pro clip is an awesome tool

863
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:51,390
For it'll generate any length of string you want and with this idea called counter strings

864
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:55,850
It's actually a pretty nice tool for figuring out what the limits of entries are etc. I've

865
01:09:56,370 --> 01:09:59,950
It's a pretty easy way to I showed dad like it's not that big of a deal

866
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:02,930
But you show somebody who hasn't done testing before and they go. Oh my god

867
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:08,400
If you put a long string in my field it breaks who would have thought of that

868
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,840
Yes

869
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,120
No

870
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:21,960
You definitely have to so the question was no sorry when you go 15 minutes to prod you probably can't build and test everything

871
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:23,240
So what do you do?

872
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:28,380
How are you guys doing it? I can explain go so I was asking you the question one of the things

873
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:33,900
So first off you you if you can leverage the system and it turns out in Bing

874
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:37,290
We are able to go massively parallel

875
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:42,500
And and a lot of the machines in Bing the the production machines have idle cycles

876
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:48,460
So we're able to capture those idle cycles and turn them into a parallel test bed

877
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:50,090
Okay

878
01:10:50,090 --> 01:10:55,530
Certain but the the other thing too is if you're gonna be live in 15 minutes

879
01:10:55,570 --> 01:11:00,610
Then you need to have the data that you can react to much sooner than that so that you can make a decision

880
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:02,690
It's going to go

881
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:05,800
So but you want to have an opportunity to make a decision to stop it

882
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:09,880
And it's not always going to go there are certain

883
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,280
Monitors in place that will stop any flow, but anything that's decision-making it's up to you

884
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,020
You have to think

885
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,820
differently around how your code works

886
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,640
The the the best example is any build

887
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,360
And you can do this whether it's a big service like Bing or it's even an on-prem product if you think about

888
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,040
the concept of an RTM build and

889
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:45,680
You you make a commitment you change the architecture in the process of your team and say we're gonna have a build that is always

890
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:49,040
RTMmable and one of the things that I actually tell people

891
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:53,940
Ship releaseable releasable. He's using weird words. Just ignore

892
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,850
It may not map to to this world, but hopefully you'll follow

893
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:06,510
So if you have a build that is it's up to the business team whoever owns the business team

894
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:10,420
Hey any build in this branch

895
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:17,410
You guys can decide the ship at any time. You don't even need to talk to engineering, okay

896
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:25,160
Then you have to then create a new incremental process such that you incrementally enhance that bill

897
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:31,980
Right now I encourage this process because you don't want if you can get to a point where engineering

898
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,300
Isn't part of the call of whether or not it ships

899
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:41,790
Then engineering then becomes a little extra diligent around making sure that they're safe because

900
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:49,600
This could be shipped by something that's outside of my control as you do that incremental then you do incremental testing

901
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,660
so you you compare your bits to

902
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:54,580
the RTM bits and

903
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:59,920
Then you can use co-coverage you can use standard tests to really pair down

904
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:08,320
What needs to be done and then if you then further enhance it with sort of an exposure rings with these monitors you really

905
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:15,120
Pair down the amount of proactive testing that you need to do to achieve the same degree of risk prevention

906
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,720
All right, let's do

907
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:29,900
That's a decision you can make so if you're making it

908
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:35,980
Yeah, so if you're making a claim that like what's different RTM and broad basically and you can you can make the same thing

909
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:42,540
RTM is for users like me who shipped a lot of products before the web existed

910
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,910
Yeah

911
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:48,110
RTM and

912
01:13:48,190 --> 01:13:50,870
We had to we had to ship our code to some

913
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:55,970
Factory and who knows where so that they can burn our code on discs. Okay

914
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:59,790
That was the version of shipping to prod back in the day

915
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:04,070
All right, their eyes tell me their butts are tired anybody had one last question

916
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,510
Yeah back here I've heard from you

917
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:12,990
So the question is if this is actually a good one to close on if agile is about adapting and we talked about people being

918
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,390
resistant to change

919
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:20,910
Don't those work against each other and the truth is is you're absolutely right, but people still are resistant to change

920
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:23,030
it is

921
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,350
people get set in their ways and anytime there's a

922
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:30,900
Sort of you want to do something differently there are people probably like you and I am brand to like yeah

923
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:34,580
Let's go first. Try this out and see what works. I really believe in trying things out

924
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,440
Do a little bit of a time see what fails learn from that try something else

925
01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:42,200
There's there are other people who are and we've worked with them

926
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,600
I'm not gonna point them out in the room

927
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:49,760
Evan told me who they were beforehand but some people who are like I'm fine the way I am

928
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,200
I don't need to change we don't need to do it differently

929
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:58,080
So you have those on both sides and then you have people in the middle who are kind of just kind of waiting to see

930
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,760
What happens? Yeah, whatever wherever you guys go. I'll go I'm going for the ride and

931
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:07,600
So you'll have 20% on one side 20% of the other and then everyone know what the numbers are

932
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:14,400
But yeah, it's you anytime you're making some sort of change even if it's about agile which is about being adaptive. There's

933
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,520
You still have a people problem is another Jerry Weinberg quote

934
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:23,400
I like says it's always a people problem and you always have to figure out how to

935
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:28,400
What the motivation gonna be to get people to change some people are very much driven by data

936
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,120
Some people are driven by you know more intrinsic things like simple just excited about

937
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:39,600
Big fan of the Dan pink work talk about change Dan pink says that people are give people are motivated by progress

938
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:43,840
So if you can show them with this change like oh, we're moving faster and cool things are happening

939
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,400
Then those naysayers are slowly slowly jump on board

940
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,080
You have to have a seed in which everyone agrees

941
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:56,000
Like if we are all deciding that hey, it is valuable to the business that we ship every hour and

942
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,600
And it's going to affect income growth something that the business values

943
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,960
then

944
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:07,320
Yeah, a lot of the adaptability can come into play but a lot of people

945
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,960
Honestly don't believe in adaptability, I don't know if that's going to be here

946
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:16,080
But they don't see it and they don't understand that value

947
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:18,800
in addition to that Alan has this

948
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:26,870
I'll let him decide if he introduces you to definition behind fragile teams, but you've all you've all

949
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:29,870
encountered those teams where hey

950
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:34,750
We're gonna be agile and then the person who's leading that agile transformation basically

951
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:42,140
They read the first chapter of the Schwab book and then decided oh they get the rest of it and then they deploy

952
01:16:43,060 --> 01:16:48,740
Part of the concept that they picked up and and the rest of the stuff that they messed up or haven't

953
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:51,020
fully absorbed

954
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:55,330
And then and then discover Oh agile is a bunch of crap. It doesn't work

955
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:58,450
It was primarily because what you did

956
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:04,060
Wasn't agile. So when I probably go deep into fragile, but fragile is when you

957
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:10,260
Just pick a few parts of agile and then try and go with them and they don't work for you

958
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:13,540
But I one thing I want to make sure I mentioned before we close is

959
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:17,300
Elizabeth Elizabeth Hendrickson. Thank you. Yeah, sorry Elizabeth

960
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:22,100
She has this quote which I'll get all horribly paraphrase about agile the litmus test for agile is

961
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:24,940
frequently delivering

962
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:28,060
Delivering frequent customer value at a sustainable pace

963
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:34,300
If you're doing that you're probably agile doesn't matter if you're to the book on something or far on the book

964
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,380
But if you're too busy, it's really easy to get stuck in the process

965
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:39,380
Like we've probably looped all the way around where we started

966
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:44,780
But frequently delivering software at a sustainable pace and that has doing that

967
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,020
May cause you to change

968
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:54,100
some of the things we talked about today like how lines are blurred between what Devin test were forever and how

969
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:00,540
Engineering processes work and who owns what how to gain those efficiencies to get that frequency that you need I

970
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:04,190
I am also

971
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:09,270
Don't encourage any more of the usage of the turn agile even though I've used it a lot here

972
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:14,510
I definitely prefer adaptable agile means is highly overloaded

973
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,510
It means multiple different things

974
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:18,180
I

975
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:21,140
May or may not those of you who are agile experts

976
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:25,040
You may may not agree with me in terms of let's say a specific debate

977
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:31,660
But hopefully would all would agree that adaptability is really what's critical really what's important and there's different

978
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:36,300
Techniques and tools to get there. Yeah, one thing I learned from Brent was on the spectrum

979
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:43,210
There's you know waterfall was a predictive model and then there was spiral and some forms of agile

980
01:18:43,210 --> 01:18:48,170
What you're kind of in that middle ground of their iterative models scrum is an example that so it go from

981
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:55,290
Predictive to iterative to adaptive. I think the the right way to make software especially web software in

982
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:59,520
Least for this decade might change ten years from now

983
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,200
But I doubt it is to make sure you're adaptable make sure you're always learning

984
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,760
From your customer always learning from your engineering practices, etc

985
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:12,770
Anything else? All right. No, I think we've closed out. Okay once again, I'm not Brent

986
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:16,370
I am. All right. Thanks everybody. All right. Bye guys
