1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:18,460
Hey, Brandt, put your phone down.

2
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,180
Gonna ride me up a 125.

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,420
Oh, God, no.

4
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,700
Oh, crap.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,700
I can't read it well enough.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,220
I'm gonna have to edit the whole intro because Brandt is now...

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,060
Post my face wanted, dead or alive.

8
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,700
Wow, this is bad.

9
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,780
This is really, really bad.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,900
If you have bad hearing, you can't tell your tone to.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,820
Hey, everybody, I'm Alan.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm Brandt.

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,580
And we're here for episode 55 of A-B testing.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,580
55.

15
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,300
Brandt's pretty happy about 55.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,390
So, anything exciting with you, Brandt?

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,350
That wasn't even like a leading setup question.

18
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,950
I'm just trying to see what it'll say.

19
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:09,140
No, I have a sad story about a personal failure.

20
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,300
Oh, the things I could say right now.

21
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,270
Is this a story for our listeners

22
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,270
or is this one you want me to rub your shoulders

23
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,390
while you lightly sob?

24
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,620
So, as you know, I went back to school

25
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,060
and I have two classes left.

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,860
One on graduate level research writing,

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,700
researching and writing,

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,860
and then I have my capstone project.

29
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,480
Okay.

30
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,720
Unfortunately, in the last six months,

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,720
I don't wanna mention it on the podcast,

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,520
but you're aware at home,

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,160
there's a bit of a family crisis.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,190
And that's taken a good bit of time.

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,110
So, I took three days off last week.

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,110
I had a big midterm proposal due last night

37
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,210
where I have to write up a research design proposal

38
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:07,390
for what I'll do in my capstone project.

39
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,940
I tried to catch up, read everything.

40
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,100
I wrote about 12 pages.

41
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,620
And when I sat back about four hours before it was all due,

42
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,180
I sat back and I read it with the eyes

43
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,660
like I do when my employees give me a proposal.

44
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,860
And I looked at it and I said, this is crap.

45
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,180
So, I withdrew from the class.

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,140
I gotta start all over again in September.

47
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,060
Summer.

48
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,900
Yep.

49
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,260
Now, were you also enrolled in the,

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,760
or these classes overlap?

51
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,560
Was that the purely the capstone class?

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,720
Or that the research class?

53
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,840
No, they don't know.

54
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,040
By design, you should take them sequentially.

55
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,600
Okay, I don't know if I've mentioned this

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
on the podcast before,

57
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,480
but I think I mentioned this in a blog post

58
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,840
several years ago, but,

59
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,200
and I mentioned it every time I go back

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,800
and visit my alumni, my university,

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,760
is the methods of research class I took,

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,080
probably the most valuable class ever took in my life.

63
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,360
Probably one of the ones that,

64
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,800
it's the class that taught me how to learn

65
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,720
how to figure stuff out.

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,080
Yeah, and that's actually what I concluded

67
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,560
when I looked at this.

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,350
I was busily focusing on producing the paper.

69
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,350
And I read about 20 different literature articles.

70
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:32,870
So, I learned a lot about the topic I'm researching,

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,040
but I realized when I sat back and analyzed it

72
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,380
that I hadn't learned about structured research sufficiently.

73
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
So, what I had produced was essentially

74
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,380
a stylized book report.

75
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,220
And I said, so you don't go back to school

76
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,180
in your soon to be late 40s

77
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,380
because you give a crap about the degree

78
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,100
or give a crap about the grade.

79
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,660
And I don't, and I'm very open and honest

80
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,160
with my professors on this.

81
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,220
I'm here, I do it to learn.

82
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,420
And so, when I realized that I hadn't really,

83
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,220
to my bar, learned the topic that I was supposed to

84
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,880
in this class on researching,

85
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,440
I had learned enough of it to know that

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,160
it's an interesting thing to learn.

87
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,700
There's a lot of black art that researchers go through

88
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,860
to find relevant articles.

89
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,980
And...

90
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,740
Indeed, so I was, I'm old, even older than Brent,

91
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,300
and I was in graduate school before really the internet.

92
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,220
I mean, internet existed, but my,

93
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,420
the only thing I had to research,

94
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,900
I could pay long distance to dial up a bulletin board.

95
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,180
There was no local bulletin boards

96
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,020
where I went to college when I was in grad school.

97
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,180
Where did you go?

98
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,540
I was in, I was at Central Washington in 1993, 1992?

99
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,620
And 1893 is when I got my master's.

100
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,700
Central Washington.

101
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,540
Yeah.

102
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,380
You went there?

103
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,200
Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,610
No, in Ellensburg.

105
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,690
Okay.

106
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,650
But what I learned there that I've transitioned

107
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,410
is things like, if you find a relevant article,

108
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,690
you look at what it cites,

109
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,410
and you figure out, and you start looking at

110
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,770
what other articles cite these same things,

111
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,730
and what article, if you go read all these articles

112
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,890
and see what they cite,

113
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,210
and really digging in those extra few levels

114
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,890
is where you find the nuggets

115
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,210
of really cool information in the insights,

116
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,530
which leads to Stephen Johnson's thinking,

117
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,290
gives you more ideas to put together

118
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,170
and merge together and come up with great ideas.

119
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:45,170
I have been thinking about Stephen Johnson a great deal

120
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,890
because I concluded exactly the same thing.

121
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,730
Yeah.

122
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,420
And there is another quote that,

123
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,660
any field of study that you want to master,

124
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:03,660
that if you just read an hour a day on that topic

125
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,490
in seven years, you would be a worldwide expert.

126
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,680
That's the quote.

127
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,520
Given what I just went through

128
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,240
in the last few days on that,

129
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,640
like I found lots of really great ideas

130
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,120
connecting the dots between entirely different topics.

131
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,960
My research was on near real-time analytics.

132
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,900
I wanted to target it for obvious reasons,

133
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,300
for the cloud market,

134
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,290
but there are a lot of other industries

135
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:47,210
that have that same near real-time analytics problem

136
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,610
and have similar problems.

137
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,020
What I found very attractive

138
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,940
is analyzing the healthcare industry.

139
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,560
So here at Microsoft,

140
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,360
when we talk about up and down times,

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,240
we refer to it as either the server health

142
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,960
or the VM health.

143
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,720
If you do that sort of mapping

144
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,240
while reading any of these healthcare articles,

145
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,760
you realize that, oh my God,

146
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,240
you could just search and replace this thing

147
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,480
and looking for the word patient,

148
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,280
put in the word VM,

149
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,060
making some certain mappings,

150
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,060
like the presence of a certain chemical

151
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,860
inside the bloodstream doesn't necessarily map well,

152
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,100
but heartbeats do.

153
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,540
Yeah.

154
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,060
We even call it a heartbeat sometimes.

155
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,380
We do.

156
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,260
So I read a book on, and I've totally forgotten the book.

157
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,620
I liked the book so much

158
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,860
that I kept on reading through the appendix.

159
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,800
I'm going somewhere with this, 15,

160
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,420
more than 15 years ago.

161
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,280
Anyway, one of the things that said at the end of the book

162
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,080
was, gosh, to the life of me,

163
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,240
I've thought about this book a hundred times.

164
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,880
I have no idea.

165
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,440
I think it was some sort of leadership book.

166
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,680
I don't know.

167
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,960
But it said, you should challenge yourself

168
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,200
to learn new things and subscribe to,

169
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,800
and some examples like, read blogs,

170
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,020
and blogs are fairly new back then,

171
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,760
but they go, subscribe to magazines.

172
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,840
And I subscribed for about 10 years

173
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,960
to this magazine called Science News.

174
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,960
And Science News was this little thin eight page,

175
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,560
maybe 12 page, little thing that came every week

176
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,880
and eventually came every other week

177
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,320
in a little thicker format, not much.

178
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,040
But it was just random,

179
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,400
it was random little publications from the world of science.

180
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,520
These aren't like IEEE type papers,

181
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,000
but little, everything from a half page blurb

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
to a two to three page article.

183
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,890
And some of it admittedly went over my head.

184
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
Everything I could understand,

185
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,360
I found fascinating and interesting,

186
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,720
and there were always some little parallels,

187
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,720
oh my gosh, this is just like something from leadership,

188
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,840
from software, from testing, from craftsmanship,

189
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,140
that I can map to my own world.

190
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,680
And one of those examples is pre-Steven Johnson,

191
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,280
how good ideas come from,

192
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,020
but just one of those ways I was sucking in,

193
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,360
I almost used the word alternate,

194
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
but alternate, the word alternate now means

195
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,200
something different in the age of Kellyanne Conway.

196
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,900
So, but these different,

197
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,260
these different ideas that I could,

198
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,200
just sort of merge into the things that I already knew,

199
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,800
I found very valuable and very fascinating.

200
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,240
Yeah, when you definitely go through the experience

201
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,020
and you're cognizant of this idea

202
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,500
that new ideas come from old ideas getting together,

203
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,730
several times just in the last few days,

204
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,690
I just said, oh, holy crap, it just happened.

205
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,850
Just happened to my head.

206
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,170
Literally 30 seconds ago.

207
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,010
It's not being cognizant, being,

208
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,690
there's an openness to this, an openness like,

209
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:11,570
I need to look at all this input coming in

210
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,370
and at some middle level be able to go,

211
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,990
are there new connections of ideas coming in

212
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,130
that I need to act on or think about more?

213
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,210
Oh, there's.

214
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,650
There's definitely a thread spinning

215
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,690
in both of us all the time.

216
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,890
One of our, and surely we're not the only people

217
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,250
who equate thinking to multi-threaded computing, right?

218
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,090
No.

219
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,730
But there's always one like semi-active thread

220
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,010
in the background, kind of looking at what's coming in

221
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,350
and looking for those connections.

222
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,350
So I chose, when you were trying to find this book title,

223
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:48,250
I chose perhaps unwisely to not interrupt you

224
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,690
and be snarky.

225
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,210
But my daughter told me.

226
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,770
Percy will call you out if you interrupt.

227
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,130
Go on.

228
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,040
Shout out to Percy.

229
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,420
I think last Friday was Dr. Seuss's birthday?

230
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,500
Yeah, I think I remember something about that.

231
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,580
What is your favorite Dr. Seuss book?

232
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,660
You know, it depends on the mood.

233
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,430
There's the canonical Green Eggs and Ham,

234
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:28,870
which I read to my kids a few thousand times.

235
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,030
Cat in the Hat.

236
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,310
I like Green Eggs and Ham better.

237
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,150
As do I.

238
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,510
There's some good stuff going on there.

239
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:40,090
There's a little bit of a cats in the cradle moment

240
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,930
if you read through like, oh, the places you'll go.

241
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,210
Really more of a graduation kind of book you give somebody.

242
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,810
One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.

243
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,130
Which is, I think, sort of a precursor or a prequel,

244
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,200
if you will, to Green Eggs and Ham.

245
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,360
Yeah, I can buy that.

246
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,280
So anyway, I would go, my favorites,

247
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,440
depending on mood.

248
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm now trying to resist the urge

249
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,400
to spin the rest of the podcast,

250
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,680
having an academic debate on which is the best Dr. Seuss.

251
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,200
The Dr. Seuss guide to agile software testing.

252
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,680
We were having a debate at our house.

253
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,760
It was split into two camps, Go Dog Go

254
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,510
and Green Eggs and Ham.

255
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,690
I took leadership on Green Eggs and Ham.

256
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,210
I represented that point of view.

257
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,090
For some reason, that Sam I Am line,

258
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,450
really, it rings true to my soul.

259
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,930
There's also the Grinch that sold Christmas.

260
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:43,770
Again, that's-

261
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,090
But because that's seasonal?

262
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,090
Right, exactly.

263
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,370
You can't have a seasonal be a favorite

264
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,050
because, do you pull that?

265
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,050
I think you can.

266
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,490
I don't know.

267
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,450
Well, I think you can,

268
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,290
but it's just gotta be fantastic.

269
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:02,290
Like Die Hard is now considered to be a holiday movie.

270
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,690
Right?

271
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,650
And I'm just like, okay.

272
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,490
Stretch.

273
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,130
Stretch.

274
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,050
All right, shall we do a podcast?

275
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,370
Oh, yeah.

276
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,210
Okay.

277
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,090
How about we start off with a word from our sponsor?

278
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,930
Okay.

279
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:22,290
Once again, the folks at TechWell

280
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:26,640
are sponsoring this episode of A-B testing

281
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,720
and they have some training coming up.

282
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,600
Training all the time through SQE.

283
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,000
They are so nice to sponsor us

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,570
that I'm going to talk about them just a little bit.

285
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,410
One would argue that's the definition of sponsor,

286
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,250
I suppose.

287
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,090
Perhaps.

288
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,930
Yeah.

289
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,900
Did you know that software testing isn't dead?

290
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,140
I did know that.

291
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,140
But it is definitely changing.

292
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,300
The State of Software Testing Professions Survey

293
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,620
published last year by TechWell,

294
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,060
participants overwhelmingly agreed.

295
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,260
Now again, I'd hate to interrupt my own PSA,

296
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,140
but if you're surveying a group of testers,

297
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,700
you have a little bit of confirmation bias

298
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,820
that we need to acknowledge.

299
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,660
Selection bias.

300
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,820
Selection bias, correct.

301
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,940
Selection bias.

302
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,460
Perhaps confirmation as well.

303
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,140
All right, I'm gonna start.

304
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,180
In the State of the Software Testing Professions Survey

305
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,940
published last year by TechWell,

306
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,140
participants overwhelmingly agreed

307
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,540
that as long as humans were responsible for software creation,

308
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,260
the role of the tester will be needed.

309
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
That makes sense.

310
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,300
But the same report-

311
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,580
Oh, wait, wait.

312
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,340
But the same report also found

313
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,460
that today's testing QA professionals

314
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,220
are being called upon to have even more technical skills.

315
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,260
So far, nothing I disagree with.

316
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,940
There's little doubt that the role is evolving.

317
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,900
Except for Brent's little interruption here,

318
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,020
I'll let him get on with.

319
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,450
No, no, no, go ahead.

320
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,490
So as part of TechWell's convergence

321
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,290
of expert resources for software professionals,

322
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,210
they provide premium software improvement training

323
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,250
and certification courses through SQE training for testers,

324
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,610
test engineers, QA specialists, and more.

325
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,090
Whatever you wanna call yourself

326
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,170
if you're involved in software quality and testing,

327
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,730
they got stuff that will help you out.

328
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,250
SQE, if training software testing training weeks,

329
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,330
offer up to 10 specialized courses

330
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,240
during one week in one location.

331
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,840
This includes four Agile testing courses,

332
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,040
including an improved

333
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,680
and expanded Agile test automation course,

334
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
new management planning and measurement courses

335
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,520
developed specifically for experienced test leads

336
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,000
and managers, as well as courses on security testing,

337
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
mobile testing, and more.

338
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,240
Upcoming testing training weeks are planned

339
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,040
for Boston, Massachusetts and Chicago, Illinois.

340
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,800
You've been to, I've never been to Chicago.

341
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,520
I have never been to either of those.

342
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,480
I've been to Boston, I love Boston.

343
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,150
I've been to Boston in Fallout 4.

344
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,870
I did spend a lot of time in Boston in Fallout 4 myself,

345
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,710
which was weird,

346
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,070
because I've actually walked some of those trails

347
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,030
in not screwed up land ever.

348
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,880
But that I'm all distracted on Fallout 4,

349
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,630
only one of the three plays games, I think.

350
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,310
Anyway, if you've made it this far in our ad,

351
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,130
A B test listeners can save $250

352
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,850
on any testing training week course

353
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,850
purchased by March 31st

354
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,450
with promo code 17ABW,

355
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,050
which I'll put in the show notes.

356
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,650
Again, that's 17ABW.

357
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,370
And you can sign up at TechWell,

358
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,570
and I will put the link in the show notes as well,

359
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,650
but $250 if you're near one of those places.

360
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,210
I know we have some East Coast listeners

361
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,410
probably get up to Boston for one of these courses.

362
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,310
They're very well done and recommended.

363
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,550
Star hasn't happened yet, right?

364
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,230
Star is always happening somewhere.

365
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,510
I mean, there's a West and an East and a Canada.

366
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,310
The next star is in May, April or May,

367
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,550
I haven't looked in Orlando.

368
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,930
There is a chance that you can still go register for Star.

369
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,350
Also save a bit of cash with the A B testing promo code.

370
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:07,310
Sure, A B testing.

371
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,790
That was from episode 52, I believe.

372
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,110
We had that sponsorship.

373
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,950
Yep.

374
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,710
You can go check that out as well.

375
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,270
But anyway, if you are in those areas,

376
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,350
want to get a week of training

377
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,590
for you or any of your employees,

378
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,110
you can use the code 17ABW

379
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:26,030
and get some money saved for you or your employer.

380
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,070
Thank you, TechWell.

381
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,630
Thank you, TechWell.

382
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:34,110
Now, as a somewhat completely, totally aside.

383
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,550
That's so rare that we do an aside

384
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:41,230
or any sort of thing off script in our well-prepared show.

385
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,260
So you mentioned that the confirmation bias,

386
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,900
selection bias, overwhelmingly,

387
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,960
as long as humans were involved,

388
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,360
testers will still be needed.

389
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,920
So what spawned up in my head

390
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,920
was a discussion I had at work the other day.

391
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,200
I was listening to the radio,

392
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,920
I think it was some NPR show.

393
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,260
And a guy mentioned something that hit me pretty hard

394
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,410
because I couldn't refute it.

395
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,960
And he said, our children,

396
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,880
so our grandchildren will never have a driver's license.

397
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,500
And I'm like, yeah, that's probably true.

398
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,340
But the way things are going,

399
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,740
the way trends are going,

400
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,740
there is a great deal of things that will be automated.

401
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,650
To that effect, I'm wondering, you know what?

402
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,790
That world where humans aren't needed for testing

403
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,940
may not be all that far away.

404
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,100
That reminds me, there's a lot of talk of,

405
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,940
I mean, as long as there have been testers,

406
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,340
there's been talk of automation taking away testers' jobs.

407
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,580
And it doesn't work that way.

408
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,860
But I think testing, you really need this

409
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,700
quality professional.

410
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,420
But this is a different kind of automation

411
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,300
than talking about.

412
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,100
Yeah, but I saw a discussion just last week on Twitter.

413
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,920
Oh, it's because Microsoft wrote,

414
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,180
there's some research guys, I didn't look at it.

415
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,280
So I'm sure there's flaws with it.

416
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,440
Some auto programming AI.

417
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,640
You describe what you wanted to program

418
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,420
and it programs it for you.

419
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,860
I didn't even look any farther than that.

420
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,400
Then there was a tangent discussion on automation for this

421
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,860
and self-testing software.

422
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,010
And it made me think.

423
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,050
And I haven't thought this through yet.

424
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:47,890
I should blog about it,

425
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,690
but I'm gonna talk about it right now instead.

426
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,530
Okay.

427
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,350
It's easier.

428
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,930
So we have talked before, Teal Shop,

429
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,200
about using logs for diagnostics.

430
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,400
The logs should tell you what went wrong with the program.

431
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,520
If you have really great logging and telemetry,

432
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,400
you can tell the failures in the program.

433
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,600
You're not gonna identify, just squash the stuff.

434
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,880
You're not gonna identify like user experience errors

435
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,080
and if the screen flashes pink

436
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,420
or maybe you could catch that.

437
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,200
But a lot of what's going on in the software,

438
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,080
you can tell what's going wrong via logs.

439
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,480
Now, we add either some self-execution

440
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,880
or some self-monkey test,

441
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,740
a diagnostic program that basically executes every,

442
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:30,240
calls everything in the model layer automatically.

443
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,100
The logs are generated

444
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,260
and you kind of have the edge of self-testing software.

445
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,140
Yeah.

446
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:41,540
And you throw in advances in AI techniques.

447
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,060
Right, you use AI.

448
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,620
You build an AI engine based on actual patterns

449
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,460
of customer data.

450
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,760
And it's always modifying the way it self-tests itself.

451
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,680
That's a heck of a regression suite.

452
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,520
Yeah.

453
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,560
I, actually that is relevant to a blog you did recently.

454
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:04,300
I was trying to download a data science tool yesterday.

455
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,620
And what this tool professes is that you pointed at any data

456
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,780
and it will find the interesting patterns in the data

457
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:24,240
and it will find the interesting family of functions

458
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,400
as well as their extrapolation for those patterns.

459
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,330
And I could see how a tool could do that

460
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,550
because that non-trivially that's a portion of my day.

461
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,990
You do it enough times just like everything else,

462
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,310
you realize this crap can be automated.

463
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,150
Yeah.

464
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:50,150
So I think testers or anyone who is afraid of automation

465
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:54,150
is really, really, really, really,

466
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,540
really missing the point.

467
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,940
I mean, these things excite me.

468
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,900
I'm not afraid about them taking away my job

469
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,500
because someone still needs to figure out how they work,

470
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
how to take advantage of them,

471
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,120
how to make sure the patterns are correct.

472
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,500
There's all kinds of other knowledge work

473
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,100
that excites me to do.

474
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,900
But I think that, I think embracing this automation

475
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,100
and looking at what it can do for us

476
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,380
and looking for ways to extend it and get more out of it

477
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,340
and let computers do more of the hard work for us

478
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,540
is something, it shouldn't be scary to anyone.

479
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,060
I think anyone who's scared of it

480
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,500
has other job security issues they need to address.

481
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,430
So knowledge work, I don't know if there's another realm,

482
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,510
but knowledge work is not something

483
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:42,510
that has successfully been well automated in the past.

484
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:48,190
But there is a trend in the last 10 years

485
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:52,070
on knowledge management and knowledge automation.

486
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,520
There's a lot of techniques, statistical machine learning,

487
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,100
process-oriented techniques around capturing

488
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,820
the knowledge of individuals.

489
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,380
And once, like I've known, I don't remember the name of it,

490
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,740
but Google has been, has a lot of data

491
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,540
and they've been doing inference engines

492
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,500
on top of that data.

493
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,340
And about 10 years ago, they started doing work

494
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,050
on turning their inference engines

495
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:35,010
on the output of the inference engines,

496
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:41,640
essentially finding new patterns in the data.

497
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,120
There was a very famous example of this

498
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,520
with the target and the father and the,

499
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,090
where target, right?

500
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,250
Look it up listeners.

501
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,570
Yep.

502
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:59,700
Where target's AI learned that this father's daughter

503
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,540
was pregnant before the father did, right?

504
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,870
Yeah, it's a new world.

505
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,030
So let me give you another example.

506
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,790
There was three or four years ago,

507
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,910
could have been longer, I'm old, I forget,

508
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,910
but I was driving to work and Amazon was just coming out

509
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,830
with their automated item stickers

510
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,270
for a lot of their shipping.

511
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,470
This is taking away jobs.

512
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,230
This is automation taking away jobs from people.

513
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,590
I thought, wow, this argument sounds familiar.

514
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,590
So here was automation taking away boring work from people

515
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,310
and creating some interesting knowledge work

516
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,310
because now you have automation to go pick these things,

517
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,550
but there's still a lot of analysis on how do I optimize

518
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,790
how things are laid out in the warehouse

519
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,870
to make life easier for these pickers?

520
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,470
How do I make sure that, you know,

521
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,350
could I tweak things to make sure that they're picking

522
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:55,350
the right size boxes and all this stuff?

523
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,630
So there's plenty of work to do there.

524
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,950
What the automation has done,

525
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,050
it takes away some of the boring part,

526
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,250
which is similar to what we've done in test automation.

527
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,970
We haven't automated away our fun exploratory.

528
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,330
Let me really dig in and figure what's going on here

529
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:15,170
type work.

530
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,210
We've automated away the boring stuff.

531
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,570
Well, and again, with current trends,

532
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,050
particularly with the onset of Agile,

533
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,010
here I'm thinking about combined engineering.

534
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,010
Like non-trivially, we've automated away the role

535
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:37,330
because we found better processes,

536
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,090
better approaches, the world change.

537
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,210
Like there is an approach you can now take

538
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,610
in the services world that you really couldn't take

539
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:50,450
in the on-prem product world, right?

540
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:57,630
And so, in my view, the need for this dedicated role

541
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,670
has definitely lessened, right?

542
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:05,550
Whether or not testing is dead is somewhat

543
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,660
a irrelevant question, but it's...

544
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,180
It's definitely evolving.

545
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,380
If you don't want it to evolve,

546
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,540
don't want it to evolve,

547
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,960
or don't feel like it's evolving,

548
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,640
you better buckle up and get along for the ride anyway,

549
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
because it's changing.

550
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,820
Oh yeah, I mean, well, if you're a listener of this show

551
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,740
and you feel that way, like how did that happen?

552
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,180
Again, we have selection bias,

553
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,500
preaching to the choir, all that stuff.

554
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,210
Hey, you know what we haven't learned in a while?

555
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,570
Lots of things.

556
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,330
Well, there's one thing in particular I'm thinking of.

557
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,170
Okay.

558
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:42,990
You know what it is?

559
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,830
What is it?

560
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:46,290
Leading close.

561
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,910
Mail back!

562
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,750
I was concerned.

563
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:54,710
I'm like, you're not gonna kiss me on air again, are you?

564
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,400
Not again.

565
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,090
That one time was enough.

566
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,420
Yeah, well, all right.

567
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,220
So, we have a mail back.

568
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,060
We do.

569
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:08,900
Exciting.

570
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,740
Exciting.

571
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,120
From one of the three.slack.com, our Slack team.

572
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,430
Noriam, Kanoriam.

573
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,810
Noriam asks.

574
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:21,670
Felipe.

575
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:22,510
Felipe.

576
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,430
Question for Brent.

577
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,750
Or for BS Data Science, which hasn't started up yet,

578
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:28,310
but question for Brent.

579
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,510
Can you share any experience you've had

580
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,350
with overexperimenting instead of going

581
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,450
with your best foot forward following gut instinct

582
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,170
or extrapolating from a small

583
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:41,350
or a non-stat significant population?

584
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,230
In other words, not pushing a change

585
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,430
that will make the product better

586
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,430
because you need to provide evidence

587
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,390
of the benefits of the change,

588
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:52,180
even if it takes weeks to produce such evidence.

589
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,900
Yes, I can.

590
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,740
All right.

591
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,580
All right.

592
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,820
A successful mail bag question.

593
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,260
It'd be great.

594
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,140
We should do a mail bag and go, nope, no idea.

595
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,580
All right, thanks everybody.

596
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,640
All right, so that's the show.

597
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:14,410
Wow, that was a long question with lots of really long words.

598
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,850
It's like four lines.

599
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,610
But it has words like extrapolating, which is good.

600
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,850
Yeah, extrapolating is a great word.

601
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:22,970
Okay, so let's take it.

602
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,630
Actually, that word wasn't there,

603
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,470
but I just wanna throw that in there.

604
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,760
Oh.

605
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,760
So his question, what it reminds me of is

606
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:39,250
the old school, hey, we're about to ship.

607
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,490
Test and dev are in a triage room.

608
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,900
We're all arguing around the bug and no one has any data.

609
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:51,010
Now he brings up overexperimentation.

610
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:54,350
Not really certain what that concept is,

611
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,670
but it kind of reminds me of sort of

612
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,630
the intuitionist battles that occurred

613
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,250
for me back in those days.

614
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,740
And a bit of are we overthinking

615
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,980
or overanalyzing the problem?

616
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,780
And I would say, I kind of take a different approach

617
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,860
when I think about it in terms of a test context

618
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,020
than I did back in those days.

619
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,380
Back in those days, it was,

620
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,920
so let's say we found a bug.

621
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,620
Really what we're trying to judge

622
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,340
is what is the customer impact.

623
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,100
Now I would say back in those days,

624
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,000
those were important discussions

625
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
because again, it was an on-prem product world

626
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,060
and it was a high time cost if we made the wrong judgment.

627
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,230
But so what we did is we judged it

628
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,270
by perceived customer impact.

629
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,390
Is it gonna be a 2% case

630
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,790
or is this gonna impact the 50% case?

631
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,710
Knowing what I know now,

632
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:15,630
if this was really important,

633
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:20,030
then we would have handed it off to usability

634
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:24,510
and said, hey, we'll do a fake A-B test.

635
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:26,790
We're gonna give you two versions of the test.

636
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,510
One with this, one without.

637
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,720
And there'd just be MVP skins of the product

638
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,560
so that it's really cheap to produce.

639
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,370
And then we just let the usability training

640
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,390
come to the opinion.

641
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,130
The one problem though that he talks about,

642
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,450
the way I'm remembering it was essentially,

643
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,550
hey, we're having a big debate.

644
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,470
Being blocked by lack of evidence

645
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:06,870
and the time it's going to take to produce the evidence

646
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:11,870
is outside of our window in which we need to close down.

647
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:17,970
For me, it comes down to how do you address two questions.

648
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,510
So second half was, for example,

649
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,550
not pushing a change that will make the product better

650
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,350
because you need to provide evidence

651
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,270
of the benefits of the change,

652
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,550
even if it takes weeks to produce such evidence.

653
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:34,030
Okay, so not pushing a change

654
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,450
that will make the product better.

655
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,300
Let's start with that one.

656
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,240
How do you know?

657
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,090
And the question is, do you use gut for that

658
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,530
or do you wait for the data?

659
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,490
No, no, but better.

660
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:53,610
As proactively to say that listeners of this podcast

661
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,050
know that the producers of the A-B testing podcast

662
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,570
firmly state product better is defined by the customer.

663
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,790
So pushing a change that will make the product better

664
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,990
under that context implies that you have some data

665
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:24,610
or you're just taking a sort of like a

666
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,730
an ivory tower point of view intuitionist opinion.

667
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,960
Now, so I guess the question comes down to

668
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,520
what's the risk of being right?

669
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,240
What's the risk of being wrong?

670
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,760
And what's the ROI in those two conditions?

671
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:52,590
If given that there's a timeline,

672
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:55,830
what I would say is if the ROI

673
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,730
of whatever's under discussion is potentially high enough

674
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,730
that there is reason to believe that this is a big deal,

675
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:12,780
then what you do is you spend your time finding evidence.

676
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,970
You don't do it as a pure, you don't go down

677
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,130
and you don't try to do a full three month

678
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,590
data science project on this.

679
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:30,990
You take the time that you have available

680
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,670
and you reduce as much uncertainty

681
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:36,910
on this question as you can.

682
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,070
So let me.

683
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,830
If this is a brand new product

684
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,650
that the world doesn't know about,

685
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:44,910
then you're gonna have to make a gut call.

686
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,890
And your customers are people that you can't get

687
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,870
in contact with or you don't have any yet.

688
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,710
It's tough.

689
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,230
But this kind of goes back to,

690
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,490
let me know if this makes sense to you.

691
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,630
When Kemp Beck's first talking about Agile,

692
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:59,070
he was implementing software for the people

693
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,270
that were sitting upstairs.

694
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:03,110
He could actually involve the customers daily

695
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,350
and get them involved and go upstairs

696
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,710
and ask them about things.

697
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,710
That's data and evidence that can help you

698
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,790
make decisions on what's better.

699
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,590
Where data science and telemetry

700
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,790
and where data has come in is when those customers

701
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,630
aren't in the same building as us

702
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,590
or the same state, same time zone.

703
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,590
So we collect that data remotely and we analyze it.

704
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,070
So somewhere in between is if,

705
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:27,230
the exception is when you don't have any customers yet

706
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,510
or it's a secret project, hasn't been announced yet,

707
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,510
but otherwise you can contact,

708
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,390
maybe you have some early adopter customers.

709
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,990
This is easy in Xbox, very easy at Unity also.

710
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,390
People want to get on the early,

711
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,740
people want to be early adopters.

712
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:43,140
Depending on the product,

713
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,340
I think it's easy in all cases.

714
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,640
Right, because if someone's a user of your product,

715
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,460
you're gonna have some faction of those,

716
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:51,140
some percentage of those who are,

717
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,300
yeah, you want me to try something new?

718
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,340
Let me know how to get some feedback.

719
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,060
I'll do that, sure, no problem, I love you.

720
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Yeah, early adopters, they actually,

721
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,380
so there was a study on this,

722
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,340
and early adopters actually get something out of it.

723
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,740
They're willing to take the risk

724
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,630
that the product is a little bit crappy

725
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,630
to gain the advantage of number one,

726
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,910
influencing the direction of the product,

727
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,310
as well as already be ramped up on the product

728
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,310
when it hits the shelves.

729
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:24,110
But they don't even have to be an early adopter.

730
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,390
One of the things I've talked about doing,

731
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,550
I've never done this before,

732
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,990
is setting up some sort of regular,

733
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,310
just call between, like with me,

734
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,870
a support person, and some or a few people

735
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:41,430
at some company, and talk about just ideas.

736
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,950
And then go, what would you think if we did this?

737
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:43,790
Would that be worse?

738
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:45,670
They go, well, it may, I don't know,

739
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,310
it'd be indifferent, or, oh my god,

740
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,190
that'd be awesome, or don't do that, oh my god.

741
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,800
You don't even have to implement the crummy feature,

742
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,760
or the feature that you don't have to even

743
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,860
implement the A-B test.

744
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,780
You can just, if you have a good rapport there,

745
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,900
you can just ask them.

746
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,740
And again, you have a little bit of sample size

747
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,620
issue with one person, but you get a half a dozen

748
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,660
of these going on, you could get that data

749
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,140
in other ways than waiting for the long pull

750
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,060
of data to come in.

751
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,020
As long as you realize that if you're making

752
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,100
decisions off of intuition, then there's a risk

753
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:22,700
that you're making a decision off of bias.

754
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,540
If you stay objective and realize that what you're

755
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:32,540
trying to do is remove the maximum amount of uncertainty

756
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,340
in the time that you have available,

757
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,660
then you go after that.

758
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,100
There's multiple different approaches.

759
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,220
So, as occurred to me, I'm speaking with my

760
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,940
data science hat on, but I think the Agile hat

761
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,740
is the one that makes the most sense here.

762
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,460
It depends on the product, but on my team.

763
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,770
My team fixes absolutely zero bugs for purely

764
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:08,000
future-proofing points of view.

765
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,920
Like, if one of my reports found a bug

766
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,240
and another one of my reports issues

767
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,160
and it's code that we've shipped to production,

768
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,920
or even if it's not, if, hey, you know what,

769
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,840
one of the things that we could do is we could

770
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,480
really solidify this widget and harden against

771
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,480
this particular concern if you make this three-day change.

772
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,920
I'm 100% consistent on, no, we're not doing that.

773
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,880
We don't spend, on my particular team,

774
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,760
I'm already overloaded in my backlog on things

775
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,560
to produce where there is customer demand.

776
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,200
I simply guide my team on these ones.

777
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
Like, great, I love the passion, and yeah,

778
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,240
I can definitely see a place where you might be right.

779
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:09,680
So, what I want you to do is the bare minimum

780
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,240
is on where this code is.

781
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,080
I want it abstracted such that if we,

782
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,470
once we learn that you're right or wrong,

783
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,230
I want us to be able to very quickly shift

784
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,800
to the correct position.

785
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,830
In other words, so in Agile, there is this practice

786
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,470
that's known as, or principle, known as defer commitment.

787
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:39,270
And what that means is you stall making decisions

788
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,140
to the very last responsible moment.

789
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:45,780
You don't go all in on, oh, we had to do it this way

790
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:48,700
because I have been in this industry for 10 years,

791
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,020
and I know everything about this.

792
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,700
Any time someone plays the experience card,

793
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:54,980
my eyes roll back to my head.

794
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,820
Yes.

795
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,350
So, you wanna say something?

796
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:00,190
I do, I do.

797
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,430
Earlier, I just had a little insight,

798
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,430
which may be all full of crap.

799
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:10,110
Earlier you talked about perceived impact of an issue.

800
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,870
And it made me think of something we use at Unity,

801
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,070
something I've used at Microsoft for, called user pain.

802
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,150
Figure out a combination of how bad is it,

803
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,790
how many people does it affect, et cetera.

804
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,510
You can use the same principle, maybe it's an inverse,

805
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,750
but the same principle, as a backlog grooming technique.

806
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,990
If I do this item, how many customers does it make happy,

807
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,790
and how happy do they get?

808
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,670
Well, this is why I brought up ROI.

809
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,470
So, you can look at like, well, it makes,

810
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,710
well, nobody, but it may make them happier later.

811
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,390
Okay, right down at the bottom.

812
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,430
Or, you know what I mean?

813
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,790
You can look at it the other way, like, it forces you

814
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,390
to think about customer value and business value

815
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,830
as a backlog grooming technique.

816
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,990
So, you just look at an item,

817
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,310
it's not making anybody happier,

818
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,430
or it's only making one person happier right now.

819
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,430
Okay, something bound to be more important

820
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,510
to work on right now.

821
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:05,190
Yeah, back in the day, I spent a non-trivial of my time

822
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,180
blocking chips.

823
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,150
No, this is not ready.

824
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,550
Producing a bunch of data, this is not ready.

825
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,710
We cannot ship this against the scorecard.

826
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,770
Today, I'm 180 degree,

827
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,250
no, this thing has to ship.

828
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,050
Because we can't, in my view, we can't evaluate properly

829
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:33,770
the quality of the product, the usefulness of the product,

830
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:35,370
if this doesn't go out.

831
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,970
I had this on Teams, and I worked on Teams.

832
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,770
I had that argument with our VP,

833
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,730
and my manager all the time, I said,

834
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,810
we gotta ship this from people, oh, it's not ready yet.

835
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:50,650
Said, we're making stuff up, so we don't have an MVP.

836
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,330
I said, are you kidding, we're self-hosting

837
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:54,530
on this thing for the last four months?

838
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:56,090
Said, well, it needs to have more features.

839
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,130
Said, no, we need to get feedback from people.

840
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,970
Which is opposite, like, here I am,

841
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,530
the test quality guy going, no, ship it, ship it, ship it.

842
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,690
Well, yeah, no, it's absolutely, to me,

843
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,890
it's nonsensical.

844
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:14,680
It's going back to the backlog.

845
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,100
Like, the way I tell my team I want them to operate,

846
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,940
number one, or at least this is how I'm going to operate,

847
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,460
number one, I am concerned about business value first.

848
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:31,890
Okay, not realized business value.

849
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,050
This means providing business value,

850
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,130
not because I said so, or the perception of business value,

851
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,130
but having an objective point of view.

852
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,810
And I don't care what KPI we measure it by,

853
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:47,230
as long as it's measured objectively.

854
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,400
Second, I'm concerned about calendar time.

855
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,520
Calendar time, once we've lost it,

856
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,040
there's no getting it back.

857
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,100
There's no way of fixing the calendar time problem.

858
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,540
And then third, engineering time.

859
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,020
Those are limited resources.

860
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,020
Yeah, I have some levers I can pull.

861
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,940
I can, as an old manager of mine used to say,

862
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:15,940
I can order burritos and influence people working late.

863
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:19,620
I could try to hire vendors.

864
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,340
I could try to articulate a need

865
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,580
for additional head count on my team.

866
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,940
There's some levers I can pull on that one.

867
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,300
But at the end of the day,

868
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,820
even with maximum efficiency,

869
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,020
the amount of productivity on my team

870
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,780
has a top, has a limit,

871
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:45,120
which is underneath what's being asked of me to deliver.

872
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,560
So we need a mechanism by which we tie

873
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,930
my team's capacity and produce the maximum

874
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:55,530
amount of business value.

875
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:58,850
So this ROI discussion around bugs,

876
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,530
which I'm not certain if that's really

877
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:02,610
what Felipe was talking about,

878
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,750
but that's just what it reminded me of,

879
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:11,680
is kind of important,

880
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,360
and it's important to try to articulate it

881
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,440
from a non-intuition point of view.

882
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,880
You don't have to overanalyze, right?

883
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,080
And matter of fact, you don't have the opportunity

884
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,200
to overanalyze, because if you agree with what I just said,

885
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,200
calendar time and shipping

886
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,200
are really important considerations.

887
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:39,190
What I would focus on is, again, high order bit,

888
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,230
what's the number one, the cheapest way

889
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:49,690
if you were to assign this to somebody

890
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,650
and only said, look, I'm only giving you

891
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:54,960
four hours to do this research,

892
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,520
but we're gonna spend a half hour brainstorming

893
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,320
on how we could spend that four hours

894
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,240
to maximize the reduction of uncertainty.

895
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,300
Then I would focus my attention,

896
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,240
how do we prove if we right or wrong

897
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,810
once this thing goes out in the field,

898
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:16,840
and how can we, if our decision we're making today is wrong,

899
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,060
how can we make sure that the product

900
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:25,510
will allow us to switch in near real time?

901
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,990
Look up, flighting.

902
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:32,690
Yeah, if you have to go by gut,

903
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,520
have a way to reverse that decision if you're wrong.

904
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,520
Right, and quickly.

905
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,280
And if you have to go by gut

906
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,580
and you can't reverse that decision if you're wrong,

907
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,260
I would argue that you've got problems in your process

908
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,920
that you need to solve before trying to solve this one.

909
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,800
Yep, agree completely.

910
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,640
Anything else, Brent?

911
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,460
Nope.

912
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,240
All right, this has been episode 55.

913
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,180
55.

914
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,320
55, A-B testing.

915
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,160
I'm Alan.

916
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:01,980
I'm Brent.

917
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,820
See you next time.
