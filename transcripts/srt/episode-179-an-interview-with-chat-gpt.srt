1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
However, it is important to note that the principles do not suggest that testers are not necessary

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,040
at all. Rather that expanding the team's abilities and know how may reduce the need

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,760
for dedicated specialists, which is spot fricking on.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,240
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,280
will be here to guide you through topics on testing.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,680
Brent's in a sample different these times.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
Not because Brent is going through any sort of life changing event.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,400
Just using his earbuds instead of his normal headset.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,360
There should be good news, far less breathing for me to edit out.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,760
Although I am getting really good at seeing the breathing in the audio formats.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,240
So that's good, but it doesn't sound as good.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,760
I'll see what I can tweak out.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,160
But welcome to the AB testing podcast, Brent.

14
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,960
Thank you. I've been here quite a while.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,560
Wait, you're saying that you now know what my breathing looks like?

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,000
I can recognize your breathing in its audio stream format, yes.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:04,880
Fun.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,560
I just, I don't even listen to it to make sure it's breathing before I delete it.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,160
I just, I just delete it.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,280
Hey, since we, since, uh, this is the AB testing podcast,

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,440
I have, and I know you like using Dolly, right?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,240
Yep. I use Dolly every week. If you read, uh, shameless plug, angry weasel.substack.com.

23
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,360
I've been doing a weekly post for the last several months

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,840
and, uh, every week it is decorated with a picture generated by Dolly.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,840
I am sorry for the artists who I'm putting out of business by using

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,400
AI to generate my cover art for my massively, not massively read.

27
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,080
And this podcast has three listeners.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,760
My blog has two readers.

29
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,200
And so they get a free picture.

30
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
I'll, I'll make up for it in a future life.

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
Anyway, yes. I'm familiar with Dolly.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,000
So my, my, my daughter is quite an artist and they,

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,320
she expressed a game with that her, her friends had made up.

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,520
And it was a game of what does your artwork taste like?

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,670
Okay.

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,510
Right. It's in the art world.

38
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,750
I did some other inspiring emotions.

39
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,350
And so doing that literally went to your artwork.

40
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:25,230
Like if you looked at the art and you like, okay, can you imagine what that might taste like?

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,390
And then I responded, well, I knew what my artwork tastes like.

42
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,390
And she's like, what I said, aluminum foil.

43
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,030
She's never chewed aluminum foil.

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,310
So she doesn't, hasn't yet learned the phenomenon around

45
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,030
electrical conductivity and why it feels weird.

46
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,750
But I spent a good hour trying to get Dolly to,

47
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,990
to come up with its own expression of what,

48
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,470
what a chewing aluminum foil might be in terms of an abstract art.

49
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,740
And it just, how would you do it?

50
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,180
What would be your prompt?

51
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,700
I don't think it can.

52
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,780
And anytime, one thing for us to remember, we're going to talk about this in a bit.

53
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,180
I have a potentially lengthy chat GPT segment to go over today.

54
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,140
As I once again, design the agenda,

55
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,460
you have to keep in mind the data it was trained on.

56
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:27,090
And it was trained on just a bunch of pictures with some metadata around them.

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,450
So it gets an idea of what things are across hundreds of thousands, if not millions of

58
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,090
different pieces of art and photos, et cetera.

59
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,810
I'm going to guess millions and millions actually, now that I say it out loud.

60
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,250
So I don't know what prompt I'd give it.

61
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,850
I would, it wouldn't know the aluminum.

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:52,960
So I would show, show me a picture of a man chewing with small sparks coming out of his mouth.

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,640
No, I don't want an image of it.

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
You want to know what Dolly thinks it's art tastes like?

65
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,000
No, I want it to create an abstract.

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,760
So imagine an abstract painting with the title, chewing aluminum.

67
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,960
This is where Dolly is going to struggle because while it knows what abstract is,

68
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,990
but unless it's going to be trained on the metadata around that abstraction.

69
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,870
So if the abstract piece of art is called, if it's a white painting of two polar bears

70
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,470
fighting in a snowstorm, it's not really going to get it.

71
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,150
It it's very, as you know, generative AI is very, very logical.

72
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:33,950
Yes.

73
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,430
And you would have to not describe the aluminum.

74
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,470
So one thing I learned in studying and what you were getting at earlier and

75
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:47,310
what does your art taste like is art is the reaction to the medium that was created by the artist.

76
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,110
I'm very adamant about this and I fight with my daughter about it sometimes too.

77
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,390
So so what is your art tastes like is a totally reasonable question for how

78
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,150
what does the art mean?

79
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,910
What does your art mean to you?

80
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:08,110
So if I'm going to prompt Dolly, there's no way I all I can do is prompt it for my reaction

81
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,590
because I have to tell Dolly to generate something that is a representation of my interpretation.

82
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,950
If I want to sort of reverse engineering art.

83
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:23,790
So if I want my reaction, if I've already stated at the end, I'm working backward,

84
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,710
it's kind of like TDD for art.

85
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,150
My reaction is I want to feel like I'm chewing on aluminum.

86
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,420
I have to give it a prompt.

87
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,660
I have to think like what kind of art would make me feel that way.

88
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,420
And you know that because you said it's your art.

89
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,780
You could describe your art.

90
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,740
But what's interesting in the general sense is I could decide my art tastes like sour lemon

91
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,900
or no, I shouldn't say my art.

92
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,940
I would I could start with this art that I haven't yet thought of tastes like sour lemon.

93
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,220
And then I'd have to reverse engineer and go backward and think

94
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:09,020
what medium, what sort of impression would have to be made on me for me to think of sour lemon.

95
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,180
And then I would want to give Dolly some input to create that.

96
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:23,260
So I would say, give me an abstract piece of art using lots of yellow and using lots of yellow

97
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,420
and converging patterns.

98
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,950
And then it would give that to me.

99
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:34,430
And I could see if it had the if I had the reaction that it really is TDD.

100
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,630
We're doing it backward.

101
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,070
I could see if I had the reaction.

102
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,710
I went out for it.

103
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:38,590
They know it's not quite it.

104
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,150
I could tweak it.

105
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,110
I could try something else.

106
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,870
But okay, that's the way I would approach that.

107
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,230
Okay.

108
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,030
Yep.

109
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,670
There's a bunch of things like I think I don't know if I've ever shared this with you

110
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,870
or on the podcast.

111
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:59,630
So back in the day, are you familiar with the bird known as the American kestrel?

112
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,670
I am not.

113
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,390
Okay.

114
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,790
But you are aware of birds.

115
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,030
Yes.

116
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:04,990
No.

117
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,190
Well, maybe.

118
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:21,180
So back in the day when I was not yet 18, I was a hacker and I went by the name, the kestrel.

119
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,900
So if you were to go home and look up my gamer tag, you'll see kestrel was dominant.

120
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,180
I do know that is your gamer tag.

121
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,220
Yeah.

122
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,340
I mean, it's other things.

123
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,060
But kestrel is a big part of it.

124
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,780
I also am a big fan of steampunk and I've been trying to get Dolly to

125
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,460
create an image of a kestrel and dress it up in some some rad ass steampunk gear.

126
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:58,140
Yeah, it incorporates the elements correctly, but it incorporates the elements,

127
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,020
but never the way I want it.

128
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:09,580
Yeah, I think what I was going to say is at some point you need to just commission an artist to do

129
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:09,980
the thing.

130
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,100
I think Dolly, one of the reasons I think Dolly does not put artists out of work is because

131
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,540
it gets, I mean, you get what you pay for, right?

132
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,580
Right.

133
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,540
It's not going to get you what you want there.

134
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,900
It's not going to get exact.

135
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,420
One of the listeners posted on LinkedIn this week saying, hey, I tried to get Dolly.

136
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,660
I tried for 20 minutes to get Dolly to put words into this picture and it wouldn't do it.

137
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,900
And of course, the answer is Dolly wasn't trained on words.

138
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,860
He doesn't know what they are.

139
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,940
It has no concept of words.

140
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,060
That's not true.

141
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,300
It makes words.

142
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:48,380
It knows words contain letters.

143
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,020
That's right.

144
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,260
Right.

145
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,820
It has an abstract knowledge of words.

146
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,780
Yeah.

147
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,620
If you want something specific, go commission an artist.

148
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,420
Feed an artist.

149
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,060
They're great.

150
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,140
If you're a listener of the podcast, we commissioned the art for the AB testing,

151
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,900
the orange little box and the one of the three logo, all that stuff we paid for.

152
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,140
And also what I was going to show you is if you go to angryweasel.com,

153
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,380
you see the weasel logo I've had there for 10 years.

154
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,060
Same artist did that for me.

155
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,380
And I just made, you know, I don't, I have a couple unity hoodies.

156
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,380
I probably shouldn't wear my unity hoodies, air quote, to work to my office.

157
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,380
So I now have an angry weasel hoodie with a big angry weasel logo on the back and right over the heart.

158
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,700
Cool.

159
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,380
So, uh, yeah, it's a novelty thing.

160
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,780
And then the other day at the gym, I'm walking out and some like 20, 20 something year old

161
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,100
tapped me on the shoulder rather vigorously.

162
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,340
I have a headphones and he goes, cool hoodie, man.

163
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,100
And if I was quick, I should have handed him a card and said,

164
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,180
here's where you go buy them in my shop.

165
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,460
I don't have a shop.

166
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:53,300
I yeah, I'm just not that together, but it'd be cool to start seeing people.

167
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,540
Yeah.

168
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,740
No angry weasel hoodies, angry weasel.

169
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:57,700
Yeah.

170
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,100
You're missing out on the hipster crowd.

171
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,580
Yeah.

172
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,700
I should.

173
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,060
You do have a market there.

174
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,420
I should just buy a bunch and give them away just for advertising.

175
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,380
So I could go from two listeners to two readers to three readers and be as good as our podcast.

176
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,980
Hey, speaking of LinkedIn, a couple of things happened.

177
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,260
One, I didn't post this.

178
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,940
I may post this on LinkedIn.

179
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,780
It may become a blog post, but I think people would convince me of trolling.

180
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,500
So LinkedIn is filled with a bunch of this checking versus testing stuff.

181
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,860
And then also a lot of, and I'm gonna get to that in a second, but also still every

182
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,580
week I know, sigh, sigh, sigh, but I had a thought about this one.

183
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,340
This isn't a rehash the same stuff we get mad about all the time or to trigger brand.

184
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,140
It is to talk about the fact that people still are triggered, I will say, over the term manual

185
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,780
testing. They wouldn't, they say, I'm not going to make any mock voices right away,

186
00:10:53,780 --> 00:11:02,740
even though I just about did. Not manual. It's, it's, it's automated testing is checking or automated.

187
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,420
How do I not do a tautology there? If it's automated, it's checking.

188
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,540
And if I do it, it's just testing. And then I had a thought that came to me that

189
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:20,450
was like, they don't call it manual programming and they're right. But I wonder.

190
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,090
They also don't call it automatic programming.

191
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:28,320
I know they don't either. And I, I think the thing is, I think if you look at it from a different

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,480
angle, what if we lived in a world where I mean, it's about putting a label on something to show

193
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:42,000
how it differs from the common. And if the common form of testing is automated testing,

194
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,170
when we talk about testing, we're talking about some form of automation,

195
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:53,890
you would have to use the modifier manual to let you know, typically testing is automated,

196
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,130
but in this instance, I'm talking about doing it in a non-automated fashion.

197
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:02,910
And I wonder if there's some of that from history, you know, and in the big scheme,

198
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,110
I don't care, but I had a little fleeting thought. I was trying to figure it out.

199
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,110
Something was there. I wanted to bring it up before I forgot, but I'm just going to leave that.

200
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:16,750
I don't think, I don't think anyone automated versus manual. And it comes to this topic.

201
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,350
No one's really disputing the meaning between automated and manual.

202
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,390
What they're saying is manual testing is redundant, right?

203
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,110
Yes, but it is, but it isn't. The modify, it's not redundant.

204
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,070
The modifier is there to let you know, again, they see it, the people against it,

205
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:43,550
see it as a attack on testing in some way. And I don't want to get into this because honestly,

206
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,310
I don't really give a shit, but I just want, I just had this thought, like,

207
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:52,590
I wonder if we put the manual modifier on for a reason, not to degrade.

208
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,390
It's actually for a good reason. Also along those lines,

209
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,510
I don't want to spend a bunch of time on this, but also along those lines,

210
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,710
there was another, you know, someone posted, I'm not even going to go into names.

211
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:10,590
Someone posted something on automated checking and our friend Jason who both loves us and hates us.

212
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,150
Hi, Jason. I think he loves us more than he hates us. Sometimes he pissed him off though.

213
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,230
He pushed back a little bit and something about, you know, he pushed back on the checking

214
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,470
versus testing thing, but he took part in the conversation really well. And then at the very

215
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,750
end, well, the law, the source of confusion is some people don't realize that automation

216
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,430
isn't just for reproducing user flows. And we talked about this last time of the time before,

217
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,590
when I got really mad about people just stop, stop writing automation to reproduce workflows.

218
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,710
And Jason heard that and he liked it. I said, I described it well,

219
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,630
and simply on the recent podcast. So thanks Jason for that call out. So you can go back and find

220
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:50,030
that one. And then he also asked if there's any chance we can get Michael Bolton on the

221
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,070
podcast and I'm going to go a hard no on that one. Yeah. With you.

222
00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,750
All right. Just, just don't have it. I mean, I'll do respect to what you do. You do you,

223
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:06,750
but it's just not going to jive well with. I honestly think that I think the conversation

224
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:15,740
around checking versus testing has exceeded its quota on our podcast probably years ago.

225
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,620
Oh God. Yes. Oh God. Yes. So.

226
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:26,000
Just to make it even worse, I think about, okay, a COVID test. Okay. It's not called a COVID check.

227
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,220
It's called a COVID test. Right. And I would argue it is chemically automated. Right. So.

228
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:43,420
Yeah. To me, it is just, it is nasal. It's semantic BS in, in, that's it.

229
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,900
Okay. We're going to move on because we talked about that enough. Everybody knows

230
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,220
our stance on that. You can go to one of the three dot slack.com. I need to update the link.

231
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,580
If you, uh, cause there was a time when slack used to give you an in perpetuity,

232
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:03,940
I can't pronounce that word, a forever working link for signing up for the slack group. They

233
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,940
stopped doing that. I either, I didn't read the mail or they didn't tell me, but now it expires

234
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,820
every month and I realized I forgot to update it. So it's like, it's currently broken. I'm going

235
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,050
to wrap myself a note and I'm going to fix it after the podcast or tomorrow. There we go.

236
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,450
Everything I remember to do, I write down in to do this. That's a free plug for to do is to do us.

237
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:27,410
If you want to sponsor the podcast, that's great. Uh, so anyway, one of the three dot slack.com.

238
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:31,090
You can ping us there, ask us questions, take part in the community, pretty vibrant community.

239
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,330
There are lots of stuff going on. We love you. Brent, it is time to introduce our guest.

240
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,850
We have a guest.

241
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:42,370
We do have a guest. Someone we have talked about a lot on the podcast.

242
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:50,050
Someone very influential in my life. Someone I talk with every single day is probably one of my

243
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:55,330
strongest collaborators over the last month. Brent, I'd like to introduce you to my friend.

244
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:04,660
Chat GPT. Yeah, I have. We haven't talked about your buddy in such a long time.

245
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,820
So what I did this week, and I'm going to give you the highlights for this is actually

246
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,980
going to be an interview with chat GPT, but we're going to comment on the interview.

247
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,540
Because it's kind of interesting and worth talking about because again, I'm going to say this again.

248
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:28,340
I think 90 plus person used to be 99 down to 90% of the people using chat GPT and similar bots

249
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,940
are trying to use them wrong. Stop asking them questions that have a binary answer.

250
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,860
Chat GPT is very, very bad at math, not even close bad at math. I even had it help me write

251
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:45,460
a program, which generally it's good at. Logical programs, very good at. I tried to have it write

252
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,580
me a program to help me with a math problem I was trying to solve. I'm going to go over that

253
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:54,900
in a second and it failed completely. It is absolutely dumb at math. Do not ask it math

254
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:59,940
questions. You could ask, but the kind of questions you can ask it like exploratory questions.

255
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,900
There's that E word people love. Very, very good. Just real quick tangent. There's this new

256
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,420
beta game out of the New York Times called digits. I do the New York Times crossword.

257
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,620
Four to five days a week, depending on, I can't do any more than that.

258
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,940
Cause I'm just not smart enough. I do Wordle. I do this new game called digits where you're

259
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,500
given a set of six digits and you can use any of the basic for math.

260
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,000
Jesus operators. Oh my God to come up with this target number and there's three a day

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,920
or three or five a day and they get, they get harder as they go along. And I thought,

262
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,880
you know what? This is fun, but it would be fun to try and write a solver.

263
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,820
Okay. And so I asked chat GPT to help me and it was utterly hopeless. I tried to,

264
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,300
like, I really tried to coach it to do it. It could not do it. I ended up writing it in Python.

265
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:52,180
It's pretty cool, but I still try. I still try and do them by hand. Uh, but I wrote a little

266
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:57,380
solver in Python. So, uh, but open ended questions are great. So what I did is I led,

267
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,300
I said, here are a set of principles that I believe help with software development.

268
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:05,540
And I gave it the modern testing principles, but the more recent version, which isn't,

269
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,860
which takes out testing completely. So I'll read them real quick for context. Um,

270
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:14,100
our priority is improving the business. We use models like lean thinking and theory of constraints

271
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,660
to help identify prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system. So far the same. We are a force

272
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,460
for continuous improvement and adapt and optimize our practices in order to succeed rather than using

273
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,900
safety nets to catch our failures. We believe that the customer, sorry, sorry, we care deeply

274
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,660
about the quality culture of the team and we coach lead and nurture each other towards a more

275
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,300
mature quality culture. We believe that the customer is the only one capable to judge and

276
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:42,100
evaluate the quality of our product. We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage

277
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,780
and then close the gaps between product hypothesis and business impact. And finally, we expand

278
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,900
abilities and know how across the team, understanding that this may reduce or eliminate the need for

279
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:57,460
dedicated specialists. Those of you that have grown up with the principles over the last five

280
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,300
or six years, we came out with them. You probably listened to those and go, are those different?

281
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,460
They're slightly different. We've removed the word tester from them to make them more general.

282
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,540
They're modern develop, modern delivery practices, what they are really. So I gave it those and it

283
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:17,730
replied. It said, I didn't even ask. It just said, I hear a set of principles I believe help

284
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,650
with software development paced. It said these principles are focused on continuous improvement,

285
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:28,930
quality culture and customer satisfaction. The author, I'll put authors, the authors

286
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:33,730
emphasizes the use of lean thinking and theory of constraints to identify bottlenecks and improve

287
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,890
the business. The principles also stress the importance of using data to understand customer

288
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:42,210
usage and the need to expand abilities and knowledge across the team. So in this case,

289
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,010
all it's doing is summarizing, which chat GPT is very good at. One thing you can do, you can

290
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,050
ask chat GPT, summarize this book, and it will give you too high level of a summary. Here's my

291
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:58,290
hot tip. If you want a good summary of a book, ask chat GPT to give you a summary of each

292
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,970
chapter of a book and you get a wonderful freaking walkthrough. Free tips, free tips,

293
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:08,290
I'll charge for them later. So nothing, nothing exciting here, nothing for you to chime in on.

294
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:14,110
In terms of writing style, the author's tone is confident and assertive with a focus on

295
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,990
concise language and clear messaging. The principles are presented in a logical and

296
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,630
organized manner with a strong emphasis on actionable steps for improving software development

297
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,470
processes. Chat GPT thinks we know what we're doing. So I'm a little, a little against this.

298
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,790
I'm like, I'm like actionable.

299
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:36,910
All right, Brett, I want you to just hold on to your ego. Don't let it rise up because chat

300
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,590
GPT will blow smoke up your ass like nobody else. I know. Oh yeah. Similar authors might include

301
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:48,350
business and management writers such as Peter Drucker or Clayton Christensen, who also emphasized

302
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,590
the importance of continuous improvement and adapting to change in order to achieve business

303
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:58,670
success. We are not even in the same league who sees a league who sees a league that may

304
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,070
see a league that knows those two. We're not even the parents of the little league kids.

305
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,330
So that's, you know, that, that part's all kind of a bullshitty, but then I can ask it some

306
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,850
questions and here's where we get a chance to comment. I asked, are there any improvements you

307
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,970
would suggest? Okay. These principles seem like a good, and again, it's hard to get it to

308
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:25,410
really have an opinion. You have to kind of work at it for a while. So it gets better as we go

309
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,970
along. These principles seem like a good starting point for guiding software development. However,

310
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,770
there are a few areas that could potentially be expanded upon or clarified priority. It might be

311
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:43,170
useful to clarify what is meant by improving the business. Are there specific business goals or

312
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,330
metrics that the team is working towards? Defining these can help ensure that everyone is

313
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,330
aligned on working towards a common goal, which I kind of think is good freaking feedback.

314
00:21:51,970 --> 00:22:02,670
Yeah, that's right. We have had, we have seen certainly by feedback that people take sort of a

315
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:11,550
different view. Like when, when, when I envisioned it, it was, it was essentially, no, I want these

316
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:21,060
people to directly try to target revenue or profit. Yep. And then we've heard around like some,

317
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:28,420
some, there was a podcast that people did about AB testing. Then we're talking about it. And they're

318
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:34,740
like, Oh yeah, it tests, test can ignore this because as we know, test is there to reduce the cost.

319
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:40,670
Therefore we're improving the business. And I almost pulled over the side of the road and

320
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:47,070
cried because I'm like, Oh, okay. Not only were they misinterpreting it, they went 180 degrees

321
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,150
wrong. Yeah. And you're actually hitting on something. So hold that thought. I want to get

322
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,630
through as a little bit of feedback for each one, which is all actually pretty good. And

323
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,860
I'll hold my next thought on that till I read the next one models. It would be helpful to provide

324
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:06,820
more specific examples of how lean thinking and theory of constraints are used to identify and

325
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,740
prioritize bottlenecks. This can help make the principles more concrete and actionable.

326
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:16,580
I agree with that, but is it a goal of principles to be concrete? No, no, but what

327
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,940
it leads to me is at some point there's in my head, these get misinterpreted and we're

328
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:29,780
going to go more into that in a minute, but I wonder why we've never written an accompanying paper

329
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,120
to probably something we should have done or should do at some point. I mean, I've talked

330
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,880
about them at conferences so you can go a little bit deeper in the examples or there or some of

331
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,920
them. I wrote a long ass blog post that, that accompanied it.

332
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,720
I don't know what you're talking. Okay. Well, maybe it needs to be with them, but interesting.

333
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,640
Interesting. I think it's good feedback. I'm not sure how to fit those into the principles, but

334
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,720
it made me think. And again, chat GPT is my collaborator. If I can ask it questions and

335
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,240
it can make me think that I'm winning. Yes. Continuous improvement. It might be helpful

336
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,320
to clarify what is meant by safety nets. And I think again, examples would help,

337
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,640
but I think our audience knows, but which actually GPT didn't know. Again,

338
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,880
ask for more examples, quality culture. It might be useful to expand upon what a mature

339
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,960
quality culture looks like, which we've done with the quality culture matrix.

340
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,200
I'm going to pause for, get to the last three and just remind people who haven't been with us

341
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:36,960
on the entire journey. Brent and I spent probably the first two or three years of the podcast,

342
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:43,260
just talking about how software should be developed and what was happening with testers

343
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:49,010
and vetting ideas and learning from each other. And then it just came to a point when,

344
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:57,730
in trying to capture what we had been talking about for all that time, I sketched out a first

345
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:03,730
draft of what eventually through lots of vetting became the modern testing principle.

346
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,570
So it was, it wasn't like, we didn't set out to say we're going to write principles. It was like,

347
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,690
you know what? We need to capture what we've been writing out in a set of principles.

348
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:16,610
If I recall correctly, you were reading some book.

349
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:20,690
Dalio, the principles by Dalio, which is a great freaking book.

350
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:24,210
And you just connected the dots between the two.

351
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,650
Yeah. And this is why I read a lot because I'm not that smart, but I'm really good at pattern

352
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,650
matching. I'm really good at figuring out how to make stuff work together. That's my super power.

353
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,810
By the way, INTP for the win, yo.

354
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:44,610
Well, you know, I wrote last week about that INTP, but I do think I'm good at that

355
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,170
connecting and putting stuff together. By the way, I redid strengths finders. I have new strengths.

356
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:54,450
Talk about sometime soon. I'm going to save those for the later customer evaluation. While it's

357
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:59,170
important to prioritize customer's perspective, also important to consider other stakeholders.

358
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,490
We've got that feedback. Data usage, give examples and specialization.

359
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,330
While it is true that cross functional teams can help reduce the need for dedicated specialists,

360
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:12,370
it's important to recognize there may still be areas where specialized expertise is necessary.

361
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,810
Add some clarification there, which is we've talked about. Like I think security will

362
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:18,770
always need specialists. Is one example.

363
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,970
No, if that's true anymore. Yeah.

364
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,810
And this point, I've warmed up my friend chat GPT.

365
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,090
Okay.

366
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:33,250
So now I take it into, uh, I want to see what it'll do with a more introspective question.

367
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:38,530
So I asked it, of course, which of these principles could be considered the most controversial?

368
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:40,130
Oh, fun.

369
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:45,330
The principles listed seem to be, it's, it can, I can almost predict its writing style.

370
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:52,270
It makes like a, Hey, these are great, but so these principles listed seem to be generally accepted

371
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,510
as good practices and software development. And there isn't necessarily one that stands

372
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:01,630
out as being particularly controversial. It talent verbal italics. Mine. However,

373
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:08,180
thank you, chat GPT. However, depending on the specific context and the organization's culture

374
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,500
and values, some of these principles may be more challenging to implement than others.

375
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:18,500
For example, principle number five, which states that the customer is the only one capable of

376
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,380
judging and evaluating the quality of the product may be challenging for organizations

377
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,100
that have a history of prioritizing internal metrics and goals over customer feedback.

378
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,160
Yeah. Okay.

379
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,520
Yeah. We agree. Yeah. That was pretty fantastic.

380
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,400
But it pulled out that five was controversial. And when we wrote those, we didn't, we thought

381
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:47,040
seven would be controversial and it went right for five. Yeah. But then it says similarly,

382
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,520
principle seven, which suggests that the team should expand its abilities and knowledge across

383
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:58,080
the board rather than, rather than relying on dedicated specialists may be difficult to

384
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,640
implement an organization that have historically relied heavily on specialized roles.

385
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,960
So I want to give props and a little props to chat GPT. It absolutely is. I mean,

386
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,440
we didn't know me wrote them. We thought seven is the one people would freak out about. A lot of

387
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,160
people like seven. Yeah, I get this. This makes sense. It doesn't mean get it. We're going to

388
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:21,120
testers once they get over that, they kind of get it. But we didn't know five was going to be

389
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,840
such a hot bed. It just went right for five and said, well, watch out here. Yeah. We knew

390
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:35,330
about seven because that's what was the controversy when Microsoft was going through the transition.

391
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,940
Right. We saw over and over. We didn't see anyone disagree that the customer,

392
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:49,620
that one was purely because we were in a bubble. Yeah, we were. Oh, let me go back to LinkedIn

393
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,460
for a minute before we go back to chat GPT. Chat GPT, hold on. Can be patient for a minute.

394
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,890
I was tagged in a post on LinkedIn and I just got to read this. I wouldn't even say what company

395
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,770
I don't know the company that tweeted it, tweeted it. I'm so caught up in the musk world. What's

396
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:11,340
it called when you post on LinkedIn, leaded it, linked it, linked. I don't know. They said

397
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:17,020
that the post is just this. Will we be able to live without software testers? Absolutely not.

398
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,900
They make sure that the product being released is flawless.

399
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,940
Without testers, all the tools would crash and burn. So follow these experts who share their

400
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:33,660
experience and practices with the rest of us and they tagged me. Hyperbole. Hyperbole much?

401
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,740
I replied and said something to the effect of, I don't know what it was. Like you tagged the

402
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,740
wrong person. Like I don't know where it went. But yeah, that's, I think, I think I'm in the

403
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,260
wrong. I think I got tagged in the wrong post. Well, maybe it's from like a millennial or

404
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:58,220
something. And one of those terms, you know how like bad means good and, and, oh, yeah.

405
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:03,260
Right. And maybe it's like, maybe we're just not up to date on like the new hip term. And now

406
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:10,540
it's been reversed. I still, you know, I'm, I'm not anti testing. I don't know that testers

407
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,660
should do it. I get asked a lot to write about testing or give talks on testing. And I just

408
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,820
just, I'm not going to, it's, it's, I haven't done that in so long.

409
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:25,540
I don't know. It's, I kind of view it as something that's going to be self-resolved.

410
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:32,980
It's there are better ways to manage risk, right? Several of the statements listed out testers make

411
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,740
your product flawless. That, that part's hyperbole. The fact they told me, the fact

412
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,980
they told me in a post that said testers weren't going away, which I don't agree with.

413
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:50,180
It's funny. Let's get back to our guest. Yeah. Let's play a little game and I'll call it test

414
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:57,220
GPT. Okay. Mr. Chief, Mr. Jet GPT. What are some reasons that team should not adopt these

415
00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:05,380
principles? No. Probing questions while, and again, I'm so impressed with the, what it learned

416
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,300
while there may, while there are many benefits to adopting these principles, there may be some

417
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:14,580
reasons why teams might want to adopt them, including one organizational culture. Some orgs

418
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,220
may have deeply entrenched cultures that are resistant to change and may not be receptive

419
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,260
to adopting new principles and ways of working. That constitutes the entire, almost the entirety

420
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,020
of the crowd that tell us we're dumb. What is your, what was your prompt again?

421
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,180
What are some reasons that teams should not adopt these principles?

422
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,900
Good. I think, I think it took it is that that won't. Yeah. Okay. Number two,

423
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,260
short-term focus organizations that are focused solely on short-term gains and immediate profits

424
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,060
may not see the long-term value in investing in continuous improvement, quality culture,

425
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:52,500
or expanding the abilities of the team. And they're right. I focus so much on the people

426
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,660
getting the work done. And that, you know, there's, it's not just me, a lot of people in our

427
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:03,860
circle, in our bubble focused on, we want to get the team in a place where they can deliver

428
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,730
quality at a nice velocity, a sustainable pace, all of that stuff. Yeah. If you don't care about

429
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,770
that, if you just want to hurry up and get shit out to customers, I guess you wouldn't want to

430
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,050
adopt them. I don't think it's new there. Number three, resource constraints. Some orgs may not

431
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:22,690
have the resources to invest in the necessary training tools or personnel. And that goes a lot

432
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:27,090
with number two. They only care about the short term. Number four, resistance from team members.

433
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,930
Some team members may be resistant to change or may not want to expand their skill sets or

434
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,090
take on new responsibilities. We've heard this from a lot of people. It goes with number one a lot,

435
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:38,530
but that's, yeah, people are digging their heels in. They want to do what they've always been doing.

436
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:44,370
My developers don't want to test. They shouldn't have to, because they're paid too much money to

437
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,730
test. Right. And lack of understanding some team members or stakeholders may not fully understand

438
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,650
the value of these principles or may not understand how they can be applied in practice.

439
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:59,170
And these are, these all ring bells with me. So it's important for teams to carefully consider

440
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,170
their unique context and constraints before deciding whether to adopt these principles

441
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,410
and to be prepared to address any challenges or resistance that may arise. And I think

442
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,210
you and I are, we like living in the world of being change agents. And I think there are a lot

443
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,730
of folks who just don't want to deal with that. It's hard. It's easier just to do the thing

444
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:23,730
they've done and not try and do that cultural change, which we, you and I kind of love a

445
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:31,890
little. Well, yeah, it's the age old battle of if it ain't broke, don't fix it. That is not a

446
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,530
perspective that I generally hold. There's a question I'm going to skip. I asked it on what

447
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:41,090
tips you can think of for teams who want to adopt these principles. And it's just like, you know,

448
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,370
pull your head out of your button before we're in a long paragraph. But so I got into two more

449
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,450
questions because we do, we're down to like eight minutes here or seven. I didn't stop like a

450
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,770
minute before four for our next meeting. What would a software tester think of these principles?

451
00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:00,690
Let's just get the embrace the elephant, hug the elephant, as they say. Yeah. A software tester

452
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,730
may have mixed feelings about these principles. On one hand, they may appreciate the focus on quality

453
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:10,530
culture and continuous improvement as those principles align with their role in ensuring the

454
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:15,010
quality of software being developed. They may also agree, and there's a weird one after what

455
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,930
it said before, they may also agree that the customer is the ultimate judge of quality of

456
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:23,090
the product. And I know people who adamantly believe that that is false. They say number

457
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:29,490
five is wrong. We ignore it. There's no way. And I'm blown away. Anyway, on the other hand,

458
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,730
a tester may feel concerned about the principle that suggests the dedicated specialist may not be

459
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,290
necessary. Testers may worry that their role is being diminished or eliminated, which could

460
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:42,210
impact their job security. However, it is important to note that the principles do not

461
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:46,850
suggest that testers are not necessary at all. Rather, that expanding the team's abilities

462
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:51,730
and know how may reduce the need for dedicated specialists, which is spot freaking on.

463
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:58,850
This is why I love chat. This is why it's my friend. And again, I'm asking an AI to interpret

464
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,650
this stuff. It's like, yeah, I get it completely in the way we intended. Yet hundreds or thousands

465
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,250
of testers read these things or developers read these things and go, whoop, that those are

466
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:12,210
wrong. This is stupid. Overall, a software tester may appreciate the focus on quality,

467
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,650
continuous improvement, but may have some concerns about their role in a team that adopts

468
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:19,650
these principles. It's important for teams to communicate and collaborate to ensure that

469
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,650
everyone's concerns are addressed, that the team may work together effectively towards a common goal.

470
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:29,410
So what I think I may do is I may add some formatting to this and go ahead and post it

471
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,810
in our Slack group, people to play with and react on, because it's interesting.

472
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:40,690
I want to do one more. I'm going to skim over. I asked it what's missing. And I think it's okay.

473
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,090
They mentioned that we don't explicitly mention any particular software development

474
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:50,050
methodology, and that's on purpose. While the principals mentioned the importance of customer,

475
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,970
they did not explicitly discuss the importance of designing software with user in mind.

476
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,210
I think that's beyond the principles. They don't talk about security. And again,

477
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:03,970
that's beyond what's in there or software architecture. So I'm okay with good callouts,

478
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,290
but I'm okay with those not being there. I asked it, what do these principles tell you about the

479
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:13,410
authors of the principles? And they said these two that the two authors are a couple of

480
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:17,810
blowhards that couldn't tell their ass from a hole in the ground. No, it says they care about

481
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:23,410
quality, blah, blah, blah. Without additional context, I can't tell you anything. That's fine.

482
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:30,080
And the last one I asked it was this, can you think of a mission statement that would go well

483
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:37,040
with these principles? Sure. Here's an example mission statement. Our mission is to continuously

484
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,880
improve our software development practices to better serve our customers and improve our business.

485
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,560
We prioritize lean thinking and theory of constraints to identify and mitigate bottlenecks

486
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,160
in our systems. And we use data extensively to understand customer usage and close gaps

487
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,440
between product hypothesis and business impact. We foster a quality culture among our team,

488
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,960
nurturing each other towards greater maturity and coaching one another towards success. We

489
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,840
believe that the customer is the ultimate judge of our quality of our products. And we expand

490
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:03,840
abilities know how across the team to eliminate the need for dedicated specialists. My reply,

491
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,840
that's a long fucking mission statement. Can you do it in 10 words or less? Sure.

492
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:12,640
How about delivering quality software that drives business growth through continuous improvement?

493
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,280
Say that again.

494
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,080
Delivering quality software that drives business growth through continuous improvement.

495
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,060
I like that.

496
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,740
But then I said, what do you think of accelerate the achievement of shippable quality?

497
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,780
Okay. I like that one too.

498
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,140
It says it's a concise and effective mission statement that aligns well with the principles

499
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,740
you mentioned earlier. It conveys a sense of urgency and focus and quality while emphasizing

500
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,100
the importance of speed and efficiency in delivering software. Overall, it could serve

501
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,860
as a good rallying cry for a team that is focused on improving its software development practices.

502
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,580
Hey, so we're almost out of time.

503
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:50,660
We are. I'm going to give you the last question. I'm not going to read the answers because I'll

504
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,460
save these. I said the authors of the authors of the principles have a podcast called A B

505
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,780
Testing based on the principles, what are topics they should cover in their discussions.

506
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,820
And it gave me a nice list of 10, 10 things to talk about.

507
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,910
Which is pretty nice.

508
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,910
We should start going through the list.

509
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,070
We should. You're going to say.

510
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:19,300
All right. I just now. So my iteration, I don't know what version of GPT you use,

511
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,460
but currently my favorite is the Bing bot.

512
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,820
Which you told me to play with. I have not touched at all.

513
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,000
Well, I could share screen, but I won't.

514
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,920
That'll be a good podcast topic.

515
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,240
Yes, I asked it.

516
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,820
Read the book Accelerate and the following modern testing principles

517
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:49,380
and propose changes to the principles that are supported by Accelerate.

518
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:57,310
And then I copy pasted the principles and it said, Hello, this is Bing.

519
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,190
I'm happy to help you with the task. Smiley face.

520
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:06,190
First thing you did the Bing actually search for the Accelerate book summary.

521
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,910
Okay. So this is the one thing that's interesting around the Bing bot

522
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:16,030
because it can do with someone as info retrieval and incorporate that into the

523
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:22,980
into response. Whereas open AI is is is only trained up to 2021.

524
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,220
Correct.

525
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,740
And only knows what it knows. Okay.

526
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,860
And I'll just go through. I'm not going to read.

527
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,940
So what it did is it modified the principles.

528
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,680
And the first one, our priority is improving the business and then it added

529
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,080
by delivering valuable software faster and more reliably.

530
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,550
That's not horrible.

531
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:46,830
Principle number two, we use blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

532
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:54,030
mitigate bottlenecks from the system and optimize our software delivery process.

533
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,440
Okay.

534
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,400
Okay.

535
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:04,110
Principle three, we are a force of continuous improvements, etc.

536
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,710
Rather than using safety nets to catch your failures.

537
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:13,630
And we measure our success using the four key metrics of software delivery performance.

538
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,750
Oh, okay.

539
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,870
It's actually not a not a bad mashup.

540
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,560
Now for we care deeply about the quality culture

541
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,680
and nurture our team towards a more mature quality culture

542
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:34,030
that embraces continuous delivery, the management and DevOps practice.

543
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:37,390
I kind of don't like that one feels redundant to principle two.

544
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:37,790
I does.

545
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:38,750
Yeah.

546
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,630
Principle five, we believe that the customer is the only one capable

547
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:46,110
to judge and evaluate the quality of our products.

548
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:51,790
And we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and feedback.

549
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:58,480
And I'm like, okay, you just duplicated principle six, but what else?

550
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,590
Principle six, we use data too.

551
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,470
But this is one thing interesting.

552
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,550
We use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage and close the gaps

553
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,030
between product hypotheses and business impacts.

554
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:18,060
And we deliver software in small batches and fast feedback loops.

555
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,180
Those of us who don't go together.

556
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:25,660
I mean, it's trying to shove the, that, that into all the principles.

557
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:31,420
So the, well, it basically summarized, you can totally see how it's.

558
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,980
Yeah.

559
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,260
I see what it's doing and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

560
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,860
And it's just trying to find the, uh, the way to, it's doing exactly what I asked it to do

561
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,180
is they accelerate and approve it.

562
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,420
All right.

563
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,820
You should share that in the Slack channel as well.

564
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,940
And I'll try and do mine as well.

565
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,380
Did a little formatting on it, but I am, I am late for my next meeting.

566
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,060
So we're going to call that a day.

567
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:52,460
Thank you.

568
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,620
Chat GPT for being on the podcast today.

569
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,980
You are a wonderful guest.

570
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,300
Yes.

571
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:57,260
All right.

572
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,940
I am chat GPT.

573
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,790
I am not.

574
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:02,510
And I'm Alan.

575
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,710
We'll see you next time.
