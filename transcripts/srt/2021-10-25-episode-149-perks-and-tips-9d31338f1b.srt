1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ice, ice baby.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,840
Now I have to think that I pissed off any part of my team who may listen to this, forget

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,840
to mention it.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:16,580
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:22,740
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,340
agile and anything else that comes to mind.

8
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,050
Now, on with the show.

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,090
AB Testing Podcast.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,090
That's where you are right now.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:40,450
Episode 149, edging up on the big 150, which we have absolutely no celebration plans for,

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,650
but 150 is coming up.

13
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:49,730
And I am Alan and I am here with the one and only, the B, the B side of the 45 that makes

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,850
up AB testing.

15
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,850
Introduce yourself, Brent Jensen.

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,260
Hi.

17
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,060
Yeah, there we go.

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,060
Bring in the energy.

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,060
Bring in the energy.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,500
Did I ever tell you?

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:06,020
Did I ever, I did something once that I don't know if I ever told you, there was one podcast

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:15,100
you came in with such low energy that I ended up taking the time to speed you up in editing

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,100
to make you move just a little bit faster to try and bring a little energy to your voice.

24
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,220
Hey, everybody.

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,260
So yeah, and hopefully that won't be today, but you know, it's just something I've done

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:37,240
before I do what I can to make this the best podcast in the world called AB testing, which

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,730
I think I think it's in the top five of all the podcasts named AB testing.

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,570
Yeah, it's in the top five of all the podcasts named AB testing.

29
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,570
So here we are.

30
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,930
How's it going, Brent?

31
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,170
It's been an exciting week.

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,680
And by exciting, I mean draining is all hell.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,080
Mine has been, and I want to get to that a little bit later, talking about some new things

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,240
for me happening at Unity and what it's doing to me.

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,720
But yeah, you know, stuff happens.

36
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,800
I'll just say like today.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,080
So my organization has rolled out.

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
No meeting Fridays.

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,280
Oh, good, good, good, good.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,880
That's something I want to talk about more later in the podcast.

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
So how's that going?

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,680
How many meetings did you have on no meeting Friday today?

43
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,520
Oh, it's been back to back.

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:39,870
It's funny because I talked to it's been something that's in place for a while and I talked

45
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,390
to my senior executive.

46
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,950
So he and I have a quarterly one on one and he brought it up because he was I think he

47
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,110
was he uses me as a sounding board a lot of the time.

48
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:59,380
I don't know how often he does this with everyone, but he knows because we have a long relationship.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:07,420
He knows that I will truthfully answer any question that is asked of me.

50
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,340
Sometimes even the ones I'm like, please don't ask that question.

51
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,820
I don't want to answer it.

52
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,220
So he's like, hey, so how do you how do you feel about the no meeting Fridays?

53
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,980
I'll call him Bob.

54
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,620
Did he ask you this in a meeting on a Friday?

55
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
No.

56
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,380
OK, it's just it was in a meeting.

57
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,620
It was not on a Friday.

58
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
All right.

59
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,940
And I said I'm going to call him Bob to protect the innocent.

60
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,780
But I said, Bob, if you wanted to punish the managers in your org, there are far more

61
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,510
direct and meaningful ways.

62
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,670
Because what I found what I found was what he laughed and then he he asked, OK, why

63
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,670
am I saying that?

64
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,910
And I said, well, here's what's happening is every P.M.

65
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:59,190
And their mother is now in order to honor this, is now trying to squeeze every second

66
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,110
of meeting time on Monday through Thursday.

67
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,270
OK, let me know.

68
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,590
No one's willing.

69
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,950
No one's willing.

70
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,490
No one's willing to counsel.

71
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:17,200
And when I'm quadruple booked like they're getting upset when I am not

72
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
choosing their meeting.

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,840
Yeah.

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,920
I'm like, all right, I'm going to I'm going to have this conversation because this is

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,760
actually something indirectly or as part of a group of things I wanted to talk about

76
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,840
today, which is what are the I will get into the whole idea on work perks.

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,200
But this is interesting.

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's talk about A.B.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,880
testing for a second.

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,600
I'll get back here.

81
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,320
Not a tangent.

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,240
This is a story like I know what I'm doing.

83
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:40,310
It's a story.

84
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,390
No, it's not a story like that.

85
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,910
You seven, you child of the 70s.

86
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,470
What happens if you take away all the testers on the team and don't give people a

87
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:54,270
framework or ideas on how to be successful with that chaos chaos?

88
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:58,550
So what happens if you go to no meeting Friday and you don't tell people how to

89
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,150
make it work?

90
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,110
It's what happens if you tell people to stop doing things and don't tell them

91
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,230
what you need.

92
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,350
They they have new ways to create chaos and destruction.

93
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,230
Yeah.

94
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,870
So one thing I have been very fortunate and I have a packed schedule and I'm

95
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,230
someone who gets someone to manage my calendar for me and she freaks out over

96
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:21,950
my calendar.

97
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,750
But despite that, and I'll tell you some reasons for why that is in a minute,

98
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,070
99 plus percent of my meetings are 100 percent effective uses of my time.

99
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,300
I don't have those fluff.

100
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,140
I don't have meetings where people are like, this could have been an email.

101
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,540
This could have been a Slack message.

102
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,820
So I'm lucky there.

103
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,060
And that's been true over my nearly five years at Unity now.

104
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,180
So I but when you move to a four day week, you need to provide guidance on

105
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:50,980
how it works.

106
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,660
Does it mean for 10 hour days?

107
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,100
No.

108
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:58,580
Does it mean if you want to know meeting Friday, does it mean you cram all the

109
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,740
meetings from the rest week into the, from Friday into one day?

110
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,220
Not necessarily.

111
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,020
I think it is supposed to give you an opportunity to prioritize and look

112
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,540
at what's important.

113
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,740
Unity gave all of the employees just some random Friday holidays over the

114
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,900
summer and people were pretty good about examining whether or not they

115
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,740
needed to cram five days of meetings into four days.

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,660
If that's happening, there's just some more context and discussion happening.

117
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,650
It's about optimizing the time because I brought up four day a week earlier.

118
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:37,830
I thought this last summer, summer before last, I had some vacation that

119
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,270
was, well, to use one thing different.

120
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,750
I discovered the hard way at Unity compared to Microsoft at Microsoft.

121
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,670
You would always accrue vacation.

122
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,030
And it was only at the end of the year when if you, you'll had a maximum

123
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,070
amount, you could carry over to the next year.

124
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:57,030
What I discovered without paying attention is that unity, you actually

125
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,710
stop accruing vacation once you hit the max.

126
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,430
So I noticed that I was no longer accruing vacation days.

127
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,510
And because it was the early days of COVID, this was the summer before

128
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,270
last, I decided I would take every Friday off in the summer.

129
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:16,990
And so I essentially assigned myself a four day work week and it worked.

130
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,150
I was so much more energetic after that extra day off that I was able to

131
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,310
be as productive in 32 hours as I was in my normal 40 give or take,

132
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,830
depending on the week so I could see how that could work.

133
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:36,030
But it also meant that, you know, I had a few more meetings on those days,

134
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:41,070
but I kind of was okay with it because I knew I'd have the extra rest time,

135
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:45,590
but it can work, but if you're going to do it company wide or organization

136
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,670
wide, it would require some guidelines, a little bit of education, some

137
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,590
discussions, some retros, et cetera.

138
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,070
The reason I want to talk about no meeting Fridays, four day work weeks

139
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,070
is because I'm opinionated about the topic.

140
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,750
I was invited into a focus group with our HR department to talk

141
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,190
about workplace innovation.

142
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,990
What could we do differently?

143
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,820
What could we try and what should we consider?

144
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,740
What should we put on the plate to think about what could we do differently

145
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,700
to make unity an even better place to work?

146
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,700
And what's interesting is they gave us a spreadsheet, people to add their ideas.

147
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,780
You're not going to be surprised.

148
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,220
People added a lot of incremental things like maybe one more Friday off a month

149
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,490
or let's have some social events and little tweaks that are all really

150
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,890
good and things we should consider doing.

151
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,850
Nothing's off the table.

152
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,770
You want to have incremental things and big things.

153
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,660
The things I put on the list were four day work weeks at the very

154
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,500
least a meeting, a meeting free Friday.

155
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,350
Uh, things like, Oh, here's, here's one I put on there.

156
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,430
Uh, vacation stipend.

157
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,750
In addition to paid vacation, give everybody a thousand dollars worth of

158
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,510
reimbursable money to use on a vacation to make them actually do a

159
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:04,550
vacation away from their hometown, you know, pay for them to get away.

160
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,820
Unity has moved away.

161
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,140
Another one is unity has moved away from a fully remote work, even though

162
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,580
actually with my new org, we'll just talk about in a bit about 16% of my

163
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:22,340
org is currently fully remote and I would hire more fully remote people.

164
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,140
But we're putting a pause on that for now.

165
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,980
I think we go back.

166
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,300
I think we should go back to that.

167
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,100
Uh, a lot of things about transparency, but anyway, big things.

168
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,940
I wanted to talk about it and like just before we pressed record, Brent and

169
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,140
now we're talking about like other perks we get and unity is really good.

170
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,740
For example, on just things we get today on health benefit, like health,

171
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:50,580
not just, not just, um, healthcare or insurance, but we get enough money

172
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:54,540
to cover my gym membership for the entire year, even though I took a few

173
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,860
months off because you know, a pandemic, but also to buy a new, a new

174
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,740
backpack, sleeping bag, a tent, all covered.

175
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,780
So that's pretty cool too.

176
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,660
Um, but what I'm curious, uh, we don't have to do like a macho comparison

177
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,940
contest between Microsoft and unity or other companies, but I'm just kind of

178
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,980
curious, either what something Microsoft offers or something you've thought of.

179
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,020
What are some other cool, this would be great one to pop it on the Slack channel.

180
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,580
One of the three.slack.com go to modern testing.org, get an invitation.

181
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:32,220
I'm curious what other cool ideas companies are doing to, you know,

182
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,220
perks that are, they make it fun.

183
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,180
Another one I thought of like just, uh, peer bonuses, uh, which is something

184
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,540
that Google has done in the past.

185
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,420
I don't know if still do it now, but just some things to help reward people

186
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,020
and give people that little attaboy, which is important and little

187
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,300
things like a hundred dollars, $200, those things like that.

188
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,260
Anyway, I am going a mile a minute and I'll slow my voice down later.

189
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,980
But does that tickle any, any bells for you?

190
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,500
That's a mixed metaphor, but go for it.

191
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,100
Yeah.

192
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,380
So we have, we have a perks thing as well.

193
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,820
Like, uh, it just changed.

194
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,540
Uh, it used to be.

195
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:16,010
So one of the benefits of Microsoft was, um, uh, an annual

196
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,490
subscription to the pro club gym.

197
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:27,010
And for those not anywhere near the Washington area, uh, pro club, I

198
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,890
would say by far is probably literally where the pros hang out back in the day.

199
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,290
And when I worked at Microsoft and I used to go to the pro club, I would see

200
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,330
sonics there every morning, the sonics were a basketball team that used to

201
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,930
exist in Seattle before it, before, um, it got screwed up and they went to Oklahoma.

202
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:45,650
Anyway, go on.

203
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,450
Super Sonic.

204
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:52,890
Uh, speaking of which, you, you paying attention at all to the Kraken.

205
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,050
Oh yeah.

206
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,050
Oh yeah.

207
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,410
All right.

208
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,290
All right.

209
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:58,890
I am, I am all in on the Kraken.

210
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,730
Nice.

211
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,530
Yeah.

212
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,250
I started well, Kraken season started right when the mariner season ended.

213
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,770
So that was handy for me.

214
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:08,170
Yeah.

215
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:09,610
Um, overlapping soccer.

216
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,170
I'm a big sounders fan, so they get my ultimate attention, but I am going to be.

217
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,970
And again, I don't have cable TV.

218
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,850
So when they're on a channel, I can stream.

219
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:23,370
I will watch the Kraken regularly on the reg as they say, but nobody says that.

220
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:24,050
Anyway, go on.

221
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,490
No one does say that.

222
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:37,540
So the, so the pro club, I would, I w I would guess is probably by far the best gym

223
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,620
in the Pacific Northwest of hands down.

224
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,900
It is, it is the lap of luxury gym.

225
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:50,220
You just cannot imagine the sheer size of this place and how nice it is and how

226
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,380
well up kept it as I, I cannot explain it.

227
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:54,940
I can't either.

228
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,860
But then Microsoft sort of changed it, changed the policy to say, okay, we

229
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:07,260
have options now we can, we can pick the pro club or we can do some amount of

230
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:14,100
money and it was less than the value of the pro club annually, but you could

231
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,260
do some amount of money for anything that you want, as long as you could

232
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,820
justify that it was for like physical fitness type of thing.

233
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,380
So, uh, sounds pretty similar.

234
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,260
Yeah.

235
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,820
You could, like, you could use it to, to what is that cool bike that everyone's

236
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,100
getting, I don't have a search with a P the, does it matter?

237
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
It doesn't matter.

238
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,700
I got to let it go.

239
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:39,900
Yeah.

240
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,900
The, so there's a lot of like exercise services.

241
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:47,060
People are buying, you know, a year at a time they were buying like little,

242
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,300
little in-house equipment, things like that.

243
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,460
Well, they've not been able to do that.

244
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,300
Well, they've now expanded it.

245
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,500
So it's now literally, you talked about perks.

246
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,660
It's literally called perks and it's still less than the total for pro club,

247
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,820
but they grew it.

248
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:10,380
It's, it's got a larger budget on a per employee basis and it's

249
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,700
also a lot more flexible.

250
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,940
Um, but, but that's just, that's just cash to take care of yourself.

251
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,260
What I'm talking about perks like massage, messieurs at work or.

252
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,300
Dinner is sent to your house at once a week or like, what are companies doing?

253
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:32,240
Well, so my, my company, at least my organization, it's not Microsoft,

254
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,480
but the organization has done things like that.

255
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:41,610
They will, will use their morale budget, uh, and disperse it through employees.

256
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,650
Like last year, I got a really nice gift basket from Harry and David's.

257
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,170
Um, I've bought some board games and things like that.

258
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,410
Right.

259
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,050
I'm talking about like regular perks for recruiting or kind of things that make a

260
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,010
company unique place to work.

261
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:57,490
Yeah.

262
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,050
There's nothing like there's nothing to do anything at Microsoft, but you truly do.

263
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,290
Yeah.

264
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,850
Are you one of those Microsoft people who never talks to anyone outside

265
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,290
of Microsoft except for like me?

266
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,210
Yeah.

267
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,570
Sadly, last couple of months.

268
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,610
That's probably that's yeah.

269
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,690
So I'm no, that literally is true.

270
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:15,410
I would guess among the three, there's some ideas.

271
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,370
So I'm going to go with you.

272
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,410
I've been racking my brain trying to think outside of the box.

273
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,090
I really like this idea of vacation stipend.

274
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,290
Uh, yeah, I like, I like the vacation stipend or maybe we buy some, maybe we buy

275
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,770
like a handful of condos and Hawaii or some other places and, and give people

276
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,490
vacation, you know, cheap vacation rental.

277
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,190
Uh, yeah, actually interesting.

278
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:44,790
So a corporate timeshare that, that might be, now you're getting outside the box with me.

279
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,710
I really like, I really liked the peer thing that Google does.

280
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,950
I adore that.

281
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,310
I've been actually thinking about, could I get away for years?

282
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,950
I've been thinking about, could I get away with doing that?

283
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:59,750
Like I have my own budget.

284
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,710
I can segment it and say, all right, I'll let my team own 50% of it.

285
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:12,740
But I've kind of, if that goes sideways, I could see all sorts of really

286
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,250
troubling things that I would then have to resolve.

287
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,050
You just keep an eye on those.

288
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,930
And like, um, I remember Whitaker telling me a story, somebody on his team did

289
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,610
something massively cool and 27 people or something, which I'm sure is

290
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,570
exaggerated knowing Whitaker, but a whole bunch of people gave him a peer bonus.

291
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,810
So his boss and HR go, Hey, what's going on?

292
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:32,810
Said, no, he just did this.

293
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:33,650
They go, okay, cool.

294
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,610
We don't have peer bonuses directly, but I do have a pretty free pool of

295
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,210
spot bonuses that I use.

296
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:44,770
I use myself, but now my team is used to me enough.

297
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,730
They go, Hey, I think so-and-so should get a spot bonus.

298
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,530
I go, Hey, I'll take care of that.

299
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:54,770
So that's the way we sort of, it's sort of facilitated spot bonus.

300
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,460
Yeah, actually.

301
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:03,420
And I know, I know Salesforce, uh, they don't have a regular bonus.

302
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,300
They only have spot bonus.

303
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:05,780
Yeah.

304
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,660
It's the same here.

305
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:11,540
Only, only, uh, director pluses have a regular bonus and it's

306
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:16,420
actually tied directly to company, uh, company revenue and performance, but

307
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,860
everyone else, I try and make liberal use of my spot bonus budget.

308
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,670
So looking for more ideas on perks.

309
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,230
Uh, that was one of the things I wanted to talk about.

310
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,990
I told you my cool ideas.

311
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,350
We should talk about, did we talk, I know we talked offline about my new,

312
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,940
uh, title, which actually I've got a letter from HR announcing it.

313
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,020
And, but it hasn't been announced internally.

314
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,220
So I probably will, I'll just leave it at that and you can use your guesses.

315
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,180
But I do have a much bigger organization now, which I don't believe we've talked

316
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,020
about on the podcast might be worth talking about that for two reasons.

317
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,140
One is the scope of what we cover and the mission of that team.

318
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,630
And the other one is challenges that come when you add 80 people to your

319
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,350
organization in one fell swoop.

320
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,830
Hey, is that challenging?

321
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,530
Listen 10 minutes longer and find out.

322
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:17,810
All right.

323
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,330
There's the in app CH the in episode cliffhanger.

324
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:28,010
So let's talk about the first part of that, which is, which was that, uh,

325
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,770
Oh, the scope.

326
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:33,890
So I think I've mentioned on the podcast before, um, oh boy, a couple,

327
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:35,490
we had two reorgs happen at once.

328
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,130
One took a little longer to happen.

329
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,010
One was actually pretty quick.

330
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,050
So we've done two things with his latest reorg.

331
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,860
One is easy.

332
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,420
We've, uh, unity up until a week ago had two different documentation

333
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,380
orgs for customer facing documentation.

334
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:58,890
There was my org had, um, a handful of people, 12, 15, who wrote the

335
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,450
documentation for all of our customers who use services, things like ads,

336
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,170
analytics, uh, some of our new unity gaming services features, uh, cloud

337
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,370
save, uh, et cetera.

338
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:15,570
Uh, we had that team plus another documentation team focused on just

339
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,090
basically everything else editor engine, some of the verticals we support,

340
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:19,890
things like that.

341
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:20,610
Okay.

342
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,490
We decided it made sense to merge those into one org and just have

343
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,330
one documentation or it's just kind of a no brainer.

344
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,330
So we merged those other documentation folks into my team.

345
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,610
Everybody's working together.

346
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,650
We're already finding some good areas for alignment.

347
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,770
Uh, with that part of the reorg, we knew it was going on for a while.

348
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,730
So we were able to get people talking at things set up.

349
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,970
So that's stage one part one.

350
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:47,170
It's not even a part one, part two, part a part B, they both

351
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,050
happen at the same time.

352
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:51,130
But anyway, I now manage documentation for all of

353
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,650
unity's external documentation.

354
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:59,050
So if you are a unity user and you go, man, I can't figure out how to use

355
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:03,750
this thing because the documentation is whack, you can message me and

356
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,230
I'll, I'll make sure it gets fixed.

357
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,320
Not on Twitter.

358
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,240
Uh, anyway, hopefully I don't open up a flood gate right there, but I think

359
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,040
Michael, our engineering, I tell our engineering team that we are a solid B.

360
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,600
We're a B engineering team.

361
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,440
We have, it's good.

362
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,160
It's a 3.0.

363
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,840
It's awesome.

364
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,880
We need to be a 4.0.

365
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:24,960
So we're going to work.

366
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,120
We have some work to do there.

367
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,080
Uh, and again, documentation answers the question.

368
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,840
What does a user need in order to be successful with this feature or product?

369
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,600
And we give you a solid 80, 80 to 88% of that.

370
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,240
We need to get to the high nineties.

371
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:51,580
The other thing that happened was we had a sister organization, a brother

372
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:58,260
organization, a peer organization to my org, which focuses on service

373
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,580
infrastructure, CI CD for those systems, et cetera.

374
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,780
There's a peer organization at unity that did that handles all of the,

375
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,100
this will bring you way back to the 2000s Brent, the same infrastructure,

376
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:16,140
CI CD deployment, test farms, et cetera, for our desktop software.

377
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,750
Okay.

378
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,270
Yeah.

379
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,590
So that team is now part of my organization as well.

380
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,950
Well, that's good.

381
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:27,110
And it makes sense because both teams have CI CD, both teams do testing.

382
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,710
Both teams.

383
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,910
It's a lot of overlap.

384
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,390
It's good.

385
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,430
We're going to get everything working together, but it's kind of fun

386
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,020
because there, some of the challenges they still have are some of the

387
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,140
problems that I remember solving, or at least being a part of solving in the

388
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,100
past, things like test selection, test prioritization, machine usage.

389
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,820
We actually have some of our own lab slash data centers we use to do a build

390
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,530
and test in, we leverage, uh, external services and vendors.

391
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,330
It's a whole bunch of cool, fun stuff.

392
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,490
So many opportunities to learn.

393
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,050
Fun, lots of new stuff.

394
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:04,730
That's old stuff.

395
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:05,850
Yeah.

396
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,290
I mean, it's a world.

397
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,410
I mean, the it's a world you used to know.

398
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,450
It is, it is.

399
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,010
But one thing I'm realizing is on one hand, they're very different, but on the

400
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:22,210
other hand, data centers and cloud infra aren't really that different.

401
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,900
If you think about the transition, we went from machines full of labs to shoving

402
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,460
those machines into a data center, to calling that data center, the cloud.

403
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,080
Yeah.

404
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
I'm oversimplifying.

405
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,160
Just send your hate mail to me.

406
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,920
No, it's not, it's not a bad simplification.

407
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,660
Not at all.

408
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,100
Yeah.

409
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,540
So I have those pluses, a few of the things in my org, just for completeness.

410
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,620
Someone asked me to draw it out once and I should do that.

411
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,380
So I have a documentation, all of the support.

412
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,020
So for everybody building stuff and deploying stuff, all of that stuff.

413
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,100
Also localization is in my org because that overlaps deeply with documentation

414
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,420
as well as the engineering system, because we do things like make sure we can

415
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,780
make sure all the things we build, we can do pseudo look builds for pseudo

416
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,300
look for those aren't in, we haven't had to deal with that before.

417
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:20,780
It's, it's fake localizing something via some regex pattern to make

418
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,860
sure your localization process works and to make sure your prost, your,

419
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,620
your are localizable.

420
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,180
Laura Mipsum.

421
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:28,580
Yes.

422
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,860
Laura Mipsum.

423
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,780
And, uh, we have, of course, I've mentioned a couple episodes ago,

424
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,780
Melissa Eden manages a team doing quality coaching across 500 plus engineers,

425
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,860
plus she just manages special projects.

426
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,300
And then I have, uh, we've centralized a program management for my overall

427
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:52,860
org under me and remember Brent program management to me and the rest of the

428
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,340
industry is different than what they call program managers at Microsoft.

429
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,860
These are people that focus on the how and the when of what we build a product

430
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,770
or program, a lot of times at Microsoft it's the why and the what I think the

431
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:11,610
TPM has done technical program management has done.

432
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:16,250
If you look at it as the, the, uh, the how and the when is very much an

433
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,210
engineering aspect.

434
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,250
So that's in my org as well.

435
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,250
We drive, so we can drive our engineering practices across the rest of our org.

436
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,810
There is, I don't know if I've ever told you my team's mission.

437
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:32,370
So I use this mission statement for my old team on cloud infra and my new

438
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,930
team seems okay with it unchanged.

439
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,300
And it may ring a bell.

440
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,900
Uh, there may be some copyright infringement here.

441
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,020
Oh boy.

442
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,100
Accelerate the success of engineering teams at unity in delivering high

443
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,540
value products and services that our customers love.

444
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,300
Yeah.

445
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,740
That doesn't sound familiar at all.

446
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,540
That shouldn't matter.

447
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,100
It's O O Ridge.

448
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,540
Ice ice baby.

449
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,580
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

450
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,980
Now I have to think that I, that I pissed off any part of my team who may

451
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,620
listen to this, forget to mention it.

452
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,660
So one thing I should mention is so maybe it goes right into my next topic,

453
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:16,260
which is my new team is of those 80 people I added almost all of them are

454
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,750
in Europe, a few, I have a few more in Montreal, but I've added 50 plus in

455
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:29,390
Denmark and, uh, another 20 in Brighton, England, and then a few sprinkled in

456
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,070
Montreal and around the rest of the world.

457
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:32,270
Nice.

458
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:39,460
So you're doing a good job on, on making sure you're hiring people in, into nice

459
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,900
places to, to spend, uh, uh, expense budget on to fly out.

460
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,100
Right.

461
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,900
Here's the deal.

462
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,420
Um, for some reason, I don't think it's, I don't know if it's been

463
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:53,700
because they think we won't go out in the sun and enjoy ourselves and work more,

464
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,740
but unity is highly concentrated in.

465
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,620
All say Northern locales.

466
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:06,180
We do have a San Francisco office, but Copenhagen, Finland, England, Seattle,

467
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,260
we, we air on the side of North.

468
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,820
We don't have Costa Rica, Hawaii, New Zealand.

469
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,780
So you need to create a, like a, a, a sub in like, like, a, like, a, like,

470
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,060
a sub in like Cancun maybe, maybe.

471
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:29,260
Uh, so I do have to say that I have had a lot of people in the new work or who are

472
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,060
a part of the, the, uh, what would I call it?

473
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,860
The, my new peeps, the new people in the org have not only have they reached out to

474
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,140
chat to me, which has been great.

475
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:42,980
Cause I actually, I can be somewhat proactive.

476
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:46,260
I mean, I've already, I have regular one-on-ones with my new directs challenge.

477
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,420
Number one, we can talk about, we can go in in these, you want

478
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,740
challenge number one, 15 direct reports right now.

479
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,780
I can talk about how I'm dealing with that.

480
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,700
Not horrible, not great.

481
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,100
Challenge number two already accomplished is I have now set up not recurring yet,

482
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,260
but at least I have some meetings on the calendar with all of my skip level

483
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:08,500
managers so I can meet with all the leads I haven't talked with before.

484
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,260
But I've been pleasantly surprised that I've already had a good handful of

485
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,420
people reach out to me and say, Hey, we should chat.

486
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,380
And inevitably when I chat with them, they've already done an appropriate

487
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,900
amount of internet stalking.

488
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,420
I had talked to a person this morning who said, Hey, I listened to your podcast,

489
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,540
got halfway through and I thought, no, I'm going to wait until I talk to you.

490
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,820
And then I'm going to go back and listen so I can get to know you better.

491
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:35,540
And what I'm finding is other people have either read staff, listen to podcasts,

492
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,180
see what I've come, see where I've come from.

493
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,700
A lot of alignment.

494
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,220
They go, Hey, I like the way you think.

495
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,380
And I said, I don't really think myself.

496
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,940
I just highlight what I already see, which I realized is a lot of my management style.

497
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,100
So anyway, challenge number one, 15 direct reports, challenge number two time zone.

498
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,100
So I start my day at six 30.

499
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,260
I am pushing hard to not start at six.

500
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,750
As you can imagine with Denmark being nine hours ahead.

501
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,600
So we have eight hours ahead in England, nine hours ahead in Denmark

502
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,240
and 10 hours ahead in Finland.

503
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,800
My six 30 to nine 30 years.

504
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,960
So it's jam packed every morning.

505
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,000
Six 30 to nine 30 every day.

506
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,980
And to make matters worse, I have a pre-plan.

507
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:20,140
I'm taking two days off to go backpacking next week.

508
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,740
So stuff's going to get crammed in a little bit.

509
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,420
The week after is all sorts of triple booking.

510
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,180
But I have a, I have an EA who will take care of figuring all that out.

511
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,860
But I do have calendar jam.

512
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:32,940
It's not,

513
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:37,460
Did you say, I'm sorry, did you say you're working six 30 to nine 30?

514
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,820
Well, no, I'm working, I started at six 30, but my meeting,

515
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,820
I usually get some breaks, some gaps beginning about nine 30,

516
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:48,500
six 30 to nine 30 every morning is every morning.

517
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,260
OK, not six 30 a.m. to nine 30 at night.

518
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,820
No, the good news is for those of you going, hey, dude, is

519
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,740
I do stop every day at three 30 or earlier.

520
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:03,270
Oh, so you're still managing to work a a normalish day.

521
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,910
Normalish.

522
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,550
It's a little more than eight hours a day.

523
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,550
But I also practice work life blend.

524
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,390
Like if I have an hour break, I'm off taking the dog a walk.

525
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,710
If I have an hour and a half break, I'm running off to the gym

526
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,150
where someone can completely disregard mask rules and just be a dick.

527
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,750
But that's a different story.

528
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,390
But I blend that time versus work a solid day.

529
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,710
It's the new way of working from home.

530
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:28,590
So I have a number of reports and size of team to expand to.

531
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:31,550
And the challenges are just I guess I mentioned a little bit last time

532
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,310
how to make a connection with everyone.

533
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:38,510
I am going to I believe it or not, I think I am this close

534
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,750
to getting approval from our people that control these things

535
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,390
to be able to go to Copenhagen for a week because in just adding 50 people there,

536
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,670
that I think the best thing I can do is just go spend a week there

537
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,900
and hang out with people.

538
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,100
Yeah, I think in in bringing other

539
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,100
other of your directs along with you would be good, too.

540
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,580
Yeah, it's tough to get right now.

541
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,780
It's tough to get permission.

542
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,780
I think at this stage, I'll just go this time.

543
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,220
I think it to give them all a chance to either learn to trust me a little bit

544
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,420
or learn to hate me, but they won't be in the middle, at least.

545
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,160
At least I'll know where I stand.

546
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,680
Yeah, ambiguity is the worst.

547
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,700
I agree with that.

548
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:22,500
One of the things I was so the one thing that was the worst for me.

549
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,740
So there was years ago where I was the dotted line manager

550
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:35,400
of a person in in Hyderabad, which is nearly literally,

551
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,560
you know, one half a day apart.

552
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,550
And that was difficult.

553
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:47,150
That was difficult because we we had to trade off

554
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:55,630
between. So what we did is we we every week we swapped between

555
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,430
morning or evening, morning or evening.

556
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,630
And I'm generally an early bird.

557
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,230
I think you are as well.

558
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,110
That's why we did the podcast originally at eight in the morning,

559
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,680
eight in the morning.

560
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,760
So when it was my turn to stay up late,

561
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,820
it was torturous.

562
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,740
There were times I'm like, it is so past my bedtime.

563
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,820
I'm just going to say, uh huh.

564
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,540
Sure. Uh huh. Sure. Sure.

565
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,940
Yeah. Interesting.

566
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,580
Because I even find just because of Zoom fatigue,

567
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:37,500
if I have a three o'clock one on one, you don't get a good one on one for me.

568
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,220
I try and limit those and just try and do meetings where I can listen

569
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,380
in late afternoon as much as I can because I get fried.

570
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,340
Yeah, I I've learned that as well.

571
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,860
Like I and there's actually some science on this one

572
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,660
that morning meetings are better.

573
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,500
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

574
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:02,380
And what I find that my happiness

575
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:07,940
is directly correlated to how many hours before I leave work

576
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,170
consistently do I have freeze.

577
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:19,470
Right. And so I can spend I can spend the last few hours before I leave,

578
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:25,870
you know, closing out all the or many of the things that I couldn't close out

579
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,790
because I was in meetings all day and day long.

580
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,040
Yep. And so ending the day with

581
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,440
with, you know, the little checks in the little box.

582
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,940
Oh, that feels so much better.

583
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,260
It does. It does.

584
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:47,260
So I want to I want to actually get to the re emphasize and put it very clearly

585
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,540
before a bit. So what advice do you have for me?

586
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,700
I mean, you know, if you've done, I don't think you've done this

587
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,180
particular challenge before, but you've been around leadership enough.

588
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,500
So I have I guess the biggest one, they just addressed one, which is

589
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:06,300
what tips do you have for when you your team in one

590
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:11,180
in a moment, in a moment in time adds 80 people?

591
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
What advice would you have for me?

592
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:21,100
I don't I don't know that I so I have I have regular advice or it's things

593
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,700
I think we've talked about before.

594
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,020
And right. The absolute key thing.

595
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,060
I'll fall back to what is what is it?

596
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:32,140
The cliche storming, forming Norman, norming.

597
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,260
Right. That's that's what you need to do.

598
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:42,830
You need to very rapidly lay down principles that identify

599
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:47,190
or that construct an intrinsic team identity.

600
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,620
Like what is your the identity for your organization?

601
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,740
You like here, I'm just sharing things mostly for the audience

602
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,340
because you do this naturally very well.

603
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,000
Right. You know, you're going to need rallying cries.

604
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,320
You know, you're going to need to set some principles in place.

605
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,980
You know, you're going to need to create, create freedom,

606
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:20,800
create engagement, but get people bought into the identity

607
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,770
that is associated with your missions.

608
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:29,110
When you go and you talk to those folks, I'm thinking through

609
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,430
several things that you've done here at Microsoft.

610
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:36,470
Like some of my favorite things that you did when you were running.

611
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,670
What the hell was that thing?

612
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,670
Engineering excellence.

613
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:46,230
No. So there was a period of time where you're running like a Q tech.

614
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,430
The quality, the quality and testing experts community.

615
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,350
Yeah. Q tech. That was the name of it.

616
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,190
I was like, it was similar to tag, except it was after you.

617
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,640
It was funded. Right.

618
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,640
So Q tech was interesting.

619
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,200
Like my favorite ones that you came in with were ones where

620
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,920
you just had questions. That was the only agenda.

621
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,630
You had questions and then it ended up.

622
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,830
And then you had an exercise where people could sort of come in and

623
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,110
and add value, add additional context.

624
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:29,160
And people walked out with the right identity connections.

625
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,120
And the words you didn't mention there, that's something that I believe

626
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,280
in strongly, which we have talked about before.

627
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,170
It was community. Yeah. Community.

628
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,950
I'm trying to generate community.

629
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,790
Yeah. Community.

630
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,470
I think that's actually it.

631
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,310
Right. You need to generate community

632
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:54,070
between your your future staff and that the community needs to

633
00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:00,550
be aligned to write a an employee, a mutually beneficial identity

634
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:07,160
and the identity and what I mean by mutually both both the employee

635
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,390
and the missions you're trying to take on. Right.

636
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:16,030
You want you want to generate energy with these folks, have them feel like,

637
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:18,590
OK, they're here for the right reasons.

638
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:21,630
They they can actively contribute

639
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:26,730
and that that your mission is important.

640
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,010
Yeah. Well, I find it again.

641
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:33,710
You're right. I do find purpose important and

642
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:38,590
being able to tie your work to a purpose is important,

643
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,430
which goes into I've had a couple of talks with the teams.

644
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,710
I did two hours of one for your I end up.

645
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,230
One worth mentioning is given non-overlap between West Coast,

646
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:53,630
especially in Europe, for a lot of my bigger meetings and done this before.

647
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,790
I just fully embraced it now.

648
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,950
I do a Europe and an America's version of a lot of my meetings.

649
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,700
I just did the meeting twice.

650
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,020
Well, sure. And that that makes sense. Right.

651
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,180
The other thing you can do to be fair is do the meeting.

652
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,740
Do the meeting once, record it and then switch.

653
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,420
So I switch between the audience.

654
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,300
So last week, right after the rework, I did two full hours of AMAs,

655
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,700
one for Europe, one for America's.

656
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,780
And as I'm as you can tell from my reading between the lines,

657
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,140
my is a shift in my work. My org is mostly European now.

658
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:31,380
Great questions, a great way to learn to begin to earn some trust on the team.

659
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,700
And then something I've done for a while is that every other week I do

660
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,220
an all hands and don't call it an all hands.

661
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,580
I just call it a just a team biweekly.

662
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,330
I half hour of just whatever I think is relevant.

663
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,980
So the goal behind this is I led with for this first one with everybody.

664
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,300
There is the reason behind this meeting is and you can probably relate to this.

665
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:57,740
I've been in jobs in my life and against all Microsoft to compare with,

666
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,940
where I didn't know what was going on.

667
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,900
Nobody told me why decisions were being made. I knew nothing.

668
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,860
It was hard to do good work because I could not get purpose from my work.

669
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,060
I didn't know why what I was doing was important.

670
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:13,700
And then other times when I had some more transparency,

671
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,060
I enjoyed my work more and because I enjoyed it more, I did better work.

672
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,660
So the purpose beyond this meeting that I've done for a while is transparency.

673
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,020
And the agenda is easy.

674
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,100
I think about what are the big things that going on with my day today

675
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,740
that the rest of my organization may not know about.

676
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,540
And we talk about that.

677
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:37,620
And it's everything from sometimes it's planning.

678
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,780
It's how we do promos, how we do budget, things that your frontline manager,

679
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,580
frontline IC may not know about, just so nothing's hidden.

680
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,260
Something I've thought about, one of the perks I recommend going back

681
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,740
to the previous topic is more open meetings.

682
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,740
A lot of people at Unity have closed calendars.

683
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,340
You can't see what's on them.

684
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,340
My calendar is wide open, but I think I want to invite people to not one on ones,

685
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,500
of course, but there's a meeting.

686
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,900
I think most of my meetings, I can actually invite people

687
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,180
if they want to come in and listen, I can make that an optional thing they can do.

688
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:12,060
But back on the other subject is we just talked about the culture I want to have,

689
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,140
which is something I mentioned before.

690
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:18,380
It's something I they get now or they're getting with the new folks

691
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,180
transparency, accountability and psychological safety.

692
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,780
He went deep into those.

693
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,380
But one bit of culture shock I got, which is interesting

694
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:30,620
from some of the people is a very interesting and I think OK,

695
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:35,500
culture shock to have is their reactions to their first week in the org has been.

696
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,580
Oh, my God, this is so transparent.

697
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,850
I'm not used to this, which I will take.

698
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:48,360
Yeah, I view that as a positive.

699
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:51,500
Yeah, I'm going to take that one for good.

700
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:54,020
There is such a thing as over transparent.

701
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,390
But in this case, like the way you tell the story, I don't want the talk.

702
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:08,070
You know, whenever I join a first like I have a I have my first speech.

703
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:12,660
Whenever I join a team or whenever I get a new hire,

704
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:22,380
like the the the very first speech I have with them is that I just I'm just transparent.

705
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:28,060
I'm like, look, I am going to do everything I can in my power.

706
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,740
I'm telling you in words right now, but I'm going to tell you

707
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,020
that my actions will follow up.

708
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,740
I am going to work hard to earn your trust.

709
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:48,810
I the I have found that gaining the trust of my organization

710
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:57,620
repeatedly is the path towards greatness.

711
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,020
Yes, yes, yes. And I talked about this is this is Lynch.

712
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,060
He only has five dysfunctions of a team without trust.

713
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,340
You can't have conflict.

714
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,220
And what I call conflict is the ability to drive for alignment,

715
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:09,860
the ability to disagree without trust.

716
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:13,060
You can't have a meaningful, meaningful decision making.

717
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:18,180
And without that, you can't have accountability or you can't have buy in

718
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,060
because people aren't bought in because they don't feel like their voice has been heard.

719
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,380
Without that, you can't people aren't going to feel accountable.

720
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:26,420
And if people don't feel accountable, you're not going to get results.

721
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,180
So, yeah, one gazillion percent degree.

722
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,660
And you'll you'll I kind of disagree with the last one.

723
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,860
You'll get results.

724
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,220
Right.

725
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,180
Okay. All right.

726
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,220
But it is a man.

727
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,100
So I'll tell them I'll tell them why.

728
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,060
So you and I have talked about this many a times around,

729
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,820
you know, where ideas come from and the difficulties of knowledge work.

730
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,980
Right. But if you don't have earned if you haven't earned their trust, right,

731
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:02,100
as the as a leader, and in your case, I say it was even worse, right?

732
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,380
Essentially, you're a senior executive at Uniti now.

733
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,540
And as as that, if you haven't earned the trust of your folks

734
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:17,460
and you need to derive results at the end of the day, certain decisions you may or may not

735
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,340
have to make. I did like I know unity is a little unique.

736
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:28,390
But if decisions are made in an organization doesn't have trust,

737
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:36,150
then you can't rely on the intelligence of the hundreds of people underneath you

738
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:43,350
to come to you when it's necessary to inform you that your idea is stupid as hell.

739
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,870
Right. You don't have with because you need psychological safety.

740
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:51,110
This is why transparency and accountability and psychological safety to me go together.

741
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,830
And I told them flat out. I said, I can tell you all day

742
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,710
that I'm a good guy and you should trust me.

743
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:00,230
But you totally shouldn't because you don't know me yet.

744
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:03,750
So here's here's the walk. Here's the here's the talk.

745
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:09,110
I want to walk and we're just going to have to practice this until we learn to trust each other.

746
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,390
We'll get there. But, you know, everybody's going to get there at their own pace.

747
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:15,990
That's all I can do for now. And then and in the meantime,

748
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:20,070
walk the talk and slowly get people on board.

749
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:23,910
Some people are there already. Some people will take months and that's

750
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:26,470
or maybe even longer. That's fine. That's my job.

751
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:33,140
Yeah. The the thing for me. So I don't ever tell my staff this.

752
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,660
Right. I view it as it's my job to earn their trust.

753
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:43,820
And what I don't tell them is they have my trust immediately

754
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:48,810
because I think that is the way to to lead by example.

755
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:54,470
Right. And so for me is trust is immediately granted.

756
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:59,830
Until repeatedly shown it's not dessert.

757
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:05,990
Yeah. Right. But I tell my employees I want them to treat me exactly the opposite.

758
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:12,470
I am the worst evil pointy haired manager until I prove otherwise.

759
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:19,110
Yeah. The overlap to that is I know I've mentioned on the podcast that Maxwell's

760
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,670
five levels of leadership. I'm going into the first two.

761
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:25,270
First, you're put in a position of leadership. And that's what I've been given with this

762
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:30,710
new org. But then I need to get people to give me permission to lead them.

763
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,440
And that's really just trust. And that's what I'm working on right now.

764
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,620
100% truth. Maybe 110.

765
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:44,120
Oh, but as a data scientist, you know, that's not actually possible. 110%.

766
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,660
You can have things be more than 100%.

767
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,700
But as a human, I can only give you 100%.

768
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,470
No.

769
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,500
I only have 100% to give.

770
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:00,780
It depends on if it's relative.

771
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,900
And on this episode of the Spinal Tap version of A-B testing.

772
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:11,340
But my effort goes to 11. All right. So, okay.

773
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:16,300
This will be an ongoing, probably not every episode, just, and you're welcome.

774
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:21,980
But interesting challenge where I'm at. And I'm excited to see where it goes.

775
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,540
And for those of you in my new org, listening to me babble on here for the first time,

776
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,820
I apologize and I'm sorry, and we'll talk more. And you can tell me all the things that you don't

777
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,660
believe or don't like us totally fine. Or you don't have to listen. I don't make people listen.

778
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,060
Yeah. I kind of prefer when my staff doesn't listen.

779
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,980
I know. It kind of freaks me out when people I know listen to the podcast.

780
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:52,170
Yeah. For me, it's easy. Oh, sorry.

781
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:56,090
Some people say, Hey, I listened to episode 146. What was that about? I said,

782
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,050
I don't remember whatever was on my mind.

783
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:03,100
Yeah. Yeah. All right, dude. I got to go to a meeting.

784
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:05,260
Yeah. I got to go too. Thanks for the time. Once again,

785
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,540
episode 149. The next one's the big 150. I'm Alan.

786
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,460
I'm Brett. We'll see you later.
