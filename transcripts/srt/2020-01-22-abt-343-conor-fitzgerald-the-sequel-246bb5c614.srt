00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,510
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,550
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started.

4
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:28,540
Hello, and welcome back to ABT 343. I'm joined. This is not a repeat. If you've already heard

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,060
the awesome episode with Connor Fitzgerald, it was so awesome. We had him back again.

6
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,140
Hi, Alan. And hello to the other two listeners.

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,460
Perfect. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us again. We talked for a while last time

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,940
and I think we both had more to talk about. So I'm glad to have you back.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,340
Delighted to be back. The last podcast was my first time being interviewed for a podcast

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,340
and I'm on the Slack channel. A lot of people were asking, could we do a second round,

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,020
which I was quite surprised with, with Delighted with a course. So it's great to be back for

12
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,700
round two of the modern testing podcast with yourself.

13
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,540
All right. I have some more questions for you, three more to be exact with potential

14
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,860
bonus questions to throw in there, but we'll start with three. Are you ready to go?

15
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,860
Sure.

16
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,820
All right. When we talked last time, we talked about how you use modern testing in your current

17
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,460
role. Four of the other two listeners, could you recommend one key change they should do if they

18
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,580
want to start to use modern testing in their current role?

19
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:38,090
Yeah, for me, it's critical you stop being the gatekeeper. That's a very challenging thing to

20
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,430
change, especially if you've been testing for a long time as a traditional tester. But as long

21
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:48,390
as you are the gatekeeper, quality, quality, nothing will ever change. And that's directly

22
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,270
rated to principle three. Principle three being we are forced with continuous improvement,

23
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:58,310
helping the team adapt and optimize in order to succeed rather than providing a safety net to catch

24
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,010
failures. So if you're always the safety net, the second part of the principle, then you'll never

25
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:09,820
get the benefits of the first part of the principle. And I guess from chatting to you in

26
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,100
the first interview, we spoke about the fact that through some painful lessons, I started to

27
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,340
learn that being a gatekeeper doesn't work and the team based testing was the solution.

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,740
And there's a couple of other things I can talk about here, maybe we can dip in an

29
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,820
algorithm if you want, but it's kind of like the pain or the negativity of being a gatekeeper,

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,940
the positive side of changing and then how do you do change. So we can start to touch in

31
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,220
on those points if you'd like.

32
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,420
Yeah, I want to do that because I think a lot of people, there are testers out there not to

33
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,780
listen to the podcast, unfortunately, but I run across them on Twitter or especially LinkedIn,

34
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,980
where they're happy for some reason to be the gatekeeper. And Brent and I talked about a weird

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,180
codependency there, but can you talk more about that pain of being a gatekeeper and what you've

36
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,220
seen happen there?

37
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,620
The turning point for me was after being on a very painful project that failed. And then

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,140
during a period of reflection reading the book, lessons learned in software testing,

39
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,060
and some of the things that made me realize was firstly, when you're a safety net,

40
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,940
it means others aren't learning about testing or gaining valuable product knowledge.

41
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,940
And on a personal level, I don't know that people realize that maybe they don't, but it is a huge

42
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,420
burden for testers. It can be isolating being the gatekeeper, and it can be quite stressful

43
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,450
for them in the workplace. And if you are that safety net, then you in turn are,

44
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,930
or if you're the gatekeeper, you're more likely to be a bottleneck potentially because the

45
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,800
activity of testing is not shared, then it's most likely that other activities aren't shared

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,860
either, such as writing automation. And there's loads of data to show that high performing teams

47
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,500
along with developers working on the automation. I believe that was an accelerate, I think they

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:58,420
got the data from the state of DevOps reports. And I guess why those teams perform better is

49
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,780
because the developers are much more aware of the product and the various challenges when

50
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,500
they have to go and automate it. And it probably helps with things like testability. And a related

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,580
topic to that, what I found in the past is when you're the gatekeeper, the decision to release

52
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,620
software or not can be quite confrontational, rather than with team based testing is collaborative.

53
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,740
So when you're a gatekeeper, the tester can sometimes be blocking the release rather than

54
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,300
when it's more collaborative and it's a discussion. And I've never had a problem in the last number

55
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,460
of years when we use mobbing and bug bashing and things like that, the team just say this

56
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:37,380
software is good enough now or not to be released. And there's no problem. And one other thing I

57
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,700
think is around bias, a quote from you on Alan Fitter recently was, if testers say we are the

58
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,980
only ones who care about quality, it excludes everyone else. And I know the opinion that it's

59
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:55,220
highly risky to not include others in testing. As testers were test specialists, we bring a lot

60
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:01,460
to the party, but we have biases the same as everyone else. So by working with others,

61
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,660
we're getting a wider diversity in our testing and thus reducing the risk of our own biases.

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,720
So that's my side on the pain or negative side of being a gatekeeper.

63
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,840
Yeah, I had a lot of flashbacks. I remember being a gatekeeper. I remember working for test

64
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,440
managers who blocked or wanted to block the release. I worked with the dev manager once who

65
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,440
said the primary role of the test team was to sign off on release. Wow.

66
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:40,900
Wow. That's great. Yeah. So yeah. And of course, what Brent and I say is a gatekeeper is a bottleneck.

67
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,980
Yeah. And as you know, in modern testing, we don't like bottlenecks. We borrow heavily from lean.

68
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:51,860
Yeah, indeed. Yeah, like lean. And I was even watching your videos and Coderdojo today,

69
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,700
and it brought me back to a book. I read a couple of years ago to gold, which is a very nice

70
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:02,980
bottle. Yes. Nice book of open next. We were just having a discussion. The meeting I was in before

71
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:11,140
we chatted was a dive into unity details, but a retrospective with another team outside of my org.

72
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,340
And I messaged someone in Slack during the meeting and said, you ever read the Phoenix project?

73
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,780
This team is Brent and not Brent Jensen, Brent, the bottle, the human bottleneck from the Phoenix

74
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:33,930
project. Let's move on. Uh, this is a fun one. Some people, and we've talked about the controversial

75
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:40,250
principles and some people consider at least one, usually two of the modern testing principles to be

76
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,410
to have some level of controversy, uh, especially principle number seven,

77
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,850
which is very carefully worded, but it says that you may not need dedicated testing specialists.

78
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,570
What do you think, uh, do you have any opinions on controversy in the principles?

79
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,850
Yeah, like, so I guess one that does cause a little bit of controversy is that the customers

80
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,810
don't even can, uh, determine quality. But I think the one that probably causes more controversy

81
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,850
is probably seven. Um, as you were saying, which is, you know, uh, we expand testing

82
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:16,970
abilities and know how across the team understand this may reduce or eliminate the need for

83
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:23,300
dedicating tests as specialists. So to me, principle seven is actually something to aspire to, which

84
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,100
was interesting for me when I was listening to the podcasts and listening to those in depth

85
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:34,660
conversation you did to me, I did wasn't controversial. And if you eliminate the

86
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,380
need for dedicating tests as testing specialists, you have actually been successful in a role.

87
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:43,700
Essentially you've helped that team ensure their self is sufficient at the activity of testing.

88
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,060
And if you achieve that, you will be in demand. Your current company won't want to lose you

89
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,460
and other companies will want you. And I think it's worth noting that often it may be the word

90
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,540
reduced rather than eliminated in that teams, even when they're doing team-based testing,

91
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:03,500
they'll often look to you as the dedicated, uh, specialist to help tweak and fine tune them,

92
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,260
help out with the retros, uh, help facilitate those bulk bashes, whatever it may be.

93
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,580
Um, and even if you get to the point that you eliminated, it may still be that you're doing a

94
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:16,940
great job. But I guess on the subject of being controversial, soft test Dublin last year,

95
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:22,380
there's a speaker, uh, John Paul, uh, Farik, I hope I got his name right. And, uh, he works

96
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,340
at Rabobank and he's a big fan of the modern testing and he did the keynote and his keynote

97
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,340
was actually on modern testing and his talk was to have testers or not to have testers.

98
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,340
And it's probably one of the best, uh, talks I heard last year at a conference and it really

99
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,060
made me reflect afterwards that for traditional testers, probably principle seven probably

100
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:46,380
strikes fear rather than controversy for them in that the fear of change and feared that

101
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,860
their role is changing. And I guess that can be very hard for some people.

102
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,700
When Brent and I started talking about modern testing and modern testing principles,

103
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:01,420
it wasn't to create fear. It was because of the fear. Yes. We wanted to provide some tools

104
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,860
and wording and discussion to help people navigate how software development was changing.

105
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,380
I'm going to shove in a side question here. I think this is related that fear of change,

106
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:19,740
especially among traditional testers. We saw this, there's always been change in testing when all of

107
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:26,140
a sudden 15 years ago, Microsoft and a bunch of other companies decided all the testers needed to

108
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:31,260
know how to code. There was this fear that people thought we could automate everything,

109
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,820
but I don't think anybody's ever really thought we could automate everything. And you've heard my

110
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,260
tautology statement on this. We should automate 100% of the tests that should be automated.

111
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,980
Very sensible. The test design, the test design challenge is figuring out where those

112
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,700
hundred percent are. Yeah. So here's the side question with that setup. Last night I was in a,

113
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,580
I was tired and I opened up Twitter and happened to open it up right up to someone have an

114
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,980
argument that I'm going to paraphrase it. I think they're already mad at me on Twitter. I've been

115
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,300
afraid to look, but without calling them out, all I said was something to the effect of

116
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,760
I opened Twitter and saw another argument about how all testing can't be automated.

117
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,960
I'm not mad about the argument. I'm just wonder how I got to 1997 and why Twitter still works.

118
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,080
I think that statement, the first half of that statement comes from some fear of,

119
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:30,420
if we don't have testers, we'll try and automate all the testing and that will, and of course,

120
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,910
we can't do that. We can automate all the tests and we can automate all the tests that should be

121
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,630
automated. Where does the rest of that testing come from in your world? How does testing happen

122
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:44,070
if there are no dedicated testers? So the organization at the moment,

123
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:50,630
there isn't a tester in each team. So some teams have a dedicated tester and others don't,

124
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:58,630
but the team still do the activities of testing. So they bake in the quality as they go. So they're

125
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:04,550
testing together when they're doing their mobbing sessions through the code reviews. And they've

126
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:10,950
taken responsibility for automation that was written actually by a dedicated test specialist

127
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,630
in the past. So they've taken over a lot of those activities. They, from time to time,

128
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:21,910
do look outside and would ask to have conversations with a dedicated test

129
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,990
being specialist, or for the greater part, their self-contained team. And from my part,

130
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:33,350
from my observation of them, the quality of the software they produce seems to be very good.

131
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,230
You knew the answer I was going for and you already answered it, I think, in the first question

132
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,950
is, by the time you don't need a dedicated testing specialist, it isn't because you've

133
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:51,510
automated all the tests. It means it's because the team does enough testing on their own,

134
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:59,190
of all types, that they don't need that specialist to do it for them. And that's the part that gets

135
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,710
lost. The point we want to keep on driving home is why not having testers doesn't mean

136
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:11,110
you're not doing testing. Yeah, definitely. And I guess you seem, from listening to you over time,

137
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,740
I think we think similarly on this point is all which is related in that testers, I've worked with

138
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,620
some excellent people who do automation testing, or probably with no other test tests,

139
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,020
who are excellent at their role. But for the greater part, testers are skill set, are better

140
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,500
placed outside automation for the greater part. And that being working with developers, for

141
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,940
example, to write the test, so that developers write the test, or at least help guide them in

142
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:46,380
writing the code, is a much better use of the resource of a tester. So working picking out what

143
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,860
are the valuable tests, because you were talking about the tests that need to be done. So testers

144
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,260
will be very good at picking up personas and user journeys, finding those critical paths often,

145
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,060
ones maybe that are tied to revenues, and saying these are the most critical things we should

146
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,580
automate. And then working with a developer to write really reliable, good quality automation

147
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,620
that you can trust. And similarly, for your alerting and other things working with developers

148
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,900
or working with people from an SRE or DevOps background to get these things in place is much

149
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:22,540
better use of a testing specialist. You have been, as I've announced on the podcast before,

150
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,700
I'm doing far fewer conference presentations. I did one last year, I'll probably do one this year.

151
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,420
But you, on the other hand, have been doing a reasonable amount of speaking over the last

152
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:43,300
few years. And I'm curious how modern testing and what you've learned and what you've practiced has

153
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,500
influenced what you speak about at conferences. Yeah, sure. So maybe give you a little savor

154
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:54,980
what I've been speaking about. And we can see it was anti interesting in there. So I guess I'm

155
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,540
relatively new to speaking at conferences. I've spoken at about five today. And I've spoken on

156
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,820
three broad categories. The first is how we can learn from other industries and disciplines,

157
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,340
learning from aviation, healthcare, economics, the world of business, for example, marketing.

158
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,660
The second broad category is Kanban. I never talk Kanban from a testers perspective. But ultimately,

159
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,220
it's a story of two teams using Kanban for the first time in the challenges they faced and the

160
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:31,110
benefits it brought them. And the third one is one Robert Meaney and I delivered many listeners

161
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,990
will probably know, Rob, and we delivered a talk called Experimenting our way to team based testing,

162
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:46,580
which was a reflection on three years together in Pablo working together. And I've also delivered

163
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,780
number talks at the ministry testing Cork meetup, and Rob and I kind of folk found it or got that

164
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,620
off the ground back in 2017. And we've done a mix of solo and joint talks with Rob there. So we've

165
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,420
done things like exploratory testing, heuristics and a few more technical ones as well, like how to

166
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,300
test microservices and an introduction to automation. But I guess what's interesting for you is, I

167
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,460
spoke at Test Bash Brighton, the year after you after you delivered the modern testing

168
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:20,140
principles talk. And you'll be glad to know included two modern testing principles in my talk,

169
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,420
which was principles two and six. When I was speaking about how we can use models and about

170
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:30,060
how we can use data. How was I have a couple questions about that. And actually, I'm probably

171
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,940
even more interested in the Kanban talks, we're going to come back there. But to start off with,

172
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,820
about a little bit more context around maybe what you talked about with principles two and

173
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,060
six. And then if there was any feedback around that, that would be interesting to share for

174
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,420
the listeners. Yeah, I guess it was I think a little bit of feedback because some people

175
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,260
at the conference weren't word modern testing principles. So they were interested to talk a

176
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,500
little bit more about it. So I talked about principle two, because I talked about when I

177
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,860
was studying business, part time a couple years ago, one of the subjects I loved was marketing.

178
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,260
I'm actually a really, really good at their various models. They have a model for everything.

179
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:17,610
And anybody can just look at their model and quickly analyze what it means.

180
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,690
So what I said is that something that we can learn as testers that I'm a big fan of modeling,

181
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,050
whether that being architectural diagrams are using something like a mind map.

182
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,130
Anything that kind of visually represents what a system looks like. And then related to that as

183
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:42,010
well was that when I was doing the same business course, I was also studying e commerce. And I was

184
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:51,020
fascinated with the use data to figure out how people work through the systems in that what point

185
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,420
in a transaction do people leave the landing page? What point do they leave the cart? Do they leave

186
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:04,580
the payments page? And they use data to figure out where they left and they use the term like these

187
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:10,660
personas and the terms user journeys. And I found it fascinating at the time that I was trying to

188
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,620
write at that point in time, I was trying to automate all the things. And I started to realize

189
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,300
that if I kind of encompass some of the principles from e commerce and focus on personas and user

190
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,860
journeys and the most important things to automate, that there's a lot to be got there. So what I was

191
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:31,860
trying to do in summary there was trying to articulate the importance of point six is the

192
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,220
use of data and use that to actually try to help you figure out what you should automate.

193
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,700
And also things like figure out should you work on a feature or should you retire a feature and all

194
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,820
those good things. It's an interesting I wrote down my questions this time, so I wouldn't forget.

195
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:53,140
One thing that's worked out, I think not intentionally, but also not surprisingly,

196
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:01,540
is the interplay and the interaction between the principles. And you're 100% correct in

197
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,700
principle number two is about understanding the system and trying to figure out the system and

198
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,180
how it works so we can understand where the if we don't understand the system, we can't find the

199
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,420
bottlenecks, we can't optimize it. So two goes into three there. But with data with customer

200
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,100
data, analytic data, that gives us an even better, more accurate view of the system and how it

201
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:29,140
works. Yes. So that's it's I like thinking about it that way. It reminds me also those believe it

202
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:37,240
or not of the question I was going to ask earlier, a lot of people, even people who don't know about

203
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,480
or care about the modern testing principles, do agree that testing is a learning activity.

204
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,600
And does it doesn't mean that testers are the only people that learn because as you and I know,

205
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,320
anyone can do testing. And somebody's gonna yell at me for saying that. But you know what I mean.

206
00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:01,800
Yes. And but that activity is done well, is a inquisitive learning discovery.

207
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:10,280
Trying to learn the system is part of that. Yes. It's understanding what it is we're testing, I think,

208
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:16,680
I don't think anybody, any of the names in the industry would disagree. That's important.

209
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,600
The thing I want to bring up in, in regards to the previous question, which fits in well here,

210
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:31,110
is that pairing with other people, developers, product managers and talking about what are we

211
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:37,030
making? Who is it for? What can go wrong? And having those discussions also helps us understand

212
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:44,710
the system or understand where the risk places the areas of risk may be in the system in order to

213
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,790
get a better grasp on the system and have a better idea of what we need to do to alleviate

214
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:55,750
that risk. Wheels within wheels, it all fits together rather nicely. It does indeed.

215
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:00,790
Let me go on a little bit before we close. I want to talk because I'm a big fan of

216
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:09,380
Kanban and I could go on a preachy thing on why I like it. But I kind of want to hear a couple of

217
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,860
your big takeaways and from your talk, like what were some of the main points? Like what

218
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:19,860
were your big takeaways from your, from what you learned using Kanban and that, that maybe

219
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,060
everyone should know about? Well, there is, yeah, it was quite, I got a lot more feedback after

220
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:30,340
this talk at Test Bash Manchester than I think I did at the other talk at Brighton. And

221
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,660
some of the things I focused on was just some of the things that people liked and then told about

222
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,100
was moving across the Kanban board from right to left, rather than left to right. And have a focus

223
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,540
on finishing things rather than starting new things. That was one thing that people really

224
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:55,770
liked. And another main thing was that we used an acceptance queue. And initially, when I started,

225
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:04,470
one of the teams that became a bottleneck. And that was a really helpful thing going back to the

226
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:09,430
gatekeeper that we realized the acceptance queue was the bottleneck. There was one of me and

227
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:14,550
there were several developers. So we started to change things around. I started work with the

228
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:22,040
developers earlier, which meant there was more testing done in the earlier lanes. But on top of

229
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,840
that, we changed the rules that anyone could test anything in the acceptance queue, as long as they

230
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:33,480
had not developed it. And that made a big difference. And that's really what helped us shift to

231
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:40,280
team-based testing. And I know that some people see an acceptance queue as a bottleneck in its

232
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:45,240
own right. But the acceptance queue wasn't there to be a bottleneck. It was there to be...

233
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:51,780
It had a purpose. And the purpose really for us was that we mocked up a lot of data in the early

234
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:58,820
testing on the developer's systems. And the idea for us for the acceptance queue was to test it

235
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,030
on a real environment and make sure everything was okay before we pushed that button and got it out

236
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:12,950
to production. So yeah, there were two key things in it, moving from right to left, and then

237
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,150
how we tackled the acceptance queue. And the interesting thing was when I went to work with

238
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:19,990
the second team then, they initially didn't want an acceptance queue because in the past,

239
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,480
they had seen it as a bottleneck. Well, because of my experience in the first team, they took my

240
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,400
advice essentially and worked with me and we put in the acceptance queue. And I really think it

241
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,080
helped create that culture of team-based testing in that second team as well.

242
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Two rules of Kanban are the main two rules are limit your work in progress and visualize your

243
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:45,240
work. Yeah. Usually stated in the opposite direction. So Kanban, your last statement there

244
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:53,080
is what Kanban is for. It shows you where your bottlenecks are. Yeah. And there's two big

245
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:59,880
reasons I like Kanban. One is it's an easy way to immediately find or very quickly find

246
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,840
what are the bottlenecks in your process. And you can figure out what to do to mitigate those

247
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,020
so they aren't a bottleneck anymore. I see a lot of teams use Kanban, but not really enforce

248
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,260
work in progress. But in your case, it's a great example because you have, because of that acceptance

249
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:22,020
queue and the fact that anyone can test that people are in order to be able to do more work,

250
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,620
they can go help out doing the testing for a piece of work to free up a spot in the queue

251
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,620
for the next thing, which is great. Yeah. It's driving all of the right behavior.

252
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,420
The other thing I like, and I'll talk about a little bit and then we can close out here, is

253
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,900
I think the conversations around Kanban, I like a lot more than what I call the scrum zombie dance.

254
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:46,260
Yeah. Where you have scrum and people, yesterday I worked on the thing, today I'm doing the thing,

255
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,220
I'm not blocked on anything. And the next day they come to their scrum stand up, they sit down

256
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,460
and they say, yesterday I did the thing, today I'm doing the thing, I'm not blocked on anything.

257
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,460
And what that sounds like is they don't care, they're not blocked. So when I do

258
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:06,580
scrum standups, the question is easy. What do you need to do to move this ticket to the right?

259
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,890
Then I get the details I actually need. I know why they're still working on that thing. I know

260
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:19,530
what we can do as a team to help them if needed. It's just, to me, it's a much more powerful

261
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,810
conversation. And of course, if you do scrum well and you have a good scrum master,

262
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:31,050
you can get past that scrum zombie syndrome. But I've had a lot of luck just with that question in

263
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,290
Kanban meetings. It works well for me. Your mileage may vary.

264
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,610
Yeah. I fully agree with you. That's one of the great things about it. Because I went from

265
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:46,330
waterfall environments to scrum and a couple of projects and companies. And then when I joined

266
00:24:47,290 --> 00:24:51,290
my most recent role, I really wanted to use Kanban. And all the things you're saying,

267
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:56,410
it works like visualizing the work, which is the first thing you're going to do to get it implemented.

268
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,650
But also as well, how it changes the standup. Because it's another improvement to move away

269
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:05,930
from scrum what I did yesterday, what I'm going to do today. And instead talk to the board and

270
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:12,170
talk about getting things unblocked and moving things to done. And that's not a powerful change.

271
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,410
When you're moving the board from right to left, it's powerful. But changing the standup

272
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:22,570
to talk to the board and not talk about individual's activities is a big shift for me.

273
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,530
Yeah, it highlights what everybody's doing.

274
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,890
Anyway, our Kanban love fest cannot go on forever.

275
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:38,550
Ping us on slack and we'll go on. Any final words, other things you want to mention?

276
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:45,670
I will be covering my Kanban talk. I will be covering of the Kanban other subjects soon,

277
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,630
but at Agile in Ireland this year, which is a big Agile conference in Dublin, I'm going to talk

278
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:58,790
about the learnings from the aviation industry. So if anybody is in the Dublin area and enjoys

279
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,990
all things Agile, look me up and maybe you might like to attend a conference.

280
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,540
Awesome. I'll try and dig up a link to that, a website to that and put them in the notes.

281
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,100
And I do like to see that I think we're seeing a trend of a lot of things around

282
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:23,900
modern testing, Agile starting to see more testers who are, it should just be anecdotal or

283
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:30,380
recency bias, but I'm seeing folks in the modern testing community out there speaking at non-testing

284
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,420
conferences about quality things. I think that's really cool.

285
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,900
Yeah, it's really cool. Yeah, my good buddy, Rob, Mimi is similar to me. He's very eager to speak

286
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,340
at non-testing conferences, but they get our thoughts around testing out there into other

287
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,780
disciplines like DevOps conferences and Agile conferences, if we can get out there into those

288
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:53,500
kind of conferences as well and start to share our thoughts on testing and the interactions you get

289
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,140
with people are brilliant. There's a conference in Cork every year called RebelCon, and I spoke

290
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,780
about that last year. The connections you get with all the different disciplines at these kind

291
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,980
of conferences is wonderful. It kind of shares your own knowledge and thoughts on testing and

292
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,380
probably generally how we develop and develop software as a whole.

293
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:20,920
I totally agree. Excellent. Thank you for doing yet another ABT343. I think our listeners,

294
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,520
we just love to have you back every week, but we'll take a break from you for a while.

295
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:30,120
We'll have you back soon. But like I said last time, I love hearing stories like this,

296
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,320
and I hope our listeners love them as much as I do. Thanks again for being on the show.

297
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,660
Thank you, Alan. All right. We'll see you.
