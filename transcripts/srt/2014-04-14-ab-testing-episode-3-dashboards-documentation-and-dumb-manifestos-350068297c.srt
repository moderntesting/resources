1
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:22,990
Hey everybody, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're here for yet another episode of AAB testing.

2
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:29,630
I just got off the, not just got off, but last night I returned from a quick trip to Florida.

3
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,190
I think my total time away from home was about 40 hours. Talking to some college students there

4
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,070
at University of Florida in Gainesville. Great group of kids, two great groups of kids. And just

5
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,230
started talking about sort of what testing was like at Microsoft. And a lot, it was, I didn't

6
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:50,350
really know, I had some exercises. It was very data driven, which was interesting because that's

7
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,150
kind of where, you know, what Brent and I have been talking about, where a test is going.

8
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,150
He's talked a lot about data, analyzing data, how to look at data and some things like that.

9
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:04,350
So Alan normally does these events and it's been primarily around helping

10
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,710
recruiting get people into tests. So what did you find different this time around?

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,590
As the role evolves, I'm finding, you know, when we go to a recruit at universities,

12
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,030
we show them the three Microsoft roles, program management, software development,

13
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,870
and software testing. And if you were to ask them to look at those roles by title

14
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,830
and, you know, rank what they wanted to do, they go, well, I've gone to school to program.

15
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,950
So obviously I want to be a developer, but if I can't do that, I want to be a program manager

16
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,470
because they have manage in their title. And here's the real truth is that program managers

17
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,510
don't program and they don't manage. And then they look at the last one and go, well, then I'll,

18
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,110
I guess if I have to fall back on something, I'll be a tester. And we want to give recruiting a fair

19
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,430
shake, a fair chance to land candidates for the right jobs. People are going to be successful

20
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,310
in their career if they find a job that aligns with their sort of mental model and how they

21
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,110
approach things. So what we find is in these classrooms, you do have people who want to take

22
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,310
a design and implement it as, you know, as has been spec'd for them and just, you know,

23
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,550
write features. And those people make great developers. And I asked them in the class, you

24
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,590
know, if you think testing is just writing unit tests and functional tests, that's great.

25
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,820
You're probably going to make a great developer because we need people to think more system

26
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,420
thinking. I talk about program management a bit too and how it's project management plus

27
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,620
a lot of, you know, coordinating schedules, managing dependencies, looking at plans,

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,220
making sure all the pieces are kind of put together, require systems thinking and people

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,140
skills at kind of a high level. Then I talk about the role of test and what we do.

30
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,540
You all know there's a million things testers do, but I approach it a lot from

31
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,900
sort of the how we look at data and how it's a very creative job and how we solve problems

32
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,980
with code all the time. And I give them plenty of examples from my career. And then we do some

33
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,260
exercises that they can pick and choose from. They form groups and they get really engaged.

34
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,940
I was amazed how excited they were about working through some of these exercises.

35
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,940
So it was a lot of fun. It gives them some insight into what testing is at Microsoft.

36
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,300
A couple of the kids there are going to be doing internships. They're already on the books for

37
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,340
that this summer. So I'm excited about that. Excited to see them here in action.

38
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,860
And they're going to be great. So all in all, a good trip.

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,860
How many budding new data scientists did you discover?

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,580
A few, a few. And I did kind of delve into that. You used to ask people if they had

41
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,540
software testing courses, but and they do, but they're all about formal verification,

42
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,260
which is interesting, theoretically. But this time, instead of probing on that,

43
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,980
I probed on who heard about big data. And actually, one of the questions I give them

44
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,460
is analyzing a relatively small in the world of big data, but big enough to cause problems

45
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,420
at a two gig data file and talk about the challenges in that. From there, we really,

46
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,460
it's more of a discussion where they talk about strategies for parsing that,

47
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,060
knowing that that disk access is really expensive, eventually lead them to a

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,900
discussion around how MapReduce works. And one person in maybe two in the two

49
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:09,060
sessions I had had heard of that. So I said, yeah, so I said, well, something to go read up on.

50
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,580
I don't think universities changing and we like we have a lot of influence over what

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,700
universities cover. Years ago, we say we need universities to teach more testing classes,

52
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:28,530
but we still need that maybe, but we need now is we need data, data and huge data and big data

53
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,130
is becoming so much a part of how so many software teams do business.

54
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,930
That it's really important. I think that, you know, budding software engineers of any discipline

55
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,970
have these basic knowledge of statistics and how big data works, you know,

56
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,210
or if they're going to get a picture of what they're going to be doing in the industry.

57
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:53,570
So I agree. We need we need more. We need more testing classes, but in a different context,

58
00:04:53,570 --> 00:05:00,130
it's more around how to test your own code. We need more TDD type classes. We need to train

59
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,650
developers to do this upfront. But on the on the testing side, do we really need all

60
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,250
these statistics? Don't we just need people to produce great dashboards?

61
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,150
Yeah.

62
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,250
Nice. Nice. Say, great. One thing I did get to do while I was off on my trip was I got a few tweets

63
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,210
out and and one of them was inspired by a discussion I had the day before I left. And

64
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:29,730
we'll just say it was a good thing. I left my tweet was, look, sometimes I just want to

65
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,610
measure something because I think it will help me answer a question. And then in all caps,

66
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:41,420
stop asking me to make dashboards. I'm all about communicating. I love communicating information.

67
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,060
There's a value of that. But just because I'm measuring something doesn't mean I want to

68
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,860
set a release criteria based on that or decide what the threshold is. Sometimes it's important

69
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,820
for me just to know how many people downloaded this. I can do that without going, well,

70
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,620
if I'm going to measure it, I should have a goal for what I want it to be. And I've been

71
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,420
working with a lot of people who are really dead set on if you're going to measure it,

72
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,780
you know, you want to know exactly what question you're going to answer and what your

73
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:18,140
threshold metrics are and what your what does pass and fail mean. Oh, oh, God. Yeah. Oh, God.

74
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:23,260
So let me just tee that up one little bit. Then I'll let the rage of Brent emerge upon the room.

75
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,740
Another thing came out of the same conversation was because I was talking about measuring.

76
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,940
Actually, I put this in my last blog post. But when you're looking at a scenario,

77
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:37,020
how do you figure out what do you want to measure to know the health or how people are

78
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,060
using that scenario that will help you kind of answer some questions? And the dichotomous

79
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,620
deterministic group wants to take those measures and determine pass and fail for the scenario,

80
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,940
which I have a hard time with. But Brent, unleash your comments.

81
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:00,530
Guys, first and foremost, stop building dashboards that say pass or fail.

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:11,200
The world that we're moving into, it is impossible to produce such a result that has any value.

83
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:21,580
There is a place for this in the short term we talked about last time about what and why

84
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:28,380
we're doing these changes. One of the things that's also important is to address how we're

85
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:36,060
going to get from here to there. I do think in the short term that there is some value

86
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:43,020
in these dashboards. The primary reason is because we have a whole community of people

87
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:52,350
who don't know what they're doing. They don't know how to get there from here.

88
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,470
And so they're trying to map this new set of goals to the world that they're used to.

89
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,670
I'm sure I shared this quote, but the thing I've used a lot lately is

90
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,790
surging into the future with one foot anchored deeply in the past.

91
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,630
Yes, I went to a presentation by Alan Shalloway. For those in the Northwest,

92
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:23,020
he runs a company called NetObjectives. And he shared a process where he talks about pickup sticks

93
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:30,620
where changing culture is like playing a game of pickup sticks. For those who don't know the game,

94
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:35,980
you have these multiple colored sticks. Each color represents a different number of point values.

95
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:40,780
You kind of hold the whole pile of sticks in your hand and you drop them about six inches above the

96
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,380
ground and they create a pile. And then you take turns with an opponent pulling sticks off of the

97
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:53,820
pile. And if you get a stick off the pile without moving any of the others, you get to go again.

98
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,260
And the whole point is to go back and forth. And once all the sticks are gone,

99
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,420
whoever you add up points and whoever has the most wins.

100
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,180
I just realized this is a real game and not something you play on the Xbox.

101
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:15,100
I'm with you now. This is old school game. Games that Alan and I might have played when we were

102
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,540
young kidlings with our marbles and jacks. In pickup sticks, there is a black stick. It's worth

103
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:30,380
25 points. And generally, the person who gets the black stick wins. Now, what he talked about

104
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:37,420
is that black stick is like the goal. If you go straight forward, there's a non-trivial chance

105
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:44,670
that you're going to disrupt the whole pile and eventually lose the game. What he said and said is

106
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:50,430
that what he noticed is when you play pickup sticks, there is always an easy stick on top to take.

107
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,150
So if you just take that stick and you get to go again and then you take the next easy stick

108
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,070
until the game is over, obviously, this dashboard world or this culture shifting world

109
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:09,140
is kind of like that. It's how do you leverage the model that they have today? How do you leverage

110
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,420
the capabilities of the people, the processes and the technology to move them forward in the

111
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,370
correct direction? If you go straight for the black stick, you're going to cause all kinds

112
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,810
of dysfunction, particularly in some of the larger groups because you can't disseminate

113
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:35,390
what and why fast enough so that people yet have the ability to collaborate together. We don't have

114
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:42,430
the technical wherewithal just yet to really reduce the friction around collaboration. So a lot of the

115
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:49,630
top-down command control processes are going to be in place for a while. Dashboards you can fix.

116
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:54,740
Fine, let's create a dashboard. But we're going to stop using pass-fail. What we're going to do

117
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,300
instead is we're going to identify key metrics or KPIs that are important to the business.

118
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,210
And we have to call them KPIs. That sounds so old school and dorky.

119
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,760
What would you like to call them, Alan?

120
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,520
S swims.

121
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,280
Swims.

122
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,120
Yeah. Shit we want to measure.

123
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,970
Shit we want to measure.

124
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,680
Does that work for you? No.

125
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,600
How does it? Oh, should we measure?

126
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:29,120
KPIs remind me of a time and I get it. And there's a big push here to classify the measurements into

127
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,640
KPIs and CTQs, critical to quality. And these just remind me of a time of measurements that were

128
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,960
purely top-down and almost purely useless. And so I get, yeah, they are the things we want to measure

129
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,160
that are important, the key performance indicators. That name to me just it bristles my skin a

130
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,040
little bit just because it has so much history with it.

131
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,480
The biggest problem with the dashboards that we use today, there's two of them.

132
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,720
Number one, they're focused on vanity metrics, not actionable metrics.

133
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,280
Number two, they are focused on deriving action with the top of the hierarchy.

134
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,840
Exam.

135
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:19,600
So pass-fail. We have the scenario. It's failing 25% of the time. So?

136
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:26,320
I don't even know what that means. I can't fathom what a failing. I mean, if it's unable to run,

137
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,560
if it's functionally not there, it would fail. If you can complete it, does it pass or there's

138
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,630
other criteria that they run? I don't know what group of measurements come through to make sure

139
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:45,200
that it passes versus fail. And let me just equate this back to the age-old test pass.

140
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:52,000
A stupid metric where we look at how many tests are passing, we go, oh, 98%. That's good.

141
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,040
Is it? Because if those 2% of failures are data loss and crashes, maybe not. Or if it's 90%

142
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,480
or 80% or 50% and the tests that are failing are these arbitrary test failures or arbitrary junk,

143
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,040
it doesn't matter. What that number tells you is there's stuff to go look at and figure it out.

144
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,080
I don't care about test pass rates. I care about the issues that we found and what we need to find.

145
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,040
And let me tie that into what we're measuring now. And if you look at data-driven engineering of a

146
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,520
scenario, we want to measure how long it takes to draw the screen. In my viewpoint, I want to know

147
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,600
how long does it take the screen to appear or our web page to download, for example,

148
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,040
our web page to appear over end. Page load time is a common metric.

149
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,640
But I don't know if I want to put the actual pass-fail number there. Page must load in 0.5 seconds or

150
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:51,280
less. Well, what if it's 0.51 seconds? Is that bad? Well, no. I don't know where to draw the line,

151
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,000
so I don't want to draw it. I want to know how fast it loads, but I want to look at it in

152
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,120
aggregate and then look at whether it's causing downstream effects, like if it's too long,

153
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,240
are people leaving the site, et cetera. So I think that's a great example. So page load time

154
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,880
by itself is absolutely a vanity metric. And just so people understand, difference between a

155
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,400
vanity metric and an actionable metric. A vanity metric is, in general, a metric that makes you

156
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:29,500
feel good. Hey, page load time is down to 2 milliseconds. Yay, we go celebrate. That's great

157
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:39,460
for arguing for a beer budget, but for creating a solid business, it's not so good. What would be

158
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:51,920
better is a ratio. Page load time over customer impact or over dollars earned. Because by turning

159
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,520
it into a ratio, you now can graph it or you can look at it in a way that creates action.

160
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,120
If you know where you're going with the action, it's really easy to create a ratio for ratios.

161
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:11,120
I can create page load time divided by the days it rained last year. That's not as exciting for me.

162
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,880
And you could drive action that way. The next thing would be to tie it to something that's

163
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,320
important to the business. So when it comes to dashboards, the high level summary that I would

164
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,920
say is, number one, they need to produce actionable metrics. Number two, they need to be consumable

165
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:36,160
by the people who will take action. A lot of the times these actionable metrics,

166
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,640
people produce scorecards because they want to publish it to the executives so the executives

167
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,560
have confidence that that team is on track. You actually bring up a good point because

168
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,360
a lot of people would tell you both inside and outside Microsoft say, well, management wants to

169
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,440
see these numbers and what they want to see are vanity metrics. If I see another red, yellow,

170
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,200
green, smiley face, sad face, frown face chart, I'm going to rip my head off and chuck it into

171
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,080
this microphone. You know, the one that bothers me is the yellow arrows pointing to the right.

172
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:14,290
What the hell does that mean? You got up arrow and it's green and down arrow, it's red and then

173
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:17,890
yellow arrow pointing to the right. It's trending, Brad. It must be important.

174
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:27,410
Okay. The last thing is the actionable metrics. So again, first one, you want actionable metrics.

175
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:32,290
You want it to be presented in a way that's actionable towards the people who will take

176
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:40,930
action. And the last one, it's tied to a KPI or a SWIM, whatever the hell you want to call it today.

177
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,170
We'll come up with a better name. In fact, we will take suggestions from our four listeners.

178
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:52,430
And it has to be tied to something that matters to the business. For example, a buddy of mine,

179
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,950
I got a quote from him. One of the things he does, he likes to shock folks. And one of the

180
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,110
things he does when he mentions, when he talks about the culture changes, he has this quote,

181
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:12,100
features don't matter. Quality doesn't matter. Moving the metric is what matters.

182
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:18,420
Defining the metric that matters is key. So explain what those last two mean. What is it?

183
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,190
What go those last two sentences? Tell me what they mean. So moving the metric is what matters.

184
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:34,990
What that means is learning how to take action on the metric, learning how to deploy code, experiment,

185
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:42,270
measure the right things that will actually cause the metric to go up or down.

186
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,430
All right. And then the last sentence, how do you find the metric that matters?

187
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,700
At a high level, you measure the behavior you want. So when you talked about peach.

188
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,780
But by measuring, I mean, we'll need a concrete example because most things you measure, you'll get

189
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,130
whether for the right reasons or not. So you'll be really careful about defining that metric

190
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:10,530
that matters. I forget the Hawthorne effect. Yeah. Hawthorne's principle. People's behavior

191
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,840
change in accordance to how they are being measured. In this case, what we want to measure

192
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:23,360
are things where our customer impact. And a lot of times they don't know that we're measuring it.

193
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,960
And actually, it's really important there. I was leading you a little bit, but when you measure

194
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,720
your metric or about the product or business and not about the people and what they're doing.

195
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:42,140
Yes. So we talked about page load time. Amazon knows to the millisecond how much

196
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:50,020
a millisecond is worth to its business in dollars. That's fantastic. Yes. How do they know this?

197
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,940
They measured it and they did the correlation between page load time and churn rates of their

198
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:02,900
customers. We talked about last time that right now in the service space, switching costs is

199
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:08,740
rather easy. People don't have to go to Amazon. They can go to eBay. They can go to other e-retailers.

200
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:18,020
So they measured what is the minimum page load time where they stop seeing people

201
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:24,340
switching away. They associated latency to customer impact and then reassociated customer

202
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:30,400
impact to the business. They want their customers to stay. That's the behavior they want. How do we

203
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:40,130
keep them sane? Cool. Makes sense. All right. So dashboards are great when used properly.

204
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:47,380
Crappy dashboards are crappy. That is words of wisdom from Brent. Yeah.

205
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,100
Anything else on metrics before we move down the Kanban list, the lean coffee list?

206
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,960
So we have up on the board, we have a discussion around dashboards. And next up is estimation.

207
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,760
No. No.

208
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,120
Screw it up, Brent. Oh.

209
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,320
Can you read? There's a one and then there's a two. A one and a two.

210
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,080
This process works so much better when we're doing it.

211
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,000
There's not even a number by estimation.

212
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Matter of fact, there's an X through it.

213
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:26,820
So folks, I warned Alan beforehand. I have been up since 3.30 this morning. It is now

214
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,260
eight o'clock as we're doing this and the coffee is just not working.

215
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,180
All right. What do you want to talk about then, Alan?

216
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,770
I would like to pause for a moment and give all four of our listeners a chance to

217
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:41,620
weep a little for you. And then I want to talk about...

218
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,340
All right. Move on.

219
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,500
You wanted to talk about shifting to a data-driven engineering culture and some pieces about that.

220
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,700
Let's talk about that a little bit.

221
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:59,540
Okay. So we've been talking a lot about why and specific things that we see as problems as well as

222
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,820
quite honestly things that drive us crazy.

223
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,860
If you look at the root cause of all this problem is really,

224
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:15,060
we have strong command and control structure within the organization.

225
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,300
Very hierarchical. And in there was a historical context to why this was needed.

226
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:31,580
But today there is so much data that that as a decision-making framework slows us down.

227
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:37,580
What we really need to do is entirely change the culture from one set of paradigms

228
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:48,460
to a different set. To do that, you really need to use a process known as systems thinking.

229
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,000
It isn't about how do we just fix dashboards. Dashboards is one bit.

230
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,500
But in addition to dashboards, you got to fix the people.

231
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,860
Yeah. There's a huge people problem. Great Weinberg quote, probably paraphrased,

232
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,460
but he says it's always a people problem.

233
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,060
It is always.

234
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,460
You're talking about systems thinking and that's the challenge in making organizational change

235
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:19,740
is you have so many things moving at once. And if you don't try and get a full big picture view

236
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,220
and only look at one part, you're going to screw something up, which isn't necessarily bad,

237
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,700
but you're going to do better if you know what the effect is of making this change here.

238
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,820
What will that do downstream? And working within a larger, largest organization I've ever

239
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:38,540
worked in at Microsoft, my team is very small, works within a very large organization, Windows.

240
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:47,340
And he has a team of one books. I work in a application group, I don't know what to call

241
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:53,980
us, an organization of about 120 people that sits inside this behemoth known as Windows of,

242
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,660
I can't count that high. It's like a zillion. I don't know. Big number.

243
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,020
It's many thousands. Yes.

244
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,780
Um, anyway, systems thinking in this particular context, there's really three things you need

245
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:13,060
to change simultaneously. You need to change the people, you need to change the processes,

246
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,340
and you need to change the technology. When we talked about the dashboards, right? Okay.

247
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,820
We need to change what information is being communicated in that dashboard. That's a

248
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:32,620
technology question. But we also need to change the processes. Right now, most of the dashboards,

249
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,580
as Alan pointed out, most people are used to dashboards as a preventative measure. We need

250
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:47,730
to see this dashboard all light up green before we can ship. Right? That's primary reason we see

251
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,530
a lot of dashboards, at least in the test context. The dashboard that I'm talking about,

252
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:58,720
that would change that model. Right? Because you're always going to have what's the current state.

253
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,600
Well, you want to monitor more than for release criteria. You want to know what's going on,

254
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,440
which is great. Yep. But we need to release more frequently. You can't,

255
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,760
it needs to be green all the time. And when it turns to yellow or red, you'll get it back to

256
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:19,760
green right away. Or green could be relative. Like the whole idea of green is that we have

257
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,000
the ability to have a predictive model around what is the threshold. What is the acceptable value?

258
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:33,840
The one of the paradigm shifts that we will see people moving towards right now, we're all

259
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,680
absolutist. Everything's got to be true, false, pass, fail, black, white.

260
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Hate it. I hate it.

261
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:48,320
We're going to shift towards one that's much more probability based. There is a 77% chance

262
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,080
that this will increase the revenue. All right. Let's go back to the dashboard example.

263
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,880
So if we have this dashboard that communicates this monitoring and it says,

264
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:09,840
Hey, this new deployment dropped the page load money KPI that I don't even know what it's called,

265
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,800
but we talked about just a second ago with Amazon. We also need to change processes

266
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,400
such that people know how to act on this data. They're used to publishing the data. And now what

267
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:28,480
we want to do is have the data pre published. They're looking at it actively and they're

268
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:37,920
reacting to it. That will also cause people to be retrained because the model that they're used to

269
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:43,840
is again, very absolutist. We create a bunch of automation. We make sure they all sum up the

270
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,480
pass and then we publish it. One of the key things that will have to change is reaction time.

271
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:59,070
So we need, we need PMs to be able to say, Hey, I had this new data point. It had this customer

272
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,910
impact. I don't understand why they need to be able to either reach out to the customer directly

273
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:12,110
or use the data to, to surgically understand what is the customer's intent? What problem

274
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:21,010
are they trying to solve? We'll need quality team, quality engineer team, whatever. Whatever. Yeah.

275
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:27,170
Titles need to go away. That's a different podcast. Go on. We'll need them to be able to

276
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:35,330
do two things important. Number one, in this world, data credibility is key. When I say

277
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:46,030
the, the page load time dollar thingy is up 2%, it's up 2%. One of the challenges that we see

278
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:53,070
right now is reminds me so much of the, the automation problems we had, uh, 10 years ago,

279
00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:01,520
um, where I used to joke, if you got five test architects in a room, you'd end up with six, uh,

280
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,240
automation harnesses. We're going to have the same problem with respect to metrics and data.

281
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:16,700
We need to, we will also need to change processes and people around collaboration. Yeah. I think

282
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,900
it's, we're moving there and a lot of people in the industry move in there and data is becoming

283
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,420
really important. We get that and it's going to be hard and we're going to screw it up and

284
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,060
we're going to get some things right. And we're going to move forward. It's pointing at the clock.

285
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:34,460
Like, like I'm out of time. Like is my, no, I got time. I got time. So I think this is now

286
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,620
third time when I tried to do invisible hand signals and he calls me out, but yet I refuse

287
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:46,540
to learn this lesson. Yes. Well, it's Brent and we all, we all know Brent, but Brent is right.

288
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:52,620
That conversation is wrapped. We're going to move on to the mailbag. Yes, that's right. We got

289
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:57,500
questions from our mailbag. Uh, I feel like we need like a little mailbag jingle, like in

290
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:04,140
the mailbag. Yeah. Something like that. I thought about it, but copyrights and things like that

291
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,940
get in the way when you go back and edit it, the, what you just did, just get a hot button for that.

292
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,340
Yeah, I should, but again, I don't want to like, I'd have Nicola who made blues clues.

293
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,700
I don't, whatever company made blues clues. Like Nick, Nick Jr. with like, like Sue me,

294
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:23,820
it's like, I want all the money you've made off that podcast. And I would do like vanilla ice

295
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,060
and just change the beat just a little bit. No, no, I never even heard that under pressure song.

296
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:33,500
Dork. Um, so anyway, we had a couple of questions you're welcome to send them in. And I had a thought

297
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,100
earlier one time we should do like, uh, like, uh, have people tweet us questions live during

298
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,980
our recording. Just thought for the future. Do you think our four listeners are up at this

299
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,940
time? No, I have way more. I have way more Twitter followers and we have listeners so we can,

300
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:54,140
we can probably get some answers. All right. The first question is, does that mean we have to do

301
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,660
live streaming? No, no, just, just, just don't throw it too hard. I'll go with the flow. Uh,

302
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:06,540
Mark asks two questions. First one is how do you document your test efforts in a, such a fast

303
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:11,180
environment, a fast based environment? I could tell you I'm going through a little transition

304
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:17,020
right now as, uh, again, working with, uh, some of my larger organization with one foot

305
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,500
anchored in the past and surging into the future with one foot anchored in the past.

306
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,500
So you're, you're producing 30 page test plan documents for what you're going to release.

307
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:32,780
But I got to tell you, there is the, the, my stance on documentation and planning is this,

308
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,180
and this is where I drew the line and actually got them to make a change, um, which was getting

309
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,340
a change in this group is hard. So I'm going to pat myself on the back without hurting my arm.

310
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:47,420
My stance around documentation, especially test documentation is there is all the value is

311
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,380
obtained in thinking through the problem and use the document to describe your intent to purposes,

312
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,260
describe your intent and communicate with those around you what that intent is.

313
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,420
I've used the verse that's wanting to do mind maps for that, but whoever you want to document

314
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,260
that it's about making sure you think through the problem. And we'll give you a template,

315
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,860
a very short one to kind of help you think through what are all the ways we can do a B and C.

316
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,740
And you know, you want to describe your intent just to, and then by communicating that the second

317
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,980
step you've one shared your ideas. People can learn your approaches and you're going to get

318
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,460
new ideas and bring in there and you're going to enter the act, enter the project. This is all

319
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:31,020
very quick. Um, you know, Google had their 10 minute test plan. And I think you want to spend

320
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,780
enough time on these to be thorough, but no more where I draw the line. However, beyond those,

321
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:45,460
is do not try to predict the future. There originally was a, you've all seen the test case

322
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,860
design documents, whatever they're called with a list of here are the test cases I'm going to do,

323
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:55,060
which is one of the stupidest practices I've ever imagined in my life. Because you don't,

324
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,460
you can, you're imagining some test cases you might, but you don't know if those are going

325
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,340
to be the final list, which ones are going to be irrelevant, which ones you're going to add to

326
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,860
that. We talk about maintaining documentation. I don't believe planning documentation should be

327
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:13,460
maintained at all. Cause it should be written in a way that areas that need maintenance do not

328
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,260
exist. Talk about intent, what you're planning to do, you know, some ideas and how you're going to

329
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:24,180
do it, and then go do it. Don't list your test case IDs. Don't list, don't link to things in your

330
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:31,140
work item tracking database. Those things will change. I think we've, on our soapbox,

331
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,940
that we have spent so much time, you know, worrying about maintaining documents and we don't,

332
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,860
and we make jokes like, well, sustained engineering will use them and they don't,

333
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,180
they would use that intent, but listing a bunch of stuff that you don't know predicting the future,

334
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,860
unless you have a crystal ball or a time machine is a complete waste of time.

335
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,220
It's okay. First and foremost.

336
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,140
Did I get too high on the soapbox? Are you a little dizzy?

337
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:58,140
No, the, I didn't follow you up there. First off, the answer to test plan,

338
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:10,140
in my view, is, it's certainly something snarky. It is, hey, however dev wants to ride it is okay by me.

339
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:16,180
The second one, planning. So Eisenhower, I believe, had a quote, which is,

340
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:20,020
plans are useless. Planning is invaluable.

341
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,900
I think it's indispensable. Whatever. Sure. Go on.

342
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:28,300
In, indivisible. And liberty and, hey, go on.

343
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,820
The plans, there are really only two goals to a plan.

344
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:41,070
Number one, get you and the people who will be working with you on the same page.

345
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,350
Number two, get your own self on the same page.

346
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:50,350
Isn't that exactly my two intents? Describe your, yeah, describe your intents.

347
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,870
That's exactly it. Share them.

348
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:57,470
That's exactly it. In my view. So, so the question was, how do we document your

349
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:02,190
test efforts in such a fast environment? I'm going to take the word test out,

350
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,270
because that word bothers me. I'm going to say, how do we document our efforts?

351
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,550
Anything we want to plan. Right.

352
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:16,270
I am a huge believer in Agile. And the way, as an example, the way we do it on our team

353
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:21,310
is the goal is collaboration, or it's not really the goal. The goal is same pagedness

354
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,990
between you and the people who are going to work with you.

355
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,390
You can call it collaboration, but the reason why we produce these docs is to

356
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,110
make it easier for everyone to get on the same page and contribute to the outcome.

357
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:43,440
What I think is the three most important things listed is the intent of the, of the plan,

358
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,400
what we're trying to build, specifically the outcomes. And what I mean by outcomes,

359
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:57,840
I mean a customer impact outcome. We, we want this to boost throughput for our customers by 10%.

360
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:05,360
You want to have an implementation agnostic plan starting off with, and then you want to have a

361
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,000
measurement of success. How do, how do you know if you're in the weeds? How do you know

362
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,320
if you succeeded in this? That last one is the most important one forgotten. And it's the way you

363
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,200
get out of this predictability BS, because the measurement of success is what tells you,

364
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,980
are you failing or succeeding? And the goal is to fail fast.

365
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,740
I get you. I get you. I want to, I have an estimation story I want to tell. Okay. And,

366
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,940
and really the answer there is that the long answer for the short question was,

367
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,020
plan just enough. And actually one thing to add is that one thing that helps us on our team is

368
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:51,230
we're sort of scrummer, fallish, fragile, working our way towards agile. But one thing we do,

369
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:57,550
your waterfall with short sprints, we're a little better than that. We're a little better than that.

370
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:04,670
So don't judge if you're not living in my world. All right. And we do list every work item has

371
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,550
in the work item itself. We make sure people define what does it mean when it's done. And

372
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,550
for me, you know, what is the done done list? What is the done list? And for me that's,

373
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,830
and I described that as I'm working on this team. We're trying to get better. I found that

374
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:24,510
describing done before you start eliminates a ton of the problems and helps focus the work you do.

375
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,070
And I believe it is also the gateway drug to do using behavior-driven development,

376
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:33,070
which is where I like to get the team. Yes. The, the biggest issue I've seen with,

377
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:38,270
with that lately though, is people are still defining done in terms of work items.

378
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:43,550
Oh, I will have a database online. I will have a reporting online.

379
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:48,830
And that's not allowed. Done means it will do this, this, this, and these things exactly.

380
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:52,590
Yes. And then there's some other implied things about the crossing the I's,

381
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,990
dotting the T's or whatever, however that thing goes.

382
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,300
Yes. Anyway, let me tell my estimation story. Then we'll get on to the last question maybe.

383
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,980
So I was sitting in a room, another tweet. I had to tweet. I had to sit next to a developer

384
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:11,220
who wanted to cost estimate, I guess they call it costing now. These words,

385
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:18,660
he wanted to cost every work item for the next year. And my, I got a little twinge on the back

386
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:25,950
of my head and I asked him, so what granularity do you cost? He goes, man months. I go,

387
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:31,390
I got a little good, good, good. I got the little face and I didn't quite wrap the telephone

388
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:37,870
cord around my head, but I said, so, um, you know, that estimating when you say something

389
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,830
takes two weeks or more, it means you have no idea how long it's going to take.

390
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:47,410
You just don't know. I know there are studies that say anything two weeks or more as,

391
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:53,310
you know, as a variance of 200%. And the, his justification was, I have done this in the past

392
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:59,150
over three releases. I won't say which product I'll be nice to him. And they've been remarkably

393
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:05,070
correct. And I'm thinking, well, it's all, it's a false. It's a false because hot thorns principle

394
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:11,310
in play. I don't think it's hot for an effect. And I don't think that's it. I think when you take,

395
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:16,270
sure, if I put these huge wide swaths around how long things I think things are going to take,

396
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,550
not every, not every task takes more time than it should. Some take less. So I think just the

397
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:26,990
law of averages, when you say everything's going to take somewhere between one and, you know,

398
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:32,750
one in, you know, or 12, 15 man months to complete at a very high level. Sure. They're going to,

399
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,750
you're going to get that because well, one, you're right. You're measuring it, but two,

400
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:42,750
it's such a huge buffer built in there. It doesn't help you. It doesn't help you get better.

401
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,470
It's just, to me, it's a fool's errand, a useless cause to try and estimate like that.

402
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:51,950
So here's what happens. Here's, here's what I've noticed what happens with people

403
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:58,110
in that situation. So they have this pride point. My estimates are always accurate. Well,

404
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:04,510
as measured by what? By my ability to deliver on the time that I set. Okay, great. Now,

405
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,790
this person is often in a management role and he has a pride point that my team will deliver on

406
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:15,230
this. So the first question I asked these guys is like, I want to see your time tracking. I want

407
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:20,980
to see how many hours your developers are working because I can guarantee you that team

408
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:27,470
is working 30 hour days the last week of that month. 30 hour days. That's funny. Yeah. Anyway,

409
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:34,610
I had to get that off of my chest because it's just, look, planning is good, predicting the future.

410
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,250
Don't try to waste a time. So actually, before you go on the next one, there's a couple of

411
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:46,700
things I wanted to say. Number one. So in a fast environment, this is the number one dysfunctional

412
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:56,960
thing that I have learned from agile. Okay. And I will tell you, I despise the agile manifesto.

413
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,840
We just lost half of our half of our four listeners. Yes. You better. And the reason why

414
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,200
is because it lays out principles. And if you read it, it says, we favor collaboration

415
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,400
above documentation. What it says, and then you have a bunch of clear, it does not say that it

416
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,760
says this is good, but given a choice between this side and this side, we prefer this. If you

417
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,560
read the language of the four motto thingies, it says favor this above this. Okay. Now,

418
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:37,630
when it gets deployed with a bunch of old school people, I'll call them. I almost got

419
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:45,120
us kicked off for what I was about to say, who are trained in the absolutist mindset.

420
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:53,440
This, this favor model gets switched to no documentation. Yeah. That's just stupid. I hate

421
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,760
that. Okay. Oh, we're agile. We don't have doctor. Agile does not freaking mean no planning. It means

422
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,280
lightweight planning enough. And that's, yeah, I think that's clear. I think what you despise

423
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,920
is not the manifesto. What you despise is the massive misinterpretation of the manifesto.

424
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,120
I do that. And I think the manifesto itself could correct it if they reworded that in a way

425
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,040
so that, so that the people who understand the spirit of it, agile as a term is so bastardized

426
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,360
that we kind of need a new word to replace it to actually describe what good engineering is.

427
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,480
People say they're agile when they're not all the time. It's so they can ignore the parts of

428
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,400
the old world they don't like and not actually work any better. We've talked about this before.

429
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,520
You know what? I think the world needs an agile manifesto for dummies. I do.

430
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:54,610
Where it's just laid out. This is how you interpret this. Anyway, the next thing, my team,

431
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,410
one of the things that I'm very proud of my team, we have this phase that we call the analyst phase

432
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:05,170
and to get, this is on our version of the scrum board. Okay. There's a column analyze to

433
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:14,850
get out of analyze. You have to have sign off from two design reviewers. Okay. Now, why is that key?

434
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:21,090
Because if this project, whatever that ticket is being worked on, goes into the weeds, I don't,

435
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:28,450
at our retrospective, I torture the design reviewers. I go, why did you let this thing go

436
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:34,720
forward? What was wrong? And oftentimes it's like, well, we didn't understand the design.

437
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:40,540
Again, why did you let this thing go forward? It's by doing that, by putting,

438
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,420
making designs and doing it in a way that applies social pressure,

439
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:52,180
you get, you converge very quickly to what is enough design. And that's going to change on

440
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:57,460
a context by context basis. Yeah. I don't always believe in social pressure as the way to

441
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:03,460
derive on the right answer, but it's not always. No, we got one more question. It's going to be

442
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:09,220
a quick answer. Mark also asks, what challenges surprised you at Xbox things you didn't see coming?

443
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:16,340
And I can tell you, Xbox was the, everything I've worked out in my career was the fastest moving

444
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:25,860
and so many moving parts that everything was a surprise. It was, it was a crazy, crazy time.

445
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,380
It was a load of fun, but I'm honest when I say that, I don't think anything threw me off,

446
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,580
except for maybe this five year old hack in the password thing, which I probably,

447
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:40,660
that's all I should say about it. But it every day, something was moving, something changing,

448
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:46,980
and just keeping all the pieces glued together and the, you know, the pieces bolted down to get that,

449
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:51,700
to get not the product as much as our test infrastructure and which was solid, but with

450
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,660
the product changing underneath, it's a huge long story. But the short story is nothing

451
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:05,740
surprised me because everything surprised me. Wow. That was remarkably Zenny and, or Zenny.

452
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:11,870
I don't think. All right, everybody. That's all we have time for.

453
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:18,350
All right. Thank you and see you next time. All right. Bye.
