00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,630
This is the AB testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:17,530
the AB testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

3
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,630
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started.

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,590
We are back again for another shot at the ABT 343 podcast. And this time we have Dave

5
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,090
Westerveld all the way from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. Say hi to everyone, Dave.

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,090
Hi everyone.

7
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:39,250
Glad to have you here. Thanks for taking part. Once again, the ABT 343 podcast is a chance

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:45,770
for really for the listeners of the AB testing podcast to get a chance to learn about each

9
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:53,030
other a little bit more and for people who maybe aren't in our Slack community to get

10
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,550
a chance to see kind of what's going on in the world of modern testing. The format is,

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,950
as I've described before, is I will take one of our three listeners because there can

12
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,710
only be three listeners to the podcast and I'll ask them three questions in about 20,

13
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,790
30 minutes at the most. We're out of here. Are you ready for these questions?

14
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,790
I'm ready.

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,150
You were a superhero doing modern. No, just kidding. That would be fun, but awkward.

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,750
I am a superhero.

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,670
DC or Marvel?

18
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,790
Oh, actually, I'm Marvel, I guess.

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,790
Okay, good.

20
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,510
I have to admit I'm not a huge, like I enjoy the movies, but I'm not like a big fan.

21
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,750
All right, then you can stay. You can stay. It's all right. But that wasn't my real question.

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,830
Don't count that one. I'm going to merge the first question into two. So can you

23
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:44,150
tell the listeners a little bit about what you do, including what kind of software you

24
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,260
work on? Catch yourself on that background. Tell me a story.

25
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:53,020
Yeah, so I guess what I work on right now is something known as LMS or learning management

26
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:59,470
systems, which is kind of similar to, well, CMS is maybe another big word that you hear

27
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:05,380
a content management, but with an LMS, what we're doing is kind of helping educational

28
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:13,300
institutions manage their learning of the whatever system it is. So an example might be if you

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,460
want to do online submissions at a university, we kind of provide the platform or back end

30
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:25,460
for that. So it's a it's, you know, fairly complex corporate ish software in that way.

31
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:30,620
And then before that, I worked actually at a company that made desktop simulation software.

32
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,300
So like engineering software, heavyweight computing, so kind of some pretty different realms of

33
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,700
software testing in that way. So I've kind of had a lot of, I guess, a few different

34
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:49,420
things, never really been in the, you know, highly startup tech world of that sort, but

35
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,980
getting exposure to some of these more corporate approaches to testing and ways of thinking

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,880
about software. Yeah, and my background is pretty much I actually went to school as an engineer

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,420
for chemical engineering, and then ended up in software testing because they wanted this

38
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,260
engineering software, they wanted someone in engineering to test it. And over time

39
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,140
kind of got more and more into the automation and that kind of stuff. And it was like, you

40
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:20,220
know, I don't think I'm ever going to have a career as a as an engineer doing chemistry

41
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,660
stuff, I'm going to be in software. So that's kind of how I move to more software roles over

42
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,820
time. That's cool. And a couple things I wanted to dig in on one is I'll go backwards.

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:37,780
I don't forget too much. So because you're an actual engineer, I know Canada has laws around,

44
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,940
like you can't call someone a software engineer if they're not actually an engineer. Can you

45
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:47,460
still call yourself an engineer? I actually can't because I never finished the requirements.

46
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,480
So I did my education. But then to officially become an engineer, you have to have five years

47
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,260
of experience and you have to write another exam. And I've never did that second exam.

48
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,700
So I am technically not an engineer, although I do have a ring that I wear on my pinky

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,860
finger, which is something a lot of engineering Canada do, which is called an iron ring. It's

50
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,940
like a reminder of being ethical in engineering. That's that's worth the price of admittance

51
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,140
right there. And then I wanted to talk a little bit about so are these universities and schools

52
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:22,500
using your LMS system? Yeah, so we have kind of three main segments like this K 12 schools

53
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,740
and then universities. And then we have another segment that we're trying to get into more,

54
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,140
which is corporate training. Yeah, that's my exposure to LMS systems. We have one at

55
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,980
my previous company, a place called Microsoft. We had a couple different LMS systems that

56
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,980
actually worked in a learning and training group for a while. So I know I have a love

57
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:46,580
hate relationship with those. Yeah, we're just looking on Reddit today at some comments

58
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,020
about our system. And seems that many people have a love hate relationship. It's quite

59
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:58,260
entertaining, actually. Reddit's just generally good for observing love hate relationships.

60
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,780
Yeah, that's really interesting. I love hearing about the different kinds of software

61
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,740
people are working on because I've worked in the you almost made it sound like a bad

62
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,780
word, but I've worked in the corporate environment for my entire career. Even before Microsoft,

63
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,740
I worked at a company making audio software, mostly with sound cards. So and then of course,

64
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,740
I'm at Unity now and I'm still making it's corporate sounds like a bad word, but it's

65
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,260
still corporate ish. Yeah, and it's and that's probably a good point, right? It's

66
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,580
not necessarily a bad thing. It's just a different kind of environment than being in a startup

67
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,380
or something where there's more rules, more processes, more of those kind of challenges

68
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,940
to sort through. Yeah, speaking of challenges, can you talk about some of the big challenges

69
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,720
you face in your day to day? Yeah, I find that where I'm working, we're trying to be

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,420
more data driven, which is good. I fully agree with that. I think that's a great way

71
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:03,460
to approach it. But there's definitely a lot of challenges that come related to that. I

72
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,180
mean, there's a typical challenges of time pressure, like got to get these features out,

73
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,140
got to get this thing that we need. And, and then it's like, well, what about putting

74
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:17,360
telemetry in and yeah, we'll get to that next sprint. So those kind of challenges where

75
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,260
it's hard sometimes to collect the data that you need. And then we also have a lot

76
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,860
of challenges around how do we synthesize the data, so we get data from a whole bunch

77
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,300
of different sources, right? You can get data from even in a sense, kind of some public data,

78
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,740
I mean, talked about Reddit, Twitter, those kind of things, where you can get some data

79
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,700
about things that your users are thinking and feeling. But then also taking in those

80
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,340
sources of data, your telemetry, your system logs, error rates, all these different kinds

81
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,780
of data sources. And then we have business intelligence data as well. So we can kind

82
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:56,140
of, you know, look into what's happening in some of the databases. And then finding

83
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,140
creating a, I guess a narrative out of that is a big challenge. Like we'll have someone

84
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,500
come they say, well, here's a problem. This thing is going wrong. And we look at it like,

85
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,980
well, I can't reproduce that. So I'm gonna go so I go try and look, okay, where in

86
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,860
the session, did this happen, try and find the actual error that they saw in the logs,

87
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,940
and then try and cross correlate that to figure out what was actually going on. And

88
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:26,140
so there's a lot of challenges around using data effectively. You know, we talk a lot

89
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:32,100
about data, but to get to the point where we can actually use it to drive business decisions

90
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,740
is a big challenge. It's a part of my job that I really like and enjoy, trying to figure

91
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:43,700
that stuff out. But definitely a big challenge that we face right now where I'm working.

92
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,860
The cool thing about that is, is you are, despite those challenges, you're a step ahead

93
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,300
of a lot of folks on their data journey. You know, Brent and I talk about data maturity

94
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,100
and your data oblivious, and then your data aware, you know, it's there. And then you're

95
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:04,500
on that, you're actually into data driven and working on becoming data centric. So

96
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,260
it's kind of cool to see that, that, that growth. You know, for me, I worked on

97
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,340
debuggers a lot during my career and I love debugging. And when I got to a stage where

98
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,340
I had enough data around me that I could begin to debug stuff actually happening,

99
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,580
happening, which kind of word is that debug stuff happening in the real world from the

100
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:31,660
data we collected, that was magical. I love it's having, it's detective work, but all

101
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,580
the clues are there.

102
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,540
Yeah. And there's nothing like the thrill of, you know, having looked through,

103
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:41,740
gotten some alert from, oh, there's some error, looking at it, digging in, figuring

104
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,460
out what it was, getting a fix together, and then having a customer complain and

105
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,780
say, oh yeah, we've got a fix ready. Like there's just nothing that beats that

106
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,700
thrill of we found the error before you even told us about it.

107
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,700
I've had times in the past where a customer reports and error said, yep, we

108
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,020
knew about that, we fixed it, we'll be out in the next batch because we saw it

109
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,660
happening often before they even noticed something was weird. And I love

110
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:06,230
like the being able to figure out and break stuff down and go, oh, we were

111
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,870
seeing errors, but only on users running Firefox on Windows XP with this video

112
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,270
card. Interesting. Okay, we can go ahead and spin up a VM for that and find the

113
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,310
repro and see if we can figure it out. But those things are always fun. And I

114
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,670
like the differentiation here. There's data for making sure we're building the

115
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,710
right thing, making sure that we have, we're able to measure customer success.

116
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:33,230
And then there's sort of the BI, which sometimes fall into the vanity

117
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,950
metrics. But talk about some of the BI metrics you look at that influence your

118
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,390
testing.

119
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,790
Yeah, so an example, actually, not that long ago that we did, we're looking at

120
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,350
kind of free working part of the UI. And as part of that, we're like, okay,

121
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:53,290
what do we what functionality do we keep? So partly, we wanted to simplify it

122
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,770
partly, we have a couple different experiences for the same thing, we want

123
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:00,250
to unify it across those experiences. But what we're looking at is like, well,

124
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,330
this is an opportunity to kind of revisit what we actually do functionality

125
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,970
wise. So we pulled data on, okay, what are our customers actually doing in

126
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,650
aggregate on these things. So in our case, it was rubrics. So you have, you

127
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,970
know, basically a table that you can use to help assess how your students are

128
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:24,440
doing. And like, okay, we offer HTML in this like HTML editing, you can kind of

129
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,720
do your HTML editing right in there, do people actually use this? So we

130
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,000
looked at the data and so okay, some people do what are they using it for?

131
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,640
You know, is it basically just bold and italics? Like, can we just limit the

132
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,520
functionality or are people doing full kind of HTML editing stuff in there. So

133
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,160
we got data on that kind of stuff, we got data on how big people make the

134
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,040
tables. So you know, how many rows, how many columns they would have, you

135
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,800
know, how long the names are, and just kind of look at that statistically and

136
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,040
say, okay, if we support this, like that's gonna affect x percent of users.

137
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,160
If we support this, it's gonna affect y percent. So using some of that

138
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,560
information to help us decide what kind of functionality to implement in our

139
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,560
UI was it was pretty interesting. And and it was, it was interesting too,

140
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,200
because you know, we decided we're not going to do full HTML, it's just

141
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
it's a lot of work on our end, and very few people use it. But then

142
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,120
there's also the factor that shows you where the limitations of data are

143
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:30,480
in that what if those very few people are very big, powerful, vocal clients,

144
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,440
you know, does that change the way that we're thinking about it, and we

145
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
ended up going ahead with not doing it. But what is interesting to see

146
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,680
too, you can't just look at the raw data, or you have to make sure

147
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,040
you're looking at the right data, I guess, to get the answers that you

148
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,320
want.

149
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,750
I love that story. It reminds me. Yeah, it reminds me, there was a

150
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,670
product of Microsoft, I won't mention which one, but they added a new

151
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,150
feature. And of course, they had metrics to track usage of that feature.

152
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:04,150
And it was all it was, it was a menu option, a toggle to do something to

153
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:09,070
well, I'm not there anymore. It was Visual Studio. And they had a new

154
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,510
feature to a camera was to affect formatting in some way. And they saw

155
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,050
a huge amount of usage when they added it. And the team was very

156
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:24,370
excited. But the more diligent investigators, you want to look at

157
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,770
context around that. And they found that 90% of the time after that

158
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,810
never could be made up, it was a high percentage. But for now, we'll

159
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,610
say 90% of the time, the command immediately following that format

160
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,650
command was undo. Meaning people are going, what does this do? Oh,

161
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:46,730
crap, I don't want that. Which is way, way more insightful. And

162
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,370
then going way back, you know, Microsoft has used data collection

163
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,810
telemetry for a long time. And I remember, if you remember the old

164
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,210
versions of Word, and I haven't used Word in a while, so can't

165
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,650
remember, but you would paste something into Word. And you go,

166
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,330
Oh, crap, I don't want that formatting. And you immediately

167
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,010
undo. And they found that the most the most common command by

168
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:14,800
far in Word was paste. And by even more overwhelming margin,

169
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,520
the command almost always following paste was undo. And

170
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,760
that's that's where the when the ribbon came and that's they

171
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,160
made it easier to paste without formatting. And now I've heard

172
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,640
exactly how they did it. But it was from looking at data like

173
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,280
that. So it's, there's a lot of value in there. But you have to

174
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,640
look, you can't just look at the surface level on one metric,

175
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,920
you have to look at some correlations and some groupings

176
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,200
of actions to see if there's really an action to take based on

177
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,880
what you learn there.

178
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,280
Yeah, yeah. And that's exactly like data is really powerful,

179
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,000
really cool. But you do have to actually understand your system

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,160
understand your users and understand the data.

181
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,640
Well, something Brent talks about a lot, which I try and

182
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,320
remember to do is form that negative hypothesis. Like, let

183
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,200
me prove that this actually isn't working like I expected

184
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,480
and see if you can use the data for that. And if the

185
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,920
data can't prove it, it's it actually is working. Yeah,

186
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,680
there's some it's fun. I really love it. That's why I'm

187
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,230
excited and delving into it. I do know that I think I know

188
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,350
that you have also as part of your job do accessibility

189
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,950
testing. Yep. Can you talk more about that and sort of your

190
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,990
approach there and educate the the three for three listeners

191
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,910
a little bit more on that area of testing?

192
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,350
Yeah, I mean, I'm definitely not an accessibility testing

193
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,270
expert. But it's one of the things coming to where I work

194
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,630
now that was, I guess, eye opening to me. So in the

195
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,910
especially in universities, in the states, it's, there's a

196
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,670
lot of emphasis on this kind of stuff, some legal, you know,

197
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,830
some of these universities, we've had clients where like,

198
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,870
we need help with this accessibility thing, because we

199
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,310
may get sued if we don't get it fixed. So definitely,

200
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,910
there's a big kind of business case for accessibility, and

201
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:02,070
it's also at our company, it's it's marketing thing as well.

202
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,790
We talked a lot about that in our marketing material that,

203
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,910
you know, we're accessible, we build accessibility right in. So

204
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,710
it has a big business need for testing it. But before I came

205
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,630
here, my exposure to accessibility testing was

206
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,070
basically, we had a co-op student one time who got a

207
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,550
concussion and tried to use our accessibility tools and

208
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,710
couldn't, and ended up needing to take a month off work because

209
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:30,230
she couldn't use the screen and our accessibility tools didn't

210
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,710
work. So it's so common here was definitely eye opening,

211
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,790
like, okay, here's what it looks like to actually care

212
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:44,130
about accessibility. And, you know, as a company, we have, we

213
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,490
have a blind tester who works full time here, we also have,

214
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,010
you know, access to other disabled users that can help

215
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,930
us with this stuff, through kind of a contract company that

216
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,890
we work with. And then also, there's just the tools that,

217
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,610
you know, use NVDA JAWS, some of these voiceover, I think is

218
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,210
on on Mac, but some of these screen reading tools, and

219
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,290
learning how to use those things, how to think about testing

220
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,010
those things, it was, it was really interesting approach in

221
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,330
empathy. And in actually thinking about users and the

222
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,890
fact that there are many different kinds of users who

223
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,130
use your software in many different kinds of ways,

224
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,610
which I think is something, you know, any experienced tester

225
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,570
is aware of and knows. But getting to that point where it

226
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,330
kind of opened my eyes to see this is something that is

227
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,570
helpful for your testing skills, let alone, you know, just the

228
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,650
fact that you're hopefully helping people by making your

229
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,850
app or website or whatever more accessible. So it was a really

230
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,530
neat thing for me to see an experience, be in a company

231
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,530
where that is a big emphasis, and a whole new set of tools

232
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,530
and challenges as part of initiative where we were trying

233
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:05,010
to, to get some automation around accessibility testing in.

234
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,810
And so kind of seeing how we could integrate some stuff into

235
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,090
our unit tests. And, you know, some things in accessibility are

236
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:17,890
fairly easy to automate, some things are not. And so is

237
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,170
another interesting case of just like test automation in

238
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,650
general, if you want to test if you want to automate UI

239
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,330
stuff, it's really hard. If you want to look at some

240
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:29,570
other stuff, there's stuff that you can do that you can really

241
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,410
help accelerate the delivery of that kind of stuff. But you have

242
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,410
to use your context and again, understand what's going on to be

243
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,530
effective at what you're doing.

244
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,130
You mentioned, I have so many side questions, which are

245
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,610
totally allowed in Three for Three broadcast. But you

246
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,050
mentioned, you mentioned how it helped your testing. So can you

247
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,890
talk a little bit more about that?

248
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:59,210
Yeah, I think in just thinking about the different types of

249
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:04,130
users that there are, so it's very easy to get stuck in one

250
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,570
track of thinking, at least in my experience, where you just do

251
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,090
things a certain way, you click through the app in a certain way,

252
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,530
you're, you're used to, you get used to the way that it

253
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,810
works, and you just fly through it, right? So you click here,

254
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,130
click there, go, go, go, you're where you want to be.

255
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:22,450
And everything looks the way that it always looks, because

256
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,410
that's the way you always do it. But then when you turn on a

257
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:29,410
screen reader, or use zoom magnification or something, all

258
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,850
of a sudden, you see your app in a whole new way in a whole

259
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:37,170
different light than you did before. And that's helpful from

260
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,690
the accessibility standpoint of, okay, this is actually what

261
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,770
it sounds like for this page to be read out, or this is

262
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,450
what context I can't see when I'm zoomed in. But then also, I

263
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,570
found, at least for myself, it helped me think about, okay,

264
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,530
what are some other things that other types of users might

265
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,130
have, or other ways of approaching and thinking about

266
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:01,090
how you work with the application. So getting that

267
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,050
user empathy there of the fact that not everyone does things

268
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,850
the same way that I do things, some people, you know, might

269
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,850
use right click instead of left click, prefer that mode of

270
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,450
interaction. Some people might not have the experience and

271
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,410
context that I have in being able to quickly know exactly

272
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,930
where to go based on some message that they saw. So

273
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,370
getting out of your own shoes and into someone else's I

274
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,370
think is just a really helpful thing in software testing.

275
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,850
Yeah, it's a good context switch. And also worth

276
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:36,250
mentioning, and again, I think tangents are allowed. This is

277
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,130
a baby of the AB testing podcast.

278
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,210
Baby tangents.

279
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,210
We'll do baby tangents. So depending on the platform,

280
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,090
you're working on, there are some varying levels of quality

281
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,570
static analysis tools that can help you find access

282
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,250
potential accessibility issues. Is there any use there?

283
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,570
Yeah, so I mean, we use some of the kind of built in

284
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,690
stuff, the axe stuff, and we're doing the stuff that I'm

285
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:11,410
working on is kind of a lot of on the UI area of the of the

286
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,690
organization. So we're working with some stuff, web

287
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:21,770
components, which is kind of API driven. And then you have the

288
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,450
web components that we're using, Google Library called

289
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:28,130
polymer, which is now called lit element that we're moving

290
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:33,530
towards. But in that context with accessibility testing,

291
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,690
there's some built in tools that that polymer and then lit

292
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,210
element that they provide. So we use some of those things for

293
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,750
kind of static analysis. Dynamic analysis is when it gets a lot

294
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:50,290
harder. And yeah, we have an accessibility lead here. And

295
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,290
and trying to explain that difference is actually tough.

296
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,130
Like there's people that say, well, I was expecting, you

297
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,650
know, because we put this new tool that was kind of built on

298
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:01,770
top of axe. And like, this is what it can do. And they're

299
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,810
saying, Well, I was expecting that it would, you know, tell me

300
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,330
when I click on this, and then things change on the page, and

301
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,890
it would tell me what happens like, well, you need to re run

302
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,130
the tool after you click, because it's static analysis,

303
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,250
it's not dynamic, it's not kind of monitoring what's happening on

304
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,170
the page and dynamically following along while you do

305
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,810
that. So definitely a very interesting difference there that

306
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,550
a lot of people maybe struggle to understand or who are in as

307
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,230
technical roles, that there is difference between the way that

308
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,350
what you can actually check with test automation easily, and what

309
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,190
you might think you can check with it easily.

310
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,210
Yeah, yeah. I think one thing that's definitely reminded me in

311
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,050
this conversation, but maybe a good takeaway for the listeners

312
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,850
is that accessibility testing is a much bigger, it's like an

313
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:56,250
iceberg. It's a big, it's a much bigger area than it may

314
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,810
seem on the outside. On my last project at Microsoft, we, of

315
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,770
course, I brought up accessibility a lot early on, it

316
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,970
was our VP was very much in the app, we'll get to that, we'll

317
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,410
get to that, it's that's the problem, it's easy, it's some

318
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:16,590
tab order stuff, it'll make sure the strings are right. And we

319
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,920
tried to shove bolt accessibility on late in the

320
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,000
project, and it was really, really difficult, and it caused

321
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,020
a lot of problems. So definitely something to think

322
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,540
about early, is that been your experience as well?

323
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Oh, absolutely. We just had this conversation. So a section that

324
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,580
we're working on, and how, you know, and we have tended to like

325
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,260
we involve designers upfront and think about accessibility fairly

326
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,500
holistically, and it's definitely a part of our

327
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,420
checklist is not like, oh, that can wait till later, it has to

328
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,900
be done before we consider a story done. But yeah, it still

329
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,140
is one of those things where it can slide. And so we kind of

330
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,260
had this conversation, like we need to make this be a part of

331
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,140
the core of the development that we do, it's not, I'll get

332
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,100
all the page working, and then I'll go back as a developer and

333
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,980
review it for accessibility and see what needs to be done there.

334
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,300
But it's kind of like, well, you're working on this, think

335
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,740
about accessibility is the whole shift left term, which I

336
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,780
don't know what I think about that. But but that idea, I

337
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,660
think this is one of those things that needs to be in that

338
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,980
realm of upfront development, like it can't be an

339
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,340
afterthought or else you end up really struggling with making

340
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:25,860
it work.

341
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,920
Yeah, a lot of times I think about, you know, my role is sort

342
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,680
of the modern tester role, at least when there is one, but

343
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,800
it's, I do a lot of just making sure we think about things

344
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:40,480
before it's too late, try and avoid surprises. And there's a

345
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,160
lot to that.

346
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,840
Yeah, definitely. And accessibility is definitely an

347
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,240
area where that plays in. Like I, you know, I do some

348
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,840
testing of it. But again, it's an area where a lot of

349
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,760
what I'm doing is helping developers make sure that

350
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,950
they're thinking about it and working on it early on.

351
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,240
That's a good role to be in. And that's really, I think, I

352
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,120
think it's probably where a lot of our listeners are is

353
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,160
there's a lot to the modern testing role on coaching, or

354
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,480
consulting, or however you want to talk about it is helping

355
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,360
people do the right thing. One thing we can bring from our

356
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,760
testing background is that breadth of knowledge or

357
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,240
breadth of ideas on the different things that make up

358
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,960
quality. And it's tough. It's it's it's tough. It's fun. Do

359
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,680
you enjoy your job?

360
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,560
Oh, yeah, I definitely do.

361
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,600
And to me, that's the as you know, if you listen to the

362
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,240
podcast, Brent and I are both into the, the idea that if

363
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,040
you just, you should enjoy what you're doing though, this,

364
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,960
this work we're doing is, it's not boring. And to me,

365
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,600
the fact that it's changing all the time, it requires me to

366
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,800
learn new things in order to be successful. That that makes

367
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,440
working fun.

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,040
Yep. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I find that like, I love my

369
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,840
job and and working towards that. Again, it's interesting in

370
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,920
terms of the, you know, modern testing principles, you know,

371
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,760
you guys talk about it for a bit. But the idea that testing

372
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,040
isn't the exclusive job of the tester on the team. And, you

373
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:11,080
know, I'm trying to continue to work towards that on our team

374
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,200
to that it's, and anyway, I work on a really great team

375
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,400
where we have a lot of good testing done by developers as

376
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,070
well. But but that idea that it's not my job to test the

377
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,630
quality into your product, right? It needs to be there. I

378
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:30,580
can do some stuff, I can find some stuff that you might not

379
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,660
have thought of. And honestly, our customers are going to

380
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,740
find a lot of stuff that none of us thought of. And

381
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,740
that's why we need to be able to respond to things that

382
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,180
come up and be have some kind of telemetry monitoring,

383
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,980
whatever in place that allows us to know about things

384
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,980
that come up. You know, our job is to set up a good

385
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,140
scaffolding in place so that we can be responsive to real

386
00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,610
customer needs, and not impose our ideas of what quality is

387
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,730
onto the product too much.

388
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,120
You hit on I'm gonna touch on these things, and we'll close

389
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,200
here, but you hit on something that that I bring up a lot,

390
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,400
both internally at my company, and just talking with testers is

391
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,760
this, you can probably remember you've been doing this for a

392
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,200
while when you mentioned that some bugs are just going to be

393
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,360
found by customers. And there was a time that we can

394
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,800
remember when a bug found by customers was the test team's

395
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,000
fault. And it in for a lot of us are well past that. And I

396
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,800
really like if you ever saw Noah Sussman drew a picture a

397
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,400
year or two ago now where he took the traditional test

398
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,240
automation pyramid and flipped it upside down and

399
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,200
described it as a band pass filter, which I like a lot.

400
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,760
It's it's rather than try and make the thing be a ratio.

401
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,320
It's like we want to catch all the tests at the unit level

402
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,080
that we can.

403
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,240
Yep. Yeah, I love that.

404
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,840
Like find the integration level we'll find there. And the only

405
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,960
bugs will find at the end to end or whatever you want to

406
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,360
call that bottom level is fine there. And then some bugs can

407
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,100
only be found in production. And then rather than you know,

408
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,180
the old school way was we'd find a bug we go, okay, let's

409
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,660
figure out why we missed that. We'll go write a test for

410
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,540
that. But it's not about blame. It's about creating that

411
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,340
environment. Like what this is. I do a lot of retros in my

412
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:21,420
current team and the discussion usually starts off on

413
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,860
I say something like this isn't about blame is about

414
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,860
trying to assign, you know, figure out what we didn't do.

415
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,820
I want to figure out how we create an environment where

416
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,340
these things are less likely to happen.

417
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,020
Yeah. And then from that framing, we figure out like

418
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,620
where what broke down. Wow. How come this? How come

419
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,940
this issue was that we, is it true that it should have

420
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,340
been caught at a lower level of the band pass filter? And

421
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,940
why did that happen? And what can we do better in the

422
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,500
future? And I like, anyway, I like that model of Noah and

423
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,260
I use it a lot. So, but it's important to realize as

424
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:57,300
part of that, there are some bugs that just cannot

425
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,100
feasibly or efficiently or inexpensively be caught before

426
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,820
the customer. It doesn't mean the customer is doing the

427
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,140
testing for us. Some people freak out at that phrasing.

428
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,160
It just means that there's these combinations of things

429
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,040
like we talked about with data earlier, that you're

430
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,880
never going to be able to find without the masses of

431
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,920
people using your product.

432
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,120
Yeah. Like there's always that person who does that

433
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,720
thing in that really weird way that you never would

434
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,880
and that's awesome. And that's awesome. We can

435
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,760
probably both still remember the times like when we

436
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,520
hear, well, no user would ever do that. And we

437
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,880
can immediately go and say, well, it looks like 10% of

438
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,600
our users do or you're right. No user would actually

439
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,320
do that. Yeah. Yeah. So, and actually, I, it's

440
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,320
I have two great examples of that. So I had one bug

441
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,800
that I filed that was like, okay, this is, you know,

442
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,110
if you do this, whatever, it's really weird

443
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,790
workflow. This problem happens. And then I said,

444
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,030
and if you think that no user will do that, here's

445
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,750
the data in the logs. Like here's a link to the

446
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,830
data that shows that we have users that are doing

447
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,950
this. And then I had another one where, you know,

448
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,350
I was looking at some data and log and while I

449
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,270
was testing some stuff, I found an issue. And so

450
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,310
then I went back and looked to see if that

451
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,270
issue had happened in production and it hadn't.

452
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,630
So I put an alert in so that if it ever does

453
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,030
happen, I'll get alerted about it. But, you know,

454
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,510
in the meantime, it's like, why would I spend

455
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,870
any time trying to figure out or fix this if

456
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:21,390
no customer has ever done it? Yeah. Yeah. And

457
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,710
I've done that before too. Like you end up in

458
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,750
a rat hole discussion with a group of people

459
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,310
around. Well, what if this edge case happens and

460
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:29,910
sometimes those things turn into like, oh, we

461
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,590
better do some work to make sure that never

462
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,790
happens. But I love the idea of instead of

463
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,670
like trying to mitigate it now, we don't think

464
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:41,110
it's ever going to happen. Let's see if we can

465
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,150
be, we can be proven wrong and we add the alert.

466
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,270
That's like the, you know, that assert you

467
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,670
bury in your code. That's just a case that

468
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,990
ever happens. I want to know. And well,

469
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,910
customers don't run the version of your code

470
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,630
that has a search. Maybe you may never know,

471
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,750
but had added that alerts and see, oh my

472
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,070
God, somebody actually made this happen. Let me

473
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,710
dig in and see how it's fun. Yep. All right.

474
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,350
This has been, I, this has been a fantastic

475
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,230
conversation from my end. I don't know if you've

476
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,110
enjoyed it, but I have, you have woken me up.

477
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,350
It's a 8 30 a.m. here on the West coast. I,

478
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,390
of course, have had meetings since six. So

479
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,590
this is better than my, this has been better

480
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,270
than my coffee and getting me going today.

481
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:21,990
So thank you. Well, I'll take that as high

482
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,110
praise. That was definitely high praise. I'll

483
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,710
put it on my resume, better than coffee.

484
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,350
Well, I have to have data to prove that up.

485
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,590
I said, can be better than coffee. Whatever.

486
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,070
Anyway, Ben, a pleasure having you Dave.

487
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,430
Anything else you want to add any social

488
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,870
media information or upcoming things you

489
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,350
want people to know about before we sign off?

490
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,670
I don't have any, I just did a talk actually

491
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,990
at the KWS QA, it's a local beat up here

492
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,790
at the conference. But I don't have any

493
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,710
other talks coming up right now. If you

494
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,590
want to find me, you can find me on my blog

495
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,790
offbeattesting.com and the same on Twitter as well.

496
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,070
If all goes well, I'll type that up in the

497
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:03,190
show notes when this goes out. But Dave, like

498
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,590
I said, it's been a pleasure having you

499
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,710
here. So thank you very much. And I hope

500
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,150
you continue to be a listener of the show.

501
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,630
And thanks for sharing a bunch of your great

502
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,230
thoughts on quality and testing today.

503
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,240
Yeah, thanks for having me. It was a lot of fun.

504
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,720
All right. We'll see you later.
