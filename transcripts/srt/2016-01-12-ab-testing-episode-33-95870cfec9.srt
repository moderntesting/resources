1
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,530
Hey, it's episode 33 of A.V. Testing. I'm Alan. I'm Brent and

2
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,810
For better or for worse. We're back. What year is it Alan? 2016. Good job. What's what's the wrong answer?

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,760
Anything other than 2016? You know what? This isn't on the board, but you know, it's wrong

4
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,440
2016

5
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:36,240
We've covered this. Yeah. Okay. I think we covered it like exactly a year ago because we didn't call it

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,750
1910 we called it 1910. I don't get it. No, it's 2016

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,790
I get that it was awkward to say 2001 or 2002. Yeah

8
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,590
onboard, but once we passed the 10 mark, it's 2010 and

9
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,810
We just found a dead animal in the palatial podcast studios

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,770
But actually it was just the sound on

11
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,610
Brent's phone so I got a new phone and there are

12
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:21,370
Still random noises they come out of like what the hell was that sound me? I will I don't know if the podcast picked that up

13
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,370
But that gave me a little chill

14
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,850
It kind of sound like a speaking of a chill, you know, I've been

15
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,820
Took a little time over the holidays

16
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,580
Yeah, I saw I saw on Twitter that you picked up

17
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,540
Snowboarding. No, I want no I snowboarded once my daughter wants to switch from skiing to snowboarding

18
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,780
So we thought it'd be a fun little family thing a lot of families go to movies and we went to Star Wars

19
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:52,380
Yeah, as it are or bowling we say we take the whole family. We're all gonna give snowboarding a shot just for one night and

20
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:58,540
We my daughter kicked butt she's gonna be totally great I

21
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,940
Did

22
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:10,180
Better than I thought I would but one thing about learning to snowboard is you fall a lot and when you're older and bigger like me

23
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:18,000
Those falls man. I I'm still recovering from a couple of them. I have never snowboard. I

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,720
Haven't downhill skied the last time we skied was like 10 years ago and it was cross-country

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,800
So as you know, as I'm sure I've mentioned on the podcast. I'm on a

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,040
Now don't take this the wrong way

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm on a ski racing team

28
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:36,680
But it's really an excuse to go down the hill and then drink beer when you're done. It's it's it's competitive

29
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,920
But not it's like a think bowling is it like last one down the hill buys no think bowling on a ski slope

30
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,200
It's head-to-head. I'm gonna erase twice a night on you go up on Thursday nights, but

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
it is

32
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,960
I'm not wearing any specialized gear or anything

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,840
I'm just trying to beat the guy next to me

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,280
And then once I'd finished my second race

35
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,780
I go straight to the little ski hut at the bottom and get some beer that

36
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,050
Except for the whole exercise bit that almost seems like a perfect day

37
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,770
I like skiing is how I get through look out the window Brent you guys in podcast

38
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,490
I can't see the window, but you see the typical Seattle dark gray cold fog here

39
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,650
Fog is all the way up to the floor 20. That's impressive. Yeah, it's gross. Hey one aside. So

40
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,950
Your family went to see Star Wars. We did my family went to see Star Wars

41
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,730
Spoiler alert. No spoilers. Let's not make

42
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,930
On those spoilers that makes no we shouldn't spoil

43
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:46,460
So far no spoilers here's the challenge Alan what's the top

44
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,760
positive and the top negative thing

45
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,560
About the new Star Wars movie from your point of view positive thing is the movie rocked

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,240
The top negative thing is the next one doesn't come out for 18 months

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,420
Now that was well done on the no spoiler, but that was boom boring and safe

48
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:14,530
I'll show you boring and safe. I do that every podcast. Oh

49
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,770
Oh

50
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,690
You set them up I'll knock them down are we going anywhere with this no, all right. I guess not

51
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,370
All right, you scared me with the whole spoiler thing. I don't like yeah

52
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,250
It was a good movie. We'll talk about it later and the and if you want to I mean the internet is full of

53
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,890
Theories already. It's great. I

54
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,090
I'll put it this way. My favorite part was like really like the ending

55
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,300
Even though you could kind of see that the ending was gonna happen throughout the whole movie

56
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Yeah, but there was something about the way they did it. Yeah, I agree but

57
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,330
the biggest thing that bugged me is

58
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:02,020
Except for I don't think hey Han and Leia are in this movie. I don't think that's a spoiler

59
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:11,260
Except for Han and Leia. I thought it interesting the ages of the entire leadership in the entire movie

60
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,500
All of the generals were like 20 something's

61
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,740
alright, and I'm like

62
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,780
That just sat with me as like

63
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,080
Really? Maybe they dude, maybe they they're like these in humans that they're actually like 150 years old

64
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,240
I looked at hopefully he explains it. Otherwise, I just like this is weird

65
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,390
General Tarkin

66
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:39,630
He was intimidating because he looked old and grizzled and he knew he's killed billions before

67
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:46,150
All right. Anyway, so can we move on or did you need to do anything else in your holidays that is worth

68
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,950
discussing for our three listeners

69
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,310
So obviously the holiday thing

70
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,970
It was a break for me from from school and from work

71
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,650
So the first time in like two years I got reacquainted with my Xbox

72
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,390
Oh, I was gonna mention that because I saw that you and I have been playing the same game lately

73
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,350
You I've only been playing one. So how do you feel about fallout?

74
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,830
I'm liking it because you know, I was

75
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:21,430
Horribly addicted to Skyrim when it came out different series same publisher

76
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,430
You see a lot of the game mechanics if you didn't Skyrim and oh look it's a video game review show, but

77
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,070
it is

78
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,310
Inappropriate to play with my children are around not like Grand Theft Auto inappropriate

79
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,850
But a little bit too much blood and broken bones sticking out of bodies for 11 year olds me and my 14 year old are

80
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,910
I figure I'm a couple couple years away from that blood being actually cool and not like disturbing

81
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:53,470
So yeah and some again that no judgment are sure some 11 year olds that handle it just fine and

82
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,110
Understanding wives who let their kids get away with that

83
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,070
So

84
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:05,450
But yeah, I'm enjoying it. I think it's the story like like Bethesda does and again, sorry for the video game review

85
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,470
It's a story lines fun

86
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:15,230
There's enough variation in gameplay that it keeps me interested. I play my goal is like I don't play every night

87
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,730
But if I but like three or four or five days a week, I play a little bit off the kids go to bed

88
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,870
I try and like gain a level every time

89
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,390
Which it which means I have to but as you know

90
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:29,350
It's the the leveling like most games is get sort of exponential as you go up

91
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,850
So as you each level took a little harder longer to get to so have you played any from the fallout series before?

92
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,710
No, so but I just I may go out back and do fallout 3 on 360 actually it'll play on

93
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:49,430
It now plays on Xbox what Xbox one now comes with fully backwards compatibility to my Xbox 360

94
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,710
But anyway

95
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,230
But the point is that full except for all the freaking statement. Go ahead

96
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,030
I was gonna say because I bought fallout 4 I got a free fallout 3. Yep. Yeah, so I'm gonna give it a shot and

97
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:09,430
Yeah, we'll see I'm enjoying fallout. I'm level 15 now. I think you're up like 20 or something. I'm 25

98
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,630
Yeah, you're gaining on me. You've been doing you've been doing a little bit more than the level of night then and then though

99
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,710
I was I know cuz I looked online a while back and you're like 19

100
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,550
You can you can stalk and see my levels. Yeah, you're in my for my Xbox friends list

101
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,030
No, I know but you tell us what you do and what level you are. Okay, right with Brit

102
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,790
It's playing playing Fallout 4 and Xbox one level 9

103
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,570
So I have only leveled up I think twice since we've come back to work. I've only played one day

104
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,330
Yeah, I was like 22 on Sunday. All right, cool. All right, but it's a great game

105
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,570
But that stuck could get me to at this point in time they could release

106
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:54,810
Hey, I knew game crap on a stick. Ooh, okay

107
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,930
Well, they do

108
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,710
They have a good game engine a good they put some good thought into their games. Yeah

109
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,890
I like the non-linearity and they they have done a great job

110
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:12,170
Doing story development even given a non-linear linear world. Yeah

111
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:14,410
So now that we're down to two listeners

112
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,700
No, no, cuz maybe our three listeners are complete geeks

113
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,940
Yeah, they probably all have nice floors or we use right

114
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,660
Do you want to to let's go to two? All right

115
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,040
so I did a tweet about this want to get your thoughts on this and actually

116
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,220
When I thought of straw man arguments in the past

117
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,760
I always thought it's like, you know, you take something out of context and you throw that up there

118
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,960
But I was looking at the straw man argument Wikipedia page

119
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,800
I realized there's this thing that bugs me in a lot of writing about software

120
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:54,060
That's exactly one of the bullet points in a straw man argument where the straw man you throw up is and it makes total sense

121
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,600
I think about it now this throw up is not the right word. But the straw man argument uses you say something that's

122
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,740
sort of absurd or

123
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,060
at least

124
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:10,170
Incorrect and then you base your article on on on the other end of that and it's all over the place

125
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:16,810
I see things like most of you think that unit testing is useless. Here's why here's three ways how it can help your team

126
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,570
wait, most of who or I see things like

127
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,630
Driving towards driving towards a most of you agree that code coverage is

128
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,070
Useless for most software activities. Let me show you how it can be helpful

129
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,590
So is this a straw man argument where you make a sweeping?

130
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,670
Generalization without any no you set yourself up

131
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,630
There is I forget the name of the fallacy for a sweeping generalization

132
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,670
Like we talked about this one before and I used to remember it

133
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,230
But you talked to one manager at Microsoft and he said something goes management at Microsoft says blah

134
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,560
Like it's a little bit different. I think the straw man is when you you

135
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,840
Set up the statement you want to say by making an argument that is either out of context or incorrect

136
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,930
Okay

137
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,610
Because the the challenge I had with your examples is like most of you if the first thing I went to is okay

138
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,650
What where the hell did you get your data? Yes, and that's what happened. Maybe you're combining often. It's anecdotal

139
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,810
I mean you see this all the time with I see several people who tweet about you know managers aren't enableable to do blah

140
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,930
This is a little bit out of on the edge of a stretch

141
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:28,610
Managers aren't being nice to their employees

142
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:34,130
So well which managers will I talk to two managers and they weren't being nice so managers aren't it's like yeah

143
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,890
But I want to start calling these I want to like make a collection of these for a blog post or something and maybe

144
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,970
It's just me that I noticed them

145
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,570
But and I find the sites that I don't want to pick on people that'll get mad

146
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,730
But the sites that sort of crank out articles

147
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:53,250
Like their whole idea is just to get crank out these

148
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,690
Half written articles and I say half written because literally they do like two paragraphs and I say more to come next time

149
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,690
It's all about getting ad

150
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,890
Getting views for the ads

151
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,730
Yeah

152
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,570
Still they write about 400 words at a time and as the and most of those are set up with some sort of straw man argument

153
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:18,940
and just and again, I could vote with my feet and stop reading those things, but I do have a lot of blogs and and

154
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,580
News sites in

155
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,180
Feedly and I go through most of them every day and kind of glance through them and just looking for

156
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,300
nuggets of information nuggets of inspiration just to see what's going on and

157
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,300
So I could just stop reading those and and fix it for myself

158
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,940
But I just wanted to bring it up because I learned I I guess the main thing was I didn't realize that that was

159
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:47,860
A form of straw man, but now I think about it. Of course it is so that was my big revelation to share today

160
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,060
The is that's not quite an Alan Page soapbox rant

161
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,020
We'll just throw it out there in the new and improved new year

162
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,990
years ago started blogging and

163
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,470
It's interesting. It's slowly

164
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,300
Transforming but a lot of the the reason why I started it is

165
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,100
Just to get practice at it gave me a reason to practice

166
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,140
Writing and communication. Yeah, it's funny if you go back and look at my very

167
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,180
first or very second or third one of my first three blog posts from

168
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,760
When did I start a long time ago 2006?

169
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,580
No

170
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,820
2004 I was still on the Windows CE team the 2004

171
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,560
Was for that I said for that exact same reason just want to practice writing

172
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,210
Yeah, and it's it's been helpful for that. But now I play

173
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,080
different games with my blog like the

174
00:13:53,170 --> 00:14:00,170
How do I change what I write about or my writing style to inspire

175
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,220
different

176
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:11,820
Behaviors, for example you go to Alan will will write a blog. Hey, I read this book and he'll get like 15

177
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,260
Comments on there to me. I treat comments like gold I

178
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,420
I

179
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,660
essentially write a book and

180
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,600
I know people are looking because I look at the stats and and

181
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,320
There is a rating page and I get people to

182
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
vote on a rate

183
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,960
But comments don't show up and I'm I found you have to piss people off a little bit to get them to comment or really

184
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,080
Yeah, I found I found

185
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,840
So here's my current acting theory. All right is I need to

186
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,840
Not cover all bases. I need to create holes

187
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
So that other people can add value

188
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,320
Yeah, but don't add lines that say more about this next time or I'll talk about that in a future blog post

189
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,480
Those things drive me crazy. I

190
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
Will do when I bring up a topic. I will do things like

191
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,330
Yeah, that's a future blog post

192
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:19,050
But what I've done once the the the series model

193
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:24,690
This is part one to be clear. I've done series before as well. But as I I will never do it again one of the things

194
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,370
That if you read any book about writing

195
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,970
They'll tell you many great ideas and I can recommend books on writing, but I'm not going to today

196
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:40,190
But books on writing will tell you one of the best ways to get to be a better writer is to read a lot

197
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:47,470
And that's true for I think a lot of creative fields when in college when we had our jazz band auditions

198
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,510
We had a great jazz instructor and a lot of times

199
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:56,110
he would listen to you play for a little bit, but he asked who do you listen to and

200
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,010
and make sure you had a good repertoire of artists that were sort of you know relevant and

201
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,130
you know inspirational at the tip of your tongue to prove that you actually listen to that stuff because

202
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,050
That's one of the ways of getting better at improvising and getting ideas for jazz

203
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,970
Just to listen more and anybody who's any good, you know

204
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,150
Yeah, I mean they will tell you everybody to listen to all the time

205
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,890
And so same thing with reading and one of the things

206
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,510
looping this back a

207
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,310
Lot of what I've learned about or what has influenced my own writing style

208
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:34,790
Is things that I've read and the fact that I get annoyed when I see these half written articles that say more to come

209
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:41,790
Next time I go you only wrote like a hundred words like I'm exaggerating now, but I realized I never want to do that

210
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,410
I never want to do that more to come next time and the serious things the same thing because it's

211
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,750
Although I've done it in the past, you know guilty as I read

212
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:57,110
More and more of these, you know sound bites of information that we get on the internet these days. I realized that I

213
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,910
Don't want to read a serious thing

214
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,670
I want to get the information I want and then if the if the blog if the author is good enough

215
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,330
I will come back even if it is a series, you know call it a series

216
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,260
Maybe that's better. But you know, I find things I like and don't like in that writing

217
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,900
I try and reflect some of those things in my own. But as you know, most of my writing is

218
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,000
Sort of a flurry of conscious like I'm thinking like I want to tweet this I go

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,300
There's no way I can tweet this and like one or two or three tweets. I'll write a couple paragraphs

220
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
I was that your decision?

221
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,820
What no, so so one big difference between you and I is you're always up on the the Twitter sphere

222
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,520
I'm up on the Twitter sphere

223
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,200
Primarily in response to something somebody I'll go up. I will look at Twitter

224
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,160
Three four or five times today just like in between meetings or during lunch or something and I'll catch up and I never like look

225
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,500
Through like I don't know if anybody does this who follows any number of people I never like go catch up on my tweets

226
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,460
I'll look at the last dozen or so tweets and if anything I want to reply to I will I may throw something out there

227
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,460
I may throw something out there. It's a general

228
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,620
comment to

229
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,620
many of the tweets that have gone by

230
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,480
Your I wouldn't say always but I think it's frequent

231
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,880
well, what I was commented on is that you're

232
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,840
You're an opener

233
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,600
far far more often than I am you'll go in and

234
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,680
Often see rants or often see

235
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,560
Status updates or things like that. Yeah

236
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,720
So I completely agree around the more to come it's it's it's not a good device

237
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,720
So I've tried this

238
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:48,620
But it it depends it is a good device if the entire goal is to get viewers to your site to get ad money

239
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,770
Sure, that's not a problem. I'm interested in

240
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,970
Solving in Mike. No me neither

241
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:02,690
But for me the that when I use the device it is often when I'm writing something I've realized

242
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:09,850
Hey the rationale for the thing. I just wrote could actually be an entire other blog post

243
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,900
I'm just gonna say hey this could be a similar lines if this could be another blog maybe one day

244
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,420
I'll write up on it. I leave it to the reader to go do their own research. Otherwise

245
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,180
Trust me. This is the reason why I said this

246
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,020
Moving on because as we all well know I am riddled with ADHD

247
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,520
And if I were to follow that thread that's going to be a hotter page block

248
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,180
so

249
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,920
You hear that sound? That's the sound of a

250
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,210
Beating of a dead horse Wow, so

251
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,970
But on the same subject

252
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:50,530
You wrote a blog post recently about combined engineering

253
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,930
Yes, the that the Jive chosen to call unified engineering

254
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,410
But for various reasons to cover before but if you haven't read it go to

255
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,570
Testastic dot WordPress dot com and

256
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:12,930
Nice lengthy tough for the ADHD crowd to get through that. I took me two sittings. Why why was it long? Oh

257
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,170
Yeah, that's lots of paragraphs

258
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,200
Words and words and words

259
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
Yeah, I have been told

260
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,280
that one of my communication problems is

261
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:34,010
Is I often choose to say in ten words what can be said in three wasn't is it Mark Twain that said I was going

262
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,930
To write you a short letter, but I didn't have time. So I wrote you a long one instead

263
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,680
Yeah, no, and you know what that sounds funny, but I completely totally understand that

264
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,980
Anybody who's done any writing totally would

265
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:56,100
Speaking of long words total rant when did people start using the word utilize instead of use?

266
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:05,570
I'm going to it's like little five-year-olds good. I'm going to utilize a blue crayon to draw this. I think that's when

267
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,590
When synthesis kind of got out of favor in terms of management buzzwords

268
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,920
excellent

269
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,980
So

270
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:24,100
Good blog post one thing. I don't think you meant to imply this but one thing that you know when you read

271
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:31,180
There are techniques on reading and I and if there's like something that bothers you it ends up distracting you from comprehension

272
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,180
One of the reasons I read this twice because in the very first or second paragraph

273
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:41,340
I don't think you intended it but you sort of made you sound like that unified engineering was invented in Bing and

274
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:49,090
And to be clear that there are teams doing an engineering team without separation of development and test no

275
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,730
It's you know as you it which I'm sure you'll agree with many many other companies

276
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,050
I think one of the first places that Microsoft if not the first place at Microsoft that to happen was over in the Bing team

277
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,010
So I will say

278
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,780
and

279
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:08,060
They spent some time trying to because the way I worded that first

280
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,340
Definitely implied it and I didn't want to do that

281
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,820
However, here's here's what I'll say the foundations of the model

282
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,460
Were not invented in Bing or in Microsoft. Absolutely not it was

283
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,540
Much like other companies do and they watch

284
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,580
Microsoft to see what they're doing like we know for example

285
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,860
Amazon is like 10 years is following the model we did 10 years ago and it's

286
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,600
You know, that's to be clear I wouldn't say that wholeheartedly there's some bits of the model

287
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,740
Following is probably too hard

288
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,620
But what happens is Amazon has gotten a lot of X Microsoft ease and they've taken what they've used

289
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,180
For better or for worse, right? I think

290
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,180
It depends on your point of view. I

291
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,900
Think for Amazon for worse if you're a competitor of Amazon for better one thing

292
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
I'm gonna interrupt because that's what we do on this podcast

293
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:15,900
But one thing it's I like about what I hear about Amazon culture is they have these company values that come up daily in

294
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:21,980
Meetings like they actually live their company values. I'm gonna ask you name one of Microsoft's company values

295
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,100
Point point made. All right, go on. Yeah

296
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,180
We used to do that actually

297
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,100
Then the first decade of my career. I mean remember having lots of discussions around

298
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,780
Our competencies in a line

299
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,420
Yeah, we'd have brainstorming meetings and the line discussions to our competencies, which was

300
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:49,120
that's the most recent version of

301
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:57,000
Values that I've actually paid attention to that's old but to your thing. No, it wasn't invented but

302
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,870
There was a very I mean it

303
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:09,170
How to do this model other companies have done before right the specific variant

304
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:14,220
And the specific set of documentation

305
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:23,300
That got deployed at Microsoft did initiate. Yeah, but I'm being honestly and this could be a huge rat hole

306
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:30,640
I don't think the initial and it rarely is it but I don't think the initial implementation for people I've talked to of

307
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,080
unifying engineering

308
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,520
Was particularly successful in being

309
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,750
And let me give you some anecdotal stories and again

310
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,630
It was a large part of the group that a lot of people I've talked to

311
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:52,350
I feel like I'm like to have looped Brent into this like I'm ready Charlie Rose sort of interrogation

312
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,460
so

313
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,620
Anecdotally, I've known a lot of people in that org

314
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,160
I've heard following statements

315
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,440
Managers were surprised that by making everybody a developer that

316
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:14,220
Throughput didn't increase reflectively. I heard that multiple people

317
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,060
I also heard that you know a lot of the but probably more believable was that in that move

318
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,820
This is one of the things talked about and things that fail is a lot of

319
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
People were valued on

320
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,120
feature

321
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:37,000
Feature output in production and then a lot of the testing activities although necessary were valued less or not done

322
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,290
so

323
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,770
That so the first one I never heard

324
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,900
Okay in terms of a throughput a

325
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:52,160
Theoretical throughput tests that failed I had I I've talked again. I was in Bing. I talked to a lot of folks

326
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,340
Yeah, you never heard your knowledge is a little better than mine mine's a second hand, but I

327
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:01,620
Think you learn there the second one. I mean that by far

328
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,240
the

329
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,620
the biggest

330
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
double-quote surprise

331
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,980
was that quality fell and that I did hear a lot and

332
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,100
The the focus on features now that is one of the things I

333
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,620
experienced two different models the the model

334
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:35,660
That they deployed in Bing. Okay. Now was their first attempt and not only that so they started off with one specific team

335
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:40,840
And that one specific team worked very well, and then they very rapidly broadened it

336
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,420
the

337
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:49,100
Thing that I believe that they did an error is they had the right thing, but they had the wrong

338
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,940
principles and goals that they were trying to accomplish things like

339
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
throughput or

340
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Efficiency, okay

341
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,900
Several of these things and it occurred to me. I actually had a mentee the other day

342
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:13,410
Come to me and he started talking about combined engineering and I'm like I

343
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:19,490
Had just written my blog three days ago at that time and I'm like, did you read my blog?

344
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,970
Is that why you're here? He's like you blog

345
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,850
And I'm like and that happens quite a read this and come back that that happens quite a lot

346
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,200
I don't I don't I

347
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,950
Don't understand that phenomenon

348
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,950
but

349
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:40,230
There was that experience in Bing and the and the learnings and the mistakes and then after after about a year and a half

350
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,750
I went to a different team and

351
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,690
They wanted to go with this model and they had learned that I was there. So I helped to instruct it

352
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:58,250
The biggest thing that I realized that I left out of my blog was

353
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:01,610
very specific common things people do

354
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,270
That they should not

355
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,840
As an example, you should although this is one I called out

356
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,080
one of the mistakes that they did is they wanted to do the combined engineering and

357
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:23,210
They said that they valued the test expertise as much as the feature expertise, but their actions and their words

358
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,530
were not

359
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:30,020
With strong integrity of each other. I believe it

360
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,600
right

361
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,920
but

362
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,260
the teams

363
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,260
Where their actions in the words lined up?

364
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,300
Succeeded with the unified engineering model

365
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
They recognized

366
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,740
But it comes down to there's this prevailing subversive belief that that the prior test team

367
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,940
Didn't add value and never did the only value that they had is now

368
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:59,590
Those guys would do my testing for me

369
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,620
right and actually we

370
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
we served a

371
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,140
stronger purpose than that and those teams that that

372
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,310
Realized that became stronger

373
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,660
In in actuality. Well, I think we talked about this loss

374
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,470
last time

375
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,230
What I am finding is

376
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:28,030
The teams that go whole hog into unified engineering

377
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,060
with with a respect both points of view and have the

378
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:36,620
leadership run by

379
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,280
the test

380
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:44,720
they're actually shaping up to be stronger than the prior and I think it's because

381
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,480
tests had a strength with respect to

382
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:56,380
Balancing quality and features. All right, we always were for the the one month test pass at the end

383
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:02,460
We were always only given two weeks. So we had to be able to do a good ROI

384
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:09,900
to prevent someone coming in yelling at us and blaming us for the quality at the end and

385
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:13,650
Also, I think test is inherently

386
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:17,410
Better at doing the generalist

387
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:24,600
To in between shift. I agree. I agree. Hey real quick. Yeah one thing you didn't touch on your blog

388
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm curious to know your answers on is what are a couple things that you definitely don't want to do when you have a unified engineering team

389
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,600
Well, I think I just touched on one. Yeah, right. Well, let's give it some more

390
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:43,500
It's easy to mess up, right? So just give you a couple quick if that have ever happened to you

391
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,500
But well a couple examples

392
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:53,170
Ideas you notions you don't want to have the incentive principles

393
00:30:53,810 --> 00:31:00,240
Be of the old world. You mean like features or what was right? You don't you don't

394
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,940
It's a new team. It's a new concept

395
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,330
you don't want to try to figure out how to

396
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,370
Take these new guys from that discipline and

397
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:19,290
Now rank them through the world that you're used to you have you have to change

398
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:25,490
The worldview so one of the things I do think I I glanced over

399
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:28,330
The incentive structure has to change

400
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,020
So how do you incentivize people?

401
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,100
What what what is the right? What is a right?

402
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,460
What is something what do you do to incentivize people in the right way in a unified engineer?

403
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,820
I'm gonna hand wave on on this one, but it's

404
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,750
You need to

405
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,110
value

406
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:59,640
throughput and quality and you don't stack rank those two it's

407
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,040
No, it's the you've heard the phrase the tyranny of or it's not an or

408
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:08,140
Yeah, you can't provide me ten features

409
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:15,980
With a quality level one and call a win. No, right, but and you can't just in the unified engineering team

410
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,650
You can't just the other thing you can't have

411
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,560
Is a caste system you cannot

412
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,570
Create

413
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,540
This new

414
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:37,460
Unified engineering team that that in my view is what makes a difference between a combined engineering team and unified engineering team

415
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:41,180
Ah, good point and I love the analogy in the blog about salad dressing

416
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:48,540
Yeah, so and I've seen this before well has seen well my feature team is unified engineering team. That is scrum team

417
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:54,540
On my feature team, you know so and so and I are the testers. We do the testing for everyone else

418
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,080
That's our role on the scrum team

419
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,680
Brad just oh, you know what? I saw this in big bang three last night. You could actually hear someone's eyes roll. Yeah

420
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,500
Especially when I watched that last night as well

421
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,220
the

422
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:10,820
the one of the problems that my mentee has

423
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,380
is

424
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,310
Was that it was was that issue?

425
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,020
So his expertise his strengths

426
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,310
were in

427
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,830
infrastructure test automation

428
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,390
in the in

429
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:34,230
Testing okay. Yeah, that was a value proposition and I said that's fantastic, right?

430
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,940
Until it's unified we need to operate on the assumption. It's only combined

431
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
unless you have a

432
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:51,120
An insightful a smart manager who realized no, I'm gonna start with the beginning or the with the end this I'm gonna

433
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,040
I'm gonna act like my team is already the team I want. Okay

434
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:02,750
But they were overly focused on their strengths and I'm like if you do that and

435
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,940
I'm not gonna mention the team

436
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:13,550
But I did mentioned. So here's the thing. I actually think that you're on a team that

437
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,820
Probably isn't going to exist for a long time

438
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:26,340
Right. It's one of these teams where we're experimenting with things and I don't think the experiment has succeeded

439
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,310
so

440
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:35,210
The rest of Microsoft is moving towards this model and if you don't start to transition

441
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:42,380
Yourself if you focus on only your strengths if my prediction comes true

442
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,380
You're not gonna find a job

443
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:53,020
Because you're gonna be two years behind everybody else in terms of their learning of how to be able to do both successfully

444
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,600
Yeah, and one thing to be clear on I was afraid of making this point

445
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,000
I agree, but I was afraid of making this point earlier why I hemmed and hawed a little bit but

446
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,680
When I look at a team, of course, it's quality focus. It's collaboration. I are some things I care about

447
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
output and

448
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,380
Maybe technical ability I might throw in there

449
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,460
But I'm looking at how I'm going to and that was a little iffy but the first three for sure

450
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,220
So collaboration thing is really important. I want to reward the

451
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:30,740
People who work together and enable others much better, especially at higher levels of Microsoft. I also want

452
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,110
output and

453
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,510
but clearly by output

454
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:43,950
One trap to fall into is that output includes customer facing features only so I want to

455
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:50,700
So output is are you getting work done and maybe maybe another one is business impact

456
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,180
So I'm gonna look at if I'm looking at my team. I want to figure out and again, it's not stack

457
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,380
I can figure out who wants to get the most rewards. It's not tyranny of war, but I'm looking at

458
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,860
You know who has a great combination of working with others

459
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,380
Gets

460
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,060
Relevant work done. So they get a lot of work done to that work

461
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,380
We've seen people get a lot of work done but none of that work is actually applicable to anything we care about

462
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,520
People go off on these science projects forever, but I can't you know, those people are people I cannot reward

463
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,880
but if you're doing a lot of work and it may not be feature work, but if you're like enabling the team like I

464
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,890
want to look at someone if I'm

465
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:34,410
Cranking out I'm making sure that this infrastructure works to make it very easy for devs to check into a CI system and get data

466
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:40,370
Out and and make decisions very very quickly, etc. Etc. Even if I never write a customer facing feature

467
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:45,690
They're doing a ton of output on relevant work and they're helping other people

468
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,650
So although they haven't done a customer facing feature, they may be one of my most valued employees

469
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Sesinctly like I have the same bar

470
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:00,480
Sesinctly the way I and then I order it for me. What's important first and foremost

471
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:08,880
Validated ROI that you delivered something that was validated as ROI. It drives me bonkers

472
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,880
That there's a lot of folks highly successful at

473
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:21,060
Hand-waving and saying oh look at all the awesomeness that we did

474
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:29,600
When all they did was ship well ship in two weeks later you you you got two people using it

475
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,360
I'm like no you didn't deliver ROI

476
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Okay, ROI business ROI delivering business ROI is absolutely my first one. The second one is absolutely team collaboration

477
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,440
Hero is a four-letter word. I

478
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,040
Cannot any longer stand siloism there. We've talked about a blog

479
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,340
Before or we did a podcast before

480
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,640
There is a place for heroes, but in general

481
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:04,060
They're not used in that fashion that we've discussed before and in general they drive me bonkers

482
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,460
And often the hero is ends up being a bottleneck

483
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:12,820
It almost always does we'll be fine as soon as the hero comes in and saves us saves the day

484
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,140
and then

485
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,140
So it was ROI

486
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:25,620
Collaboration and then lastly is throughput if I can get these first two principles

487
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,420
throughput is easy to turn the crank up on when when they try to do throughput first and

488
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:36,620
They abandoned the others two principles then things go into the weeds. That's my experience

489
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,880
It was great to have a mail-in mailbag item from you Alan

490
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:51,170
Yeah, we forget to do the mailbag when it's a question from each of us. Yeah, I don't think it really counts

491
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:53,190
so

492
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,990
One thing one last thing. Yeah is I should probably talk about is

493
00:38:57,790 --> 00:39:02,550
Came back from the break after the holiday on Monday. We're having a meeting. We had a little bit of a

494
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,510
Architectural reset on my team

495
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:11,270
We're gonna change our back end and we're talking about how to get that going and we're having this discussion and and this is totally

496
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,790
Out of context, but one of the and I tweeted this and maybe I should just read read the tweet

497
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:19,870
This is words removed and paraphrased to fit in 140 characters

498
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,350
But basically what happened is I I said this

499
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:29,190
Peer manager said today that his current plan was to quote not worry about tests and quality

500
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,590
Well, his team got their features done, you know

501
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:36,070
I wrote hashtag last words and just a little bit of event for me and kind of you know, it's

502
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:42,510
Kind of funny, but it's like 20 some odd retweets and then 12 likes of that

503
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:46,130
Well that struck a nerve or people thought it was pathetic or something

504
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,720
but and then

505
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,000
There are some follow-ups on that or so there's some context where I think he meant the right thing and and we had a long

506
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,720
We had a talk afterwards and a couple talks afterwards

507
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,520
One where I told him he should be fired but

508
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
He took it well

509
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:12,120
So the point is is when in the world and again he didn't use those exact words, but

510
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:18,630
Why do smart people this is our I think our smartest dev manager. Why do smart people?

511
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,010
Say dumb things

512
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,480
To me that's a very easy answer you think it's an easy answer I think it's complicated

513
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,740
What's your easy answer? No, so it's it's it's broad enough

514
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,820
that I could easily see your typical answer for these type of things of

515
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,400
It depends would apply

516
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,180
So but I actually think I can answer it with an equivalently broad answer

517
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:53,360
Oh, I can't wait go the answer is I'm letting it even say always

518
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,770
the wrong combination of fear and hope that is

519
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,520
Always the answer. So let me go a little bit more specific smart people do dumb things because they're not using their smartness

520
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,920
They're not analyzing. They're using an emotion. Yeah, motion is always there influenced by context and largely emotion and

521
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,240
One of the things I learned a few years ago. I spent some time

522
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
I don't have time for the long story

523
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:28,000
I will tell it anyway in the brief form used to be a thing we did at Microsoft called an MS 360 where

524
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,120
If you get up to hire their own leadership ish levels

525
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,720
They one of the things you can do is this thing called the 360 where they take people from all over the company

526
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,560
You've worked with people that work for you. You work for you work with you work outside of your org and they fill out

527
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:53,200
This extensively long survey about you and just to kind of get feedback on kind of how you're perceived around people and I grew

528
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,600
up in the Microsoft of you know

529
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,280
Steamroll take names and you know, if you leave bodies in your wake, it's cool

530
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,920
so those are my mentors my first like 10 years at Microsoft and

531
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,660
That's where the good attrition comes from and we know people that still try and act like that and where I made a big turning

532
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,180
This 360 and I met with HR and you know because they

533
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,300
Still people as part in that I know and they're idiots as part of this

534
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,940
It was kind of eye-opening because I felt like I was doing good

535
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:31,340
I was emulating my mentors and and I was having a great time and being a dick and

536
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:39,600
Part of this is the ad like a one-on-one with some HR person talking to you about stuff and and they go holy cow

537
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:44,540
Alan everyone you work with loves you. They think you're fantastic. They also think you're an asshole

538
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,750
Yeah

539
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:48,750
So it was like oh

540
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,490
Is that good or bad?

541
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:57,050
So I ended up because what I do is what I want to improve it something I study the crap out of it

542
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,970
So I read like a half a dozen books on interpersonal awareness, which a lot of people hand wave as oh

543
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,850
I need to be nice to people and that is the most shallow

544
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:08,570
It's like it's like to loop this background at the beginning

545
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:13,370
It's like learning just enough of the force where you go off on the dark side and become an income a jerk

546
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:21,430
I would say if you wanted to do a broad generalization, it's not be nice to people. It's no it's understand. No, it's understanding

547
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:29,390
How you're coming across as well as what other people are saying it's a different you need to concentrate on perception and learning about things

548
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,510
Yeah, so when I see someone anytime like that's really stupid

549
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:39,810
But and a lot of times like I used to like flip the bozo bit like you said something stupid. You're an idiot

550
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,090
I'm never taking anything you say at face value again because you're an idiot

551
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:49,370
But I look at and I assume for the most part if someone especially someone's fairly senior

552
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:57,250
They're a smart person and with this guy. He's a smart person thinking why would he say that and it's about context and the context

553
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,250
Is is he had some fear?

554
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,410
About you know getting things up and running

555
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:06,570
We have a lot of dependencies like in order to get the site up and running on the new back end like it

556
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:12,570
We need to get you know level stage D or E running before we could actually dog food on it

557
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:19,250
It's depending on ABC and D and he's thinking well if I am blocking these five other things down the road

558
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,490
The important thing is get them unblocked first and then if I have to make some shortcuts, I will

559
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:28,720
But once he said that I said oh, I'm actually okay with that

560
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,120
I'm actually I'm all for do not skimp on adding unit tests. Do not skimp on code review not skip any of this stuff

561
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,480
If when push comes to shove you want to take a little shortcut

562
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,480
I'm not saying right crap throw away code

563
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,680
But if all you're saying is sometimes gonna take shortcuts in order to unblock someone then you go back and do that work by all

564
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,080
Means that's okay cuz unblocking I think is very important

565
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,480
But I want to be exception rather than the rule but even then once you unblock

566
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,800
Then you immediately have absolutely and and and he was okay with that but though he was looking at it from the I

567
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,760
You know, I look at things that

568
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,540
We wanted the goal is quality. We're not we're never going to ship if we don't think of quality first, but

569
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,080
sometimes

570
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,360
There's no rule that I can think of that's written in stone

571
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:23,200
This is you have to follow every single time you can bend these things for a reason when I was in college

572
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:29,400
It was great. I took this and I mean I'm on my talent chair had music theory for two straight years of music theory every morning

573
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:31,810
exciting, huh and

574
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:38,490
We spent the first four or five four and a half quarters of that like learning rules the rule of fifths

575
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:45,250
That's like day one. So it learned rules and rules and rules and rules is Kate now, you know the rules now

576
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:49,650
You can break them not allowed to break the rules till you understand the rules. Yes

577
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,610
So that works a lot. So anyway, that's important

578
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:59,850
That's like the first lesson that I teach and is broken in a true with agile as well, huh?

579
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:06,650
Learn the rules that there's probably a blog post in there. Yeah more next time. So there's two two

580
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:13,030
For lack of a better word I'll say wisms that I pass on that's real

581
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,680
Relevant to this when mentees come to me first and foremost

582
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:29,640
Everybody is awesome. It's their behavior set piss us all very very well put just because I like that nugget

583
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,160
Just because you think they're a dumbass

584
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:39,580
More than likely it just means their worldview is different than yours. Now there could be behaviors

585
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,760
that are

586
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,240
The oil and vinegar with your behaviors, but it doesn't mean that their worldview is

587
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:56,010
Necessarily invalid. Okay, this is one of the things that were why I love strength finders as a framework because it gives me insight into

588
00:46:56,810 --> 00:46:59,810
Okay, this behavior is really pissing me off

589
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:04,370
how do they look at the world that would explain this behavior and

590
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,320
which enables me to

591
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:14,220
Then go have a conversation say, okay, how do I suggest a behavioral change because these people are awesome

592
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,260
I want them in this party. I want them part of the team

593
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,400
But I can't live with how they're doing this behavior wait the second wisdom

594
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:26,310
This is something that I've learned

595
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:31,900
It's not always true, but it is true. So friggin awesome or not awesome

596
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,160
Often that it is awesome

597
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:38,160
and that is

598
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,980
in general

599
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,980
though the worst things people do

600
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:54,920
The behaviors that they do to screw up their own lives is because they are operating out of a fear and they don't

601
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:02,220
Often even realize it the best thing people who are observing this like you go you go Wow this guy

602
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,600
Normally really smart. He does does does these things really well, but this thing this thing he's doing

603
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,440
Which is completely wrong is also

604
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,580
Uncharacteristically

605
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,340
Part of his behavior said this is a new pattern

606
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:24,560
This is something I've never seen this guy do before and I will tell you 80% of the time

607
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:31,400
It's because they're afraid of something even if they are claiming they aren't so two quick things before we close today is

608
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,680
Two things come to mind both from books. I read a lot huge number of books

609
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,120
Jerry Weinberg said on multiple occasions. I don't know what book or whether

610
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:44,440
It was somewhere else, but it's actually I do know a book is from but I can't remember the name

611
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,000
Doesn't matter

612
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,200
It's always a people problem

613
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:55,280
Which is true, but what is even better and I really think it's important if you have to work with people

614
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:00,510
You need to actually work at it the same as you work at your code

615
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:05,150
If you're a consultant, especially or a sort of leader as much as you work on your technical skills

616
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:10,790
You need to work on how you deal with people just as much and maybe more if you're behind the curve

617
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:13,990
Michael Lop wrote a book called

618
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,750
Managing humans, which is very very good

619
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:21,950
There's a whole chapter on FUD fear uncertainty and doubt and how to deal with that in your organization

620
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:26,950
Which is you know right along these same lines and you need to be able to handle that you need to understand that

621
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,310
You know people have weird behaviors. They're gonna act differently

622
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:37,650
You need to learn if you really want to manage someone or lead someone you need to take time and effort effort

623
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:41,150
Especially to kind of figure out where they're coming from what drives them

624
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:45,990
There's a motivation that makes people say silly things or do dumb things

625
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:52,790
there's a motivation that made this dev manager say we're gonna make shortcuts and I real demand like this to make the shortcuts for the

626
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,230
exception rather than the rule and and

627
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,590
Working with people is a lot about compromises not about setting hard rules and making people

628
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:06,630
You know strictly adhere to them and you and I have both known test managers throughout our career that say this is the way

629
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:11,310
It's gonna be and you know, I'm in my own quality and these are the rules

630
00:50:11,310 --> 00:50:16,410
But you you could have rules. We also have to understand that sometimes in

631
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:23,510
Making progress I was once I I was that test manager once

632
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:28,030
I'm glad you grew up Brent it and it did not go well

633
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,800

00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:39,370
Very cool. We could go on and on on this thing is a good subject to explore more next time just kidding

But our three listeners are tired and probably want to get off to bed. Yes. All right, so happy new year

636
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,130
Happy new year. Everybody will be back with episode 34 next time I am
