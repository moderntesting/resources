1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,260
Hey Alan, how are you doing?

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,820
Super hey everybody listening. We're happy to have you here. Thanks for listening. Tell your friends so we can have even more listeners. Oh

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,090
This is the a B testing podcast. There will only be three

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,670
So we are at

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,790
Episode number 65. I like to let Brent say that because I can't count very high and he's a he's like a math guy

6
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:44,310
Right. Yeah, so we are here once again early in the morning recording a podcast Brent. How was your last week?

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,940
It's interesting

8
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,760
Big deal happening in the Jensen household

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,810
Emptiness syndrome officially starts Wednesday

10
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,700
Is your last child start school? Don't you have a young you have a young daughter?

11
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,560
I said it starts doesn't start. Yeah first one left first one leaves Wednesday

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,440
But I like to count down the other way, which is the year until they're all gone

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,400
So how old is your youngest seven? Yeah, so I I will be done earlier because my youngest is

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
starting seventh grade in three weeks and

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:28,020
I'm just counting down the days until they're out of the house and we sell the house and don't tell the kids where we move

16
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:36,620
Everybody laughs when I say that like it's a joke. No, I'm I think I'm not 100% serious

17
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:44,260
I think it's fascinating that you have this position already in your kids aren't teenagers. Yeah, I had it before they were born

18
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,580
The older ones a teenager. I had it before they were born. I

19
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,580
Took my daughter clothes shopping yesterday

20
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,780
She is such she's such a shopper

21
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,700
She

22
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,220
It was I I did the thing where I sat on a bench in the mall for about an hour and a half

23
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,540
Well, she looked at and tried on clothes. I figured out what I hate malls

24
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:15,060
It was physically draining on my soul. My daughter isn't old enough for that yet, but I do remember

25
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:18,190
Gosh, I think she was like four

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,340
where she and mom went out shopping and

27
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,540
She

28
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:31,480
Came home. She's like dad. I made mom buy me two pairs of these shoes just in case one gets dirty and

29
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
I'm like, oh my god

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,120
She's like already in the shoes and she's already four and my wife is not like one of those

31
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,340
Shoe people I'm like I and I have three pairs of shoes. I'm like, I don't know where you're getting this from

32
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,890
My son was with us he's massively patient he's the opposite

33
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,410
he

34
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,410
Didn't want to buy any clothes. I

35
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,140
finally made him buy a pair of sweats he's where he wears sweats or shorts and a t-shirt every day and he has a

36
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,060
infinite well, not quite infinite a

37
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,080
Continuous I'll put it a continuous supply of brand-new t-shirts coming in through loot crate. You know what loot crate is

38
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:20,140
No, loot crates this thing for like 20 bucks a month subscription service. You get a box of

39
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,980
Stuff every month which always includes a t-shirt some sort of little statue

40
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:30,820
It's a little knick-knacks he did just a general loot crate, which is just kind of cool nerdy geek stuff for a while

41
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,080
But now we just loot crate gaming so he gets a little little game trinkets sometimes stickers

42
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,180
figurines

43
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,160
But some really cool t-shirts as well. My daughter does loot crate anime

44
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:52,070
They're on a tangent she got some she gets some cool stuff loot crate is on our sponsor today

45
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,230
No, how would your son 13 13?

46
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,910
And the stuff he's getting the loot crate gaming you think of age appropriate. Yeah, there's no it's with a 15 year old

47
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:12,530
Find it age appropriate. You can go to loot crate comm and check out and again, man. They should be sponsoring this show

48
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,770
Loot crate comm check out the crates. See what they have. I do one thing with my daughter

49
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,720
Have you heard a kidster? No, it's a essentially a

50
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,970
recipe of the month type of

51
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:30,130
Loot crate thing. So every month there's a theme every month

52
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:37,610
We have three recipes and every month she gets some specific tools like it was it sandwiches this month

53
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:45,530
And what I do is my daughter and I it's a it's a father-daughter thing my daughter and I we will pick a recipe

54
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,200
one every weekend and then

55
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,240
As I mentioned, there are only three recipes. So the fourth one

56
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,440
Every week kids sir will send you another recipe and email

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,480
But this month it sandwiches and one of the one of the tools that it came with is a little sandwich cutter

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,080
So it's a it's about the same size as a regular two piece of bread sandwich

59
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,000
But when you squish it down, it's kind of like a cookie cutter when you squish it down on top of your sandwich

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,880
it automatically cuts off the crusts and

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
It cuts it into a little like

62
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
puzzle pieces

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,040
The little four pieces of puzzle stuff and we've used that tool gosh

64
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,520
She

65
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,640
Got it. I think that's kind of awesome like three days after August started and we've used it probably ten times already

66
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,940
That things cool. That's pretty cool

67
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,800
Alright, so as I mentioned neither Loot Crate or kids stir nor kids stir are our

68
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,520
Sponsors, but you know who is yes, I do who?

69
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,900
Coba time Coba time our friends at Cobra time once again sponsoring a be testing

70
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,900
If you don't know what cobit on is let me tell you a little bit about it not in my own words

71
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,740
If you're looking for an easier more affordable way to test your mobile app on real devices

72
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:18,660
Welcome to cobit on the complete mobile device cloud platform that gives you access to test on the latest iOS and Android devices when you need them

73
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,620
For manual to automated testing cobit on is a simpler cost effective way to test your mobile app the way you want with no

74
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,780
Commitment for only ten cents a minute

75
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,160
You can get 100 minutes of testing time for just ten dollars and the best part is that your minutes never expire

76
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,420
Buy the minutes you need use them whenever you want add more when you're ready. It's that easy

77
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,900
So I like this model. I also like that you can do a free trial without a credit card to tell you about that

78
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,800
in a minute

79
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,280
But just buy a chunk of minutes. You can test manually on those devices. You can run automated tests on those devices

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,600
Almost any device you can imagine and if you're building well who's not building a mobile app today

81
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,510
Something like this is I think

82
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:09,030
Absolutely necessary a little more from automatically generated activity logs to one source for your testing history

83
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,030
Cobut on gives you tools you need to find and fix issues faster true

84
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,950
Empowering developers and businesses to get their products to market sooner

85
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:23,750
Test your mobile web and hybrid apps on all the latest devices and configurations from anywhere anytime

86
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:32,150
Sign up for a no commitment free trial at cobut on comm forward slash AB testing to start testing in

87
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,330
minutes and as usual I will post that in the

88
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,590
The blog post that contains this mp3 you're listening to now. I'm I

89
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:48,510
Remain a big fan of cobut on and tools like this and again if you are

90
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,700
Testing mobile apps and you're trying to build your own mobile

91
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:59,340
Lab, please stop. I I can't imagine how it could be cost-effective

92
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,940
Using tools like this and and again by the minute on the paying by the minute scheme

93
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:15,060
Spreading those minutes out across your team running automation being strategic about it all kinds of capital win there

94
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,660
the other thing I was thinking about here is

95
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,300
The

96
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,600
Individual angle is one of the things that I'm seeing a lot when I'm called in to interview developers

97
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,540
I'm seeing a lot of people who are just app developers and they're the only person

98
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:38,760
I don't know. I don't know what if it's cost-effective, but if you're an individual

99
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,520
Right it you certainly not gonna find a better way to scale

100
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,380
It's gonna be more cost-effective if whatever you're building

101
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,240
You need to cross platform thing. This is gonna be way more cost-effective than going out and buying the devices yourself. Absolutely

102
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Although I suppose there's the model of

103
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:06,660
Getting friends who have different devices to try your app out you could just try it out but

104
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,880
mechanical Turk it up

105
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,920
There are other companies are yet sponsors

106
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,860
So I won't mention them by name for crowdsourcing a bunch of those

107
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Crowdsourcing is really grown in the last

108
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,320
A few years especially seems like I see if a new

109
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
crowdsourcing company every few months

110
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,520
It almost feels like

111
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,840
crowdsourcing's

112
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:35,720
Kind of gotten over the plateau and there's no longer the I wonder if it'll get to the tipping point where it's just

113
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,240
Everything is tested by everybody which is a lot of what we do in testing and production

114
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,800
They just do it willingly versus unwillingly

115
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,410
Yeah, it's it's crowdsourcing. It's just a technique now. I think it's not

116
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:55,520
Like a lot of the big crowdsourcing companies. I haven't I haven't heard mention of them in

117
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,400
years

118
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,960
Like like when you test came out you test is still very big applause

119
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,600
Test I owe off the top of my head

120
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,880
again naming companies that are not sponsoring this episode, but

121
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,080
Well, we talked about a lot of things here on a be testing. Hey, I

122
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,820
Had a vacation last week, which was great or let me rephrase that as great as a vacation can be

123
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,580
When you spend it with your extended family

124
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,820
Which is actually pretty good my mother-in-law actually listens to the show sometimes

125
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,580
As I've as I shared on our slack channel one of the three dot slack comm

126
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,900
She says I'm a little harsh on Brent sometimes and I say Brent deserves it

127
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,480
So I'm back and while I was driving hanging out I had really had a nice time

128
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:59,820
But did some kayaking saw some harbor seals did some mountain biking down a mountain Constitution highest point on on Orca silent about

129
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,980
2400 feet

130
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,060
But a good five miles down. I had a lot of fun one thing I pondered is I

131
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,620
Just recently passed my six-month mark at unity

132
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,100
where I've been the director of quality for services and

133
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:22,100
For some reason reflecting back on my time at Microsoft and I spent a chunk of my career at Microsoft

134
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,150
advocating

135
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,710
For the as I say advocating successfully unsuccessfully. I'm not sure but I'll just say advocating for

136
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:36,820
The role the role in career advancement of the individual contributor tester for better or for worse

137
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:41,940
I think at the time it was the right thing to do so no regrets for that

138
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,860
But but that wasn't what I was pondering. I was pondering. I

139
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,860
Wonder I was trying to think how much

140
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:57,380
Time of my career I spent as a manager versus individual contributor despite that big chunk of my career dedicated to the let's

141
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:03,300
Look, I'm an IC role model and look and look what we can do. I see being individual contributor. So

142
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,020
But I have a question for you before I start. Yeah, how did you become a manager?

143
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,460
What was your path at Microsoft? You obviously weren't hired as a manager. How did it happen?

144
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,720
Of course, you didn't even know you're an intern when you're

145
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,120
It was a it was a different Microsoft so

146
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,640
I've held before I came at Microsoft. My very first job was

147
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:38,660
At Carl's Jr. In California, which for those who aren't in California, it's a fast food joint

148
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
And say what you will about that

149
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,340
Like there's still several of the burger recipes that I have memorized I love to cook and

150
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,500
And what's a burger recipe you take hamburger and you fry it?

151
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,850
No, that's how you cook a hamburger. It's a hamburger. The rest of the rest. Oh put lettuce on the bun. Sure

152
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:09,350
All right. Great. Great. All right. Glad you're proud of this. Go on but it actually also solidified

153
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,570
my Spanish skills

154
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,970
Because the no one spoke English in the kitchen

155
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:20,690
That's very cool. Then when I went to college

156
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,970
Was a dishwasher

157
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,370
Then it went up going into a

158
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,650
Grocery store

159
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:38,650
Now the reason why I'm bring all these I was gonna ask. Yeah, I have no idea you're like what what question are you answering?

160
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,290
How did I get into management?

161
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,500
just checking

162
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,970
so

163
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,570
There's something when I when I came up to Microsoft. I mean we I already told the story that that

164
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,750
Around how I came here

165
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:05,120
But I was an intern for six months and then I was a contractor at Microsoft for eight months

166
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,840
And then I shifted the full time and I spent I think a total of six months as an IC and I have been

167
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,710
a manager ever since

168
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,270
Now the

169
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:25,010
What led me to this

170
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:30,090
When I became a when I became a contractor I worked for

171
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,920
what I still view today as the best manager I've ever had and

172
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,760
Even before it was a full-timer. He told me

173
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,880
Brent you're gonna get converted to full-time in the next couple of months and I see you're gonna be a manager within a year and

174
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,340
That actually freaked me out

175
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
he I

176
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,310
Had had in all of other jobs I had had

177
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,850
There's something about my work ethic my style

178
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:07,950
I've noticed that I always get promoted into management pretty quickly

179
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,960
In terms of like the Peter principle they they

180
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,560
they state a

181
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:25,640
common phenomenon is people get promoted in management are often the best workers and I've always had a strong work ethic I

182
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Always wanted to get stuff done

183
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:37,160
So I I knew when he told me that that he was right that I would get promoted into management and it actually freaked me out

184
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,520
Because every other job I had had I had been promoted into management because I was good at doing that individual job

185
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,560
But once I got promoted into management

186
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,160
Getting others to do as I asked was a challenge and I ended up

187
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
in my early

188
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,670
Jobs I ended up going no

189
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:06,310
If I can't get my staff to do it, then I'm gonna do it because it I

190
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,670
My name is on this thing and it's gonna be of high quality

191
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,320
That actually freaked me out

192
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,730
Because every other job I didn't really care if people didn't really listen because there wasn't a consequence

193
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:26,290
Here I was no longer at a job. I was at my career. So I had to pay active attention to what

194
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:32,710
What it meant to be a manager how I got into it is I kicked ass as an IC

195
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:38,630
Should I should I've been promoted into management because of that? No, and there's actually

196
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:46,030
I've I've I've logged on this. There was a study done that says people do actually get promoted

197
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,630
for the wrong reasons and

198
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,680
In this particular case promoted because

199
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:03,260
There's a subconscious belief in humans that they I guess they don't really recognize where it's a fundamentally different

200
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,220
skill

201
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,840
To be awesome at something than it is to get others to be awesome at that thing that you're awesome at

202
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:18,290
Yes, however in this case, I recognize that I worked for a great manager

203
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:24,440
Someone that I could learn from and mentor with and then I had a very

204
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:31,840
When he told me that he gave me sort of a of a timeline and I had a very active

205
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,960
Paying attention to who's succeeding and how are they motivating others and things of that sort? So very early on

206
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,120
I knew I would be going into management but knew that it would be leadership

207
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,560
skill set that

208
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
enabled me to survive it

209
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:56,080
Interesting a lot of things to comment on one just I'll pull out from the middle and then I want to share my story

210
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,800
Cuz it's a little bit different and and I think there's some points

211
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,760
I want to talk about the thing I wanted to bring out is you mentioned something

212
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,620
Very quickly that may have slipped by some people but the job and the career

213
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,520
Yeah, and I've had lots of jobs and quickly my path is

214
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,700
Graduated college taught music in the public school system for four years went back to grad school

215
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,820
After grad school masters in music composition. There's a thought as good as an English degree or maybe slightly worse. I

216
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,820
Worked as a bicycle messenger for about six months

217
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,600
Fell into a job doing tech support at a music software company where I eventually learned

218
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,400
Actually on my first day became a software tester as well and eventually learned to program there

219
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:49,480
from there fell into a contract job at Microsoft that fell into a full-time job at Microsoft and it wasn't until I

220
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,170
Didn't even realize it was a career. It was still just a job to me for the first probably two years

221
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,850
I never thought and today people change jobs every five years as a matter of course

222
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:06,870
It's almost weird that they don't but at the time I never thought I would be at Microsoft as long as I was

223
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,120
so I

224
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,660
Early on in my

225
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,740
career at Microsoft I thought maybe I want to be a lead but really I

226
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,180
I didn't know I didn't care if someone would ask me to be a lead

227
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,780
I would have been a lead and those times in those days. That's kind of the way it worked

228
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,520
I'll say that since I've known you

229
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,080
Until recently until the last few years the majority of time that I've known you you've you've sort of been

230
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,500
anti

231
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,420
Management well, let me tell you that and specifically what I mean is

232
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,700
You felt the the burden of managing people

233
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,740
Let me go out weighed the benefits

234
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,820
Let me go on the subtlety of that because I don't believe there's a burden in managing people in general

235
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,660
But I want to talk about the subtlety of what you observe because there is something there so

236
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,780
Point I was gonna make is my first manager at Microsoft was

237
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,200
We were both like oh my first manager Microsoft was awful

238
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,220
And actually to back up another thing you said I don't think I've ever had a great manager

239
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,580
I've had some good managers some really crummy managers

240
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,460
But I've learned something whether it's something to do something to emulate or something not to do

241
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,220
Or something not to emulate from all of them. So my yep who I've become has been

242
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,820
Formed from my managers, but I've never had a great

243
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,380
Management mentor and I want to go in how I've learned about management in a minute as well

244
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,860
About five years into my Microsoft career. I became a lead and the way I became a lead was

245
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,420
Doing well as an IC. I was writing a lot of code a lot a lot of code

246
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,020
product code debugger code some test code

247
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,660
At the time I was writing the I own maintenance and writing of the debugger for Windows

248
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,840
Also was doing some kernel bug fixes and stuff

249
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,460
I had no right to be doing given my background, but they let me because I somehow managed to make it work

250
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,020
Anyway, I went to my boss said I you got to take some stuff off my plate

251
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,340
I I love working. I was I was single I was working

252
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,580
5060 hours a week and loving it. It wasn't a work-life balance thing. I enjoyed it

253
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,940
It was exhilarating, but I said I can't it's just too much. I'm getting overwhelmed. He goes

254
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,620
Oh, we actually have a new hire starting on the team on Monday. How about he works for eating help you?

255
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,660
I said great. So wait a minute you tricked me

256
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,500
And

257
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:35,540
Then some other things like oh this person is working on the stress tools. They use the debugger. He should work for you, too

258
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,820
and and over that team morphed into another team and

259
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:47,980
So I would end up being a manager for about those I drew some lines on the whiteboard wall print was talking

260
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,660
But they're wrong. I think I ended up being a manager for about four years

261
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,220
total

262
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,300
growing up to a team of about 35 40 people

263
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,250
And I was four years total at Microsoft

264
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,680
Well four years total in that stint. Oh, okay. Okay in that stance gotcha

265
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,780
At the end of it towards the end Microsoft created this test architect role

266
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,380
And my manager said you actually would be really good in this role and I said, I don't know anything about testing

267
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,060
So yeah, you do and that's when I started to really study testing

268
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,980
So if I'm gonna get this test architect role, I'm gonna figure that I don't know what this means

269
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,300
And part of that role was to trance was it took about six months because it said I want you to move in this test

270
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,460
Architect role that could be great at it

271
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,180
But you have to help figure out who's gonna lead your team and grow someone into that role took about six months to find

272
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:40,420
The right I think I knew who the right person was but to get them ready for that role. I had never studied

273
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:48,700
Management at that point. I knew nothing other than just my what was in my soul and my guts and what you'd seen from

274
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,100
And what I'd seen from examples, so I was very hands-off which worked

275
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,660
Well, which is kind of how I am now, but it works better in the culture here than at Microsoft

276
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,380
one of the reasons I didn't like management is

277
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:08,960
Was really one of the reasons I didn't like school teaching. I loved teaching kids to play music

278
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,540
That part of my day was fantastic

279
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,500
Dealing with all of the BS bureaucracy and red tape was one of the reasons I never went back to teaching

280
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,250
and

281
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:27,010
At Microsoft especially at that time and it got better in later years, but at that time and for a long period there

282
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,040
management required a lot of bureaucracy and red tape and

283
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,200
Fitting into fitting everything into very good boxes and the training they offered

284
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:44,720
Generally management training I see is not about how to be a good manager for your team and how to

285
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,560
And how to be a good leader for them how to set good examples. It's about how to not get yourself in legal trouble

286
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,660
Yeah, so I became a test architect for about four or five years

287
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,740
The last few of that I was in engineering excellence when that group

288
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:07,500
I think actually made a difference of Microsoft I took over as the director of test excellence for almost two years

289
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,120
Could you take over from?

290
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,960
Nimrod I I only say Nimrod because that's what his name resolved to an autocorrect

291
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,040
Is alias Jim James Rodriguez Jim Rodriguez who Jim rod not Nimrod

292
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,440
Yeah, but I typed up Jim rod in a word doc it autocorrected to Nimrod

293
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,040
So I that's how I that's my that's my trigger to remember his name Jim Rodriguez. He was only there for about six months

294
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,520
He replaced Ken Johnston who was actually one of my better managers at Microsoft. I didn't realize Ken was

295
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:44,010
Was in that role. Yeah, Ken hired me into that team. I took over for Jim EE started really going downhill

296
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,090
I left took an IC role. That was always my plan

297
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,750
I was even though I was a lead of a team of five people there

298
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,290
My plan was to always leave to an IC rule

299
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:59,610
I went I continued on my I see career path stuff for a while through link and then through Xbox one and

300
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:02,370
then through the science project and then

301
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,250
became a lead again

302
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:08,090
in the Microsoft Teams team

303
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:13,470
but at this point now the difference between this stint in management and

304
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,690
Even in my EE and especially in my first stint is at this point. I had actually

305
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,500
read

306
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,070
10 20 books on

307
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:30,190
Management so I had and the story I tell about software testing. It's a first read a book about testing

308
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,550
I thought I knew everything about testing

309
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,550
I read another book started to get different ideas

310
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:39,030
When I read a third and fourth and fifth and sixth and seventh book is when I began to form my own opinions

311
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,550
And the same thing happens reading books on management and leadership

312
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:49,430
Mm-hmm, and it's just as hard to learn to be a good manager as it is to become a good programmer and I

313
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:54,190
Don't think enough people in management positions put that

314
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,510
Realize that and I didn't realize that the first time I did it either and I think

315
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:05,630
Not many managers the first time to become a manager do but I think by the time you've done it for a while

316
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,630
by the time you've made your

317
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:14,510
Second or third stint at it fifth or sixth year at it you better have started to study some things not just directly about management

318
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,470
But reading books like drive to understand how what motivates people looking at

319
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,540
Other books on my favorite so drive is a good book on just what motivates people

320
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,300
Some of my favorites are Michael ops book on managing humans

321
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,700
He he didn't read that one. He talks about the skill and the will matrix, which I use a lot

322
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:40,850
Okay, high skill high will low skill low will high skill low will I will skill

323
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,240
People generally follow one of those but unlike a bucket model of stack ranking

324
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,520
Genuinely want to try and manage your team towards high skill high will positions where they're in the and I know we've talked about this

325
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,040
before coffee shop

326
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:00,260
You have people of low skill you can get them training get them coaching mentoring people with low will may be on the wrong job

327
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,540
But you want to get people the right work that makes them the most productive and most beneficial to your team

328
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,540
there's a

329
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,380
Actually a really good book. I read

330
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:15,650
Fairly recently. It's called the manager's path and I forget the author

331
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:22,210
But it talks all the way through like first becoming a lead to becoming a lead of leads to being a director and kind of the different

332
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,410
Things you take on it's a pretty quick read pretty well written

333
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:31,170
I'm about three-quarters the way through a book written by a Google exec whose name I have forgotten former Google exec

334
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,870
Called radical candor. Have you read this book? Nope?

335
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,410
I think it's a very good as well. The reason it's very good is the reason I say it's very good

336
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,530
Is I tend to fall in love with books that echo my own values

337
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,560
Because and there's things I've built up now that I've read a bunch of these books

338
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:53,460
I like oh, yeah, this is either it solidifies or Marty thinking gives me a new way to think about some things

339
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,460
I've been thinking

340
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:01,440
Everybody wants validation. They do they do and just be careful though because

341
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,560
Every time you get validation validation balance it with

342
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,900
Okay, great

343
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:17,380
There's a 5% chance that both me and this book are wrong, which is why I keep reading so I can everything

344
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,040
Everything is a minor course correction at this time. It's like, okay

345
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,540
Yeah, and it's not like I wrote the book. It's gonna have some things like oh, I haven't thought of this before

346
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:32,580
It's a great idea. Yeah, but I've had a good time learning that so anyway, that was my path where I was going

347
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,700
I forgot where I was going. So I've been in and out of management

348
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:44,700
I can't count the time but I've probably been an IC more than a manager, but I have been really more than any time at Microsoft

349
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,060
For a lot of reasons. I don't want to go in the hole unity is awesome Microsoft sucks thing

350
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,620
But they're just different companies at different stages of maturity

351
00:28:51,620 --> 00:29:00,020
I have really enjoyed my time as a manager at unity to haven't exactly put my finger on why yet. I think

352
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,300
One thing is though a lot of it is just there's just so much freedom in how I do it

353
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,980
Let me offer a suggestion. Yes, then I'll go back to my subject. Okay

354
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:15,740
first and foremost like over the years I have read just a ton of

355
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,800
books as well and part of

356
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Just like what you mentioned

357
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,820
Every manager that I've ever had

358
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:30,390
Some of their style their philosophy got incorporated into my own

359
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:36,000
It's now at a point where it's really challenging to go. Okay, what's the difference between these guys?

360
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:42,400
I'll say the first manager I ever had was absolutely worse and I absolutely know what

361
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,120
What I will never do as a result of the things

362
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
He did when I reported to him

363
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,440
But and the other thing I would say the thing that that I find kind of quirky

364
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,160
Like it seems like every management book if you don't have your own variant of a truth square

365
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,360
You're not building a proper management book

366
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,480
Every single one of them has their own variant of the truth square. Yeah, but you mentioned the skill vish as well

367
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,760
I actually like I can't pronounce the guy's name

368
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,800
So and I'm not even gonna try out of respect, but it's a it's concept of flow. Yeah

369
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,800
But there was another one and I don't remember the guy's name

370
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,440
I'd like to give him credit, but he came over this concept that I've actually used

371
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:40,560
With all of my employees ever since I learned it that really what you're trying to do is a as a human being is

372
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,130
You're trying to align

373
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,210
your

374
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:48,210
value system your

375
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,730
strengths

376
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:56,010
With a business that shares those values and actually that's what I think you've done with going to unity

377
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,780
You you are highly adaptable you like strategic thinking

378
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,240
You like the freedom and not to be bogged down by

379
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:12,420
bureaucracy and the big thing is is I like to be trusted yeah, I think

380
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,460
maybe

381
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:16,840
I'll put this nicely. I think

382
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,480
My experience at Microsoft as a manager was there was and again for very good reasons and not a big knock

383
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,340
But almost too many guardrails put in place

384
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,640
Yeah, and then

385
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,330
When you're gonna get to a particular size, there's there's there's a lot of philosophies

386
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,530
This is a company thing. There's a lot of philosophies that

387
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,320
Move

388
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,000
forward unquestioned

389
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,440
right am and that that ends up being part of the ecosystem now and it didn't and there's a

390
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Steven blank

391
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,160
is

392
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,880
probably my favorite author on

393
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,840
Rise and fall of companies going from sort of the startup mentality to

394
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,600
Taking over the world and he's studied it very well

395
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,650
But this other guy

396
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,190
Here's what I tell people and this is again not mine

397
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:22,450
But what everyone's looking for is a job

398
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:27,010
That is the center of the following three

399
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,730
You can think of it as a Venn diagram

400
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:32,470
number one everyone

401
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,610
Has a set of things that they do well

402
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,920
Everyone also has a set of things that they like to do

403
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,880
lastly

404
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,700
There's a set of things that you can be paid to do

405
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:56,160
Yep, and really you want to find something? That's all three and honestly Alan

406
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,440
I think that's that's what it feels like you've done. So

407
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,400
Yes, perhaps perhaps so I have a question

408
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,620
I want to get I want to ask you but I need to address some things and

409
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,380
Evolve some things and not get lose my train of thought in that process

410
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,340
So what I just want to be clear that skill on the well matrix was an example

411
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:19,220
It's not the center of my management philosophy and I think

412
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:27,380
One thing I've used more often is the ACB thing which I'm working on renaming to I forget what I've

413
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,020
renamed it to the most recently but another model and as

414
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,180
Managers, we should build these models as much as we have I don't want to compare them to design patterns

415
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,340
but just have some models for how you

416
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:45,230
Can maybe find the center of that Venn diagram and one I use this ACB thing

417
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,850
New name I'll blog about it sometime, but you have some stretch work some above work

418
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,250
Stuff that makes you learn if you're not doing any work that's making you learn new stuff

419
00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:00,510
Or if you're not giving your employees work that makes them learn new stuff. They're not growing and they're not they're just stagnant

420
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:03,690
Yep, then you have a chunk of stuff that you're just good at

421
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:09,070
It's it's it's worked. It needs to be done. Of course. It's that current that concrete stuff

422
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,130
The stuff in the milk duck is in your wheelhouse stuff

423
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,130
You're great at and then every once in a while we have to do some kind of grunt work

424
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:19,290
Yeah, I have to go, you know shovel out the horse banner in software

425
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,570
I need to go I need to be the guy that goes make sure all these VMs are up and running

426
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:28,610
Because I don't have an automated tool for it. Whatever it is some sort of it's not it's not stretch work

427
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,690
It's not something I'm it needs to be done. So I'm gonna jump in and do it for me

428
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,170
It was I'm gonna go fix a bunch of these static analysis bugs

429
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,130
I don't really want to do it, but it's a good place for me to jump in

430
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:43,050
So it's an example of a model and we have multiple of these models and that that

431
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,180
This in the Venn diagram and the skill of the will there's a lot of overlap

432
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,420
There's another Venn overlap between what those target but the point is

433
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,000
Through observing through your own experiences through your own values

434
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,300
Through what you read and discover in books what you read and discover on the internet

435
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,920
Both in blogs and I think hbr.org is a great

436
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:12,240
Source for a lot of great ideas and management leadership. That's where I first saw the hint of what I later

437
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:18,890
Developed more into the world of Warcraft guide to project management, which I've mentioned before so I won't do now

438
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,510
I can elaborate later if if someone gets in the mailbag and chooses

439
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,950
So if you want to get good at it, you have to

440
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:32,530
Absorb from a whole bunch of different sources and from that form your own management philosophy

441
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,730
So my question even that's not good enough. You have to act you have to try things out

442
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,750
Yeah, and I tell my team this is part of my management philosophies. I tell my team is

443
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:47,970
Everything I do is sort of in the agile way. So I'm gonna try shit all the time and

444
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,310
Before it's perfected before it's complete

445
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:55,790
I'm gonna try and see if it works and if it is we'll do more of it or elaborate and if not

446
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,790
I'll throw it away and we'll do it again

447
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,590
All the time always try and crap always trying to see what works

448
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,030
so I want to lead that that's part of what I do and

449
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:13,190
But let me ask you do you have and if so, can you share the Brent Jensen?

450
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:18,450
Management philosophy. How do you what are your what are the core things you try and do as a manager?

451
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,450
You have you thought about this before I thought

452
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,890
At a abstract. Yes

453
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,000
It's it's actually very easy

454
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,150
So, what are my guardrails?

455
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,950
Okay, first and foremost

456
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:40,700
I will communicate myself as my my

457
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,900
Teams manager just because that's the easiest way to explain the concept. Okay

458
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:54,650
First and foremost, I don't view myself as my teams manager. I view myself as their MSP. Oh

459
00:36:55,290 --> 00:37:01,010
God, it's an acronym. It is I view myself as their management service provider

460
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:06,110
Okay, and every time I share it that's what I get I get giggles

461
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:09,740
Because it sounds very manage managerial

462
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,620
I can see the pointy here growing out the side of your head now

463
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:20,540
But there's an important distinction and why I view MSP as a better way of describing it than manager

464
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:26,850
Because if I'm so let's say Alan I was your management service provider

465
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,130
Okay

466
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,770
versus your manager

467
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,120
the difference is

468
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,060
Who fires who ah?

469
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,690
Okay, if I'm your MSP, you're my customer

470
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,850
not my

471
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,970
slave or

472
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,570
work doer

473
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,210
so by by

474
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,010
reinforcing myself as an MSP it

475
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:01,930
It helps me to stay balanced at what my job is actually to do

476
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,300
It's to help

477
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,840
grow

478
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,450
Not only the project but you Alan if you leave my team

479
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,820
You fired me. Okay, and

480
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:20,220
Now if it's mutual for example, there are many times

481
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,780
Actually just this last year that I had a report and I could tell

482
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,410
That what he could be

483
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:31,450
He was out of balance the stuff he liked to do

484
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,240
He could be paid to do the stuff

485
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,060
He did well on my team, but it wasn't the stuff he liked to do and I'm like

486
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,500
Let's let's find you a different place

487
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,130
The second

488
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,760
The MSP is a is a big one

489
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,640
The second thing that really is the other guardrail and it's probably aligned with

490
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,600
the first and some great degree

491
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:09,360
10 years from now the code that you're working on today is irrelevant and

492
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,640
In pretty much anyone listening to this podcast. This is going to be for the most part true

493
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,320
I'm happy to like one of the things that I'm happy with

494
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,120
I've mentioned this before I have a test harness that I patented back in 1998

495
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
That thing is still in use

496
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,920
This surprises me

497
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:42,260
I'm well, I'm a little I kind of know why because the way we designed it we designed it to be

498
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,500
adaptable and flexible

499
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,180
But that's a rarity

500
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,580
What persists though 10 years from now are those people?

501
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,340
Who you interacted with?

502
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:05,690
So as a management, I'm like we're here to to get things done grow the career grow the business

503
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:13,290
But I do view myself as more beholden to the the people I work with and

504
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:22,160
Work underneath me than anything else. Okay, so though that's the primary guardrails for me. Okay, so

505
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,240
You could work on concise in that up a little bit, but I get it

506
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:29,840
so mine simples I have two big points in mine and

507
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,840
These have come from again my own values and finding things that I've liked and latched onto from some of the things I've studied

508
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,600
So I'm gonna talk about I think two books. I haven't talked about

509
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,680
which

510
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:47,360
again, they yeah, that's how I would like to do with that that fits how I function and

511
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,480
Very similar to the MSP. You've probably never read

512
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,240
Reed Hoffman's book called the Alliance

513
00:40:54,170 --> 00:41:00,930
Yeah, Reed Hoffman is one of the founders of LinkedIn. I wrote a book called the Alliance. It says in today's workforce

514
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:07,210
It's not the job like my dad got a job out of high school and worked there till pretty much till he retired

515
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,930
Consulting for the last five years of his career, but he worked at this company for like 30 years

516
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,810
That world does not exist for most people anymore

517
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,130
although I've worked at Microsoft for 22, but

518
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,450
Things happen the differences is like say say you work for me

519
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,010
Okay, so similar to the MSP

520
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,770
But you didn't talk about what's in it for you and we're gonna make an alliance for different kinds of alliances

521
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:32,170
Can be they're like a tour of duty is what Reed Hoffman calls him

522
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:38,890
Let's take a given time period a year six months 18 months. Here's what we're gonna accomplish together

523
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:44,130
I am going to help you be successful in your job by doing a B and C and

524
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:49,770
in that that's going to help me and the company be successful by doing DE and F and

525
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:54,110
We have a packed an alliance together because I think that goes two ways

526
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:58,870
I think I get the MSP thing because I my job is to help you be successful

527
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,510
But I also recognize that in helping you to be successful

528
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:06,190
I need we need to both agree to understand how that helps the company and

529
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:12,390
In me in some cases be successful as well. We need to grow together in this journey in this alliance

530
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:17,010
Yeah, then at the end of that alliance, we can either re-up we can

531
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,930
Go our separate ways

532
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,750
I may help you move to another team or a different company if it's a better fit like you talked about

533
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,410
Or we can do a different kind of a maybe we're doing a transformational alliance like you want to move to a

534
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:36,330
Data science architect role and for example a different rule like with my manage helped me move to a

535
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:41,850
From a manager just architect role. We're gonna take like here's what I'm gonna get at the end

536
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,850
Here's what you're gonna get at the end. Let's work on this together. We're in it together. Mm-hmm

537
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:49,290
So it's a slight variation on your MSP

538
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:54,170
But it says in practicality, it's it's very much the same

539
00:42:54,690 --> 00:43:02,090
Yeah, like in order in order in order to in order for me to be a solid MSP

540
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:06,890
I have to guide those people

541
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,200
Towards the center of the Venn diagram with the with the business constraints, right? I I

542
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,240
Cannot put them in a position

543
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,080
Well, I mean I can but it's foolish

544
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,400
I can put them in a position where they only do the things that they do well and they like to do

545
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,320
But they can't get paid for and my paid for I've mapped that to sort of the review model like great

546
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,960
You can do these two things

547
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,240
but

548
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,240
This is what's gonna happen at the review model

549
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:46,000
That's let's continue searching for the thing that's that's gonna be right in the center in terms of the partnership and the alliance

550
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,520
Stuff like what you described very aptly is is a hundred percent

551
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:54,000
number one the best relationships the best

552
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,380
managers I've ever had

553
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,140
is where

554
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,640
they've

555
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,800
Didn't view me as a report, but viewed me as their peer

556
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,520
They're part of the team. I think they're ally great. And one of the things anecdotally I've heard from

557
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,240
Multiple people on my team without me even like trying to do this was they just appreciated that I was there to bounce ideas off

558
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,440
Oh, and I thought well geez, what else would I do as a manager?

559
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,640
That's like one of the best services as you put it I can provide right? I'm happy. I have some experience

560
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,040
I have some ideas

561
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,500
by all means bounce your ideas off of me and then cross team like this alliance model if you're

562
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:44,550
The other the other thing it's not really related to management, but one of my driving philosophies is

563
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,710
NIH kicks ass

564
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:52,710
and for those who are not familiar with the the acronym NIH is not invented here and

565
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,340
You really need to create and grow

566
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,940
Negotiation skills and practice

567
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,700
creating win-win scenarios

568
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:09,060
To make these Alliance

569
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,980
models work across team. Yeah, and

570
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:19,840
Plenty and plenty of nuance there before I run out of time the other half of my the second of my 12

571
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,840
No, pretty much two

572
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,880
things that drive me as a manager or

573
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:29,820
Frameworks, I rely on one is the Alliance model. Other one is taken. Have you ever read Steve Dening's book?

574
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:35,600
You know Steve Dening is yes business author writes for Forbes magazine all the time. He is a

575
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,720
not a software guy a business guy who discovered agile and says and just

576
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,370
kind of embraced it in the business sense and wrote a book called the leaders guide to radical management and

577
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:55,520
You can it barely mentions agile but you can see some of the agile principles seeping through his ideas and how to lead a team and

578
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:02,200
One of the things from his book is basically give your team a framework they can work in and then get out of their way

579
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:07,510
Amen, and that's I've always had that philosophy. One of the reasons my last team

580
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,650
really

581
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,930
Graded on me. I mentioned my blood pressures going down

582
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:19,210
It was a team driven by micromanagement and that is just not who I am. I want to give I don't want to

583
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,270
I don't ignore my team at all

584
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,410
But I do want to give them I want to give them their own guardrails

585
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,710
Make sure they know what our alliance is where we're going what they need to do and then

586
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:34,610
Give them room to learn and to grow and ask questions and I have some people doing really well. I have to

587
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,890
challenge them to

588
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,250
Learn more to one of the guardrails I put up is you must learn to be successful on this team

589
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,250
So what did you learn this week?

590
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,570
but

591
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:53,650
Building a framework around I the things I value the things I think that will make the individual and the company successful and

592
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:56,650
Talk about those to the team make sure they know

593
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:05,450
What those things are and then get out of their way they need to they need some room to grow and learn I do this with the

594
00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:10,390
Obviously the more junior people do a little bit more hand-holding but at some stage

595
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:18,990
I expect this is probably especially true on a team that's geographically dispersed, but I expect independence and autonomy

596
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:23,070
Yeah, as you were talking it reminded me of

597
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,780
The safe planning event and

598
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:34,970
Try to do it in in a in a succinct nutshell so I can I can drive my point home

599
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:41,010
Right what first and foremost what they are saying when safe does this planning?

600
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,830
Right, there's the fail-fast principle. There is

601
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:50,390
accountability and there is a power empowerment and

602
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:54,090
Probably a topic for another day

603
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:59,830
But we could philosophize on can you have empowerment without a catability?

604
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:06,120
The my short answer is no in a safe planning meeting. You have a bunch of scrum teams

605
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,080
Let's say five okay, and they are treated

606
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,760
Independently so they are they are

607
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,840
Proactively assigned items that they're gonna own for the sprint

608
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:21,010
at the very beginning and

609
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:29,930
The neat thing about a safe planning event is essentially in two days you plan out the entire three months I

610
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:34,620
Did this a couple years ago at Microsoft?

611
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:39,360
and it's the first time in my entire career at Microsoft where a

612
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:46,060
Plan that was built in us in essentially a day for a team of 40

613
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,340
Was nailed on time to the day it was

614
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,830
Really freaking cool anyway. I think I think it's a fluke but go on

615
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:01,070
They so I left shortly after that and they continued to be able to do that

616
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,230
No, it's it's it's the model. It's because knowledge is

617
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,130
shared up front

618
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,810
We can go into bigger detail

619
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:20,340
At so the planning event so you you get assigned these tasks and then the teams can horse trade amongst other teams

620
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:26,500
And so if they got assigned a task it makes more sense for another on another scrum team than on theirs

621
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,380
They're allowed to trade these things across. Okay?

622
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,580
they have to go through the process of building a

623
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:40,100
Sprint plan breaking these things down into stories and at the end of it they say okay based off of our resourcing

624
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:47,460
These are the objectives we're gonna accomplish and before a single line of code and every sprint team has to do this

625
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:54,020
They say these are our objectives. We're gonna accomplish sprint by sprint and these are our stretch objectives

626
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:57,810
now the thing that I think is fascinating is

627
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:04,890
At the end of this there is a team that serves as the business team and they go sprint team by sprint team

628
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:09,970
They look at the objectives and then they score what's known as business value points

629
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:13,250
now that business value points

630
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:16,350
the value of that is is

631
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,960
Now so planning has gone through then we now have an execution plan

632
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,440
We now have a solid vision for the sprint now the business team is going through

633
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,520
They're realizing that what they were hoping for

634
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,330
Versus the reality of what's going to get delivered is now with they know that within a couple of days

635
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:37,650
in

636
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:44,130
Addition to because they have to go and put these business value points. They now communicate feedback back to

637
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,960
That's that

638
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,790
Scrum team each of your objective. This is what we think is the worth of these objectives

639
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:58,890
So even before a line of code you have a complete three month end-to-end plan

640
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:06,600
Including a fail fast opportunity. Was that too much? You didn't understand that no

641
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:12,920
I understood I not quite understand the segue from give people a framework that can work and then get out of their way

642
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,320
Yes, so it's it's it's it's not just good get out of their way

643
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,740
You still are accountable to be the representative for the business

644
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:27,150
Right and what this does is it gives it is a framework that

645
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:34,570
Allows management and the execution team to work copacetically together. Gotcha

646
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:41,730
The one thing I'd the other book I'll throw in there that you sprinkle in with the denning thing is the one-minute manager

647
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:43,610
Which is knowing yeah

648
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:48,630
When rather than manage all the time micromanage just know that even if you're out of their way

649
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:54,690
You have to pay enough attention to know when to dive in make course corrections before it's too late fail fast

650
00:51:54,890 --> 00:52:00,150
Whatever you need to do jump in take care of the whatever correction you make and then step back out of the way

651
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:05,280
And that's frankly how I scale across a team of a large number of vector ports

652
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,720
How and it's not that I guess the thing the way you said it because a lot of the ways managers

653
00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:14,760
Implement that and I've seen a lot of people do that. They do it in a reactive style. They're like, okay

654
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,500
I'm gonna give them the freedom freedom until they screwed up

655
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,780
This model tells it tells people up front

656
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:24,220
This is what we see

657
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,880
That's the value and what you're planning to produce

658
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,980
Yeah, I think and my love that pro activity and the ad that to build yeah, and I think that support

659
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,620
You do need to be proactive about not wait for recognize

660
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,000
Don't wait for it to fail completely but recognize that old things are a little off course. Let me as I've been here

661
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,260
Give a little coaching a lot of I do more coaching and then I do managing

662
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,000
Yeah, definitely

663
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,720
Anyway, I think we're about out of time, but this was a fun little digression into management. Thank you, right?

664
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,200
One last thing

665
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:03,720
Sure, thank you and you're welcome. Me neither as a manager

666
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:07,920
If you want to fake it till you make it and you don't know what you're doing

667
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,510
Then if there's only if there's one technique you could do that get you most of the way there

668
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:20,880
It's just study the Socratic method just ask questions

669
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:28,550
Okay, maybe more on that next time. Maybe all right. See I'm still Alan and

670
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:30,690
I-am-not

671
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,690
We'll see you next time. Bye
