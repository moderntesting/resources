1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:17,520
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,230
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started. We're back again for another

4
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,990
episode of ABT 343 and we have one of our three listeners with us today. Today we have

5
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:36,430
Percy Ababa. Say hi, Percy. Hi everyone. I hope the other two is out and about and we'll be

6
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,550
listening to this. Yeah, we'll get this out sometime during the holiday season. Happy to

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,430
have you here, getting a lot of great feedback on this series. So glad to have someone who's

8
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,950
practically a show regular here today. Percy was on the show we did without Brent in Philadelphia

9
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,070
three years ago, four years ago now, maybe four years. Yeah. Wow. A while back. Yeah, three,

10
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:07,310
four. Yeah. And then also took part in our 100th episode and is the creator of,

11
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,590
in a way, the creator of one of the three.slack.com. He put our Slack group together first.

12
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:21,330
Yeah, I was just the guy who signed up. Yeah, there's a lot of credit to be the

13
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,760
guy who signs up for stuff. Yeah, I do think that it's something that's inevitable. I'm not

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:36,000
going to pull a Thanos here, but it's something that would have happened. I mean, there is

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,760
definitely an acceleration among the listeners and the feedback, especially with how you and Brent

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,040
are talking about the mailbag questions that you guys get. It's like, man, how come nobody's ever

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,400
tried to bring everybody together to something that's kind of like 10,000 conversations permanent?

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,360
Yeah. One of the things we talk about, I was in a conversation on Reddit over the weekend with

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,640
someone who was very confused about modern testing. And in this conversation, I didn't

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,880
plan to bring this up. A nice tangent to start off with. He said, and I don't know the quote in

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,920
front of me, but he said, an agile is getting phased out. And I said, what, what do you mean

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,400
agile is getting phased out? I think it's market driven and it helps. He goes, well,

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:32,000
it's being replaced by CICD. And I thought maybe you don't understand what any of these words mean.

24
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,200
So yeah, CICD is a way to achieve the agile principles. And he got into another conversation

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,480
which involves modern testing. It's not there to be something new to try and push the industry

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,640
in some direction. We're just putting a label on some things that are already happening. And

27
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,760
many teams have come up with modern testing approaches without knowing modern testing.

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,120
And some people recognize this change is happening and want some tools and ideas to help navigate

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
how to survive or how to best transition this move.

30
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,800
Right. And I think this is actually a really good segue into the transition guide, right?

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,360
Which is, you know, it's not a thing that you're supposed to be able to follow and decide,

32
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,900
specifically tell you what to do so that you can get to the next kind of level of the capabilities.

33
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,420
It's a way for you to evaluate and understand where you are. And then from there, you can

34
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:41,870
build your backlog on what you could do, whether the focus is going to be on tooling or skills or

35
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,670
blend of both or improving the process. But at the end of the day, knowing what your team is capable

36
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:54,750
of, breaking down whatever assumptions you have on what a thing is or what a thing is supposed to be.

37
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,790
You're definitely better off from there, but that's just the first step. There's a lot more

38
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,270
that needs to be done to get you to the point where, for example, you're switching from

39
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,870
chaos to growing, for example, right? From your testing breath capability. So it's definitely

40
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,220
a good way to look into where you are. Yeah. So Percy is talking about for,

41
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,460
if any of the other two haven't seen it, is the Quality Cultural Transition Guide,

42
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,660
which goes along with Principle Number 4, which is the one that says we care deeply about the

43
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,020
quality of our team and we coach and lead and nurture them towards a more mature quality culture.

44
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:43,460
This is the one where 20 years ago, we may have had some managers, some more say testing is

45
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,380
responsible for quality, which we know is stupid. We knew it was stupid then. We know it's even more

46
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,780
stupid now. But I would say even today that as we're making this transition, that testers or the

47
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,980
people formerly known as testers need to be a big part and have some responsibility for driving

48
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,660
the quality culture. And this spreadsheet I put together on the Quality Culture Transition Guide

49
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:12,220
is some tips on how to help, not even to, actually, this is what missing, what you are going to talk

50
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:19,100
about is it's a list of descriptions of how you can mature your quality culture in several different

51
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:28,220
ways. But what's missing is the guidebook. What are the tips that help you? How do you do that?

52
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,180
How do you, this is nice to read all this stuff, but I'll open this first question up to you,

53
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,360
Percy, is how do you lead a team towards a higher quality culture? You have a guidebook,

54
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,520
but you have some rules, but no guidebook. What do you do?

55
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:51,340
Personally, for me, based on my own experience, one of the biggest detractors for this is not

56
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,940
really having a shared mindset, that that's really number one. So when we say that something

57
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,140
is something that not everybody agrees on the same definition, I mean, look, the quality itself

58
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:09,820
is a big question here, but getting everybody in the same spot, we talk about what do you actually

59
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:17,970
mean when you say regression testing, for example, which is probably an entire podcast on itself and

60
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,130
why that name doesn't really describe what we're trying to do when it comes to performing the set

61
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,610
of testing activities that we have for that, I guess, coined term. So the shared mindset is

62
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,810
definitely key. Getting everybody on a regular basis so that you will continuously communicate,

63
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:45,330
be able to encourage everybody that, hey, this is not the end all and be all of what you know about

64
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:55,310
what we're doing. So if you have test specialists, as testers, you have to have the desire to learn

65
00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,590
some more and expand that circle of comfortability when it comes to just, okay, I'm just

66
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,710
testing this ticket, like what are the things that will be affected if I don't do this well.

67
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:14,290
At the end of the day, it's essentially a people problem, right? It's not going to be a knowledge

68
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:21,710
thing or a process thing, but like how do we get these set of people who you call as your team

69
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:28,910
members to share that mindset? There's going to be complications around how often people move in

70
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,990
and out of your team or depending on the resourcing model that you have within your company

71
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,670
on how you'd be able to deal with that. But yeah, that's just really the tip of the iceberg on the

72
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:47,710
challenges that you have with making sure that you have a common mindset on what we actually

73
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,150
think our quality culture is and where we need to be.

74
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,150
What are some things, and I agree. In fact, the definition I use of quality culture,

75
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,710
the first three words are a shared mindset, 100% on board. But how do you do that? What

76
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,950
are some things you can do to help build that shared mindset?

77
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,350
One of the things that we've tried so far has really been setting up a community of practice,

78
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,110
which is really just a fancy way of saying, hey, let's all come together. Let's talk about

79
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:23,630
something that we've learned, and then we'll break that out into something that we can actually

80
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:30,910
apply across the board. Or does it open itself up to more questions, more scrutiny? But at least

81
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:38,690
we're all doing it together. There's definitely going to be a few people who will take over the

82
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:46,530
conversation in the first few meetings. But as you go along, as everybody realizes that, hey,

83
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:53,570
this is a safe space for us to be in, to express our concerns, our questions, and encourage them

84
00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:04,610
that, hey, no question is wrong. It's just a matter of you being able to either understand,

85
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:11,170
why are you actually asking that question? What is the context around why something is important

86
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:19,170
to you that needs to be broken apart? It puts you in a position where you give up whatever

87
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,970
assumptions you have and declare them on the table.

88
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,970
Yeah, I've been thinking through that while you were talking. It's a fun challenge. It's

89
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,770
a leadership challenge. I think, of course, there's the other things you can do. Just when you see

90
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,940
people do things that are... I'll back up a little bit. Quality culture is a very easy

91
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,580
thing to hand wave about. I've talked with plenty of teams that, yes, we care about quality,

92
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,860
but when you look one level deeper, there's a huge bug backlog. There's

93
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:55,070
massive amounts of tech debt and customers are angry. Those two things don't align.

94
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,620
You have to get past the hand-waving part and actually get some agreement and some alignment

95
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,740
and that shared mindset and make sure it's really true and do the things like rewarding

96
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,780
the behaviors you want to see and course correcting and realizing it's definitely

97
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,140
a marathon, not a sprint. It takes a while to get that culture. One of the stories I often

98
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:23,020
tell is how Microsoft got their security culture, which is one of the few examples I can ever recall

99
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,620
where a culture was created via mandate. It's a big bet. It's an expensive bet. It doesn't

100
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,580
always work, but in 2000, at Microsoft, year 2000, Code Red, Slammer, the I Love You virus,

101
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,020
we're all back to back to back exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft software.

102
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:47,420
And the whole company went offline for about a month where we took maybe it was longer.

103
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:54,220
There was massive security trainings and threat models that across the board and code review

104
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,740
tools or added analysis tools to find these potential, many potential errors. But that

105
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,260
quality culture lives through to today, or that's the quality culture, the security culture

106
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:12,580
lives through to today. Two completely different things. And I don't know that that worked because

107
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,620
there was a crisis. And usually by the time a company has a quality crisis, it's too late

108
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,540
and they're about to go under. So the challenge with building a quality culture is trying to

109
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,100
build that culture before it becomes an urgent issue. If your customers are all complaining and

110
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,820
you can't even get a build done because the CICD is broken or your build system is broken,

111
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:41,970
and there's just no way to get the work done, then it's kind of too late to build that quality

112
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,970
culture. You're digging out from the bottom of the hole where it's better to try and kick that

113
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,570
off. When things are running pretty smooth and people go, oh yeah, we're doing well.

114
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,730
You can use that quality culture transition guide to figure out, okay, how can we turn up the

115
00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:02,750
notch? What can we do even better? Right. One of the things I think to be able to rally everyone

116
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:10,190
towards a particular goal is figuring out what is that shared priority that everybody has.

117
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:17,310
And that is a very difficult. It's a very elusive thing to deal with, especially when you have

118
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:28,420
multiple teams or if you have 140,000 employee companies. And that's kind of the need of

119
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:35,940
rallying point where you can start bringing things up. So let's say if we talk about Agile,

120
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:46,530
for example, because of the success of folks at Scrum, a lot of the misconceptions now when it

121
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:52,770
comes to Agile is that Agile equals Scrum and then Scrum equals the rituals.

122
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,650
That drives me crazy. Which is not. And like,

123
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:01,090
which is probably what was meant when that guy said that when they said

124
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,810
Agile was evolving into CICD, they probably acquitted Agile and Scrum. But anyway, go on.

125
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:15,010
Right. So at the end of the day, there's definitely going to be multiple, even though,

126
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:20,770
let's say let's stick to the Scrum context, for example, even if we're reading all the same

127
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,250
Scrum guide, right? Everybody has completely different definitions of or at least interpretations

128
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:33,730
of what the rituals are for, which one comes first. Now, it's just a lot of chicken and

129
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,770
the egg thing when it comes to like, if you do the rituals often enough, then it becomes natural.

130
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,450
Or the other side too would say, like, do what's natural for you. And then eventually,

131
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:53,570
it'll seep into kind of your team dynamics. But looking into what that shared priority is,

132
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,930
all of these things will break apart. So this reminds me of a story with,

133
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,670
have you heard of the company called Alcoa? Yes.

134
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:08,020
Right. And when they had that, probably in the early 90s, maybe, or the early 80s,

135
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,700
when they hired Paul O'Neill as their new CEO, and they were really having some issues

136
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:19,680
within the company. And what he did was, you know what, everybody cares about safety.

137
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:27,680
But the thing is, he did not define what safety was. But that became like a rallying call for

138
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,840
everyone else. And then from there, everybody had a direct responsibility to ensure safety

139
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:42,720
among everybody within their groups. And long story short, it can tuple their valuation,

140
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,280
their income. And they became one of the most respected companies in the world, one of the

141
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,240
safest companies in the world. It's just finding that one thing that everybody can rally about.

142
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,000
Personally, for me, that's still kind of elusive. I have some hints here and there, but

143
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:09,520
it's something that I do want to be able to bring forward and get some partners to work with

144
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:15,200
me across all the development centers that we have all over the world.

145
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,500
Yeah, this conversation, I didn't realize it until we've been getting into it,

146
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,880
reminds me of, I just finished reading The Phoenix Project, which is, I don't know if

147
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,120
you've read it yet or not, but it's a story about DevOps transformation. But the company

148
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,760
massive, or having massive quality issues, it's kind of like the story I described before,

149
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,680
they can't get a build out. It takes, even if they can get a build to finish, it takes,

150
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,800
there's approval process that takes forever to get something out. And they talk about how

151
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,400
that transformation works. But you and I have done these things before. I don't think we're either

152
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:57,680
one of us are particularly bad at them. My one gripe with the book that goes a little bit

153
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,400
too far into the world of fiction is that the transition happens too easily. It's like, oh,

154
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,880
all of a sudden it's CI CD everywhere. And they've remembered dependencies and they're

155
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,120
able to ship stuff all the time. And it's just not that easy. And I don't think it's

156
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:23,120
particularly hard because the technical part is it's hard enough. One other example is they

157
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,400
rewrote a mobile app and shipped it to customer delight in a week.

158
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,520
If I remember correctly, but mostly it's the people part, the transitional part that

159
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,240
drove me a little crazy. So it really ends up being a leadership problem or a lot of problem,

160
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,000
a leadership challenge. So it leads me to one question as people going through this.

161
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,300
And I think you may have some ideas on it is making this transformation requires a leader

162
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:00,700
growing your quality culture requires some leadership to do. What are some challenges

163
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:06,540
you may face if you're doing that like you and I have done within a company versus someone who's

164
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:12,620
hired as a consultant or a consultant working or someone working across divisions at a company.

165
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,540
What are some challenges that may make that full-time person on the team

166
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:22,300
more difficult or easier than someone who's visiting the team as a consultant?

167
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:31,900
Well, it's the idea of permanence, right? Where you kind of don't have that person who will be

168
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:38,940
like, let me try that in a different way. Just imagine you're hiring a head coach.

169
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,280
That's part-time, right? It doesn't work like where the head coach will only show up on game

170
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:52,380
day. It's very difficult to kind of force that. And then the learnings that you're supposed to do

171
00:17:52,380 --> 00:18:03,470
as a team throughout the week, that needs to have a more kind of introspective eye of the coach

172
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:10,510
that gets you, how can we do this better? So the idea of always at the end of the sprint

173
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,790
always at the end of the sprint retrospective kind of gets thrown at the window from a

174
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,910
digital transformation perspective because there's a lot of things that a coach might see that needs

175
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:27,950
to be addressed right away instead of waiting for that to kind of fester. That can be done when you

176
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:34,100
have someone that's there and it's focused. A shout out there to the retro, one of the most

177
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,580
important meetings or probably the most important meeting you can have, especially in regards to the

178
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,780
quality culture transition guide because that's where teams have been exposed to that,

179
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,580
that I work with. That's the time we bring that out during retro time. It's like, oh, let's see

180
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,660
what we could do here. We just say anything about this. It's a nice reference during retrospectives.

181
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,580
There's a book, if you've ever read by, I forget his first name Maxwell, called The Five Levels

182
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:05,580
of Leadership. You've heard of this book? I have not heard of that book. It applies a little bit

183
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,180
here because the first level is you're put in a position of leadership, which means you've been

184
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:19,040
made a manager. You've been, or in our case, maybe you're the sole dedicated testing specialist.

185
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,680
You're the person who's leading the quality culture. You're in a position,

186
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
someone could announce you in that position. You could say, hey, I'm going to try and lead

187
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,920
a source of higher quality culture. You're in a position of leadership. As you know, at that level,

188
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:38,240
it doesn't give you any rights or privileges unless you're a company that has a very specific

189
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,400
emphasis on hierarchy. But it's that next level where you have to give people permission to let

190
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,910
you lead them. People have to give you permission to let them lead them, let you lead them. God

191
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,750
damn. People have to give you permission to let you lead them. What that means is you don't

192
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,630
just get your leadership by a level. You have to let people know you're there to help and they

193
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,510
accept that you have good ideas. That may be one of the hardest levels to get past. You have to

194
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:17,140
establish credibility. In Weinberg's Secret of Technical Consulting and in a book called Getting

195
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,020
Naked by Pat Lentione, they're both really good stories. The latter being a business novel like

196
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:28,300
The Phoenix Project, but much better. Showing how important it is to when you're trying to be

197
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,460
a leader for a team and help them through transition. To be humble, to ask questions,

198
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:38,540
to not be afraid to ask the dumb questions. Because what that does is that establishes

199
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,540
what it helps you learn, which is the important thing. But it establishes trust. People know that

200
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,340
you're not there just to boss them around. You really do care and you want to help them.

201
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,670
It isn't until you get to that level, you get to level three, which is where you begin to

202
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:59,070
produce results. Until you as a leader and you can again, much easier being that permanent part

203
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:04,510
of the team because establishing trust is not something you can do on a sporadic basis.

204
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,750
You have to be engaged. Once the team understands that you're there to help and they want you to

205
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,750
help them, then you can begin to move the team down the path of improving their quality culture.

206
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,270
You have to ping me later the title of the book. I didn't write it.

207
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,550
That would be a good next read for me, which actually does remind me with another

208
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,390
organizational book called requisite organization by Elliot Jack.

209
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,750
I have not read that.

210
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:42,210
Elliot Jacks. It's interesting because he looks at it in also the same, but this one is in

211
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:48,770
like seven levels or maybe even eight or higher levels than that, where he breaks it apart into

212
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,690
the amount of time that you have to be able to do your work.

213
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,240
The first level essentially are the people on the ground. Whether you're a sales splurge or

214
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:14,930
traffic be cop, for example, where your work is mostly routine. Then the second level is

215
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,530
first line managers. From a softer perspective, this would be

216
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:29,920
probably our leads or maybe senior developers who have more responsibilities, not just from a day to

217
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,960
day basis, but they look at things that need to be done, let's say at the end of a sprint.

218
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,480
Then the next level up is instead of focusing on the deliverables every two weeks,

219
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,520
now you have quarterly deliverables. The next level up would be your directors,

220
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:58,320
so on and so forth. Your vision can't be enacted up until you have maybe months or for CEOs for

221
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:05,470
really huge companies. They have years or maybe even a decade to be able to enact on something.

222
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:12,540
I think the way we look at it, especially from setting that culture, whoever it is that's

223
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:18,220
assigned for those needs to have a different outlook and make sure that everyone else

224
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,420
underneath the lower levels can also focus on their work and get their work done pretty well.

225
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,620
But you have a larger vision of where you need to be. Let's say if it takes a lot longer to

226
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:40,620
be enacted on. Tying that back into the Phoenix project, it's almost a typical

227
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:51,180
fairy tale story where everything is happy ever after. All the individual work that needs to be

228
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:58,140
done leading up to that point where they can actually release in a more consistent cadence

229
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,380
and they can capture feedback at the level where they can actually act on it.

230
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,060
That's the hard work that we're kind of, hey, instant coffee time.

231
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:19,490
You're not worried about waiting for your coffee beans to grow and roasting them and grinding them

232
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:28,670
and you making that cup of coffee type of thing. There's definitely a lot of, I guess, dimensions

233
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:34,030
that we can look deeper, but I have to get the copy of that book that you just mentioned.

234
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:41,470
I'll send you some links. It definitely helps. We've talked a lot of the strategic part. We know

235
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:49,630
it's a leadership issue. We know that it's difficult and it takes time and all those things.

236
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:58,300
But let's go into some more of the tactical. In helping teams improve their quality culture,

237
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:05,980
what are some examples of tactical things you've done? How have you addressed

238
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,660
specifically some aspects of improving the quality culture?

239
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:18,980
One of the first things that I actually almost always do when I get asked to join a given team

240
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:25,460
is that I ask them for what are the activities that everybody actually does?

241
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:33,780
So let's take a look at your last release and the contents of what you've released.

242
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:42,220
How long did it take for that to pass through your pipeline for that to get into the hands

243
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:50,190
of the customer? Digging deeper into that, then it shows, all right, we're actually spending 15

244
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:56,190
business days to do user acceptance testing because that's still a thing in my world.

245
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:04,350
We take a look at what they're actually doing in detail, breaking that down and see if we could

246
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,110
get rid of some of the things that are redundant. Most of the time, there's really very obvious

247
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:18,110
things that show us why, hey, why does it take you 12 hours to generate all the user data that

248
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:24,780
you need to be able to perform your tests? Because it's a person doing it and the automation

249
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:31,580
attempt was employing Allen's favorite tool, which is Selenium, to click through the browser

250
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:39,420
to create the data. So changing things like that into, you know what, let's talk to the developers.

251
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:45,820
Maybe there is an API in the backend that creates this data for us and you can just

252
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:50,940
see the difference where what used to take 12 hours now takes, I don't know, three minutes

253
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:59,580
to get things done. So this is an example of how the principles overlap and support each other

254
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,860
because it definitely improves the quality culture to get rid of that technical debt,

255
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,940
but you're doing it also by identifying and mitigating a bottleneck in your system.

256
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,140
Right. And then most of the time, because of how busy everyone is on their day-to-day

257
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,430
and the expectations, a lot of these things are just accepted. It's just like, yeah, it's

258
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:26,670
how things are done. That's the way it's always been. We're going to continue to do it. And it's

259
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:34,260
usually one of the most, I guess, poisonous things that will happen in any kind of team culture.

260
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:41,790
And that's what's so important. It's important that this is where you and I and people driving

261
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:47,790
modern testing can really help out as we don't, we're not good with the status quo. We go,

262
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,030
why couldn't this be better? It's the old fable that I won't retell today about

263
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,360
why the woman cut the ends off her roast beef before she put it in the pan and look it up.

264
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:06,100
I know you've heard it, you're laughing. But it's a great example of just, this isn't right. How

265
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:12,910
can we make it better? You have another one? It's really something that is very similar.

266
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:20,080
I've told this story a lot of times. I'm taking like three shots right away.

267
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,040
When I first joined the company that I'm in, it used to take us 29 days to upgrade a single site.

268
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:37,740
That includes all the necessary evidences for a company that's under specific

269
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:46,450
regulations for us to be able to release something. From there, they've been trying for the past

270
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,050
four years on how to get it more efficient with and without automation, with and without

271
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:59,410
tooling. But they still can't go past that 29 days for a single 29 day turnaround time

272
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:03,490
to test the site before we can actually push for an upgrade.

273
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:10,770
And what we realized was really just a ton of redundancy. So I guess you fast, I'm going to

274
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:18,290
pull a Phoenix project here. Fast forward four years, that 29 days can now be done in

275
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:26,210
90 minutes. And we can now handle, instead of just dealing with a single site at once,

276
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:35,090
we're dealing with 600 sites from an operational scale perspective for upgrading.

277
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:43,710
I think the key there really was all the silent noises in between the handoffs,

278
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:50,430
a, data creation, b, making sure that the build environment is set up properly, making sure that the

279
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:58,670
configuration schemas are correct and we're not going back and forth, looking into

280
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:07,710
more difficult bugs to be able to debug because it's just a flag that everybody ignores. And there's no

281
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:14,510
kind of sense of static analysis based assertions where we can now check that, hey, is this actually

282
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:20,140
the last known configuration that everybody kind of blessed and approved saying that this is

283
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:27,660
actually works. Before that was just all kind of throwing the ether saying, no one's looking at it

284
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,780
because we're too busy dealing with the UI stuff. And the other thing that we did with the UI stuff

285
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:44,160
was we converted a majority of our tests from Selenium based click things into just replacing

286
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:52,480
80 assertions of this element present into just a single visual test. So we work closely with

287
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:02,580
some of the more leading AI based visual comparison tools that's out there. And that really

288
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:09,460
accelerated a ton of what we're able to do. So now it's not just the testers that are consuming

289
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:14,980
that information, handing that off to the dev team, but now the product owners are actually

290
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:23,170
jumping in because we made sure that throughout that approval process, they would be included in it.

291
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:30,190
If it's a matter of, hey, there's a weird bug that the visual check has captured,

292
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:38,780
is this actually something that we introduce when we're dealing with internationalization,

293
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,780
for example, across multiple markets, we can't hire every single person that can speak a certain

294
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:50,060
language, which can be broke. So having something like this, and we can just hand it off to an

295
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:59,260
auditor or reviewer saying, oh, right, that is an intentional change based on the intent of the

296
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:08,500
wording that we're really trying to make. So it's an easy, fast way for us to flag certain diffs

297
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,260
and hand that off to the person and the person can easily understand without sitting on it for

298
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:22,740
days and days. So it's really a whole, I guess it's a whole process fix for us,

299
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:29,440
for that particular group. Yeah, sounds nice. I think as you were talking, I was also thinking,

300
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:38,000
we just need a book filled with these stories of how these improvements have been made.

301
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,720
I'm not suggesting writing a book, but I'm just thinking if I talk to you about all these choices,

302
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,840
I talk to my people around Unity where I work and that I've gone through this,

303
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,280
and there's all kinds of stories about how a good low hanging fruit is just going back through the

304
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,960
bug backlog for people that have big bug backlogs and deciding what are we going to fix and what

305
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,840
are we not going to fix? And let's take the bugs that we said we're going to fix,

306
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:09,820
just fix them now. It's a very freeing thing to free up that just bug tech debt,

307
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,540
but you have some process tech debt you're dealing with as well, getting people to...

308
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:22,820
I've helped people begin that journey towards collecting data to help understand where

309
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:30,180
customers are seeing success and failing. And it happens again, that happens slowly.

310
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:35,860
It isn't overnight, like in Phoenix Project, where you have nothing and the next day,

311
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,700
oh, we have all this wonderful customer telemetry telling us exactly what's going on.

312
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,100
It's like, this is an iterative process that has two steps forward, one step back to get

313
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,540
the right data. It takes a while, but it's worth the effort. All you're just looking at is,

314
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,140
what are we doing? How can we improve? What we use with that transition guide is let you look

315
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:04,500
at holistically at, I don't know how many there are anymore, eight different ways you can improve

316
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,940
your quality culture, different attributes, areas, and look and see what's going on,

317
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,740
figure out where you're at, figure out what different behaviors or tools or processes your

318
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:21,260
team could be using. So good examples of that. Here's an oldie, but it's a goodie.

319
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:27,820
Since you're talking about stories, maybe it's time to put the notion of a beautiful modern

320
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:32,980
testing book in your backlog. Way in the back of the backlog.

321
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,880
When I was a shout out to Adam Goucher as the editor and one of the contributing authors of

322
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:55,470
that series, but it puts you in an anchoring position, listening to the stories that everybody

323
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:03,950
had. You wrote something, Scott Barber's story was actually pretty good as well. It's one of

324
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:10,030
the things I can remember on top of my head, but it's things that, hey, this is what's happening.

325
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:16,190
I think this is what you're doing with the ABT 343 podcast is a matter of writing.

326
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:21,230
Yeah, maybe someday we grow into that where I curate a book like Adam did with Beautiful Testing.

327
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,040
That could work. We'll work out. We need to get some more stories. It'd be great to get some of

328
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:34,400
these stories of, I forget the name of the company I quoted yesterday in the Slack group,

329
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,320
Mercado, I think it was, who discovered they were doing modern testing before they heard about

330
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,840
modern testing. And I'd love to get those stories as well. Like what happened? How did you get

331
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,320
there? And they're at last seen to some extent do things that are like modern testing. It's

332
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,560
not a thing we're making up, which I've said before, but it'd be fun to gather stories,

333
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,160
people that discovered it without us because we're just there to put a label on it and to

334
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,440
help people that are going, what the hell is going on? My job is changing.

335
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:09,550
We'll give you a little bit of a map. Lots to do. It has been as always absolute pleasure

336
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:15,870
talking with you, Percy. These are good stories, fun stuff and a lot for me. And I would expect

337
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,670
for the listeners to chew on or think about. So thank you a ton for being on the show today.

338
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,750
You're definitely welcome. It's always a pleasure. You know what? Just a side note,

339
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:33,230
it was around this time when I first found out about the EBTesting podcast. And it was really,

340
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:42,980
I was reading up, scrolling through my Twitter feed and here comes Mike Blarson's list of

341
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,500
must hear podcasts. He had the best description of us.

342
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:51,060
Yes.

343
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:03,040
Of the next year. And I downloaded your, that was the first time I was actually picking up

344
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,950
family from California at that time. And it started playing as we were driving out of the airport.

345
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:19,650
And what you hear is full volume intro of the, that riff that you have in the beginning.

346
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:27,070
And I had to like turn it down because it was a shock. But then I listened through the ride.

347
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:32,910
And I guess two of my family members listened through the ride as well for the first EBTesting

348
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:39,950
podcast that the three of us shared that experience. So it's been like what, four or five years now?

349
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:48,190
And I do appreciate everything that you guys are doing. And it's grown into something.

350
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,150
And is it okay if I close with a question? Yes, absolutely.

351
00:37:53,790 --> 00:38:00,510
I know we started with defining modern testing as the acceleration of shippable quality.

352
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:07,820
Has there been any nuances or changes to how you understood that the first time you and Brent

353
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:14,900
coined that term fast forward to now on what that means to you?

354
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:21,300
Yes and no. So what's happened to me is like the first, Brent coined that phrase.

355
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,140
This is actually a very good question because Brent coined that phrase.

356
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,620
He said, yeah, this makes sense. Sure. How do we do this? And then we started talking about

357
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:34,260
very early before we had a name for it, how we wanted to approach quality before we called it

358
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,100
modern testing, which as we all know, nothing modern, not about testing. It's just an antidote

359
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:49,380
to traditional test last testing methods. But as we talked more and more, and then when I got the

360
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:56,180
notion somewhere around in the sixties or ish that we should, not the years, the episodes,

361
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,260
that we should have modern testing principles and trying to iterate on those, is that I begin to

362
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:08,980
realize how much they supported that mission of accelerate the achievement of shippable quality.

363
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,620
What was odd, it was nothing, none of it was consciousness. It wasn't like, okay,

364
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,180
how does principle number two promote the mission? How does principle number three promote the mission?

365
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,720
I didn't even think about them separately. What I did, we did the principles, just trying to capture

366
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
all the stuff that Britt and I had talked about and aligned on that we cared about.

367
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,640
And probably what was the interesting part, the insight was that all the things that we

368
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,360
cared and aligned about without even thinking about it directly aligned with

369
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,480
accelerate the achievement of shippable quality. So that was really the bigger insight is that

370
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,000
I thought once the principles were done and we had iterated on them and then we had talked

371
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,760
through all of them and I put together talks on each of them and courses, the farther and the

372
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,480
deeper I got into internalizing what these principles were, what modern testing was,

373
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,240
and why we cared about it, it was just, I can't even call it serendipitous because you knew it

374
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:17,200
would happen. But the alignment with the mission just was super, I was gonna say supernatural,

375
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:23,040
that's a different thing. The alignment with the mission was natural and it just happened.

376
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:33,220
And it tells me that it all is fitting together as it should. And it really just goes back to

377
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:42,020
the values. We knew this was the right thing. We had talked about it a lot and everything we

378
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,700
had talked about aligned with that mission statement. So it's probably the backward answer

379
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,500
of what you're expecting. We never went back and looked at the mission statement and said,

380
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:55,060
well, can we make this better? We just left it as it was. Although one of my employees,

381
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,220
and I like this one, Brent doesn't, but she shortens it. One of my former employees,

382
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,820
still at Unity, says, accelerate the delivery of customer value, which rolls off the tongue a

383
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:10,000
little bit better. And I think it tells the same story. I think it's fine. But yeah,

384
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,920
it's all aligned with, again, what we think, but also what we see going on, which is nice.

385
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,640
It makes it make sense. For me at least, it makes me feel even stronger in

386
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,800
that it's the right thing to be talking to people about and sharing with the community.

387
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,520
Well, thank you.

388
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,040
My pleasure.

389
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:29,120
I really appreciate that.

390
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:35,040
That was a fantastic question. All right. We should wrap it up here. I will put your

391
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,240
Twitter handle. You have blog links, books, public appearances. You want to plug at this point?

392
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,360
Ah, Twitter's fine.

393
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
All right.

394
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,960
Just keep it simple.

395
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,320
Okay. We'll put that in the notes for the show, get this out in a few days. But

396
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,320
have a wonderful happy holiday, Merry Christmas, and we'll chat with you again in the new year.

397
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,360
Thank you, Percy.

398
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,640
All right. We'll do it. Thank you, Alan.

399
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,040
All right. See you.

400
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,430
All right. Bye.
