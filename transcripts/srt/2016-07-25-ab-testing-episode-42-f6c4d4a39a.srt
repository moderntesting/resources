00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Hey, thanks for listening to the show today, this is Alan, and before the show starts I

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,880
wanted to warn you that we had some audio issues arise during editing.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,720
I lost a microphone, had to try and make up for that with some level changes, and with

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,520
that I got extra sounds of Brent breathing, some microphone rumbling, and in the end

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,920
a lot of clicks and pops in the last third of the show.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
Good content, I hope you enjoy.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
Thanks again for listening.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:40,220
Hey everybody, hello, I'm Alan, I'm Brent, and it is episode 42 of a video.

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,420
I'm going to be testing, how about that, 42.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:51,100
Yes, and unlike the usual reference to 42, this episode will not be the answer to life,

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,500
the universe, and everything.

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
No, it'll be the answer to, hey Alan, why angry weasel?

13
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,540
I'm going to kick off episode 42 with some good old fashioned venting.

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,660
Yes.

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,020
First of all, Brent.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,300
I understand the angry part, and I know you've told me the story approximately 50,000 times,

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,860
I don't get the weasel part.

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,260
There is a story on, hey, I resemble that comment.

19
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:22,420
There is a story I've posted on the long, long story, I'll give you the paraphrase

20
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:31,230
version, but if you go to AngryWeasel.com, the sponsor of AB testing, if you go there,

21
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:34,190
there is a story about the weasel or something like that along the banner at the top of

22
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,320
the blog.

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:40,080
It talks about the fact that many, many, many years ago, I was playing in this rock funk

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,200
band and we were trying to decide on a band name.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,040
One time we had some temporary names, one of these bands had a different name for every

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,960
show for a while.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,360
Then we're talking to someone after a show and they're telling a story about how they

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,760
were driving through Germany and got some car trouble because they're stuck by the

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,440
side of the road.

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,080
Someone pulled over to help them, this kind of strange German, this is right out of a

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,430
weird movie.

32
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,150
Stephen King.

33
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,300
Not maybe Stephen King, maybe more Kevin Smith.

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,010
But they started talking about the weasels and said, beware of the tooth of the weasel.

35
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:25,170
It's not a very good German accent, but they heard the story about the tooth of the weasel

36
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,010
and they talked about Angry Weasel and that's it.

37
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,010
That's it.

38
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,700
That's the band name, Angry Weasel.

39
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,900
Even the band said, yeah.

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,660
Our guitar player said, no, I don't like it.

41
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,300
I said, screw you, I am getting angryweasel.com, I'm going to keep it.

42
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,700
I owned angryweasel.com for about three or four years before I finally moved my blog

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,820
over to angryweasel.com.

44
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,020
It was originally going to be a band name, I just took over the name and have a logo

45
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,180
now and everything, that's where Angry Weasel came from.

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,140
So nothing to do with Pauly Shore?

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,780
Nothing to do with me actually being angry except for today.

48
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,380
Because let me tell you just a couple things.

49
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,100
It's been a while since I talked about dumb things Microsofties do.

50
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,300
Alan, soapbox, box, box, box, box.

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,680
So this is not really it.

52
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,150
No sound effects.

53
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,910
So Brent and I are meeting two floors below my floor.

54
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,910
Why?

55
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,910
Do you ask?

56
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,910
Oh, why?

57
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,790
Because the meeting rooms on my floor are all booked.

58
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,150
Even weirdly, we're in the middle of a move and there are only 10 people on my

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,590
entire floor, yet our meeting rooms are booked all morning.

60
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,150
Why?

61
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,060
Because people, who I won't use adjectives to describe, we have a lot of Microsoft

62
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,980
employees just decide to have, it would be fun to go have a meeting in Lincoln Square

63
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,020
so they come over to Lincoln Square now meetings.

64
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,460
Okay, fine, done it before.

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,980
And then we have other people who book meeting rooms like recurring meetings, big

66
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
long meetings and just never show up.

67
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,460
So you can't actually book the room.

68
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,810
Understand, there's 10 people on the floor, the meeting room right next to my office

69
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,530
that I want to use all the time.

70
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,250
I can never use because somebody I don't even know or work with or have seen before

71
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,820
takes up claim for a four hour meeting in that meeting room.

72
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,180
Do you have, you think you have enough clout to take that meeting room offline?

73
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,660
I can't, but I do have enough clout to, there's a, I try not to do this

74
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,500
because I can, but I can actually, one thing, career advice for everybody in the

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,260
world, career advice for everybody.

76
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,260
If you have an admin on your team, be nice to them.

77
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,420
Oh gosh, yes.

78
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,910
Because they actually run the organization.

79
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,670
So I have enough clout to go to our admin and say, you can do this at Microsoft.

80
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,070
You can say, can you please restrict meeting rooms on our floor to our

81
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,870
organization so other teams can't book them.

82
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,670
They can do that.

83
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,350
They can do that.

84
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:52,640
How?

85
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,920
It's just a, I'm going to have to go talk to my admin.

86
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,480
Yes, it can be done.

87
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
I can't have it for myself, but I can have it for my org.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,800
I've recently, recently moved buildings.

89
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,520
We haven't done a podcast in that one yet, but there is only one

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,140
conference room on my floor.

91
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,980
And for the longest time, it was locked out.

92
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:21,880
It was the, it, it was under exact lock out.

93
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,630
Yeah, that was cool.

94
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,620
All right, so rant number two.

95
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,960
I think the secret to dealing with the meeting rooms is just have no meetings.

96
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
Honestly, it's a really a first world problem.

97
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:44,750
It's really, I mostly use meeting rooms for podcasts.

98
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,350
We do our stand up just next to our desks.

99
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,610
When you come to our building the next time, I'll show you my office.

100
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:58,090
Coolest, biggest office I've ever had.

101
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,650
And now whenever I have like team meetings, I just do it in my office.

102
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,070
I'm just angry as a weasel because-

103
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,350
I'm really feeling the anger emotion.

104
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,350
Yeah, I was.

105
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,550
I wanted to use the room and I thought I had a book, but I guess I did.

106
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,190
And the guys that were in there were kind of dickish, so

107
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,870
they kind of pushed my buttons a little bit.

108
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,670
Hey.

109
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,390
Hey, so that room next to you?

110
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,070
Yeah.

111
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,470
I have a suggestion for you.

112
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,470
Yeah.

113
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:33,740
Hang up a scrum board right on the wall outside of that conference room.

114
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,700
And just do spontaneous and very loud stand up every half hour until

115
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,940
people start unbooking that room.

116
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,020
We're out of stage at our product where I kind of knew this would happen.

117
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,380
And I haven't played the game if I told you so.

118
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,460
I'm playing the game of dig ourselves out.

119
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,900
Where things were going swimmingly and

120
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,340
we are pushing towards a big milestone and our GPM,

121
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,540
GPM and our ship room meeting said,

122
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,580
really important we have these features done for this milestone.

123
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,290
And I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.

124
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,890
The past tells me that when you make statements like that,

125
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,450
people will shove in stuff without doing their due diligence about quality.

126
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,450
Just those features need to be done.

127
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,580
It's critical for the product.

128
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,020
And I said, OK, because it wasn't a fight.

129
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,140
What are you going to say?

130
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,100
I wanted to have it.

131
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,260
It wasn't going to go anywhere.

132
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,500
I believe in discussion and even disagreement

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,660
as a method of getting to an end.

134
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,740
I think it inspires creativity in this case.

135
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,610
There wasn't anything to do at that point.

136
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,100
So anyway, what happened is we have what I'm calling feature jam.

137
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,810
And we just took a snap of our product has

138
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,130
been getting progressively worse.

139
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,270
Shocking.

140
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,790
I'm not shocked.

141
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,950
All I can do is do my best to make sure we get out of the hole.

142
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,270
But it is we took a snap.

143
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,310
I'm a little angry to start off with this morning because we took a snap last

144
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,230
night from our sea environment to our pre-production environment,

145
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,390
where normally we can sit for like a day and be OK.

146
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:19,990
It's good.

147
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,510
Let's stop this to broad.

148
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,270
It is for the last three weeks, especially this one.

149
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,910
Just awful.

150
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:33,270
I've just I'm really frustrated and almost embarrassed about how every time I see

151
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,590
people make these type of mistakes, right?

152
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:42,070
The other mistake that I see is that they don't use it as an opportunity to

153
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,850
to make this a learning org.

154
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,370
Right. So what are you doing to make sure the next time doesn't do this shit?

155
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,130
That is absolutely what I'm doing.

156
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,330
So lots of stuff going on.

157
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:58,810
Trying to do a lot of the work to make sure some of these things don't happen

158
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,330
again, as well as just there's two things lacking, I think.

159
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:07,010
One is lack of developer testing, even trying their thing out before they check

160
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,930
it in, they're getting better at that.

161
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:15,260
And where the learning is going to come from is in an org that up until

162
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,820
the pressure kind of hit was a very open org with lots of communication.

163
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,740
Everybody knew what was going on in the last, I don't know,

164
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,580
some amount of time, month or so.

165
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,900
As the products become more real and more something that we're going to ship

166
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:36,900
to real people in a fairly soon timeframe, the pressure has made them silo

167
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,180
a little bit and that communication has gone away.

168
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,340
I think the key to being successful, you cannot ship a product as often as we

169
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,380
want to ship without very transparent communication across the org.

170
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,740
So we have teams breaking other teams with their changes, feature teams

171
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,540
breaking other features with their changes.

172
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,260
I think primarily due to lack of communication, hey, I didn't know you were

173
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,180
going to do that, or why did you do that, or should have had a discussion

174
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,540
about that, sorts of things.

175
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,700
So those things are happening, they would always happen, but they're

176
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,900
happening noticeably faster, in fact, exponentially faster than before.

177
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,460
So to me, that's the key part of the problem.

178
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,020
That's the key thing.

179
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,620
So that's a good thing.

180
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,980
That we're trying to, I believe that communication could solve the

181
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,700
majority of the issues that I have seen over the last few weeks.

182
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,820
Your story reminds me of how I execute my Kanban board on my team.

183
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:40,020
We have these tickets, as the three well know, I haven't had a bug

184
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,700
database in years, we have these tickets we call swarm tickets, and

185
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,060
periodically we go through a period where essentially all the work that

186
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,860
we're doing is nothing but swarm tickets.

187
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,340
Swarm tickets, when they come up on the board, they're treated like

188
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,220
bugs, and when they come up on the board, we have to knock them down

189
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,300
in 48 hours, and that means we're not doing feature work.

190
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,060
So you can, for those who are familiar with the concept of bug jail,

191
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,000
it's like we have a zero bug bug jail.

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,800
One of the nifty things as a tool of having these tickets in this process

193
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:23,520
and a very visible board is that we can very readily see when we're in the

194
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,320
midst of what we've now come to term as swarm storm, where it's essentially

195
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,160
we're going on for a large period of time and all we're doing is knocking

196
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,080
down swarm tickets.

197
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:45,400
And one of the insights that I learned from the author of Personal Kanban,

198
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,280
Oh yeah, Benson, Jim Benson.

199
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:54,450
Jim Benson, I always think of Jim Henson, but that's not the right guy,

200
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:02,850
was that too many swarm tickets is actually a sign of going too fast.

201
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:10,460
And I have used that over and over again to slow the team down, do the

202
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,380
proper root cause analysis, do the proper retrospective to figure out what

203
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:20,840
shortcut have we been making that we should not be, and fix it.

204
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:29,760
And then almost always that causes a near order of magnitude boost in productivity.

205
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,760
And it's counterintuitive, but once you work through what the board is doing

206
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,190
is telling you what the crappy bottleneck on your team is.

207
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,150
But if I can be briefly optimistic, I would say that when we dig ourselves out,

208
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:48,310
the team will be better than they were before.

209
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,580
Cause now there's a lot of learning from mistakes as we all know,

210
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,550
and we're doing a lot of learning right now.

211
00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:04,070
Yeah, I'm not as optimistic as you are because I've seen broken window theory

212
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,790
happen over and over again in exactly the same situation.

213
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,870
I've seen it too.

214
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,950
What I've seen is the GPM gets too much power,

215
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:19,030
and then your next six month milestone, what he's going to communicate is,

216
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,430
this is how we ship product.

217
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,950
This is just the world we live in.

218
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:31,270
Devs should buck up Buttercup and figure out how to cram in these extra features

219
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,450
and quit screwing the customer.

220
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,250
The thing I hate about this power struggle,

221
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,170
cause the way you tell the story, and I hope it's not true,

222
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,890
but the way you tell the story is you got like an old school GPM,

223
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,050
and those guys get reviewed on their ability to cram in additional features.

224
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,180
So let me add something now that I'll probably edit out.

225
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,260
Alan here, we cut that part.

226
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,490
All right, back to the show.

227
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,490
I think all of the three are on Twitter.

228
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,090
And if you've been on Twitter, you've noticed over the last week or two,

229
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:12,410
a lot of talk about the context driven testing community.

230
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,410
I have this weird take on context driven testing.

231
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,120
I'm not against it.

232
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm all for it, but the thing is with me is I'm a little bit removed

233
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,920
from the conversation or the concept,

234
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,320
because I don't really believe in context driven testing, not directly.

235
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I do believe, in fact, the difference is I believe that I don't believe

236
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,960
in schools of testing.

237
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,840
Sure, there are people that get paid to push buttons all day,

238
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,920
and you can say they're the factory school or whatever,

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,640
but I just believe that all good testing and all good software

240
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,520
development in general and all knowledge work,

241
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,370
anyone who is good at any sort of knowledge work is context driven by

242
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:51,330
necessity.

243
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,610
So I don't understand the need to say, well, I'm in the context driven school.

244
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,730
Just like, what the, I don't even get it.

245
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,250
So just the whole concept alienates me.

246
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,410
So it's hard for me to figure out where I stand in this conversation.

247
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,130
I have my opinions of James Bach.

248
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,290
Again, I can talk to him.

249
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,010
There's there have been psychological studies.

250
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,690
Obviously, we don't prep on this show.

251
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:20,210
So I'm not going to give any references that shows that as your EQ or

252
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,770
is your IQ goes up, your EQ goes down.

253
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:30,340
So it's very, it's not uncommon where super smart people,

254
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:39,820
they're extremely logical, don't have much room for compassion in some regards.

255
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,380
Right.

256
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,140
What the point is this way is I choose to ignore James.

257
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:46,980
I know he's deaf.

258
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,020
I read his blog post, but I just kind of ignore him.

259
00:15:50,620 --> 00:16:00,100
Is he is his loud, not physically loud, but is his leadership damaging testing in any way?

260
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,340
Is question A for you, Brent?

261
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:08,500
And B is by not standing up to him more and

262
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,540
not involving myself in the discussion more, am I damaging testing?

263
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,830
I think on the CDT front, right?

264
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:26,270
The whole school's topic in from my world view is done, is over, right?

265
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,750
It doesn't make sense.

266
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,270
The I also strongly disagree with the content,

267
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,550
the CDT, the context driven testing.

268
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:43,830
Because testing in my view is context driven.

269
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:48,230
It is entirely redundant having a separate school.

270
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,430
That one now famous slide that we've talked about, right?

271
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:59,540
James is potentially attacking the agile movement.

272
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:05,820
It's one of those things where that movement that is successful,

273
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
it is helping businesses build value.

274
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:15,180
And my point is, my view is his leadership,

275
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:20,500
if there are people kind of viewing

276
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,660
James's role in the testing community, quite honestly,

277
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,020
it used to be important.

278
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,180
Its importance has shrunk dramatically.

279
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,770
I think people like Elizabeth Hendrickson and

280
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:47,650
Lisa Crispin are much better leaders for testing in this new world.

281
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:52,770
And I think the importance of his content has shrunk to,

282
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,510
I don't know, cult size.

283
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,020
It is, and I sort of, I don't know if we're ganging up on James,

284
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,300
but I'm glad we're talking about him in this context.

285
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,500
Because I think his, to me,

286
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:15,080
his influence on testing has been diminishing for some time.

287
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:22,900
The size of the population of testers that can benefit from RST,

288
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,820
Rapid Software Testing, his primary source of income, as far as I can tell,

289
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,140
is still a huge pool out there.

290
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,900
But it's not the people I hang out with that's not diminishing.

291
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,140
So I, like people say stupid stuff on the internet every day.

292
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,740
Every day.

293
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,540
When James says something stupid, because he has a larger following than most of the other people saying stupid stuff,

294
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,740
does it make a bigger difference?

295
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,220
Part of me says I should just call him out when he's being,

296
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,500
when he's out of context.

297
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,860
I don't have time for that crap either.

298
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,700
My advice to you, Alan, is, right, you're already doing it.

299
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:08,130
Look, I've coined what I call Jensen's law of politics.

300
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,730
And it is essentially this.

301
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,620
He who is defensive loses always.

302
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,660
And his response, his abrasiveness, in my view, is an act of defensiveness.

303
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,340
That last slide is an act of defensiveness.

304
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,380
It is...

305
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,740
It challenges his world.

306
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,580
It challenges his world.

307
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:37,940
Some people get defensive by getting defensive, and others get defensive by going on the attack.

308
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,500
He's more on the attack style.

309
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:47,860
We have been very good on this show, as well as before we were doing the show,

310
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:55,860
of aligning with the momentum of the future, future, future, future.

311
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,980
Right?

312
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,300
Well, let me interrupt there.

313
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,300
And I think we're fairly decent at it.

314
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
I think so too.

315
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:14,900
And I think that one thing is, this is going to sound weird, but by those of us that look at the future and adapt,

316
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:19,300
we talked about software being predictive, iterative, adaptive,

317
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:26,020
adapting to what's needed for the context of shipping software is more context driven

318
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,750
than a lot of what happens in the CDT air quote community.

319
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,430
So those of you, and I'm just going to add this right now,

320
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:39,870
those of you right now getting tired of the boom, boom, boom in the background,

321
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,190
Brent is like fondling the heck out of his microphone stand and won't stop.

322
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,790
It's awkward.

323
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:46,630
It's...

324
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,870
Sigmund Freud is like watching right now to see what happens.

325
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,000
And I'm freaking out a little.

326
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,560
All right, where were we?

327
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,790
I'm sorry, Dylan.

328
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:03,750
So the one last thing on the subject is there was some talk about James and...

329
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,030
Whoa.

330
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:11,270
James and Michael Bolton wrote a paper on the context driven...

331
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,310
context driven testers guide to automation or something like that.

332
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:18,030
I was a reviewer on it earlier, almost exactly a year ago.

333
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,710
I blogged about this.

334
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,150
My name is listed as a reviewer.

335
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,910
I didn't know it.

336
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,910
The paper is my feedback is mostly grammatical and flow and like, no, this isn't what you called it, etc.

337
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:33,070
And then there was some feedback around the approach used.

338
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,910
What that paper is about, and I'll summarize it, it's about how we use some tools to help us test this product,

339
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,190
which I think is a good thing to do.

340
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,550
I use that all the time.

341
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,750
It wasn't a paper about test automation.

342
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,910
They use some tools to help them test the product.

343
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,470
They didn't actually automate anything of value.

344
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,430
So it's...

345
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,510
If you want to learn about test automation, not the paper to read.

346
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,150
But it's a fine paper on, oh, hey, we use some random tools that weren't quite appropriate,

347
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,700
but we made them work to test some random software to show that we could do it.

348
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
Yeah. I mean...

349
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,380
So I...

350
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,700
And this paper was published a year ago?

351
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,220
No, I reviewed it a year ago.

352
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,910
I think it came out like three or four months ago.

353
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,390
Maybe six months ago.

354
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:21,990
Three or four months ago, a paper that describes essentially a manual STE world that,

355
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,390
hey, look at the nifty tool that we just learned about that makes our life easier.

356
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,030
Three or four months ago?

357
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,190
Really?

358
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:37,500
Yeah. Going back to your last question, Alan, my advice to you is just take the high road.

359
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,660
These guys are just on the wrong path.

360
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,500
I think so too.

361
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,460
And it's just a waste of your time.

362
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,380
Right. So I think the answer is I should just ignore them.

363
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,900
I'm not doing a huge disservice by not standing up, but I probably will if I'm ever bored.

364
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,620
Yeah. Your last blog post seemed to be about this drama.

365
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,060
Yeah. And somebody called you out and wanted you to push back.

366
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,940
Oh, Chris McMahon said, hey, you're reviewing this paper. What's your take on it?

367
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,300
I said, I don't think it's a very good paper. I reviewed it. Sure.

368
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:15,500
So is Chris asking you to take Michael and James on?

369
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:23,290
I don't know. Chris and Noah Sussman, two people who I respect the shit out of are both

370
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:28,730
they have both been attacked directly by James. So they're and I'm full of support of them.

371
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:34,210
I would support them. So I will do I will do what they much as they ask me to do within

372
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:37,180
my ethics and time.

373
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:45,180
So, hey, we have a few minutes left. Let's talk about something you're doing like data

374
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:51,610
driven change. So I don't know if we have enough time to really flesh out this topic.

375
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:56,330
Thanks, everybody. Yeah. But let's give us an overview. It'll inspire some questions

376
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:05,420
that we use those 43. So one of the the just another shout out those who are listening

377
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:15,420
in and want to be attached to more of the A.B. testing community. Right. We do have a

378
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:25,900
Slack channel. You can you can direct message per Z P.E.R.Z.E.

379
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,860
I think you and I are admins on the site, too. Yeah, but I like it. Percy as our admin.

380
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:43,380
So I'm going to keep advertising you per Z until you you you cry uncle enjoying one of the

381
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:51,700
questions that has popped up on the slack channel quite often is hey, great. We're big believers

382
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,260
in this data driven culture, this data driven change. But how do we do it? I think that's

383
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:06,460
probably a full episode. Alan recently went through a similar thing. I don't. I did. You

384
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:13,580
did in my view where essentially you had a PM who was the way you described it initially.

385
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:21,900
You had a PM who was building yet another. The metrics scorecard. Yeah. Stoplight scorecard

386
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,300
filled with entity metrics, none of which are useful. And that's how you initially

387
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:32,940
described it. And then we talked later and he's like, oh, no, this guy's on the board.

388
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,140
So what was the difference for you there? Like initially you're like, oh, my God, is

389
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,780
a PM. This is what he's going to build. Yes, there was a lot of talk about the default

390
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,220
built. Start talking about building dashboards from telemetry. The default they seem to

391
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:53,620
always fall into is, oh, let's record how many people use our feature. How many people

392
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,300
click this button? That's great. But you don't learn anything from that. There's no

393
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,140
insights from that other than vanity stroking. So I was worried there was a lot of talk about

394
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:08,700
this. I went and talked to the PM. I said, hey, I didn't want to tell him he was wrong.

395
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,380
I just want to figure out where he's coming from, blah, blah, blah. Turns out he actually

396
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:18,880
has a good background in experimentation and he knows that those metrics have some but little

397
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:26,720
value. But he also knows he's a good PM because he knows that at first to get people to shut

398
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,080
up, he was going to give them what they wanted, which were the dashboards that show their

399
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:36,280
little vanity metrics and when they go, oh, look, I have a dashboard. But in parallel,

400
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:43,640
help make sure they build dashboards that show customer value and business value and

401
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:52,340
get some insights as well to eventually be used instead of usage metrics have limited.

402
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:58,060
I won't say no value, limited value, but he is actually on the board as far as how

403
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,420
for two things I wanted to follow up on. One, building scorecards, for lack of a

404
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:10,220
better word, dashboards that show business value and customer value of a feature. And

405
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:18,070
then also did not blink an eye when I said I want I believe in experimentation culture

406
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,190
where everything's an experiment. He nodded his head said, yes, that's absolutely where

407
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:27,430
I want to go to. And when I get that agreement, I go, okay, we're cool. Move along. I have

408
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:31,230
other things to worry about. I have confidence in you to take this forward. So it was

409
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,870
going into discussion. I was worried as hell coming out. I said, okay, he's got it covered.

410
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:39,070
Time will tell whether I have false confidence or not, but I feel good about it now.

411
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,870
So the PM is building the scorecard. It's a good thing. Because the first thing that

412
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:48,790
you're trying to do is create an asset that drives the business. Create convergence where

413
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:56,190
everybody's eyeballs are looking at this, knowing full well that in a few months, you're

414
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:03,150
going to push, you're going to self push back on the metric that you built. Because oh my

415
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:09,510
God, I just realized there's a better one or oh my God, I just realized it's wrong. Okay,

416
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:16,590
the first the step one is to create a site that people converge towards. Then the next

417
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:22,610
that that creates a vernacular creates a language creates something that people are concerned

418
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:28,210
with. Okay, you use the motivation that they're already used to and people are already used

419
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:36,990
to you can't ship until the scorecard shows all green. Okay, then what I will often do

420
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:48,400
is create a companion site that's a bit more actionable and then link these two together.

421
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,280
So you have this one scorecard that shows all these yellow numbers. Then you create this

422
00:28:54,280 --> 00:29:00,480
other companion site where people can drill down and see what's known as Pareto order.

423
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,900
What's the biggest bang for the buck that we should go after in order to turn this

424
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:18,120
green? The challenge with your strategy that this PM is executing is that you constantly

425
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,010
have to change these KPIs if you want to get there. I don't one of the things that scares

426
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:29,050
me about that is I don't want to over index on the on the stoplight, red, yellow, green

427
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:39,090
dashboards. To me, in my experience, insight is addictive. Yes. And by that I mean to explain

428
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:42,730
Brett gets it but the moment like you look at how they could use like it. How much

429
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,570
time they push the button. Okay, oh, great. It was 500 years today 600 today. That's

430
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,330
great. It means nothing. There's no insight from that. But when I can start to connect

431
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:57,450
some things go okay, this number went up here. The same time we added this feature at night.

432
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:02,610
And I look at some different metrics together and I go, ah, ha, well, people find an insight

433
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:09,650
they go, oh, I want to find another one. It's awesome drug. Oh, it is. So I want to

434
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:15,010
get people to a stage where the dashboards or whatever met however they're looking at

435
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,370
the metrics, I'll stick with the dashboards for now, but it can lead them to insights.

436
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,050
Because right the vanity metrics, there's no insights that come from those. But if I

437
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:29,130
can find a way for them to get the right data in front of them, where they can start to

438
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:35,410
find first find insights and then search for insights. This doesn't require business

439
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:41,600
intelligence require data science or statistics necessarily. Brent's rolling his eyes a little

440
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,480
bit to be some of the more advanced stuff, air quotes again, yeah, we'll take that.

441
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,360
But any PM without a math degree should be able to any engineer any knowledge worker

442
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:58,280
without a math degree should be able to look at some set of data and begin to find some

443
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,640
insights. And once you find insights, you will begin to search for insights. And once

444
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,680
you search for insights, your path to the dark side is clear. I mean, the good the

445
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:13,760
forest the good side. So I recently pulled together a deck on how to build a data centric

446
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,600
culture. And there are three phases I would say a team goes through. And the first one

447
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:27,920
is data oblivious and data oblivious essentially means I've talked to actual customers, I

448
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:34,490
know what they want. Anyway, oblivious, then what happens? Then it's data centric. And

449
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:39,130
that's really what you're building when you build this scorecard. Yeah, sure. It's

450
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:47,670
okay. Now we need to have data driving the course of the business and it's here driving

451
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:51,870
with data centric is different than data driven. I assume you're going there. Yeah,

452
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:57,870
data driven is the last one. So the one of the key markers, I like how you frame the

453
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,350
story. But one of the key markers that when you're in a data centric is you're starting

454
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:11,490
to see insights being built and those insights becoming addictive. And an insight is really

455
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:18,290
nothing more than an unexpected relationship between two different data sets. That feels

456
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:23,810
good. I mean, it comes with euphoria to a little bit, a little bit of if I had a meeting,

457
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:27,910
if there's a scientist in the three, could you please do a study on what happens chemically

458
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:35,200
in the brain when you have an insight? It's you found a discovery. It's it is fully addictive.

459
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:43,630
It's like I get to play Easter egg hunts all day long with the data. What is lacking though

460
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,870
is great, you have an addiction around insights. But what is lacking is which of these are

461
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:57,160
interesting. I like the idea of that insights can be interesting or not interesting. And

462
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:07,160
it's the amount it makes you go, huh, or huh. For me, the you can tie it back. But what

463
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:15,320
really drives interesting is how easily and readily you could connect it to a useful business

464
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:20,480
KPI. And a useful business KPI is essentially does it help me grow? Does it help me earn

465
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:29,320
more revenue? Does it help me reduce costs? Does it help me reduce time? Those so if

466
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:38,420
you can connect the dots to something that the business as a whole cares about. It's

467
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:48,320
interesting. I have seen. So for example, last week I was sitting with one of our interns,

468
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,960
and he drew together a history and talking about data science stuff like 80% of what

469
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,920
I am doing nowadays is just pulling together histograms and interesting ways and looking

470
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:09,440
at the patterns. I know how to analyze histograms. A lot of PMs don't like when should you look

471
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,400
at the outliers? When should you not disclosure? I don't either. Yes, teach me. Okay, happy

472
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:21,440
to do this. I've seen histograms. I don't know if I can get an insight from one. You'll

473
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:29,520
be surprised. Once you play with histograms and you learn how to use them. I'll give

474
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,440
you an example. A lot of the histograms are head tail curves. You can do a simple

475
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,500
transformation of a head tail curve to turn it into a normal distribution. And that normal

476
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:52,570
distribution will give you a much greater detail of insight than the head tail distribution.

477
00:34:52,570 --> 00:35:01,510
The other thing with head tail distributions, generally there's between two to five times

478
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,510
additional whatevers depending on what the head tail distribution is measuring in the

479
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:13,330
tail than in the head. But almost everyone focuses on the head. So that's one of the

480
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:20,280
reasons why I will often convert it to a normal distribution, a bell curve distribution.

481
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:29,110
Because it eases the seduction around, oh we must focus on the head. They're the customers

482
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:43,070
that everyone cares about. Where was it going? Hit a pothole. Oh, so this intern

483
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:56,790
drew together a histogram and he found that 80% of the results he was looking at was divisible

484
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:04,210
by five exactly. And he's like, does that bother you? And I tortured him on a bunch of questions

485
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:17,570
around. So one of the things for me, it is immediately initially interesting when it

486
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:27,050
doesn't line up with your expectation of the data. What makes it super interesting, I guess,

487
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:33,370
to try to disambiguate the term of interesting I used before is when you find a pattern that

488
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,930
you can connect the dots to a business KPI. But the first thing is if the data shows something

489
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:47,360
that you don't expect, that is something you should follow up on. Time box it. Don't get,

490
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:52,680
because the other thing with these insight addictions, it can be a rabbit hole. It can

491
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,360
be something that gets sucked you into a spiral of figuring out, well why? Well why? Well

492
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:09,280
why? You always have to be able to have something in the back of your head of if I answer this

493
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:23,850
question why will I care? There's more on this topic. I think we can go into deeper,

494
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:30,130
like the Slack channel. One of the things I think our listeners have asked for is,

495
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:38,860
hey how do I get the execs to stop being stupid? Oh, let's do a whole episode 43 on how to stop

496
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:43,140
people, including execs, from being stupid. As you know, I don't know if you, I'll mention

497
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,100
this again in 43, but I once, been about 10 years since I first did this, but I once described

498
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,500
my job as I stop people from being stupid. I do less of that now, but it's still something

499
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,220
I've always done. Why do you do less of it now? That's a good question. Let's explore that.

500
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,380
I'm pretty certain the amount of stupid people have not gone down. Maybe I just do it so subconsciously

501
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:09,710
now that I don't notice. Alright. That's what we're talking about. Thank you for listening.

502
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:15,310
If you've made it this far, yes thanks. I'll thank you anyway. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. We'll

503
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,190
see you next time. Bye.
