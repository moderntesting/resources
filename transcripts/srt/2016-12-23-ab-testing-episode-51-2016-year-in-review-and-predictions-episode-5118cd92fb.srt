1
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:27,310
Hey everybody. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And it's episode 51. 51. 51 of A B testing. Thanks everyone

2
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,830
for downloading yet another podcast. It's our end of the year episode. It is. It is. You know what?

3
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:40,220
Now at this point, maybe hasn't passed. I was going to say at this point, we've done more episodes

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,180
than the oldest of A B testing. I turned 51 a few weeks ago. It's a tie. And now we're in episode

5
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:53,570
51. If we survive the holidays, we'll do 52. And then, uh, yeah, what are you doing for the

6
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,570
holidays, Brent? You staying in town? You going to Las Vegas? No, staying in town. And, and, um,

7
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:06,530
I'm doing what is an accidental tradition, which is at the start of December, I go, Hey, I take,

8
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,250
I'm going to take the last two weeks off. That's enough to do my shopping. And then when the last

9
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,930
two weeks come, I go, Oh crap. The last two weeks only gives me one week till Christmas.

10
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:25,570
Why don't I learn this year over year? So I will be fighting traffic. Oh, wait, it's Christmas.

11
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,800
It is. Shoot. I have to do some shopping too. I'm in trouble. That's what Amazon's for. Thank you,

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,510
Amazon. Yeah. The only problem with Amazon is it doesn't tell you what to buy. You still have

13
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:44,910
to look for it. Yeah. We're down a rabbit hole. I don't want to be down because this is a,

14
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,100
it's hard. It is hard. I was going to say something funny and clever and interesting

15
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:57,500
and relevant. And now I've completely forgotten it. I will say that the big value adds to society

16
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,580
for those data scientist guys would be to solve that problem. Pretty soon. Can't we do that? Can't

17
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,410
we just plug in a name to a search engine? It tells us what they need or what they'd like,

18
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,890
even better, not what they think they want, but based on their analysis of social media,

19
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,700
research, postings, whatever their internet presence, it tells you what they want that

20
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:29,700
they don't know they want. Right. And prune out the risks of things like, Hey,

21
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:37,550
my wife says she wants a vacuum cleaner, but does she really know, dude, save the vacuum cleaner

22
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:43,650
for Valentine's day. Is that better? Is that really better? Yeah. Do the vacuum cleaner. Here's a

23
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:52,910
romantic vacuum cleaner, honey. Get her a red one. Oh yeah. Sure. Come on. There you go. Perfume it up.

24
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:02,540
Yeah. Yeah. Present it in candlelight. Yeah. Yeah. I got you a vacuum cleaner. Yeah, baby.

25
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,500
I'm, I'm driving to Bozeman, Montana. I'm sorry. Yeah. I, do you think of a better month to drive

26
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:18,180
over the Rocky mountains in December? No. Yeah. Yeah. You got to go through 90. So like you're just.

27
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,020
It's 90 all the way. You got two sets of chains in case one breaks.

28
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,340
Just, just one set of overpriced Tesla chains. You're driving your Tesla through the snow.

29
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,860
Heck yeah. All right. Way to go. The thing, the thing I, I remember is, uh,

30
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,300
I 90 is a huge trucker route. It's driven on all the time. So even if there's snow,

31
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,020
it gets kind of beaten down pretty quickly. You should double check. Cause I did hear in

32
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,500
the news that they were going to shut down 90 sometime around now ish.

33
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,580
It can't shut it down. It's a major thoroughfare. Yeah. But they were doing some avalanche. Yeah.

34
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,420
They close it like, yeah. So they don't shut it down. I'm not leaving now.

35
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:07,360
They're moving a mile an hour. Just look, just saying, or don't, you know,

36
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,940
it'd be a great story for next year's podcast. Yeah. Yeah. If I live, jeez. Hey,

37
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:20,060
it's the last podcast of 2016. Yep. And we should talk about some of our favorite things.

38
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,310
Here's where I'll cue the, we really need.

39
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:32,510
Yeah. So our favorite things from 2016 and maybe some things we'll predict from 2017

40
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:39,950
and we can reflect on our predictions from 2016 and whatever else comes to mind as we

41
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,310
babble through the next 40 minutes or so. Right. Hey, so the first thing, uh,

42
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:51,600
it is episode 51. We, uh,

43
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,320
I always worry when Brent starts reading his phone during the podcast.

44
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:06,160
Yeah. I can write it down here. So last time we did this last year was somewhere around episode 30 ish.

45
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,560
30. Oh, I mailed it to you. It's like 36.

46
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,860
36, 30, 30. Yeah. You can go. I'll, I always say I'll link to things in the show notes,

47
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,020
but I probably won't, but I will try and remember to add a link to last year's prediction episode,

48
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,580
because I'm going to quote from it. I'm going to paraphrase from it loosely later.

49
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:31,520
Yes. So what's your prediction for the episode number for this episode next year?

50
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,160
Oh, that's a good one. So our prediction show for next year will be,

51
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,040
oh, there's some factors in here. I have to talk to you about after the show.

52
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,320
Let's say 72. 72. I'm going to say 70. So it'll be real close.

53
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,300
All right. This is like the prices, right? Where you, as close as we can go over, right?

54
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:58,900
So if it's 71, we tie and we hug. Otherwise, yeah, if we want to,

55
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,020
want to do it that way, it's the closest without going over.

56
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,860
And if it's going to be episode 70, I will break one podcast into like three.

57
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,810
I have the power to control my own. You forget I can be clever occasionally.

58
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,450
Yeah. Hawthorne's effect in effect.

59
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,010
This is not even the Hawthorne effect. This is just me being a dick.

60
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,730
Yeah. It's people's behavior changed in accordance to how it's being measured.

61
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,730
You want to win. So you're going to change the behavior.

62
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,690
And you're like, ha ha ha. I have power. Brent doesn't.

63
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,200
It's because I'm a winner. Winning that meme is like five years old.

64
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,880
So done. Yeah.

65
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,000
So old. Okay. What have been some of your favorite moments for 2016 that you recall?

66
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And keep in mind that both Brent and I are old and we can't remember what we did last week.

67
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,840
So remembering podcast moments may be difficult.

68
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,720
The positive thing is I took notes. Oh my god.

69
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,030
The one episode a year, I know upfront I will have the Hawthorne.

70
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,590
I however am completely unprepared.

71
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:15,500
I have three I wrote down. So first and foremost, my absolute favorite moment of 2016

72
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,470
was our first promo code.

73
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,010
You mean our sponsor from Star?

74
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,650
Yeah.

75
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,330
Hey, I would like to take this point to let Brent know and our listeners know that

76
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,290
they enjoyed our little plug so much. Star would like us to be like a regular,

77
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,410
like once a quarter sponsor for 2017. We have made it.

78
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,410
We have made it. We have like,

79
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,010
we haven't totally made it. Like aren't we supposed to get paid for this?

80
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,370
Working that out. But at the very least we may get a very huge

81
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,530
free Star logo to put on the hood of your car.

82
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,250
Nice. Swag.

83
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:08,540
Yeah. AB Podcasting where the sponsorship is super friction free. I don't know. I have to work on the

84
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,200
Yeah. You keep thinking about that.

85
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,400
So anyway, yes, we had our first sponsor.

86
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,680
So they circled back. So the people actually use the promo code?

87
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,920
I don't know. That's interesting. I didn't ask.

88
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,120
But they did. I don't know if anybody did or not.

89
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,000
Because we only have three listeners. I don't know that any of them went to Star.

90
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,940
However, they think we're mildly interesting and we don't rag on Star too much.

91
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,300
So they're going to have us back. So congratulations, Brent.

92
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,100
That's awesome.

93
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,860
You're like a professional podcaster.

94
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,300
Almost like one.

95
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,980
At a very loose definition of professional.

96
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,020
And podcaster.

97
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,180
Yeah.

98
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,410
True, true, true, true.

99
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,410
Hey, hear that, Vernon?

100
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,090
Test Bash.

101
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,290
Vernon. Test Bash.

102
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,070
Promo code.

103
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,270
Yeah. Oh, yeah, we can we can sponsor Test Bash, but they're pretty low.

104
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,670
They're such a different beast than Star.

105
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,150
Yeah.

106
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,430
I'm star is like this corporate enterprise marketing machine.

107
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,830
So you get it's a great place to get as we mentioned before.

108
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,870
This one, not even any sponsorship.

109
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,070
I think stars where you go and you want a bunch. I'm new to this.

110
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,790
I need a bunch of knowledge and ideas, etc, etc.

111
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,210
And then just bash where you go. It's like more in the masterclass.

112
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,050
Sure. Really, at the end of the day, I just want more promo codes.

113
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,370
All right, man. We'll get that done.

114
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,530
Low, low hanging bar there.

115
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,810
My boss is texting me, so I just got to you talk for a minute.

116
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,170
I'm just going to let him know.

117
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:47,650
Oh, OK.

118
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:57,100
My second favorite podcast moment was the spontaneous

119
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,740
invention of the one of the three slack channel from one of the three.

120
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,340
That's right. That's a good moment worth remembering.

121
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,180
It was better at this than me, Brent.

122
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,880
It helps to remember when you've already thought about it and wrote it down.

123
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,080
Yeah, whatever.

124
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,160
You have a slack team and it's kind of fun.

125
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,880
I really am enjoying the conversations there.

126
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,360
Yeah.

127
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,840
It's like hanging out backstage with Alan and Brent.

128
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,320
If Alan and Brent, it really is.

129
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,520
If Alan and Brent don't actually participate as much, but Brent does.

130
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,400
There's a lot of great conversation among the three without us.

131
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,840
Alan's, I would classify you sort of as a slack channel stalker.

132
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,580
You get involved if someone's mocking you or usually me.

133
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,380
Or someone says something that you just can't stand anymore.

134
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,460
I imagine that's how you handle Twitter.

135
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,580
That's usually you also.

136
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,230
But yeah, the slack channel, if you're not on it,

137
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,190
you should get on it.

138
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,190
It's really formed up an informal community.

139
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,940
Yeah, it's one of the three.slack.com.

140
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,780
If you need an invitation, you can email me, Alan at angryweasel.com.

141
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,500
Oh, we're gonna...

142
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:12,940
Okay.

143
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,420
You can do that.

144
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,220
How else are you gonna do it?

145
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,740
I just like Hawk and Percy like crazy on that one.

146
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,450
Percy has done a lot for us.

147
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,970
Maybe in the spirit of the holidays,

148
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,450
you shouldn't chuck more crap on top of him.

149
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,210
Is he your lackey?

150
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,060
I think he likes it.

151
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:39,700
Did you hear episode 49, how happy he was saying, and I'm not Brent.

152
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,980
That was 48, right?

153
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,450
49?

154
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,410
48, yes.

155
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,650
Anyway, that was my high point of the year,

156
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,410
recording that episode with the guys at Test Bash.

157
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,210
That was a lot of fun.

158
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,130
Yeah, I wish I had been there.

159
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,530
I've not been to Philadelphia, so it would have been fun doing the historical tour.

160
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,720
And then from...

161
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,040
I really enjoyed the series we did on transforming the data cultures,

162
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,560
starting in episode 44.

163
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,040
I have...

164
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
Bringing in Steve Rose.

165
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,800
I have myself stolen so much information from those discussions on my team.

166
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,200
Oh, good.

167
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,960
So that was a good learning experience for me.

168
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,800
Have you tried like, hey, here's this awesome podcast.

169
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,520
UPM should listen to it.

170
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,040
These guys, they know their stuff.

171
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,000
Have you tried that angle yet?

172
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
No, I haven't tried that.

173
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,120
Wow.

174
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,880
You think you get away with that?

175
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,880
Well, Microsoft has this huge value and huge push around the growth mindset.

176
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,600
Yep.

177
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,200
Which is from the book.

178
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,720
It's called Mindset, yeah.

179
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,360
You can look it up.

180
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
I don't need to talk about it.

181
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,680
Most of our PMs don't have that.

182
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,280
I hope they don't listen to the podcast now.

183
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,560
Yeah, so I'm guessing you're not going to use this as a reference to them.

184
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,080
No, no.

185
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,680
But I think the point is, I think I can safely say that and not edit it out.

186
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,840
That's the fun part.

187
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:54,960
Oh my gosh.

188
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,540
Alan's getting the love from the management.

189
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:05,020
Yeah, and my boss is in India right now, where it is only about nine,

190
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,260
a little after nine o'clock at night.

191
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,180
Yeah, most bosses I'm aware of still aren't in.

192
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,940
I was feeling bad for you.

193
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,780
Like 24 seven, he's got his eyes on you.

194
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,820
That was, was 48 your highlight?

195
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,460
It was episode 44 is where it began.

196
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,820
I think we did three or four episodes.

197
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:29,180
I'm sorry, 48 was, I meant it was 48 the highlight of having AB testing without Brent.

198
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,340
No, that made me sad.

199
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,700
Like really between the two of us, you've done 51 episodes and I've done 50.

200
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,900
And I'm not entirely certain since you have all the equipment, how I catch up.

201
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,460
Maybe I record a conversation on the phone.

202
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,580
Tell you what, you can just talk into a tape recorder

203
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,740
and then figure out how to upload that to the internet.

204
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,010
Yeah.

205
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
Again, not catching up.

206
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,480
All right.

207
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,820
You have any of your own moments?

208
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,180
49 was my favorite.

209
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,780
Sorry, 48 was my favorite.

210
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,460
You screwed me up by calling it 49.

211
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,670
Try bring games or something, pick up your memory agility.

212
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,790
I'm sorry, what were we talking about?

213
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:13,950
Yeah.

214
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,070
So you liked going to Philly and recording with the one of the three?

215
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,790
That was a lot of fun.

216
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,430
Anything else comes to mind?

217
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,030
Uh, was it this year with the episode where I asked you the ISTQB questions?

218
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,910
No, that was last year.

219
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,390
Damn it.

220
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,910
That was our favorite moment from, that was one of our favorite moments.

221
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,790
I can't remember.

222
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,270
Yeah.

223
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,150
I really, this will be the year 2017.

224
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,710
Yeah, right.

225
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,630
As I get older will be the year where I really break things down.

226
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,830
We need, you know, um, the Stack Overflow podcast,

227
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,590
they have people that translate, that translate the text,

228
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,230
not only into English, but into different languages.

229
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,110
We need one of those.

230
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,070
I didn't like someone Stack Overflow had a podcast.

231
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:55,790
See, that's what you know.

232
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,900
So, uh, let's flip those two speaking of podcasts.

233
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,140
Um, I was thinking about my favorite pot, the podcast I listened to the most

234
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,420
ones I listened to the most in the last year and they haven't really changed.

235
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:17,020
So I, so for me, freaking omics, although, um, because of your suggestions last year,

236
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,380
I listened to a great deal of the ones that you suggested last year.

237
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,860
For example, uh, I don't remember what I was forgetting.

238
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,620
Then actually I have my phone.

239
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,540
So I'll tell you why you look it up.

240
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,260
So my, the staples that I listened to regularly, I'm sort of a trivia nerd.

241
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,020
I just saw a good job brain.

242
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,660
Yep.

243
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,060
So good job brain is something I listened to.

244
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,100
I listened to both.

245
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,380
Wait, wait, don't tell me.

246
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,500
And, uh, what's the other trivia?

247
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,620
A little bit lamer trivia show on NPR.

248
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,100
I don't know.

249
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,300
Uh, I don't have it.

250
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,630
It is a shoot has a fear of Eisenberg crap.

251
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,660
It'll come back to me.

252
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,100
So I still actively listened to this American life.

253
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,420
I, I like the story model.

254
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,780
It's a great way to learn.

255
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:12,220
I mean, the way to learn anything is to immerse yourself in the technique.

256
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,920
For example, when I was in college and played in a jazz bands, we'd have this grueling

257
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
audition process.

258
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
And a lot of times he'd ask like, who do you listen to?

259
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,660
It's what there's so much more of what you get as like a jazz musician on what you

260
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,380
listen to.

261
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,620
And there's so much you learn by listening to players play the good, the great players

262
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,940
that will eventually transition into your playing.

263
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,940
All the great writers say the way you get better at writing is to practice writing a

264
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,220
lot and to read a lot.

265
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,900
Stephen King has a great book called on writing.

266
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,780
He talks about just if you want to be a good writer, you need to read a lot.

267
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,580
If you want to be a good storyteller, listen to a lot of good stories and read a lot

268
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,620
of good stories.

269
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,100
Yeah.

270
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,540
And, and learn the art of a, sounds like a James Whitaker talk, learn the art of

271
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,260
storytelling.

272
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,540
Years ago, there was a class here at Microsoft advanced presentation design.

273
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,740
And that was a key aspect of the whole thing is if in present in presenting your goal

274
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,660
is primarily entertainment.

275
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,380
It's not the delivery of the content.

276
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,340
Absolutely.

277
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,860
And that's like the step in between there.

278
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,820
And I've been trying some different, I learned a technique.

279
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:25,340
I haven't pulled it off really well yet, but someday I'll give a talk where I can

280
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,300
pull it off.

281
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:31,100
It's this five by five technique where you start with a story, you don't finish

282
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,740
it.

283
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,020
And you go into another story and then you kind of build this inner loop and

284
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
kind of get the fourth or fifth story.

285
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,940
You tell the ending to that story.

286
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,340
And then in weaving your talk, the ending to the, after the fifth story, the fourth

287
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,340
story, then the ending to the third story.

288
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,780
And then people are waiting for, they're waiting all for the, they know at the end

289
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,060
they get the answer in the punch line to the story you started at the beginning.

290
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,070
It's a really difficult technique, but in the examples I've seen, it's really

291
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:57,710
cool to watch.

292
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,750
So I want to pull that one off sometimes, but I think if you want to be a

293
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,230
presenter, I think storytelling, as you mentioned, very important.

294
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,230
How many talks have you seen about data presentation?

295
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,310
Again, to give test bash a plug, one of the things I liked about it is it wasn't

296
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,630
that, although some people bordered a little bit on it for the most part, it

297
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,270
was experiential and there was a story there.

298
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,710
And I think that's really important.

299
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,430
I hate this.

300
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:24,350
So what you want to do with metrics is you want to measure things, measure them

301
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,550
again, but first let's look at the definition of metric and see what that

302
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:27,870
means.

303
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,470
It's like, Oh my God, I want to gouge my brain out with an icicle.

304
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,740
Um, happy.

305
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,620
Every, so you mentioned, you know, the data presentations, even then you can

306
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,620
do it with a brilliant story.

307
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,830
For example, every Ted talk I've seen where they're presenting data, right?

308
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,950
Those guys are good.

309
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,790
I have not seen a sucky one of those.

310
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:52,110
No abs because they can tell a story with right.

311
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,550
So, so important.

312
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,790
So anyway, this American life getting back on track here.

313
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:58,430
Uh, absolutely.

314
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:01,710
If you listen to those stories, you will, if you don't regurgitate those

315
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,280
stories, uh, you will, uh, you will be become a better storyteller.

316
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,200
One of the things that we tied us back to jazz again.

317
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,680
One of the things we always do in lessons when I was, uh, playing a lot is

318
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,160
in lessons.

319
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,480
We, one of the things I always have to do is learn a solo from John

320
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,520
Coltrane from, uh, Sonny Stitt from Dexter Gordon, um, you know, off, off

321
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,250
of the recording and learn how to play it just like they do.

322
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,900
And that's gotta be hard.

323
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,020
We would, um, you get better at it.

324
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,100
Cause the ear is so important.

325
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,260
So we would do like, I would do like one a week, learn a solo a week, whether it's.

326
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,140
So what happened is occasionally then when you're playing your own solos, a little

327
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:47,140
bit of those things you go, Oh, I can play that riff.

328
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,660
I learned from that Dexter Gordon's whole earth.

329
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,780
It fits really well right here.

330
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,260
And those little bits of they call them quotes and those little, those quotes

331
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,420
come out in your own playing the same thing.

332
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,940
If you listen to a lot of stories like this American life, like a lot of the

333
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:06,420
NPR shows or Ted talks or, uh, one of the podcasts I'll mention is Dan

334
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,580
Carlin has a couple really good podcasts.

335
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,780
Who's named that completely forgotten one on history, which is like their

336
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,700
three hour podcast, but he doesn't know what sort of on politics and current

337
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,020
events.

338
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,300
He's just a good storyteller.

339
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,210
It's all by himself telling, talking about how these things work.

340
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,250
It's very, he's very, uh, engrossing.

341
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,650
And although I won't tell his stories, there may be an anecdote I'll pick up

342
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,850
and maybe from this American life, if you listen to it enough, you'll find, Hey,

343
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,090
you know what?

344
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,010
That's that relates a little bit to work.

345
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,130
I can weave in this story in a presentation about something I'm doing

346
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,090
at work and those, so the exact same patterns happen.

347
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:44,690
So if you, that's something that you want to be good at listening to those

348
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,050
things will definitely help you.

349
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,130
It's very aligned.

350
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:53,970
Like you mentioned mentioned the Ted talk, uh, they have a podcast.

351
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,450
And so the two things, the two podcasts that I am regular listeners to

352
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:02,610
that I added this year are the Ted radio hour.

353
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:09,360
Cause the other thing I think I really like about the, um, the two that I've

354
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,440
added, they're both very much around stories, but they're grab bags.

355
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,320
You don't know what you're going to get on any podcasts.

356
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,320
So I find that that opens up the realm of possibilities.

357
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,920
Have we as we've talked about here, new ideas come from old ideas

358
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,800
coming together.

359
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:36,580
So whenever I hear my Steven Johnson bone, who's the guy that wait, where

360
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,380
ideas come from?

361
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:37,540
Yeah.

362
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,340
Steven Johnson.

363
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,940
Does he have a podcast?

364
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,060
He just started one.

365
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:42,510
Okay.

366
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,430
I'm going to, it's called wonderland.

367
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,390
All right.

368
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:51,230
So my third that I haven't even listened to yet will be wonderland.

369
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:51,950
Okay.

370
00:21:53,470 --> 00:22:00,990
But the one thing that I found that I think is a gem is called 99% invisible.

371
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:04,770
I have heard about that have not listened to it.

372
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:18,300
99% invisible is a podcast around design and how design has positively and negatively impacted

373
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,860
the humans that interact with that design.

374
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:33,940
So the latest episode as an example talks one second.

375
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,820
Is it called wonderland?

376
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,300
Is that it?

377
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,260
Yeah.

378
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,140
Fantastic.

379
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,820
Subscribe.

380
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,350
Oh, Steven Johnson.

381
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,710
I just clicked through.

382
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,590
Oh, Brent.

383
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,970
That actually is that's, that's honestly, that is better than a, than a Christmas present.

384
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:55,010
Good.

385
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:55,810
Cause that's all I got.

386
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,130
Yeah.

387
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,160
I mean, I just liked the, the, the latest podcast is called the, the plat of Zaya.

388
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:12,590
And it's about salt lake city and how bring them young designed the city.

389
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:21,840
And they have these 660 acre blocks, which is, I believe nine times larger than a normal

390
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,640
New York block.

391
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,900
And the streets are like, um, I want to say 120 yards across.

392
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,940
So a traditional stoplight signal.

393
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,100
They have problems with it.

394
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,500
Because if pedestrian starting to walk the traditional timing for pedestrians,

395
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,620
they're in the middle of the street when it gets to don't walk.

396
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:53,420
So there's the, um, they're going through how that initial design benefited and then

397
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,900
how it changed, uh, society later and what they're trying to do about it.

398
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,420
Like it, it's a brilliantly named, uh, podcast, 99% invisible.

399
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,940
I've added it to my list.

400
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,180
Yeah.

401
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:06,500
Okay.

402
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,420
So, so mine are like, I'm looking at my list now.

403
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:14,420
So I remember that the Ophira Eisenberg hosted chill on NPR is called ask me another.

404
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,080
And it is, uh, while wait, wait, don't tell me is, uh, news related trivia from the week.

405
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,960
It's a great way to catch up.

406
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,760
The fun way to catch up on news, uh, ask me another is just rant like stupid word

407
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,920
games to play this game called this, that, or the other, which I find kind of hilarious.

408
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,080
And one of it's one of the games they play.

409
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,840
And what they do is they'll give you a name and like they'll pick three categories.

410
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,360
Like what was the one yesterday?

411
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,470
A national park, Japanese movie monster, or I forget the other one, something else.

412
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,590
And they give you a name like to try geeky.

413
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,550
And so it's just, it's not like any, any information you would use

414
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:58,910
ever elsewhere, but it's fun to hear people.

415
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,710
It's just, it's just, it's a good commute.

416
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,790
Listen for me for those.

417
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,230
So do you listen to Freakonomics?

418
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,910
I don't.

419
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,630
Okay.

420
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,390
Occasionally if I'm out of other podcasts,

421
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:16,030
Stephen Dubner has a new one that it's, uh, tell us something we don't know where he,

422
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:21,310
he invites participants to come in and just tell a story of that.

423
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,710
They expect people to not know already.

424
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,630
It's really random.

425
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,080
Um, but you learn something from every participant.

426
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,280
Okay.

427
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
So back to my turn.

428
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,080
So the podcast, I listened to the most again, most of the same as last year.

429
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,040
Uh, I'm what I haven't mentioned so far.

430
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,680
The Dan Carlin shows are common sense with Dan Carlin.

431
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,200
I like his history show is called Dan Carlin's hardcore history.

432
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,290
I don't think he even does that show anymore.

433
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:53,890
But, uh, if you can go back to the back episodes, uh, he does these like seriously,

434
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,880
like three hour long podcast talking about, you know, the Cuban missile crisis or,

435
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,160
or the, the plague or any chunk of history.

436
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,280
He will actually make it interesting for three hours,

437
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,440
which I get is great for the long road trip.

438
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:09,840
Right.

439
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,480
A lot of fun.

440
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,840
Uh, only other thing interesting on here is I do listen to total soccer show.

441
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,640
Of course you do catch up on things.

442
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,440
Congratulations.

443
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,240
Sounders.

444
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,880
Stephen Dubner also does a soccer show with his son.

445
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,960
Oh, there are too many soccer shows made listen to them all.

446
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,680
I used to listen to the one from, uh, MLS major league soccer sponsors,

447
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,640
one called extra time, which is awful.

448
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,520
I listened to it for a while.

449
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,720
I just couldn't stand it.

450
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,280
I just couldn't stand it.

451
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm sorry.

452
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,200
So, but you need a hug.

453
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,440
No.

454
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,160
So anyway, that's kind of my podcast list.

455
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,000
I was on the testing show this year and we'll check out that podcast from time to time.

456
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,840
Uh, and I did, I don't think it's a really regular podcast.

457
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
Now I recorded a little short with Mark Tomlinson, who was one of the three

458
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
for a little test bash pre-show.

459
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:03,870
He's on the East coast.

460
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,630
I think we did it like five in the morning.

461
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:06,670
My time.

462
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:08,610
Jinkies.

463
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,170
Jinkies.

464
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:09,410
Right.

465
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:10,530
Jink.

466
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:10,690
Yeah.

467
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,690
You're so weird, Brent.

468
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,630
So anyway, those are my favorites.

469
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,310
Those are the ones that get regular play in my car on my commutes to work.

470
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,770
And I will be listening to a lot of these on that drive to Bozeman, Montana.

471
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,540
I need to.

472
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,620
Okay.

473
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:30,420
All right.

474
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,220
What's up next?

475
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,980
What blogs are you plugging for 2016?

476
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:48,060
So as I was prepping through this, I realized that not except for prepping for this show,

477
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:58,780
this is the year where I didn't proactively go out and follow up on, on, um, testing podcasts

478
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,580
or not podcasts, uh, blogs.

479
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:08,940
Like the, the closest thing I would say to that is, uh, anytime you post something

480
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,760
because I have the notification on, I read it, but I don't, you're so lame.

481
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:22,640
I don't even, I don't even think I would classify yours as a, uh, testing blog as much as I would

482
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,920
have say a couple of years ago.

483
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,560
For sure.

484
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,120
For sure.

485
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,200
And interesting.

486
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,640
I was going to bring up the same point.

487
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,240
I still read a lot of blogs.

488
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,920
I go through my blog list usually daily and flip through it and it's half software engineering

489
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,920
blogs, half other things I'm interested in software engineering, including testing.

490
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,440
There's a few, I won't pull out any names, but you readers could imagine.

491
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,920
There's a few blogs I read just to see if someone's going to say something

492
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,990
extra exceptionally stupid or thought provoking or interesting.

493
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:51,870
Everyone want to look at it.

494
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,790
Well, the, the, the, the test related blogs that I have read read rather are when listeners

495
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:03,580
or you, um, have sent it our way as sort of podcast fodder.

496
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:14,750
Uh, the I am reminded of the, the episode we talked about, uh, in this last year, um,

497
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,990
on the box, uh, controversial slide.

498
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:22,350
Oh yeah.

499
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:23,470
Well, there was the right.

500
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:27,870
There was the whole thing on agile is coming to get you, you, you,

501
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,870
agile hate your doors.

502
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,310
Agile hates testers.

503
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:34,610
What does it?

504
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,670
Hates testers.

505
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,690
Agile hates testers.

506
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:45,670
Yeah, so for me, two blogs that I am going to totally screw up,

507
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,340
but I spent a lot of time on nowadays,

508
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:56,620
is number one, it's cleverly named AndrewJellman.com

509
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,780
and Data Mining Blog.com.

510
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:06,300
Both of these are applied data science blogs.

511
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,020
They both are around, they simplify,

512
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,180
they give you techniques to observe,

513
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,860
and they open up things to a lot more people.

514
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,140
They're not data science blogs for data scientists.

515
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,920
Oh, I need that one.

516
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,120
I need data science for non-data scientists

517
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,690
and people that aren't very good at math.

518
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,700
This is something that I'm thinking about

519
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,600
changing my blog towards.

520
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,760
So I've been doing a lot of ML in my day-to-day life.

521
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,120
Machine learning.

522
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,040
Thank you.

523
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,040
You're welcome.

524
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:50,930
And I have one of my employees who is just a brilliant guy.

525
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,210
Hey, it's Talon.

526
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,650
And about this point in the audio,

527
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,690
things start going badly and they only get worse.

528
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,170
So we'll finish up this topic.

529
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:06,130
And Brett now, kick off 2017 at episode 52

530
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,710
with a rehash of our 2017 predictions.

531
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:14,670
But he can be, he can tend on the impatient side.

532
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,190
So this data science thing, he immediately sort of goes,

533
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:20,710
this is hard and it's math-y

534
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:23,120
and I don't want to get involved in it.

535
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,040
But he's a smart kid.

536
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:31,720
And he started doing Azure ML.

537
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:36,760
And he realized that by observing what I've been doing,

538
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,560
that he was able to apply some of those basics

539
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,800
that he's picked up and immediately start rolling

540
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,830
on Azure ML.

541
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,980
So I'm thinking through this idea of also helping

542
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:58,000
to simplify things as well as get better myself on Azure ML.

543
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,880
Send me a link to that blog.

544
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,440
Yeah.

545
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,880
And I will put it in the show notes

546
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,280
and add it to my own feed as well.

547
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,540
I'll send you the positive thing about me having notes

548
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,300
is I can send you the whole bloody thing.

549
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,460
Oh, great.

550
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:12,750
Blog pose.

551
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,870
There were two that were really interesting to me this year.

552
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:23,310
One was from knowledgetester.org.

553
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:28,390
And it was on the generalist versus specialist discussion.

554
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:35,520
And I recently wrote a blog on this sort of topic

555
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,500
where I go through the history of where specialists come from.

556
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:47,300
And we kind of, I'd say, accidentally collaborated.

557
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,940
But he invented this thing called a pie-shaped tester.

558
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,180
Pie as in the Greek letter.

559
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,980
OK.

560
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,900
Which is like, there's a thing called a tree-shaped,

561
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,140
or a T-shaped tester.

562
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,620
Right.

563
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,380
T-shaped persona.

564
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,140
It's a T, but with one more depth skill set.

565
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,380
Great.

566
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,300
And then the last one, which I will,

567
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,180
I think this is something that everyone should listen to based

568
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,500
off of our data.

569
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,180
Or not listen to.

570
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:14,820
It's a blog post.

571
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,980
I'll just click correct you later.

572
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,700
You can have Cortana read it to you.

573
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,700
On the Data Mining blog, one of the posts that they did

574
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,660
was the five most common data relationships

575
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,460
shown through visualization.

576
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:31,180
So I think one of the first places people need to get into,

577
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,420
and we talked about this in the past,

578
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:41,310
is how valuable just staring at histograms are.

579
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:46,510
And they wrote a blog post around different, most

580
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,070
five common relationships where you can look at it and go,

581
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,180
ooh, I see something there that's

582
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,260
worthwhile to dig in further.

583
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,760
Cool.

584
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,340
Interesting.

585
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,660
That's it for me on the blog post.

586
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,220
How about you?

587
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,740
I gave this one last year, but I'll give it again.

588
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,220
I'm going to try and print out.

589
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
I probably screwed up her name last year, too.

590
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,100
But I got to meet Merit at Test Bash.

591
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,320
But Merit, oh my gosh.

592
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,760
I looked this up last year.

593
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,800
Merit, who has at visible-quality.blogspot.com,

594
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,080
has her season testers crystal ball.

595
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,780
And her role is so much like mine.

596
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,180
She knows testing, and she's on an Agile team.

597
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,100
My team's not really Agile, so maybe it's not that close.

598
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,340
They like to think they are.

599
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,700
But that's a whole other topic.

600
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,660
But it's not as much fragile your team.

601
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,140
She blogs almost every day.

602
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,020
And everything is, I have to read them all.

603
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,740
Because she does a good job.

604
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,180
And oh, yeah.

605
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,060
I've done that.

606
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,860
That's cool.

607
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,580
Oh, new perspective.

608
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,500
Cool.

609
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,460
Really impressed by her blog post.

610
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,740
I'm jealous of both that capability.

611
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,540
And even yours.

612
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,140
When I sit down to do a blog post,

613
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,980
I know the next four hours of my life are dedicated to this.

614
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,180
So you can just, and it's a brilliant blog post.

615
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,100
Depending on your definition of brilliant.

616
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,300
OK, happy 2016.

617
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,780
We'll see you in 2017.

618
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,500
I'm Alan.

619
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,580
I'm Britt.

620
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
And we're done.

621
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,020
Happy holidays all the time.
