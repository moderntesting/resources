1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
We need to have everybody gradually moving along on this trajectory to not need the testing

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:16,160
specialist anymore. But you might not ever get there. You might get there. And if you do get

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,120
there, that doesn't mean that testers are out of work because believe me, there are plenty of other

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:30,500
places that still need software testers. Welcome to AVE testing podcast, your modern

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,620
testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

6
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,260
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now on with the show.

7
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:46,420
Hey, good everyone. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. I should unmute.

8
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,820
And we have a guest. We do.

9
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,260
Say hi, Kristen. Hello.

10
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,340
We have Kristen Jackvone. On the podcast this week, we're going to talk about all kinds of

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,060
testing stuff, but we should, I should just let you plug yourself. So maybe we can start with this.

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,260
So Kristen, you're here for a good reason to talk about something very exciting and important

13
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,500
you've done recently. But just say, introduce yourself and talk about your thing and we'll

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,580
go from there. Okay. So I am here to talk about the book that I published in December.

15
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,980
And the name of that book is The Complete Software Tester,

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:27,620
concept, skills, and strategies for high quality testing. And it aims to be sort of a one-stop

17
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:34,100
shop to help you with all kinds of testing things, manual testing, automated testing,

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,900
API testing, testing strategy, performance testing, mobile testing. It's really, that's why it's called

19
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:46,420
The Complete Software Tester. So I'm really excited about it. It's the culmination of a

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,620
couple of years worth of work. So yeah, I'm here to talk about it some more and answer your question.

21
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,020
And I have some, I have plenty of questions about it. I think Brent does too. I don't

22
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:02,900
know sure where to start. So there's a couple places I could start. One is, well, one, I skim

23
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:08,580
through the book. You're right. It is complete. I've always been a fan of the testing books that

24
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,100
were more broad and some stay very broad and are not pragmatic. And the ones that are pragmatic

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,580
are about one thing. And the thing that's great about yours, it's really cool, enough information

26
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,860
to kind of understand, oh, that's what you do there. Is that fair from your side? Because I have

27
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:32,100
a statement after that. Yeah, absolutely. And that was a lot of my motivation for writing the book in

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:39,460
the first place. I discovered software testing sort of late in life. I was almost 40 when I discovered

29
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:45,540
that software testing was a thing and that I wanted to do it. And I was so excited about it.

30
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,060
And I wanted to learn as much as I could. And I had a lot of trouble finding the information that

31
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,940
I needed. And a lot of times, if you don't know what you don't know, then you have no way to ask

32
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,980
questions about it. And just a perfect example would be something like working with a development

33
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,700
team and wanting to make a change to the code. And the developer says to you, well, we'll just

34
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,260
pull down the repo and make some changes and then do a PR. It's like, what? What does that even mean?

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,940
Like, what's a repo? What's a PR? And so the book is really aiming to kind of give you like a

36
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,180
starting point for a whole lot of different things so that then people can go on from the book and

37
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,100
know what kinds of questions they need to ask to learn further. Which gets to my point, which

38
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,500
isn't the intent of your book, but it's the way I'm going to use it when I give copies away. So

39
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,820
you have a section in your book where you talk about a couple of pages about what will we still

40
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,740
need software testers, which I want to go to in a minute, because I think you're largely right.

41
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,870
But you may have heard the story I told a few times on the podcast when I was coaching

42
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,030
a team at Unity that did not have dedicated software testers on how to write

43
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,110
developers how to do testing. The VP would ask me, how is the dev team doing at testing? And I say

44
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,190
they do all the tests they know how to do. They had unconscious incompetence. They could test the

45
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,790
stuff they could think of, but they just didn't really think of the things you outline in your

46
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,310
book. And I think this is actually, while not what you intended, I think this is an excellent

47
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,150
book to get maybe it was you can tell me, this is going to be an excellent book to give

48
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,110
developers to help them understand all the different ways they can test the thing they're

49
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:37,390
building. Yes, absolutely. And I think maybe on my description of it on Amazon, I might even say

50
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,230
that that that software developers, I'm not sure it's been a while since I wrote it now. But

51
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,670
yeah, that's something that we've been working on at Paylocity, which is the company where I work,

52
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,270
because we've been working on an initiative to really have the whole team own quality

53
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:59,550
and developers can get very nervous about that. What I need to test, what does that even mean?

54
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,510
And so, yeah, so this would be an excellent tool for that.

55
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,070
So maybe, I'm glad you feel that way too. I think it's a great way because Brent,

56
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,870
actually, I don't know what Brent does, but I worked with a lot of teams that don't have

57
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,230
dedicated testers, but it doesn't mean they don't do testing. They do a lot of testing.

58
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,310
Why do we still need dedicated testers?

59
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:28,540
I think there are a few reasons. One is that teams change. So you might have a team that

60
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:35,820
is just working swimmingly. There's no dedicated testers. Everybody knows exactly what to do.

61
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,580
Everybody works cooperatively together. But then somebody new comes onto the team,

62
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:47,660
and that really changes the whole team dynamic. So you might need to have somebody focused on

63
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:56,990
testing at that point to help that new person acclimate. Another thing is that the technology

64
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,870
changes. So let's say, for example, you've got a team and they're doing a whole bunch of stuff

65
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:09,390
with Azure, and then they decide that they need to lift and shift their entire platform over to AWS

66
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:15,310
instead. Well, that's going to require different testing. And so while the team is figuring out

67
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,710
how to do that, having a dedicated tester could be something that would help with the transition.

68
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,350
So yeah, I think those are some of the big reasons.

69
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:32,590
So can I ask a clarification on that one? Because what I heard you mention is dedicated tester,

70
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:38,900
but in your two scenarios were ephemeral in nature. Was that by design?

71
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,630
Ephemeral is in. I'm not providing like a concrete example of something.

72
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:53,310
No. So for example, I'm going to distinguish like your AWS example. I'm going to distinguish

73
00:06:53,310 --> 00:07:03,150
between a dedicated tester versus dedicated testing is needed. And we need people to do that.

74
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:08,590
And in ephemeral fashion, meaning it's going to be timebox, it's not going to continue.

75
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:16,380
Did you make that distinction on purpose? Is there a role of a place or do you summarize

76
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,260
the places where you feel a dedicated tester in a more permanent scenario?

77
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:32,370
Okay. Yeah, I think I guess my feeling is that a lot of teams just aren't mature enough to be able to

78
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:42,050
handle all of the testing without that person that thinks about how to test things. And I think

79
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:48,530
that's the skill set that testers really bring is that testers love thinking about what can go

80
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:54,290
wrong with this. What are all of the really horrible things that could happen? And how can we test

81
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:00,690
for those? I think that developers can do that. And certainly developers can be trained to do that.

82
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:08,530
But most teams, they're trying to deal with tech debt. They're trying to churn out features and meet

83
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:17,890
the business requirements that are put upon them. They might not have the time or even the skills

84
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:25,730
to do that. So I think it's like they're sort of a testing nirvana where everybody understands

85
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:32,770
exactly what needs to be done and how to do it. But how many of us are really going to get there?

86
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,130
Some of us. Maybe not all of us, at least not right now.

87
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,530
Yeah, I think that's a good way to see it. It's not exactly what we've talked about with a test

88
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,570
coach, but kind of somebody there to kind of help people. And I've been in that role before

89
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:54,130
myself and there is value there. So yes, oh, by the way, and it's my mistake, I actually just kind

90
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,250
of flipped through the forward again of your book where you actually do explicitly say this book

91
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:05,090
could be for developers, too. So good. See, I didn't remember. You didn't even know I asked a dumb question.

92
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,600
Yeah, no, I so that's one thing I adore. I do think so. Like I

93
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,260
were not doing live stream. So the podcast won't see this. But one of the questions I wrote down

94
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:30,300
is, OK, I wanted to explore sort of this idea around the tester mindset. And I think I think

95
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,700
Chris and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think you'll say, yeah, there is a tester

96
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:42,940
mindset, but not in the way that is often described when those terms are used. That that in other

97
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:50,540
words, I don't think you would argue that this tester mindset is exclusive to testers.

98
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:58,060
Right. Yeah. It does can be trained. And as Alan just pointed out, it's in the forward.

99
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,380
And then in your last your last answer to the question, you mentioned that it's going to be

100
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,660
based on the maturity of the team. And you also mentioned you're a huge proponent. Well,

101
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:18,060
I don't think you said huge, but a proponent of whole team. Yes. And so

102
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:25,940
a dedicated tester specialist, I think you're going to say you're going to argue, hey, it's going to

103
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,900
be based on business needs. And sometimes you're going to need it because the business needs it

104
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:39,620
because they have a gap that needs to be filled. Right. But I think you would. Well, you tell me

105
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,540
instead of me constantly telling you your words, how about I ask you a question about that, Brett?

106
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:52,510
Yeah, that that that might make for a better interview long term. Where do you see it going?

107
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:00,240
I think, well, one thing that that has made me so happy over the last couple of years,

108
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,000
working where I do is to see the quality of software testers that we have been hiring.

109
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,120
And those those testers have a lot of coding skills and they have a lot of I guess I'll call

110
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,360
it nontraditional testing skills for the lack of a better word, but like they know about security

111
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,000
testing. They know about performance testing. And so what I'm seeing is that we're starting

112
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,430
to develop what I will call a full stack tester. That's a tester who understands accessibility

113
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:41,630
testing, security testing, load testing. They know how to help shepherd a release through on release

114
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:47,870
night. They can go in there and make changes to the code when they need to. Like if there's

115
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,990
like an accessibility item that that needs to be worked on, like, oh, you know, we're missing a

116
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,630
tag here or something like that, they can go in and they can make those changes. They can

117
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:04,910
put together entire frameworks. So I'm imagining that that sort of what's going to happen is

118
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:12,670
like emerging where the testers are getting better and better and better at more technical

119
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,310
and more development related things, whereas the developers are getting better and better and

120
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:23,230
better at the testing things. So that's what I would imagine for the future, but I do not have

121
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:29,470
a crystal ball and things could change radically. Who knows? Go ahead, Alan. No, I want your

122
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:37,950
reaction, Brent, because you know, I wholly agree with that. Yes. Right. And as a matter of fact,

123
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:45,470
I would say in general, what we did here at Microsoft kind of followed that pattern.

124
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,660
Right. You merge it. Then then you still have to sort of get stuff done

125
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:03,140
in this new reality. And I think over time, people generalize. Right. So

126
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,380
Kristen's a listener. That's what I've been informed. I don't know how many episodes she's

127
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,340
listened to, but I assume you're aware of the modern testing principles that we've.

128
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:26,350
OK, I guess based off of this, principle number seven, this is the one that sort of Alan's

129
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,990
question line of questioning has been on. Where did we get that wrong?

130
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:38,350
I don't think you did get it wrong. I will definitely say that a few years ago, and I

131
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,830
can't remember how many years ago it was that I first became acquainted with the modern testing

132
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,230
principles. I was reading through them and I was number one, number two, like, yeah, yeah,

133
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:54,160
this is great. I love this. And I got to seven and I was like, this is oh, my God,

134
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,440
they're talking about getting rid of testers. And it took me a long time. And it took me

135
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,960
listening to your podcast to to really think about it. And I realized that

136
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,020
the wrong thing to do would be to read this and say we don't need testers anymore

137
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,420
because then you're going to wind up with with applications that suck. Like,

138
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:29,100
what we need is we need to have everybody gradually moving along on this trajectory to

139
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,540
not need the testing specialist anymore. But, you know, you might not ever get there.

140
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,860
You might get there. And if you do get there, that doesn't mean that testers are out of work,

141
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,620
because believe me, there are plenty of other places that still need software testers. I know

142
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,260
because every time I interact with an application, you know, I'm filling out a form to order

143
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,980
something or whatever, and I discover the pop up doesn't work right or or I can't get

144
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:01,500
to the button I need to click like that. We're going to need testers for a long, long time.

145
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,660
You've seen the light on this and you get it exactly right. And Brent knew this. He asked

146
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,060
a very leading question because everything you talked about before described that the principle

147
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,260
seven says it may reduce or eliminate the need for dedicated testing specialists because it may.

148
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,700
And a lot of times it does. But what we really want to do there is get rid of

149
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,500
a dedicated specialist as a bottleneck and at the point where you're there to

150
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:36,380
advise and look into some of the the areas that even a good developer tester may not get to

151
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,590
being there for those things. There's there's plenty to do there. And I'm a big fan of the

152
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,860
of that sort of role. And I just flipped it a little bit farther. Like we have,

153
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,990
I think I mentioned on the podcast, I have a small team of people who function as quality coaches,

154
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,750
most like much like you said, being dedicated on one team, they bounce around a little bit.

155
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,110
Sometimes they consult for the really little mini consultant team. Sometimes they consult for

156
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,990
an hour, half a day, a day. One person has been embedded on a team for three months to help them

157
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:15,070
bootstrap some automation, just whatever they need to help them build that testing knowledge.

158
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,110
Maybe instead of consulting, I can send them copies of your book.

159
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,030
But yeah, I think everything you've talked about says that you have seen past the words on a page

160
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,990
on the page, which can be scary around principle number seven and actually have figured out what

161
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:36,750
that means in practice. It's not scary. And it's not a definitive like we're getting rid of testers

162
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:41,310
is you just actually make it so good at making software quality software from the beginning

163
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,750
that dedicating someone to testing all the time would be a waste.

164
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:51,070
I absolutely believe that a tester specialist today, a traditional tester specialist,

165
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,910
if they invest in what we are, if they invest in understanding and what we're talking about

166
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:04,590
in the modern testing and festivals, they will not only be excited about the removal of

167
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,270
or the potential removal of a testing specialist. What I've observed in the industry,

168
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:17,470
every time we go through the cycle and we improve, that individual becomes a lot more valuable.

169
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:24,590
And I've said, actually, Kristen, you just brought up it. You believe that there's an eventual

170
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:28,670
merging of these things. Have you actually observed that yet in practice?

171
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:34,270
Well, I have a fun story to tell you about one of the teams at my company, and I'm going to give

172
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:39,710
the shout out to the core platforms team just in case they're listening today. So this was a team

173
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,750
of developers. They do as their name suggests, they do a lot of sort of back end stuff. They

174
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:56,510
they deal with caching and with API governance and with messaging, that kind of thing. And so they

175
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:03,870
had formed this team. They really wanted a software tester. And it just was not in the cards.

176
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:09,550
Budget wise, they were told, no, you can't have a tester. So my role at the company is really to

177
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:15,310
help all of the teams adopt quality practices. And so I met with them and they said, well,

178
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,550
what are we going to do? Well, one of the other things that they wanted to work on was

179
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:24,590
eliminating silos because they've got a lot of really smart people on their team. Each one of

180
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,030
them was an expert in one of these different areas. And they really wanted to make sure that

181
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,910
it wasn't just one person, they were they were all experts so that someone could go on

182
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,430
vacation and not get called up in Hawaii. Hey, our caching system isn't working correctly. Can

183
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:47,070
you help us? So I suggested that they form testing buddies so that each one of them as the feature

184
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,710
expert and the one that was doing most of the dev work would be paired with one of the other

185
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,630
people. And that person would do the testing. And in the process of doing the testing,

186
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,750
not only would they learn about being a better tester, but they would also learn about the

187
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,950
other product that they were testing. And so they tried that out and that worked really well for

188
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,750
them. And then the other thing, the other idea that they came up with on their own was they

189
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:18,430
decided that they needed to have a test application, one that was different from what's running in

190
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,870
production, that they could try out all kinds of things on sort of like a sandbox to say,

191
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:30,110
let's run all of our tests against this and see what happens when we when we make those changes.

192
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,710
And so they've been working on that. And they're really excited about that. And they've come up

193
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,790
with some other testing frameworks to for observational purposes to see things like,

194
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:45,550
you know, are they getting any message loss when the messages are going out? So I'm really excited

195
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:50,590
and happy for them about the innovation that they've had together. And so now they're proving

196
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,870
they don't need a tester. They can solve these problems themselves. Yeah, that's, that's a

197
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:02,990
fantastic story. It's essentially one of the things that what is it? Necessity is the mother

198
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:09,230
of invention, right? If you if you set the stage in a way, like you told the story like, no, you're

199
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:16,030
not getting a tester. And no, you are going to continue to have the expectation of high quality

200
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:22,670
outputs, right? Well, then you figure out how to solve it. The the other thing I was trying to

201
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:29,790
get to is we talked about you you predicted that you predicted that over time you see sort of

202
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,150
tests becoming more devish and then dev becoming more test ish. And I'm wondering,

203
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:42,860
have you have you experienced any sort of ecosystem of that occurring? I have I'm just

204
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,620
curious. I have a question on that. I'm curious if you have experienced that yet. Well, one one

205
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:55,180
thing that I've seen, we had a push this year to get involved in accessibility testing. That's

206
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:00,940
something that's very important. The company where I work, we we do payroll software and we and, you

207
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,100
know, time cards and things like that we want to make sure that all of our users are going to be

208
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:12,940
able to use the application. And so teams started doing some testing, and we had a group of three

209
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:19,020
testers who got very interested in accessibility testing. And as they were learning about it,

210
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:24,940
they discovered just how easy it is to solve some of those accessibility problems, like to put in

211
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:33,020
like an alt image tag or to put in other descriptions or to change the level of headers.

212
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,020
Apparently, that's important for screen readers. So as they were learning these things,

213
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:42,140
they also realized these are simple changes that we know how to make. So they were going in

214
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,060
to their team software and they were making all of the changes and doing the pull request and getting

215
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,660
the approval and getting those changes pushed through. So I think that that's sort of the

216
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,820
tip of the iceberg. I think we're going to continue to see more things like that as we go forward.

217
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,580
Nice. And I think the second part of your question was the devs becoming more like testers.

218
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:11,900
We actually had one dev we switched over recently to using Cyprus for for UI automation. And now

219
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:20,940
we're moving into API automation with Cyprus as well. And we had one developer who was so excited

220
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,620
about Cyprus that he switched over to become a software test engineer instead. So I think,

221
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:31,020
you know, we'll see some of that as well. Well, that I'll just say this and I can have Jason

222
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,980
Huggins yell at me later. That doesn't happen with Selenium.

223
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:46,610
I don't know that I don't know that we'll inspire Huggins to come and try to yell at us again.

224
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:54,690
So that was fun. We I was just thinking about the same thing. No. So one of the things that I've

225
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:04,640
observed, Chris, and is that when you push what I've observed in my prior histories is that testers

226
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:13,810
becoming dev, even though they don't have sort of the history on like the the O of one algorithms and

227
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:21,650
such. I find I have found and it may be subjective bias. That's what I was testing. I have found that

228
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:28,130
they end up being superior developers. Oh, yeah, I was just going to say I've seen I've seen that

229
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:35,890
before too. I've seen testers switch over to be developers and contribute greatly to projects.

230
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,810
The other thing that I've seen that I really like is testers who switch over to be managers.

231
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:48,850
And those managers really understand what it means to have the whole team on quality.

232
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:56,130
So here's here's another example from from my workplace. Someone I worked with, hello,

233
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:06,370
Monica, was a tester and she became a manager of a team and she instituted sort of a process

234
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:12,370
right before the team releases. They all do exploratory testing together. All of them,

235
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,730
developers and testers are all doing that exploratory testing. And so what happened

236
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:22,610
with that was the testers were teaching the developers here are the things that you need

237
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:27,410
to look for when you're testing. And then the developers were also learning more about the

238
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:32,690
product too, because sometimes the developers can kind of get involved, like with one little section

239
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,450
of code and they're not really looking at the whole picture. So they were really seeing the

240
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:42,290
big picture. And so all of them working together found great bugs before they released. And so,

241
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:51,410
yeah, I think that testers make great managers. I definitely think that putting the tester in

242
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:57,810
a manager role, if you're going to go with a unified engineering model, they're going to

243
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:03,170
think about the whole system in the end. Yeah, testers, people who have spent time in testings

244
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:09,010
tend to be more systems thinkers, not universally true, but that's my experience in general.

245
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,930
One thing we've talked about a lot here, not directly, but I'm going to call it out is,

246
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,930
you know, you've been in testing since 2009. So I think long enough where maybe you cut the tail

247
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,370
end of the testers versus developers, but there's none of that when you're talking about it. That's,

248
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,130
I like to think in most companies, although for what I read on Twitter, it's not true, but

249
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:33,250
I think at least a lot of companies, maybe most companies are past that and it's a collaboration.

250
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,970
I think that's helps, but I wanted to talk about a tweet that I did this week, nothing to do with

251
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,650
your book, but I want you to tell a story from your book based on this. So I ran across yet

252
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:47,490
another, I won't even say where I got it, because I'll probably piss somebody off, but yet

253
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:56,690
another complaint about manual versus automated testing and labels, labels, labels. So I tweeted,

254
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,930
the coolest thing that happens when developers own all of their own testing is that all the

255
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:05,970
arguments around manual versus automated versus exploratory versus whatever all go away.

256
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:12,130
Because it's all just testing. And before I have you tell hope, remember the story you told from

257
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:17,200
this chapter in your book. One of the thing again, is isn't we're having, we're having

258
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,480
Kristen on the podcast. She can talk about the book. We're not like, we don't, we're not,

259
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,560
we're going to, we're going to talk up your book because it's good. But the, one of the things I

260
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,960
like it and brain, you would like it too, because you have the attention span of, of this

261
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,600
piece of cloth right here and the book, you want to sit down and read a chapter of the book. You

262
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,200
can be done like in 30 seconds, a minute or two, depending on the chapter. It's all little bite

263
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:50,400
size chunks. So chapter like 564, I'm making this up, is on the whole manual versus automated debate.

264
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,960
And I liked the way you just call bullshit on it. So do you remember the story from there?

265
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,560
Do you want to share that? Yeah, I'm not sure if it's a story, but, well, it's not really a

266
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,960
story, but the anecdotes you shared, like, yeah, the three software testers, Marsha,

267
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,430
yeah, yeah. And then yeah. All right. So I actually, I have the book open here so that I can

268
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:20,190
remember all the details. Marsha is the software developer and test. So she's very proud of her

269
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,910
automation skills. And she sees, you know, the feature that that's coming down the pike. And

270
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:29,630
she says, Oh, I know just what to do with this. And so she writes a whole bunch of automation

271
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:36,590
and makes sure that, you know, everything's running and, you know, the feature is released and all of

272
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,630
her tests are running and passing and isn't it awesome, but she didn't pay a whole lot of

273
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:48,510
attention to the acceptance criteria. So as a result, she missed one really important use case.

274
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:53,390
And now there are end users who are seeing errors when they use the application because

275
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:59,470
she completely missed that. And so then we've got Cindy, who's the manual tester.

276
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:05,230
Cindy read all of the requirements very, very carefully. And she came up with a very elaborate

277
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:13,630
test plan where she's manually testing everything, but because she's doing everything manually,

278
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:19,230
she can't keep up with the frequent software releases that the team is doing. So, you know,

279
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,670
the team is saying, okay, well, I just, I pushed some code here. Can you check it out? And it's

280
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:30,030
like a day and a half before she's done with all of the testing and the developers want feedback

281
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,710
right away. They want to know, did I break something? I don't want to know a day and a

282
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,670
half from now. I want to know now. So then we've got Jan, Jan's there in the middle.

283
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:46,670
And she does both. Jan is reading the requirements, the acceptance criteria. She is interacting with

284
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:53,150
the application to really understand how it works as a system. And then she's creating automated

285
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:59,630
testing that is going to be sensible and is going to reflect all of the acceptance criteria and all

286
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:07,070
the use cases that she's discovered. And so as a result, that means that the developers can

287
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,270
make the changes and push the code and know right away if they've broken anything.

288
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:12,750
Yeah.

289
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:16,670
So which one should you be? Should you be a manual tester or an automated tester?

290
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,270
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.

291
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:27,150
You should be Jan. Another thing I say in the chapter two is that like, I mean,

292
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:33,470
what does automated mean really? Like if somebody writes a script, like if I, if I need a whole

293
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:40,670
bunch of like users in my system to test with and I write a script to like put them all in the system

294
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:47,230
really fast, does that make me an automated tester now? I mean, I made a tool or I did a process

295
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:56,270
and then like if I'm creating test automation and I push a button to run the test automation and I

296
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:00,910
now a manual tester, like these distinctions are not important. What really matters.

297
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,870
Right. That's exactly it.

298
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,470
The what's getting tested is what should be getting tested.

299
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:13,790
On one hand, I get the argument like we stopped calling it manual testing and they're absolutely

300
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,830
right. Yeah.

301
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:22,190
The problem with the automated and manual discussion, in my humble opinion, is the industry

302
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:28,910
is moving in a place where again, a lot of this stuff is shifting to development.

303
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:36,990
I grew up in my career. I've had multiple people like I am a manual tester and I love this job

304
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:43,540
and I am never changing. Really? What if the industry changes to put you in a position? How

305
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:51,860
about now? You get right. And so what I see is a lot of these discussions are really my sense of it.

306
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:57,780
I'm a data scientist now. I have not done a scientific study on this, but my sense of it is

307
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:05,460
no, it's more of a justification or a rationalization of this is the value we had. But honestly,

308
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,860
it's no different than in the traditional way, the justification we've always had.

309
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:16,180
Like, like I remember a conversation I had with James, James Whitaker, and we're talking about

310
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,140
what's the ROI of tests. He and I had this over lunch and he's like,

311
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:25,460
oh, well, if you want to know what the ROI of test is, just get ready your testers and then

312
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:32,960
you'll see. Well, you know what? 20 years ago, I would have been clear today. A lot of companies,

313
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:39,020
you know what? I think his statement probably still kind of describes it because you got,

314
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:46,220
in today's world, you got rid of all your testers and nothing changed. That might indicate that no,

315
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:51,980
no, no, that's that wasn't things have changed. Right. In terms of in terms of the labels,

316
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,140
I actually think there should be no such thing as automated or manual tester,

317
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,540
automated and manual testing.

318
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:07,470
Even that's hard. So let me take that and build on that and actually talk about a twist on this,

319
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,150
this last story for the book. Like if I push a button in my manual, if I write a script to

320
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:17,230
generate stuff or am I an automation engineer, there are, and this is a rant that I've made

321
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:23,630
before and I'll make it again. There are hundreds, I would say thousands, tens of thousands. I don't

322
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:29,390
know how many test automation engineers and they are happy with their job of writing

323
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:36,930
automated Selenium tests all day long. The data show from Nicole Forest was working at Accelerate

324
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:42,450
that developers owning their own automated tests produce higher quality software. Does that mean

325
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:47,730
testers write a work? No, because this thing you described like writing a script to generate,

326
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,290
like, oh, I want to generate a bunch of names to test with. I want to generate

327
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:59,330
a bunch of input strings to put here, whatever. That is a more, for me, that is a more valuable

328
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,530
use of any sort of coding knowledge than writing a gazillion. Is that a number of rent?

329
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:12,450
They're writing a gazillion Selenium tests. It's what Merit talks about, like exploratory

330
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,170
automated testing. We're going to use the tools to help us get to a state where maybe we can

331
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:22,370
learn something interesting about the software. That is the kind of thing I want people who are

332
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,450
doing dedicated software testing to be. Ideally, developers do it too, but that's where the magic

333
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:32,850
happens. You people, and again, I'm not talking to you because nobody, nobody who writes Selenium

334
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:38,450
tests all day and loves it is listening to this podcast because they've already turned us off and

335
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,170
deleted us from the internet years ago, but there's something there.

336
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:50,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That reminds me, oh, I just totally spaced on what it was that I wanted to say.

337
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,570
Oh, hey, Brett, she's one of us. We do this all the time.

338
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:04,930
It's related to, oh, I know what it was. Okay. So at my company, we hire what I consider to be full

339
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:12,930
stack software testers. So those software testers need to know how to find bugs. And they also

340
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:21,970
need to know how to write automation that could help guard against regressions. So we actually have

341
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:28,610
a two-step process that it took us a little while to refine this, but the very first thing we do

342
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:36,380
when we have a software tester come in and be interested in interviewing with us, we give them

343
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:43,340
an application. It's a buggy application. It's got UI bugs. It's got API bugs. And we just say to them,

344
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:50,140
find all the bugs you can in this application and just write up a bug report in just whatever

345
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:55,260
style you would want to do to communicate to us what the bugs are. And then we have a scoring

346
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:02,700
rubric and we measure, did they find one point bugs? Did they find three point bugs? And it

347
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:11,420
never ceases to amaze me the inability of these people that can write Selenium tests,

348
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:17,580
but they can't find the bugs. There was one person who liked it.

349
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,420
Because they don't know anything about testing.

350
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:26,460
Yes, yes, exactly. 13 years of testing experience. We had a candidate who could only find three bugs

351
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,740
in the application. It's just, it's amazing. But yeah, I mean, that's really the most important

352
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:39,500
thing is that mindset to be able to say, what can go wrong here? What could I try here?

353
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:47,060
So yeah, yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, same rant repeated. But it reminds me a little bit and

354
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:53,070
Microsoft, I was of course at Microsoft for a long time. For many years there, I was called

355
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,310
was called an as app interviewer as appropriate, which I was at the end of the loop. I was the

356
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,390
person said, are they a good Microsoft fit? Can they do the job? And sometimes it was just

357
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:04,670
selling them if it was somebody who'd done really well on the on the interview loop. And sometimes

358
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,470
it was sometimes it was breaking the tie, kind of figuring out and those were fun too. And sometimes

359
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,750
actually, if they wouldn't even come to me if they were if they were no hires down the road.

360
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,590
But one thing that kind of blew me away, it's not similar to testing. These weren't all testing

361
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:24,830
roles. But in Microsoft, at least at the time, it's probably still true. Most of their hiring

362
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,550
has been right out of college, do a lot of hiring adventure level and then grow them through

363
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,060
the system. One thing that was interesting, like here, like, and I want to the topic I want

364
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:39,580
to get to around this is I am not a computer science major, neither is Christian. In fact,

365
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:43,660
we have a very similar major, but we'll get to that in a moment is I would be the one

366
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:52,300
interviewing these MIT folks and and Stanford or and sometimes not always app or stage these very

367
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:58,460
well educated people who were geniuses at the algorithmic computer science level,

368
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,620
but did not have the ability to think their way outside of a bag. High intelligence, low wisdom

369
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:12,900
for you, D&D players. And it was I see a parallel there. Like I would say even someone without

370
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:18,180
testing experience who kind of could see the forest for the trees would be able to find,

371
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:22,420
you know, they could fake their way through that part. But the fact that we have people

372
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,940
in testing positions doing testing all day, but they're not really doing testing,

373
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:34,260
does not surprise me. They would fail miserably there. Yeah, yeah. Well, and and that's that's

374
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:39,700
another interesting thing about the testing profession is that software testing is not

375
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:46,820
taught in college. I deal with a lot of new college grads because we do a lot of recruiting and we

376
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:52,660
recruit them as soft as software engineers. And I get to spend a whole day with them and teach them

377
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:59,060
about software testing. And one of the things I do is I ask them, what did you learn about

378
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,180
software testing? What kinds of software testing did you do? And generally, the answer is we learned

379
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,100
how to write unit tests. And that's it. They didn't learn how to think about anything else. And I

380
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:15,860
start my day with them by just showing them a little picture. It's just a field, an empty field

381
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:22,900
and a button. And I say, how would you test this? And, you know, sometimes it's fun to watch them,

382
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,340
because sometimes they'll go to write like SQL injection, you know, like right away. But but

383
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,220
sometimes they'll they'll start to think about, oh, well, you know, well, what if we had too many

384
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:37,860
characters in the field? And what if we didn't have enough characters in the field? And I say,

385
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,620
okay, well, what what if it's a phone number? And then they start thinking about all the

386
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:45,540
different things that they could test with the phone number. And hopefully they realize

387
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,820
that phone numbers are different lengths in different countries. Yes, absolutely. Yes. And

388
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,860
they usually do come up with that. So that's good. But but yeah, I mean, and that's another

389
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:03,060
reason why I wrote the book is because nobody's teaching software testing in college. Right. And

390
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:09,630
and I actually don't maybe there should there shouldn't be I do not believe there should be a

391
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:15,470
software testing degree, there should be a software testing course that, you know, computer

392
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:20,030
science is a lot about it may not cover that. But if there's a software engineering degree at

393
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:25,230
a college, definitely should have testing you and I and Brent, excuse us, we alienate you,

394
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,030
maybe, maybe, Brent, I don't know how many people you know, who studied music in college

395
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:35,070
and found their way into tech, but there's of the three people on this podcast that is true

396
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:40,190
for two of them. What was your path? So tell me how you got from music into tech.

397
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:48,910
Well, it's it's an interesting story. So I'm old enough that when I was in high school, it didn't

398
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:54,030
like computer science didn't really even occur to me as being a thing I would be interested in

399
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,950
doing like I took one computer course, the only computer course that the high school offered.

400
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:04,430
But I didn't, you know, this was before there was a thing called the internet where everybody

401
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:09,310
could communicate and their pretty pictures and and all that. So I never thought that that

402
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:16,350
computer science would be a thing for me. So I became a music teacher mostly because I couldn't

403
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:22,190
come up with something else to do. I mean, I liked music and I liked children. So that seemed like

404
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:28,110
the way to go. So I like music, but I didn't like children. Actually, so I also taught school.

405
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:32,590
Actually, I liked children. I taught middle school, but I didn't like the other teachers.

406
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:40,990
Yeah, yeah. So yeah, so I was a music teacher for a while. I left the I was an elementary school music

407
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:46,270
teacher. I left that profession when I had my son. And then I taught piano lessons at home for a while.

408
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:53,230
And then I became a church organist and choir director. Then around the same time that I

409
00:40:53,230 --> 00:41:00,030
was starting to lose interest in that area. I also got divorced and I needed another source of

410
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:05,950
income. And I had no idea what I was going to do. And I thought, well, what am I good at? Well,

411
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:11,550
I'm organized. So maybe I could be a professional organizer. So I started a professional organizing

412
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:19,470
business. I did that for about a year, discovered I didn't like it at all. But that job led me to

413
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:26,030
being a support person in a tech startup. It was a tech startup that worked with mobile phones,

414
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:30,430
they needed somebody to keep track of all the mobile phones, make sure all the software was on it.

415
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:35,150
And so while I was doing that, I thought, this software stuff looks kind of fun, you know,

416
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:40,750
maybe I'd like to be a software developer. So I started taking courses at night to do that.

417
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:49,550
And then very early on into that, the job dried up. And I found myself needing another job. And I

418
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,270
thought, I don't have enough development skills yet to even get an internship as a developer. So

419
00:41:54,350 --> 00:42:00,590
what else could I do? And so I started looking for like, tech writing. And then I discovered there

420
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:05,790
was a position open for an intern as a quality assurance engineer. And I thought, Oh, I think I

421
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:11,950
can do that. I did a little bit of testing in my previous role. So I'll do that. So I went to the

422
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:20,030
job. It was software that it was voice recognition software on Blackberry phones. This is before

423
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:27,790
Siri and all of that. And so I showed up on my first day and my supervisor gives me a test plan

424
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:31,310
to work through. And so I start working through the test plan. And I noticed something odd that

425
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:36,430
happens. And I oh, that's interesting. I want let me see if I can do that again. Yeah, that doesn't

426
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,390
look right. Well, what happens if I click this button instead, and I'm clicking the long and then

427
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,270
I said to myself, Oh, I should really stop playing with this phone and get back to work. And then

428
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:53,310
suddenly I realized this was my job. Like I was supposed to be playing with the phone. I was

429
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:58,990
supposed to be figuring out what was going on. And it was like the heavens opened. And I was like,

430
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:04,750
this is what I want to do for the rest of my life. Very cool. I also started off, I want to go

431
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:11,070
my whole story, but my first job in tech was support for in my case, I got out of grad school,

432
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:13,950
where I got a master's in composition, where I learned how to use computers pretty well,

433
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,910
didn't know anything about programming, but I got a job at a company doing

434
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:22,110
tech support for a company that made music software. I knew I knew the MIDI, I knew how

435
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,830
computers connected to musical devices really well. And then the rest I just kind of figured out.

436
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:36,350
Was it Finale? No, no. I own Finale. Finale is based in the Midwest, I believe. So I've

437
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:40,910
had a copy in the year, but it was a company called MIDI soft. Oh, okay. So this would have

438
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:46,350
been a little ahead of your time, because this was, they were mainly an OEM supplier, meaning when

439
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:50,670
you, in those days, you bought a sound card for your computer because computers didn't come with

440
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:56,830
those. And when you bought a sound card, it would come with some free software. And that's what we

441
00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:04,830
made. Cool. Yeah, I know a lot of, a lot of great software testers who were French literature

442
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:10,750
majors in college or history majors or psych majors. Well, one thing to call out here is,

443
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:16,110
this is off topic, but on topic for this conversation for a long time. I was on,

444
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:20,110
they took a break for a while, but I was on the alumni board for my university school of arts and

445
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:27,490
humanities. Cause we're talking about the value of this liberal arts education. And people think

446
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:33,820
liberal arts, you'll never get a job. And I say college is not a vocational school. And what I

447
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:40,700
learned there, I learned so many things that apply directly to what I do every single day,

448
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:46,700
but I didn't learn a skill. I learned why I learned life skills. I learned aspects of leadership. I

449
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,460
learned how to problem solve, you know, this from learning how to play a piece of music. What do

450
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,860
you do? You break it down into little pieces. You take those little pieces and you isolate

451
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,020
them to figure out why they're so damn hard. And then you, you work on them, you kind of

452
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,740
put it all back together and then you're done. And that's similar to how we do problem solving

453
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:10,700
in tech. It's just different tools in front of us. Now you go to YouTube, you look at the video

454
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:18,370
and you just copy what they're doing with their hands. Yeah. That's pretty much it, Brent. Yeah.

455
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:24,190
That's there you go. Music, future music majors. I have saved you four years,

456
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:31,070
but the thing is, and I'll go into this, we can get to closing, but there's so much more to it.

457
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:38,430
Like playing the right notes is such an infinitesimal small part of being a musician.

458
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:44,530
A lot of times we work really hard to make things look easy, but it sounds like you maybe

459
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:50,930
were a piano major. I was a voice. Well, I was a music major with a concentration in voice.

460
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:55,250
I did play the piano also. So you know this from choir. It's like, it's like in playing in

461
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:01,410
ensembles to like listening. I think there's a parallel between listening and playing for

462
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:07,890
blend and pitch. That is very similar to how we communicate with people at work.

463
00:46:08,610 --> 00:46:15,570
Yeah. And you know, I played a lot of different woodwind instruments when I was playing saxophone

464
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:22,300
in a jazz band. There are even subtle gestures you can make to get people to do something,

465
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,380
to get your section to do something different together. They just kind of pick up on those

466
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:32,260
things. And that's kind of where I equate that to little bits of coaching, like a little,

467
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,700
but even a little head nod in a meeting will make people feel like you're engaged.

468
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:41,940
It helps with engagement. So anyway, all kinds of little parallels I pick up on.

469
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,860
Brent, it's just so much more than pressing the right notes.

470
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,860
Well, and another thing that really benefited me from being an elementary school music teacher

471
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:59,700
is that I learned how to explain things to very small children. And because of that, I feel that

472
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:07,220
I'm adept at breaking things down into their simplest parts to then explain to other people,

473
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,740
including adults, including people who want to learn about testing.

474
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,220
You know what? I'm glad you brought that up because people have mentioned that to me before

475
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:22,660
that something that I do, I didn't even realize it, is I take people that have been in computers

476
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:29,740
their whole life often have a difficult time explaining technically what something is.

477
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,300
Often, I got some really nice feedback from one of our finance VPs that said,

478
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,940
Alan, it's just a really good job because I track a lot of our cost spending.

479
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,980
And say, Alan, it's just a really good job explaining these things in a way that we understand.

480
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:49,900
And it isn't that I'm trying to explain it to them in a way they understand.

481
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,780
I'm trying to explain it to them in a way I understand.

482
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,780
But yeah, I think that there is something there, learning or just having, you know,

483
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,820
from either teaching private lessons or studying privately, when you have a good instructor,

484
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,500
they have multiple ways to explain the same thing. They have different things they can try,

485
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,940
knowing that eventually one of them will resonate and you'll nail it.

486
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,940
So I think those skills are all great too.

487
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,540
Well, and they say that if you want to really understand something,

488
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:23,420
you ought to teach it to somebody else. And so that is one of the things that I'm doing with

489
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:28,700
this book also. I mean, it's funny, a lot of the chapters of my book are based on blog posts

490
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:34,220
that I've had over the years. And I actually go back and I look at my blog posts when I've

491
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:40,060
forgotten how to do something. So I'm like, thanks past me. Thanks for reminding me

492
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:42,940
what I'm supposed to do when I run into this problem.

493
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:48,940
I think that's the purpose of blog posts is like, okay, now I can free all that memory from my brain

494
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:55,740
and bring in new things. But it's interesting. Sorry, I'm going to go back to a thing with,

495
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:05,520
so I've known Alan forever, it seems. So we've talked on the podcast. He and I are in terms of

496
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:13,120
Myers Briggs, which is essentially an advanced horoscope, but he and I are essentially the same

497
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:20,400
type, but he has a bunch of talents that I don't have. It's not, I don't think it's associated.

498
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,120
Like he is an introvert. I am an introvert, but Alan in particular, he can generate energy in

499
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:36,800
a crowd of a community of like-minded folks. He's always been able to really do that. And one of

500
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,680
the things I'm now actually hypothesizing is I wonder, Alan, if your music degree is where that

501
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:52,480
came from, the ability to work with and collaborate with others, because in terms of like an orchestral

502
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,560
environment, I think both of you would likely argue that that's pretty critical.

503
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,480
Yeah, I do see the parallels there. What about you, Christian?

504
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,120
Definitely. And I just want to mention, I think it was a most recent podcast you were talking

505
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,080
about the Myers Briggs and saying that you were both INTPs. I am an INTJ.

506
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,120
Oh, a judger. I see what's going on now.

507
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,760
But yeah, I mean, I think sometimes people are surprised that I'm an introvert because they,

508
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,280
you know, I'm happy bubbly and hey everybody, let's do this. But I think a lot of that comes

509
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,960
from my music background. I mean, I did a little bit of musical theater and I took conducting

510
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,400
courses and I was able to lead and conduct a choir. So I think that those leadership things

511
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,970
probably come out of that. Yeah. I don't know about where you went to school, but one of the things,

512
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:54,370
and again, I can do it all, but it exhausts me. I'm tired at the end. But one of the things I

513
00:50:54,370 --> 00:51:01,410
hated the most out of school was recital hour. Like sit there. Yeah. Okay. We call it convocation,

514
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:07,170
but an hour a week, every week of performances of students playing in front of the entire

515
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:12,370
music department, I would hate it when my teacher would say, you should sign up, play

516
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:21,360
that at convocation next week. I go, no, I don't want to. Yeah. I hated that too. And even when I

517
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:26,400
was a church organist, playing the organ is extremely difficult. It's more difficult than

518
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,480
playing the piano because you have to play a keyboard with your feet as well. And it was,

519
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:39,920
every single week I was just so terrified. So performance was never something that I enjoyed.

520
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,360
So I'm happy to speak publicly. I can do that. That doesn't bother me at all. But like having

521
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:51,280
actually played notes or sing while everybody is listening, I would really prefer not to do that.

522
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:58,880
It's interesting for me in terms of that. So I will often remind people introvert has

523
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,880
really does not like, um, means your energy from, right?

524
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:14,160
Shine away from people or public speaking ability is a common symptom for lack of a better. I don't

525
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,080
even want to call it symptom, but it's often associated with introversion, but it is not a

526
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:26,160
requirement. It's not a causal thing. Because I'm in it for, it doesn't mean I have, I don't have

527
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,680
the ability to speak to people, but I will tell you one thing for me, like I am no longer

528
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,200
uncomfortable talking in front of a crowd. I'll happily go in front of a crowd. No problem

529
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:44,240
whatsoever, except for one condition where I am the center of attention. Now it's not,

530
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,560
it's not a hypocrisy. Like when I'm, when I'm going and talking in front of a crowd,

531
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:54,240
I usually view it as whatever I'm presenting. That topic is the center of attention. And I

532
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:58,880
am just the conduit. But if I'm the center of attention, like put me in front of 200 people

533
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:04,960
to celebrate a birthday. Oh my God. I have a thousand things I need to do that day. That's

534
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:12,320
way higher priority, including like washing my dishes. I will run and hide for that environment.

535
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,400
So it's, so we got to close, but there is one thing I did want to share

536
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:25,360
so I didn't come from a music background. I came loser. Yeah. I just have three tech degrees. I'm

537
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:34,720
sorry, but I will just pass on. I have learned a way to hire testers in the face of schools.

538
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:40,320
Don't now it may not be a scalable way, but what I suggest in the past or what,

539
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,560
what I suggest, if you're going to go to school and you're, you're looking specifically for

540
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:54,160
testers, go talk to the department heads, go talk to the lab managers and find the students in,

541
00:53:54,160 --> 00:54:02,860
in the computer science lab that everyone goes to, to debug the ones that have a reputation

542
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:09,760
for being excellent at debugging. Those are testers. Man. I love debugging. Me too.

543
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:17,310
Fricking love debugging. This to me, it's a puzzle. This is what went wrong. Yeah.

544
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:24,190
So when I was still was a tester, every time I got to send an email, Hey, I was looking at your code

545
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:33,340
to a developer. You have an off by one bug. Oh yeah. Oh, those just, I just, I adored those

546
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:40,220
because I'm like, really, dude, really? You got an off by one bug. Like really? Anyway. Yeah.

547
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:49,470
Those are fun. Let's close here. Uh, Kristen Jack, Voni. Yes. Super happy and excited to be on the

548
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:55,870
podcast. Thank you for all that your book, the complete software tester available on Amazon or

549
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:01,980
I guess other places where you can get books. It's awesome. I'm a big, I'm a fan of it. I like,

550
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,820
again, me, the big takeaways are I want to give it to developers and there's lots of little short.

551
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,460
It's just short snippets, but they're organized really well. It's, it's, you know,

552
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,980
I didn't read them all. I looked at, I kind of went through, looked at the headlines and

553
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,700
did my little homework here and, and, uh, I learned a lot. It's like, yes, this is

554
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,780
one of the most pragmatic, if not the most pragmatic testing book or comprehensive,

555
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:31,820
comprehensive pragmatism. I don't know something like that. Anyway, super excited.

556
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,820
All right. Well, it worked. It, it, that resonated with me. Um,

557
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,060
thanks for being on the podcast. Really appreciate it. Yes. Thank you, Kristen. Yeah.

558
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:48,220
Thanks for having me. All right. Thanks everybody for listening. We'll see you later. Bye.
