00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,300
Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,440
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,040
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,180
Now, on with the show.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,280
I just did an interpretive dance for Brent.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Yes.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,310
The intro.

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,390
And it was a sarcastic interpretive dance.

9
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,390
No.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,470
And I'm like, you know, it may be time for Alan to record a new version of that.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,750
You just didn't know.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,150
You just didn't know what it was all about until now.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,110
When I originally made that, that's exactly what I did.

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,150
I documented the choreography and that is what it is.

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,150
Welcome to AVE Testing.

16
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,150
I'm Alan.

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,150
I'm Brent.

18
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,750
Brent's the other guy over there, generally stinky, is what we call him.

19
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,750
It's a long story.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,330
We talk about that on a previous podcast.

21
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,470
Our producers will look that up for you and let you know we don't have any producers.

22
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,950
So you get us.

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,710
Brent, how have you been?

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,830
It's review time.

25
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,830
So yet there's that.

26
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:16,030
Start off with a good pick me up.

27
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,110
Does Microsoft still do the connects things?

28
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,110
Like, is that a thing?

29
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,110
Good.

30
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,110
That's good.

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,790
They were done poorly when I was there, but I do like the idea of check-ins multiple

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,110
times per year.

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,870
So, it's tell me.

34
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,870
Tell me what's on your...

35
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:37,710
The Connect has a look of pain, disgust, angst, and a slight bit of horror on his face.

36
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,430
Please tell me what you're thinking.

37
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:47,380
The connects, when we started at Microsoft, right?

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,380
They weren't connects.

39
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,180
They were reviews.

40
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,980
And then there was an easy one and then there was the one that sucked.

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,980
Yep.

42
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,980
Right?

43
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:06,260
Then the Connect thing came in and said, hey, we found out through studies slash experience

44
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,460
slash experimentation.

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,180
Slash people leaving.

46
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,940
That checking in more frequently is better.

47
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,820
Oh my God.

48
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,820
Right?

49
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
What?

50
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:30,980
And then they're like, oh, and since you're checking in more frequently, right, you should

51
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:38,700
do this and you should do that and you should do this and manage this Microsoft message.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,340
And so now it has kind of slowly creeped back into what it was.

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,340
So that's unfortunate.

54
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,340
And so...

55
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,340
Welcome.

56
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,340
Welcome, great cat to the E.E.N.E.

57
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,340
and it's a podcast.

58
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,060
My dog was crying on the floor a minute ago.

59
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,660
She'll probably cry again.

60
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,180
So let me...

61
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,380
Let's talk about that for a minute.

62
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,260
We can get back to what's been going on.

63
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,340
And maybe this is the whole podcast of the topic, topic of the podcast.

64
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,940
I don't know.

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,940
But Review Season Interesting.

66
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,940
Wait, can you do that?

67
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,520
No.

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,580
Oh, I did that.

69
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Nice little purr into the microphone.

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,580
That was great.

71
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,580
That was great.

72
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:28,500
So, current employer, NBC Universal, has one performance review a year, which I find not

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,560
good.

74
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
It's hard.

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Well, what happens?

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,960
Let's talk about what happens when you have one performance review a year.

77
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,960
And this is documented.

78
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,680
It goes back to the whole reason that the connect in the first place is...

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,640
And plus, a bunch of researchers come out and say, boy, does it put a whole lot of pressure

80
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,540
and anxiety around that performance review.

81
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:56,220
And again, if you're managing stuff well and you're remembering to give people feedback

82
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,220
and talking to them about what's going on and remembering the mantra of no surprises

83
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,570
at review time, it can be okay.

84
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,970
But it puts a lot of pressure on the manager to remember to do that.

85
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,210
And again, it's the manager's job and they should.

86
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:21,680
So given that my philosophy of work is to, again, align on the goals of the organization

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,120
and what we need to get done.

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,840
I do whatever the fuck I want.

89
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,360
And so in this case, my team, I told them that for a couple of reasons, once a year is just

90
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,600
not cool until we get better at giving feedback and remembering to care about this stuff because

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,440
it's really easy to fall into that trap of managing the work for the people.

92
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,000
So we do four times a year.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,520
We have the main one in Feb.

94
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Then every three months, we have...

95
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
I just don't...

96
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,600
There's no documentation.

97
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
There's no...

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
I don't check follow up, but I do it with my directs.

99
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,000
And so I think by modeling, they do it farther.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
It's have a career discussion.

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,560
Have a discussion around whether it's...

102
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,080
And it can be different every time.

103
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,440
I didn't mind different, but have a deeper discussion around hopes and dreams.

104
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Have a deeper discussion around feedback.

105
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,030
Have a discussion around really tying purpose to the work, going back to Dan Pink.

106
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,270
And that does two things.

107
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:21,010
One, it's better for the manager to get used to giving that feedback.

108
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,170
Maybe it's the same thing to two different angles.

109
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,250
It normalizes getting feedback.

110
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,370
It normalizes having that more serious discussion.

111
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,810
It normalizes having one-on-ones that aren't just about status reports, which I freaking

112
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,930
hate.

113
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,810
So it brings a lot of value and practice in that, especially I have some new managers

114
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,250
on the team.

115
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,610
It helps them learn how to manage better in the long run.

116
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,010
It's very low key.

117
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,730
Again, no requirements, but just getting folks to have those conversations is really important

118
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,730
to me.

119
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,890
Did we bring over the Unity questions?

120
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,890
No.

121
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,690
And the Unity questions went away.

122
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,690
Oh.

123
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,810
Why is your job...

124
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:59,730
Well, actually, indirectly.

125
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,730
Why is your job?

126
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,410
Why is it important?

127
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,410
What have you done?

128
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,410
Something like that.

129
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,810
I think it was with the Unity questions.

130
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,810
But I like that.

131
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,300
We had three queues, three questions, three times a year.

132
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:18,980
What I've done, and again, first perf review was in last Feb that I was a part of.

133
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,980
So we've done...

134
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,580
This is our third set since then.

135
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:30,620
We're going to do November career discussions, and then we'll have the big gnarly scary one

136
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,260
in February.

137
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,340
But I usually put a little bit of framing around each of them.

138
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,860
This one is, let's have a discussion around tying purpose to your work.

139
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,260
So this really goes back to that first question.

140
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,140
Why is your job important?

141
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:49,720
How does what you do support the goals of the company?

142
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,380
Last time it was more around where do you want to go in your career and what are the

143
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,420
skills that I need to find an opportunity for you to practice in order to get there?

144
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,540
And those are things that come up.

145
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,660
I document all this in our shared Slack channel.

146
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,620
And it just...

147
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,400
To me, it's real easy to get caught up, especially in our world where there's a lot

148
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,900
of cognitive load due to far too many things going on at once.

149
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,540
Taking a little bit of time every three months.

150
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,340
And of course, there's reflection that comes after that.

151
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,860
It gives us a basis for future discussions.

152
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,760
But just to have a more serious discussion around, let's just take a step back from

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,820
all of the daily bullshit.

154
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,020
Let's just talk about you and your career, why it's important, where you want to go.

155
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,100
Let's just make sure we're aligned on that.

156
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,940
And then we'll go back to the daily bullshit going forward.

157
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:44,180
But we have a conversation and some documentation on that that we keep, that we can use

158
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,180
to refer to.

159
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,700
And we go, hey, I have an opportunity that I think will help you do this thing we

160
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,380
talked about two months ago.

161
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,780
What do you think?

162
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,620
So to me, yeah, go ahead.

163
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,300
I think that's fantastic.

164
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,220
That's because you love me, Brent.

165
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,020
I do love you.

166
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,180
Well, love, love.

167
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,180
Yeah.

168
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,180
You know what?

169
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
It's all the same.

170
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,300
For the people in my life, I'm good with tolerate.

171
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,860
It's mine.

172
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,020
I know who I am.

173
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,020
I know what I do.

174
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
It's OK.

175
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:22,620
Yeah, no, it's I realized the other day that at some point in time, just in the last couple

176
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:31,540
of years, I have shifted into that that age where you go, I'm fucking old and I no longer

177
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,540
give a fuck.

178
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,020
Right.

179
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,980
It's just like, yeah, this is who I am.

180
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,660
If you don't like it, great.

181
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,580
Like, don't talk to me about it.

182
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,380
Don't waste any further of my time.

183
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,380
Right.

184
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,380
Yeah.

185
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,900
You know what?

186
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,420
I'm older than you and I'm not there.

187
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:55,860
Sometimes I don't give a shit, but actually, 95 percent of the time I do.

188
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,900
And I forget how old I am because I feel so young at heart and I feel like I have so

189
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,220
much more in me, but also the calendar says otherwise.

190
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,440
Well, there is.

191
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,360
So what I described is sort of like my home persona at work.

192
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Right.

193
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,460
The one of the problems and I do still go into work at least three days a week.

194
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
Right.

195
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:29,420
And one of the problems at work is you're surrounded by these 20 something to 30 somethings.

196
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:37,560
And it's just natural for for you to forget you're not the same age as everyone that's

197
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
around you.

198
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,140
Right.

199
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:48,620
So until things like, oh, yeah, he's basic and totally simping on so and so.

200
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,570
And I'm like, what the hell did you just say?

201
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:04,500
It's I'm going to be at a loss in four years when when when my last teenager finally

202
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,060
leaves home and I lose my ability to it in near real time, interpret the quote unquote

203
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,100
English around me.

204
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:21,280
Now, going back to your topic, I think that's that's very base to be a brand.

205
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,240
Thanks. I I think it would be fantastic.

206
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:38,530
So one of the reasons why Microsoft created the more frequent feedback program right was

207
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,770
because they did the research and they found that it was the benefit.

208
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:54,560
OK, but the problem is if the people who have to execute it don't understand the benefit

209
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:02,880
or or worse don't care, there are seeing that there are far too many managers and far too

210
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,480
fewer leaders in management positions.

211
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,760
I had a conversation about this earlier.

212
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,680
So you are on to something because this is true.

213
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,080
Up and down at Microsoft over the years.

214
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:22,600
But as you know, managing people, being a manager is a whole different job than being a

215
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,920
frontline engineer.

216
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,350
Yes. And being a manager of managers is a whole different job.

217
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:35,590
Yeah. And we put people into these roles and rather than give them coaching and

218
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:40,630
training and the skills that they need to be successful, instead, we give them a

219
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,790
handshake and good luck.

220
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,470
So Microsoft, we now do a whole crapload of training.

221
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,510
OK, well, good for you.

222
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,030
So now, so tell me about this because I think that's important.

223
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,270
It is important. And I don't know if that training is tactical or it's around like the

224
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,430
growing humans part, which I feel oftentimes is missing in business.

225
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,950
But please go on because you want to talk.

226
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:14,340
Yeah. The way I would interpret the training is there.

227
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,010
Like the coaching habit.

228
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,250
OK, that was required training and that was fantastic.

229
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:32,960
And the reason why it was fantastic is because within the training is part of

230
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,160
training people. Why?

231
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,720
Why you as a manager care, right?

232
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
It's creating that intrinsic motivation.

233
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,420
But that type of training is super rare.

234
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,420
If you don't care beforehand, like you're it's you're going to come up or you're going

235
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,890
to view it as this is an action that legal is forcing on us.

236
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,010
Right. Or HR.

237
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:09,530
And well, what do you think about checking on this stuff before someone comes a manager?

238
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,560
Like I and you see this happen.

239
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,800
It happens a lot less now, given that there are generally fewer manager roles growing,

240
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,920
as there were like years ago when they were booming.

241
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,120
But a lot of times people would want to take on management for no other reason than

242
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,560
they felt like it was a promotion.

243
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah. And how do we.

244
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,800
So maybe there's a little bit of work we need to do.

245
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,760
And I'll talk about how I've been this in the past, but I'm going to put it to you

246
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,160
first. How do you figure out if people are becoming managers for the right reason and

247
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,120
making sure those people go into management because they want to eventually,

248
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,360
the pinnacle, according to Maxwell, grow more leaders.

249
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,120
Ah, I have a very high bar for for someone who wants to be a leader.

250
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,140
Tell me.

251
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,080
Or manager.

252
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,720
And it's essentially OK.

253
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:10,200
Let me give you let me give you my short speech and I have another mitigation as well

254
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,240
around promotions.

255
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,670
Because I am not trying to construct managers.

256
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm trying to construct leaders and the leaders who I will put into a management

257
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,930
position. Honestly, my heuristic is do they want the job?

258
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,730
And if the answer is no, that's my first bar.

259
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,690
Well, OK.

260
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,410
Then I'm going to ask that I want to know why.

261
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,890
So no, it's just the first step.

262
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,480
But if if the answer is no, and the reason why is because of a sense of responsibility,

263
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,720
that they're going to be in a position that could potentially screw up a bunch of

264
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,640
people and their families, that's exactly the person I want in that role.

265
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:58,680
Good.

266
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,200
It's one that recognizes the importance of the role.

267
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,760
It's so important to check.

268
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,800
And I want to go back to, again, the three things that Gallup over years of

269
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,200
surveys has shown have the most to do with employee engagement.

270
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,360
Feedback.

271
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,080
Know why your job is important and know your manager cares about you.

272
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,920
So if you can get an idea of someone's going into management because we can coach

273
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:29,600
on feedback, but you but they care about what someone's career looks like.

274
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Give them the feedback and coaching and guidance to get there and tie purpose to

275
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,240
their work.

276
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,240
If there's interest in those things, they're probably going to be pretty good.

277
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,000
It's going to be hard.

278
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,320
Talk about that in a minute.

279
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,120
But but but good call out.

280
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,340
Yeah.

281
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,410
On so this often happens in promotion discussions.

282
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,730
So I'll share I'll share with people.

283
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,020
Brent Brent, thanks.

284
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,420
People listen to the podcast.

285
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,580
Anyway, keep talking.

286
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,620
I'll share with Alan.

287
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,020
Yeah.

288
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:09,420
Because I don't think like over the years you've heard most of my management

289
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,180
philosophies, but I don't think you've heard this one, but we'll find out shortly.

290
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:23,490
So, you know how at Microsoft we have ladder levels, but we also have these

291
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,690
things called bands, right?

292
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,770
And a band is sort of an aggregation of levels.

293
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:30,410
Yeah.

294
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,050
Right.

295
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:32,490
So it's someone.

296
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,730
One band, one level, one title may contain multiple levels.

297
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,040
Right.

298
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:46,490
So as an example, we have a band that's simply known as the one band and that

299
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,210
will have people in 59 or 60.

300
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,930
And then the two band has 60 levels, 61 and 62, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

301
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:57,370
Yep.

302
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,040
And just a little bit of context.

303
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,720
So the reason was Microsoft had original ladder levels, which were like nine,

304
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,680
10, 11, should could be, could be four or five, six or one, two, three at another

305
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,360
company when they changed them.

306
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,840
They wanted to make the numbers so vastly different.

307
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,840
People would not confuse one set with another.

308
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,200
So that's why you're an inter-level software engineer at Microsoft.

309
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,680
There's a level 59 general.

310
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,040
Yes.

311
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,970
Um, and there are, there are ladder levels lower than 59, but they're

312
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:29,770
generally not in development roles.

313
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,170
Yeah.

314
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,730
I was hired at what would be the equivalent of a level 57.

315
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,230
Oh, I was hired at as a 10.

316
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,510
I don't, I don't remember the mapping.

317
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,390
Well, La-Dee-Dah.

318
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,870
Guess who, guess who got more levels?

319
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,710
This guy.

320
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,340
Uh, as far as I recall, we're now tied.

321
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,740
No, cause I started lower.

322
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,930
I got, I got more than you cause I started lower and got there.

323
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,780
You started at 57 and what do we think a 10 is?

324
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,140
I'm just thinking through how many levels do I have to do?

325
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,780
And then I'm willing to do that.

326
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,380
So a 10 was a 61.

327
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:11,800
Was it?

328
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,240
Okay.

329
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
Oh, yeah.

330
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,680
You suck.

331
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,800
No, I'm going to, I'm going to go a 10 is a 59.

332
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,040
All right.

333
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,400
There you go.

334
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,640
The next two.

335
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,200
You're good.

336
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:23,840
You're good.

337
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,680
Story time continues.

338
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,240
Okay.

339
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,240
So for, for me as a manager, my ICs are generally going to be, my individual

340
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,840
contributors are going to be in one of four bands and those are the one, two,

341
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,600
then senior, then principal.

342
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,080
Okay.

343
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,440
And I have a little speech.

344
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,280
Okay.

345
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,480
Around exit and entrance criteria.

346
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,320
Cause when we go on a cross band, things happen.

347
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:50,880
Okay.

348
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,040
The level one band, basically to get into it, you have to pass the interview.

349
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,000
That's, it's, it's, that's it.

350
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,550
Um, but to get out of it, you have to show, um, that you have mastered the ability.

351
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,750
You have to show two things.

352
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,190
Number one, that you have mastered the ability to independently learn.

353
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,680
And number two, that you have a, that you have the capability to independently

354
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,600
execute, okay.

355
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,120
So far, so good.

356
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:29,570
Now, similarly with the, the two band, the two bands role is to construct autonomy.

357
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,370
To get out of it, you have to show that you have mastered independent execution,

358
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,590
but you have to show the capability of leadership.

359
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:46,170
And then similarly, um, senior band, you have to master leadership, but show

360
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,530
the capability of ownership.

361
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,850
And when I talk about ownership here, I mean, um, you're going to own

362
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,010
a small part of the business.

363
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:03,000
Uh, and the principal band, you are expected to get a task from an executive.

364
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:10,100
Hey, Brent, I need you to go move this KPI or go solve this problem.

365
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:16,660
It's, it's like maximum ambiguity and it's your job to own that part of the business.

366
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,860
And sometimes it involves sucky things.

367
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,340
So if you haven't mastered leadership, it's going to be really hard.

368
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:31,400
Now, um, on leadership, people will often ask me, okay, what do you mean leadership?

369
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,960
Like, like, because there's so many people that view leadership and manager.

370
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,200
Ascentonyms.

371
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,560
And I say, no, no, there is, they are absolutely not synonyms.

372
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,240
And I, I tell them this and I'll do this.

373
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,960
Um, no, cause you'll give me a crappy, you'll give me an answer that doesn't go

374
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,920
the way I want and I'll say, okay, let me share with you how I know if someone's

375
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,520
a leader, okay.

376
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,120
And it's very simply this, they have followers.

377
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,040
Yeah.

378
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:10,640
Okay.

379
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,920
This is not a circular definition.

380
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,120
I would have given you that answer.

381
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,600
That's all right.

382
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:14,840
I know.

383
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,280
It's not a circular definition as a lot of people will do.

384
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,160
No, that's a key thing.

385
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
They have followers.

386
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,160
Now, the hard thing is what is a follower?

387
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,630
Are you asking me?

388
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,030
Yeah.

389
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,950
I can get after it.

390
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:30,790
It's a topology.

391
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,080
What do you want the answer to be?

392
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,330
Cause I want to, I w I have a followup on this, but I don't want to, I don't

393
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,770
want to play along.

394
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,610
What's a follower.

395
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,050
If I say a leader has followers, what is a follower?

396
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,770
Someone who has someone who has a leader.

397
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:47,900
Okay.

398
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,820
So yeah, that that's the, the tautological, stupid, circular answer.

399
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,140
You can do better than this.

400
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,580
I know the executive lobotomy hasn't fully stuck.

401
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,140
Oh, I am.

402
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,060
I am practically brain dead.

403
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,080
Um, okay.

404
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:10,080
What is the difference between a direct report and a follower?

405
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,710
A follower follows you because they want to.

406
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,790
Okay.

407
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:15,470
Why?

408
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,440
Because now you're, you're massively overlapping with the levels of

409
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,480
leadership I want to talk to because they want to, because of, because

410
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
they believe in what you're doing for the organization.

411
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,600
They believe that you can achieve results with them.

412
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,320
Or whether they believe that your path is beneficial, right?

413
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,760
Whether it's intrinsically or extrinsically, it doesn't frigging matter.

414
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,600
But they believe that that's the path for that.

415
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,360
Okay.

416
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,830
Um, so it is a lot easier to be a manager than a leader, but, uh, I

417
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:00,830
won't move someone into a manager role unless they are also a leader and

418
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:09,650
have shown the ability to, to acquire followers versus what is often the

419
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,850
case, like we've seen bullies.

420
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:15,610
No, I, a person that does what you want them to do out of

421
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:17,090
fear is not a follower.

422
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,010
Oh, no, no, not at all.

423
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:19,930
Not at all.

424
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,560
It's in there.

425
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,240
It's in there.

426
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,120
Actually, I don't even want to say it's in their better interest

427
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,600
to follow because if you're a bully, right, you're threatening them.

428
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,320
Right.

429
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:38,520
The, but in getting that idea into a future leader's head around what is

430
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,170
a follower and what it means, and it's about influence, not, um, not

431
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:51,810
an organizational change, um, can be difficult, but the more I stick

432
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,250
with it and stay consistent.

433
00:23:53,490 --> 00:24:01,640
I have had a number of people, um, be successful, um, making that shift

434
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:09,120
and that shift sustains them through the rest of the levels.

435
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,080
Cause it starts sitting in their mindset.

436
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,560
Like it's just as hard getting people to understand ownership because like,

437
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,760
I don't know when you went into the principal band, I don't know if

438
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,040
you hit the same sort of system shock I did.

439
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,610
It's, it's, it's not a linear progression.

440
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,940
Like, like up until around senior, there's sort of this obvious thing, but

441
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:41,600
no, getting over into, into principle is we trust that we can leave you alone

442
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,920
and that you'll do high ROI things for the business.

443
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:45,560
Yeah.

444
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,040
And that's your, for me, that was, I spent many years doing that.

445
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,280
He's having to do that next box.

446
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,440
It's before on windows CE, that on stupid link project, but that was my thing.

447
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,600
I just liked to figure out people trusted me to figure out what the right

448
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,840
thing to do was and get it done.

449
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:00,760
Yep.

450
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,160
And yeah, but absolutely right.

451
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,800
And then I've seen people at principal struggle.

452
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,240
I want to go back to levels of leadership, but the quick thing on principle

453
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,320
is, um, I heard someone say once I keep up the principle.

454
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,360
I keep telling people what to do, but they don't do it.

455
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:24,530
And if it, well, um, I'll give you one guess where the problem is and it's not then.

456
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,490
Yeah.

457
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,750
So I, you're, I know we've talked about it before on the podcast.

458
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:32,110
I want to go a little more deeply than we have, because it aligns

459
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,710
really well with what you just said.

460
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,430
And John Maxwell wrote this book called the five, I think it's called

461
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,430
the five levels of leadership.

462
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,630
Please don't type and look it up.

463
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,480
Type, type, type, type, type.

464
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,200
So the first thing he talks about is putting people, your first level of

465
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,640
leadership is that you are in a position of leadership.

466
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,440
People follow you because they have to.

467
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,040
Yeah.

468
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,720
No, that's okay.

469
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,120
Fine.

470
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,600
Again, you don't look, I get it.

471
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,360
I get it.

472
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,720
I get it.

473
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,800
He calls that the five levels of leadership and that's fine.

474
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,360
Holy, but listen, think of you and I both can name people managing today.

475
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,050
That are managing their team and demanding their respect because they're

476
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:20,130
in that position of leadership and haven't done Jack squat other than that.

477
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,450
That's true.

478
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,210
A single higher level.

479
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,610
But that's true.

480
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,810
But I hope that the way this progresses level two and five have nothing to do

481
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:29,810
with having been a manager.

482
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:33,650
Can I kind of finish before you get in here with all the bullshit?

483
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,740
So you're in a position of leadership.

484
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,540
I'm never going to make it.

485
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,780
People follow because they have to.

486
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,140
These leaders who stay in this position either aren't leaders anymore or they

487
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,020
focus on rules, control and compliance.

488
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:51,380
Maybe a manager at McDonald's can get away with this for a longer time.

489
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,860
Nothing against McDonald's except for that one where Trump was.

490
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:02,540
Then people give you permission at level two, people give you permission to lead them.

491
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,780
These leaders are beginning to build those relationships with their teams.

492
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,100
They're fostering trust.

493
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,620
They're building a foundation.

494
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,860
This is where we want people to start rather than level one.

495
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,660
We want to start.

496
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,000
And again, no matter what, Brent, I'm promoting you to a lead.

497
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:25,480
Briefly, it may be a day, but briefly when I started a new company, I am in a position of

498
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:25,800
leadership.

499
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,720
I am at level one as quickly as possible.

500
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,440
I have to get to level two because level one sucks for everyone.

501
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,650
It exists.

502
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,940
I'm in a position like here's the new guy in charge.

503
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,740
Okay.

504
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,540
I don't know him.

505
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,220
Why would I give him permission to follow me?

506
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,100
After permission, it's production.

507
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,020
People follow you because of what you've done for the organization.

508
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,920
So again, at this level of leadership, you're focusing, you have the relationships built.

509
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,120
You're focusing on like you get the team aligned around achieving organizational goals.

510
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,360
So they follow you.

511
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,560
You deliver results together.

512
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,780
At people four, people follow you.

513
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
Level three is probably different.

514
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:14,060
The organization at level four, people follow you because what you have done for them.

515
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,400
So these people are they follow you.

516
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,680
This is we're getting into probably if you want to call these managers, they're probably

517
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,440
managers and managers, but they don't have to be.

518
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,160
Their focus is on developing people.

519
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,520
And I talk a lot in my blog at angerweasel.substack.com plug.

520
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,840
I need a little jingle for that.

521
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,360
I'll write one sometime.

522
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,080
People at this level are sorry, I lost my train of thought when I gave the plug.

523
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,160
I manage the people, not the work.

524
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,800
And we know so many managers are focused on managing the work.

525
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,080
Give people a framework they can work in and then let them succeed.

526
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:58,880
So at this level four, it's all about creating that culture of self-sufficiency,

527
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,880
autonomy, giving people going.

528
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,400
And then finally, not all leaders get here.

529
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
And Maxwell calls this out.

530
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,400
This is where we want to get to at level five.

531
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,560
Not only are people following you because of who you are and what you represent, but the

532
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,720
key thing leaders at level five do is they develop more leaders.

533
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:26,550
Their focus purely on not purely, primarily on culture and values and making sure that

534
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:31,030
the people that are reporting to them or the organization themselves are becoming better

535
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:34,270
leaders because of all kinds of other stuff going on.

536
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:34,910
Very complex.

537
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,390
Not very many leaders get here.

538
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,670
I don't know very many leaders that are there, but it's where we should all strive to be.

539
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:46,750
It's, you get how these advance and how they get more difficult as you go up.

540
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,430
But it's a nice little, it's probably too long to go.

541
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:54,790
I mean, the book's like a gazillion pages and I just kind of summarized it in five

542
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,830
minutes and badly.

543
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,790
So I don't know.

544
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,190
To me, it's really stuck because especially those first couple of levels, you have to

545
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:06,150
move from a position of leadership and I've worked for people talking to you, Peter.

546
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,150
Oh, God damn it.

547
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,950
Alex has Alex.

548
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,390
Alan has frozen.

549
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,550
I don't know if he can hear me.

550
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,220
I will sit here and hopefully remember.

551
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,730
I was taking a screenshot of his face though.

552
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,570
That's funny.

553
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:27,970
Do you hear me?

554
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,010
I do.

555
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:35,100
You know, this was not a Riverside thing.

556
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,660
I'm not sure where you lost me.

557
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,460
I have to kind of, I was on a roll.

558
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,460
I'm never going to get it back.

559
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,340
Um, my wonderful Xfinity internet just puked and it's weird.

560
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,700
It almost always pukes during this hour on a Friday and it's fairly consistent the

561
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,220
rest of the time.

562
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,180
I don't know what's going on.

563
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,060
My wifi stayed up hot five bars the whole time, although now it tells me it's off.

564
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:56,980
So I don't know what's going on.

565
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,460
Do you hear me?

566
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:57,780
All right.

567
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,500
I do.

568
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,820
This is weird.

569
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:00,900
Okay.

570
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,100
That was just my Mac getting caught up.

571
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,700
So I don't know what's going on, but we're back.

572
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,940
And I was talking about five levels of leadership.

573
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,020
And then what was I talking about before Comcast cut me off?

574
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,660
I don't know.

575
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,100
You are on a pretty good roll though.

576
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:12,980
All right.

577
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,820
Well, we're never going to know where that goes because I have the

578
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,580
attention span of piss.

579
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:21,340
Um, I wrote down notes though.

580
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,820
Oh, why don't you refresh me and we'll just go from here.

581
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,780
You know, listeners, you get what you pay for.

582
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,380
Here we go.

583
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,460
Tell me your problem.

584
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,900
Stinky.

585
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:31,780
Yeah.

586
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,930
I have, I like the order.

587
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:40,010
Um, yeah, my only problem is that he calls it the first level of leadership.

588
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:41,570
It should be the zero.

589
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:42,770
I know.

590
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:48,720
I know he's not a, he's not a software guy Maxwell.

591
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,280
So tech people count in zeros.

592
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:51,960
I don't know.

593
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,800
Was that loud?

594
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,000
That in my house or yours?

595
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,000
That was in your house.

596
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,320
Okay.

597
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:56,680
Hold on.

598
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,480
All right.

599
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,360
Let's see where the cat went.

600
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,240
No cats right there.

601
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,600
All right.

602
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,320
What wasn't the cat?

603
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,370
It's probably the daughter.

604
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:09,170
Ah, no, hold on, man.

605
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,570
I'm going to, I'm going to keep things you done.

606
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:10,890
You good.

607
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:11,410
You good.

608
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:11,890
Oh, well, no.

609
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,890
So I wrote down, okay.

610
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:18,170
I did it in an, in alliteration.

611
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,010
So level zero is people.

612
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:23,050
Level one is permission.

613
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,410
Level two is production.

614
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:32,640
Level three is personal and level four is propagation.

615
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:33,840
It's funny.

616
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,280
I believe Maxwell calls them, he also gives them peace.

617
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,480
But I think he uses, if I remember right, I'll look it up in the book.

618
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,400
Someone asked Chad GPT, position, permission, production, people and pinnacle.

619
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:50,890
Sure.

620
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:52,370
Sure.

621
00:32:54,010 --> 00:33:04,500
I think I've told you before that I went pretty far in my younger years and take

622
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:08,200
one though, and that's right.

623
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,320
And now it's weird because I still, I marvel over the fact that chronologically

624
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,260
I am older than you, but I'm just younger.

625
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:18,980
Anyway, go on.

626
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,830
Maybe I'm Benjamin Button.

627
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:26,630
And the horse you rode it on is what I'm currently thinking.

628
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,470
All right.

629
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:36,260
The, but, uh, so it's different in, in different styles.

630
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,860
Uh, but the style of take one though, I went through, right.

631
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:47,100
So you, you know, that the ultimate in is a black belt and you can get

632
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,980
multiple degrees in black belt, but, uh, the color belts, what you are in, when you,

633
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:57,140
when you, um, up to getting to black.

634
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:04,930
And in my particular style, uh, the color belts were intended to represent sort of

635
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:14,520
the growth of a plant from, from a white seed all the way up to sort of the red

636
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,080
belt, which is the last color belt before black and red represents the

637
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:26,210
beginning of death and black indicates is dead, is dead.

638
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:33,490
But, um, the reason for that symbolism though, is not directly dead because

639
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,370
when a plant dies, it spreads its seeds.

640
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:44,880
So most, um, most martial arts that I'm familiar with, right.

641
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,080
They will actually tell you, no, actually the color belt, like the destination isn't

642
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,620
black, the color belts are, we're pounding into you all the pre-reqs

643
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:59,220
necessary for you to be actually begin your martial arts training.

644
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:05,620
Martial arts training really is intended to begin at the, uh, once you get your

645
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:16,430
black belt, um, anyway, it's a neat story that somehow, somewhat related to your

646
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,950
leadership story, like on the propagation thing.

647
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,030
Well, this was all the answer to how's it going, Brent?

648
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:24,950
It was.

649
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,350
And there's actually one other thing that I, that like our little, our

650
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:35,310
little brief unexpected intermission share, or made me remember.

651
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:43,640
Um, I have officially decided to take exactly the same journey you did about

652
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,830
four, five, six, 18 years ago.

653
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,210
And that is, um,

654
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:51,650
I was just out of high school

655
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:57,720
on November, at the end of next week, no later than the end of the next week.

656
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,400
I will be waving bye-bye to Xfinity.

657
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,430
Oh, you mean to cable TV?

658
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,430
No.

659
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,080
Xfinity.

660
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:11,680
All right.

661
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,720
I kind of get my Xfinity highly subsidized, so I'm sticking with it.

662
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:21,430
I am shifting over to Zipli.

663
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:23,110
Nice.

664
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:23,830
Nice.

665
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:28,470
So, um, yeah, I just get Xfinity super cheap.

666
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,410
So, uh, I, I, and the fact that it goes out during the podcast, you know,

667
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,890
maybe it's great.

668
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,810
You get what you pay for.

669
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:36,610
Yeah.

670
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,770
I realized like in the last year, um, so I have like the,

671
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,690
the super duper package and I'm like, okay, really?

672
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:50,330
In the last year I shifted over.

673
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,890
I'm not watching broadcast TV.

674
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,130
I'm all, no, the only things I watch are on, on the streaming channel.

675
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,530
Nobody watches broadcast TV.

676
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,690
It's a dying business.

677
00:36:58,930 --> 00:36:59,290
Yeah.

678
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,490
I say working for a company that delivers broadcast TV, but they'll

679
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:04,410
figure it out eventually.

680
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,440
Oh no.

681
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,080
Well, I think, I think that move has already happened, right?

682
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,280
Yeah.

683
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,440
Yeah.

684
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,410
Netflix, their lowest offering is with ads, right?

685
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:15,650
Yep.

686
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:17,370
And we were like, okay.

687
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,860
Now they just need a live stream nightly news show per market.

688
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,240
Yeah.

689
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,200
I wonder how far I had to do a thing.

690
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
We should start that.

691
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,200
I do not want to go into this deeply.

692
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,780
I do not want to, but I have to mention, I had to do a little, um, uh,

693
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,020
what would I call it?

694
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:47,050
Uh, little survey for a thing I'm going to in a few weeks.

695
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:52,410
And I had to, the question was something around, write out a fictional news

696
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,530
headline that captures how the world has changed by 2030, something like that.

697
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:00,290
Or I said it's 2030, write a fictional news line about how the world has changed.

698
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,890
And I will tell you what I wrote cause there's nothing in here, but going

699
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:09,680
into why broadcast may be dying again, I don't know how right I am, but I'm just

700
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,310
going to read this to you is the headline I wrote was AI driven newsroom set new

701
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:20,190
standard major media outlets operate with 80% fewer human reporters focusing

702
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,430
on real time, hyper personalized content streams.

703
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:28,670
So what you do is you log into Netflix, you click news and you get your

704
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,590
personal content stream based on a bunch of stuff has been curated for you.

705
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:38,650
So news is sort of delegated to the masses and it comes to you based on your

706
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,370
preferences, kind of just like tick tock.

707
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:44,170
But, uh, anyway, that was my, that was my idea for the future.

708
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:44,890
Just a mess.

709
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,210
I don't think we're too far away from that.

710
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:48,570
Maybe 2030 is too long.

711
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:50,210
Yeah.

712
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:53,130
I mean, I could think about how to implement that.

713
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,350
And I debated leaving people get so freaked out about AI taking jobs.

714
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:02,470
I debated leaving off that part, but I also wanted to put it in there.

715
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:05,390
But anyway, a little thing now we've talked about AI in the podcast.

716
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,270
We got that part done.

717
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:10,550
Uh, I did, um, uh, a trap ton of travel.

718
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,550
I went to New York for two weeks, hang out with my daughter, stopped in

719
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:17,630
Bozeman on the way home to take care of my nephews for a week, got back home.

720
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,950
I'm here for two weeks.

721
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,910
I'm going back to New York a week after that.

722
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,670
And, uh, man, just too much going on.

723
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,910
I'm looking forward to the slow.

724
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:29,550
Well, holiday's coming up.

725
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:37,180
Is that going to be slow for you or, um, it depends if I survive the election.

726
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,190
Okay.

727
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,430
So I have a question for you on that one.

728
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,830
Yes.

729
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,630
Like, like the, cause that could be a double entendre.

730
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:47,230
Right.

731
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:52,150
Cause given your business, it's really more of the first one, given that this

732
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:59,940
is like, you know, at unity, we had code freezes for, uh, like, uh, Christmas,

733
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,500
uh, dads and grads days that would have huge spikes would be very, we would

734
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:09,300
never freeze, but we'd be careful around deployments and changes, uh, in the day

735
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,140
who would have spikes and add traffic.

736
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,420
Microsoft had not really code freezes, but dads and grads and holidays and

737
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,420
things were, were sale just to make sure stuff was up, uh, news like Olympics

738
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:26,300
is big elections, huge, and the election cycle may take a lot longer here.

739
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,620
And a matter of just keeping, keeping news stations, all local news stations

740
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,880
all over the country, national news stations up, uh, getting, uh, web-based

741
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,560
news also up quickly and updated and all that stuff.

742
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:44,000
It's, um, it's going to be a little zippity doodah here for a while.

743
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,440
And in some, some years, you know, in a, in a normal year, you know, like

744
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,720
when we were kids, the election cycle may take three or four days or out

745
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,280
around elections, a bunch of news comes in, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

746
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:59,720
no matter what happens in this election, no matter what happens, the news is

747
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,860
going to go batshit for two weeks, minimum, minimum.

748
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,470
Now, like we should be taking bets.

749
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:16,800
Like how long before we actually know who's president?

750
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,140
Oh, see there.

751
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:33,400
We're going to know on November 6th, we're going to know whether getting the rest of

752
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,840
the country, I mean, getting people that don't have critical thinking to know

753
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,280
will take the remaining two weeks.

754
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,020
A lot.

755
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:44,300
We didn't know on the day of the election last time.

756
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,180
We knew the next day.

757
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,600
We did know the next day, late in the next day, but the next day.

758
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:52,780
Yeah.

759
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,810
Well, we're going to see what happens.

760
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:01,850
But anyway, yeah, we better, we are running out of time here in the

761
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,370
palatial studios of A.B.

762
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:03,850
testing.

763
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,730
I have one interesting thing.

764
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:13,070
I wasn't going to say anything, but we had a little bit of a of a audio

765
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:19,560
issue at the beginning and I had to do the thing right, unplug and plug back

766
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,200
in the USB connector to my audio device.

767
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,000
And that worked great.

768
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:26,990
But then when it did that, I didn't notice that it changed my

769
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,310
microphone input to my laptop, which is fine.

770
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:30,110
That works out pretty well.

771
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:32,510
It's a little more tinny, but I can fix it in EQ and post.

772
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:38,590
But then just to make things more fun, after my computer, after the

773
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,870
after Xfinity, crap the bed and I had to reconnect.

774
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:44,910
When I reconnected, it connected back to my good microphone.

775
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,110
So now our listeners get two different microphones, which I get the blend

776
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,110
and post production and see what happens.

777
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,830
So, you know what?

778
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,630
Either it sounds awful.

779
00:42:54,430 --> 00:43:00,330
And again, I hope you enjoyed your time with this anyway, or it sounds great

780
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,090
and you marvel over my audio awesomeness.

781
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,960
Or no, no more ors or it doesn't.

782
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,400
It's a dichotomy.

783
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,320
It doesn't have to look what would sound great mean it to me.

784
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,800
It's either it sounds awful or it doesn't.

785
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:20,220
Well, I'm an unfortunate audio file, so I will know.

786
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:21,900
But if the rest of people, yeah, whatever.

787
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,660
Do you think?

788
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,900
All right, man, I am kind of know who I am.

789
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,620
I'm not Brent's cat, so I must be Alan.

790
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,060
And I also am not Brent's cat, so I must be Alan.
