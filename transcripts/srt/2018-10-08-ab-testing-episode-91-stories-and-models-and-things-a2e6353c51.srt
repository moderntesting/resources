1
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:17,980
in the testing podcast with your hosts Alan and Brent.

2
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,090
I am mindless agile robot I must iterate.

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,690
This is the place to discuss software development,

4
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,730
software quality and testing, agile, leadership,

5
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,290
organizational change, and of course modern testing.

6
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,170
You can read more about modern testing

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,210
on moderntesting.org and join our Slack group

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,050
in the link on the same page.

9
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,450
Now on with the show.

10
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,270
Hey Brent.

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,190
Hey Alan.

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,550
We are back for another episode.

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,390
We are.

14
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:47,550
There's no number, oh 91.

15
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,510
91.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,240
Hey what do you think of that new intro that just played?

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,200
Yeah that was great.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,440
That's time travel because Brent's heard it

19
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,000
but he hasn't heard it in context.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,480
But you've all heard it now.

21
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,520
Let us know what you think.

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,200
Or not, whatever.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,220
Yeah is it too much reverb?

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,200
Probably a little bit too much reverb on my voice.

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,920
We can tweak that later.

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,880
We can take a listener.

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,640
We'll let the three decide what they think

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,840
of the new intro.

29
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,480
The nice thing about having three listeners.

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,320
Yeah.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,880
It's either unanimous or majority rules.

32
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,720
Sure.

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,120
On any voting decision.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,700
This is great insights from a math professional.

35
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,200
Holy crap.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,120
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,810
What have you been up to?

38
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,810
So we have a big hackathon that's in place for support.

39
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:39,850
As I think I mentioned in the last podcast.

40
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,530
That's kind of, that's one of the places

41
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,570
where my team is focusing on data science.

42
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,050
We're doing all kinds of cool things

43
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,410
with natural language processing.

44
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,370
NLP.

45
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,770
NLP.

46
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,030
And I did a presentation last Wednesday

47
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,850
to a bunch of folks.

48
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,310
And very first question I asked is,

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,470
okay, anyone here ever worked

50
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,920
with a data scientist before?

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,860
And there was about four people that raised their hand.

52
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,540
And I looked at the four people

53
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,980
and became very clear that I was the data scientist

54
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,230
that they had worked with before.

55
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,020
And so I changed it to, and that data scientist wasn't me.

56
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,360
And they dropped their hands and I said, okay, great.

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,180
The positive thing about this is none of you will know

58
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,260
when I'm lying, which got a brief little chuckle.

59
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,540
And then I clarified, I'm like, okay, no.

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,220
There's some data science slides in here.

61
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:49,360
Just making sure that I have to communicate these concepts

62
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,320
without using those terms.

63
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,800
That's why I asked the question.

64
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,060
But it was interesting.

65
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,620
So I did a data science presentation

66
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,880
to a bunch of people who didn't have data science,

67
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,700
got a lot of people coming and talking to me after it,

68
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,430
which we've talked about, imposter syndrome.

69
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,230
This is the sound of me nodding my head.

70
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,190
Yeah, that was, I went home that day on a high.

71
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,710
I'm just like, so I didn't actually lie to anybody.

72
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,310
I got my concepts across and I got a lot of people engaged

73
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,190
after the conversation, after the presentation.

74
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,680
So for me, that was just a massive presentation win.

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,830
Cool.

76
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,600
For someone, oh, and the other thing too

77
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,300
is all sorts of people came up to me afterwards

78
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,060
and they were like, oh my God,

79
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,420
that is one of the best presence.

80
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,000
I've seen, the majority of PMs can't do presentations

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,920
that good and I'm like, yeah,

82
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,560
I don't know what to do with this feedback.

83
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,280
My presentation self-esteem is still too low for me

84
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,240
to be able to accept it, but I appreciate it.

85
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,040
What I found as we segue this conversation

86
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,080
to talk about me is that people really appreciate

87
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,640
practical, pragmatic advice.

88
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,800
So I'm guessing your presentation had some of that.

89
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,720
It did.

90
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
See, I turned that from me back to you.

91
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,360
I was gonna go to me, but I bounced back.

92
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,200
I'm gonna make it shift back to you very quickly.

93
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,040
Ah, damn it.

94
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,080
But I do actually, here's a lesson I learned

95
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,680
a long time ago.

96
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,760
I'll just ask you a question.

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:29,030
What is the number one goal of a presentation?

98
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,230
It's entertainment.

99
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,770
That is 100% correct.

100
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,130
You are constrained by the content,

101
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,670
but the presenter, your job is to make that content

102
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,490
as entertaining as possible.

103
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,570
That is the point of a presentation versus a document.

104
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,800
Damn.

105
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,680
Now I'm having like...

106
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,520
Acid reflux?

107
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,120
Oh, something's going on inside because I'm thinking

108
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,000
of the opposite of the presentations

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
where people just read a bunch of slides to you

110
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,500
because they've turned their presentation into a document

111
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,200
that they read to you.

112
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,960
Yeah, I attended a class years ago.

113
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,500
He calls those brick slides.

114
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,620
And one of the things in his presentation

115
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,720
is what he calls the squint test.

116
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,740
So when you look at a slide and you squint at it,

117
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,010
you should still be able to sort of

118
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,870
have a glimpse at the message.

119
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,900
So he's a big fan of...

120
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,140
I forget what they call them, but the shapes.

121
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,540
So if you're about to message sort of a journey,

122
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,940
there should be something that has

123
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,280
like little blocks and arrows.

124
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,160
Yeah.

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,160
Whereas bullet point slides with massive amount of text,

126
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,000
they look like bricks when you do the squint test.

127
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,150
All right, anyway, what's up with you, Alan?

128
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,190
Well, I was gonna segue that back to me.

129
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,990
I was at Star West, got back on Tuesday night.

130
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,590
I was just down there to do a workshop.

131
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,070
I went down early, went to Disneyland, that was fun.

132
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,750
Hung out, worked all day for my hotel room Monday.

133
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,430
Gave my presentation on web tools,

134
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,090
which is just me leading people

135
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,310
through a bunch of my favorite Chrome extensions,

136
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,270
showing them how to use Wireshark and DevTools

137
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,250
and Chrome and Firefox and a little bit of security testing.

138
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,430
So it's a flash through a bunch of stuff,

139
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,410
but I massively screwed up.

140
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,710
I looked at the little piece of paper on my table wrong

141
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:30,110
and let them out for their coffee break

142
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,870
as the coffee was being put away.

143
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,150
They weren't nearly as mad at me as they should have been.

144
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,570
And then afterwards, a similar thing,

145
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,830
I had a bunch of people come up to me

146
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,540
and say this is the best tutorial I've been to ever.

147
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,790
Honestly, it was fine.

148
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,290
I think a lot of times in testing,

149
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,310
people forget that there are many, many new things to learn.

150
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,870
So the goal, in addition to my entertaining stories,

151
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:02,470
ranting on UI animation, for example,

152
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,310
and the idea that technical testing means UI animation

153
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,350
through a couple of directions.

154
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,950
I ranted on that for a while.

155
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,430
Wait, wait, for our listeners.

156
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,270
For our listeners.

157
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,630
So the segue I gave people go,

158
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,790
testers need to be more technical.

159
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,590
And by technical, they mean they need to write automation.

160
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,630
And by automation, they mean they need to write UI automation,

161
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,850
which I think is stupid.

162
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,470
So we talk about a bunch of tools they can use

163
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,790
to make their lives easier, a little bit of scripting,

164
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,790
but just a lot of different stuff.

165
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,690
So pragmatic, practical things.

166
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,450
The goal is, I tell them at the beginning,

167
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,310
the goal is that everybody can go back

168
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,270
and find three or four or five things

169
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,750
they can use back at the job on Monday,

170
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,110
and they usually feel like they can do that.

171
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,070
The other thing I did is I'm giving this workshop

172
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:51,470
one last time, next week, at PNSQC.

173
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,950
This exact workshop?

174
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,150
Well, I'm gonna tweak it a little bit

175
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,990
based on what I learned,

176
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,640
but pretty much the same workshop.

177
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,100
But also one thing I did at Star,

178
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,460
and I'll leave it in there for PNSQC,

179
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,980
because I will never give this workshop again.

180
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,140
I just slapped a Creative Commons license audit

181
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,300
and said, if you ever wanna teach this to yourself,

182
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,660
if you wanna, in fact, I told them,

183
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,220
if you wanna just do this at Star next year,

184
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,340
I'll help you get to submission in,

185
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,580
because I'm done doing this workshop.

186
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,660
No, just you beginning the explanation.

187
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,500
So I've now worked with you.

188
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,180
It is a 101 level course.

189
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,700
I've now worked with you for long enough

190
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,220
where I can pick up your body language,

191
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,390
and you're like, doing this workshop is an obligation.

192
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,930
It is absolutely not something you're excited about.

193
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,570
I don't like doing the same thing more than once.

194
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:47,210
And I don't like workshops in general,

195
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,850
because I kinda like to adapt.

196
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,430
Even my presentation style is adaptive.

197
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,850
I would rather change things based on the context

198
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,510
of what people wanna do.

199
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,310
A couple years ago, I gave another set

200
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,850
of presentations at Star, Alan on testing.

201
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,310
Those were fun, because just be doing whatever.

202
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,750
Of course, they wanted me to prepare slides.

203
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,470
So I think I did Star East first and then Star West.

204
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,750
It might've been the other way.

205
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,470
But I prepared slides, and then what I did

206
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:19,550
for that entire workshop was I went,

207
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,550
I just took sickies.

208
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,110
What do you guys wanna know about?

209
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,190
What do you want my opinions about?

210
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,270
What do you wanna learn about?

211
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,470
And we put them on the board,

212
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,350
and we con-bond them, we prioritized,

213
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,110
and con-bond them out and went through them.

214
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,950
And then it was fun.

215
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,310
A couple people though gave feedback and said,

216
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,320
the presentation didn't match the slides.

217
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,320
And I thought, W, T, capital, exclamation point F.

218
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,120
So what I did, this was interesting how well

219
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,860
this worked out and how similar people and challenges are.

220
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,780
I redid my slides based on what I presented at Star East

221
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,290
in the pure ad hoc manner.

222
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,370
Did the exact same exercise at Star West

223
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,490
where I asked people what they wanted to hear about.

224
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:09,220
We voted on what they wanted to talk about.

225
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,620
And the slides, not perfectly,

226
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,840
but pretty well matched up anyway.

227
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,640
So that was fun.

228
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,320
So I like doing presentations like that

229
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,160
where I can just-

230
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,200
A la carte.

231
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,520
A la carte, much like a podcast.

232
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,680
Yeah, the one thing I was actually thinking

233
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,400
as you were talking, another thing that you and I,

234
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,200
I think are, and I think we've even talked about it

235
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,280
on the cast, there's so many different ways

236
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,280
to separate people into one of two things.

237
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,830
In this one, so often you hear people talking

238
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,590
about starters versus closers.

239
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,430
And-

240
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,130
I wouldn't say often, but yeah, I've heard it.

241
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,970
Go on.

242
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,810
All the time.

243
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,650
All the time.

244
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,470
It's like daily.

245
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,310
Yeah, I heard it on the radio today.

246
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,150
Oh, nevermind.

247
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,970
I've listened to the radio in years.

248
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,370
Anyway, go on.

249
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,850
And I think you and I are mostly starters.

250
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,770
We both recognize we're not exclusively,

251
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,570
we're specializing generalists

252
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,610
or generalizing specialists, one of those things.

253
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,160
And starters just are allergic to repetition.

254
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,370
Yes, oh my God.

255
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,890
And one of the things though I've learned

256
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,640
that's fantastic is when you make an investment,

257
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,000
when you've captured 80% of the profit,

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,080
it's essentially, and here, I mean in a generic sense,

259
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,720
but it applies to real investments.

260
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,660
But like what you said with a creative license,

261
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,940
you've gotten out the value you care to get out of it.

262
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,980
But there's still plenty of value in that content

263
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,620
for someone else who wants it.

264
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,290
Always, when you do a handoff, don't get greedy.

265
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:56,970
Always give something for the next owner to...

266
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,970
Yeah, and to be clear, I want to...

267
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,810
Get rewarded by it.

268
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,290
We have a lot to talk about today, believe it or not.

269
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,440
I don't know if anybody there will take me up on it,

270
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,440
but Star did ask me if I would present this,

271
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,260
again, at Star East, and I said, no, I would rather not.

272
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,760
But if any of the three want to,

273
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,440
I'm happy to give you the slide deck,

274
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,000
give you the link, walk you through what I do,

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
and I'll help you with the submission, whatever.

276
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,430
I'll even, if it's...

277
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,110
I'll probably just endorse you, if you don't mind, at Star.

278
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,830
So if anybody wants to do it, just let me know.

279
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,830
Ping us on the Slack channel.

280
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,110
Which you can get to if you go to ModernTesting.org

281
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,750
or Angewheasel.com, WAC AB Testing.

282
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,710
You can find a link to join our Slack team

283
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,270
and hang out with the other two people.

284
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:44,130
All that said, shall we get on with the show?

285
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,570
Hey, we just finished topic number one, didn't we?

286
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,010
We sure did.

287
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,450
And we're gonna do something a little bit weird.

288
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,210
We're going to do our mailbag session

289
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,330
early in the show today to make sure we get to it, I guess.

290
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,170
Sure.

291
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,300
All right.

292
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,140
Mailbag.

293
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,220
Do you want to read it?

294
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,040
Do you want me to read it?

295
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,880
I got it up.

296
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,380
Is it too many big words?

297
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,220
No.

298
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,060
All right.

299
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,180
I think I can cover this.

300
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,020
I will let you try it.

301
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,860
All right.

302
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,700
Go ahead.

303
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,670
This is a question from Nicholas Shaw.

304
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,590
And he asked, you've both been in the technical field

305
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,670
for a number of years and seen a number of transitions,

306
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,110
both industry-wide and personally,

307
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,310
or in personally, sorry, looks like a comma.

308
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,470
I wonder how you stay invigorated by the field

309
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:36,130
and ensure you enjoy coming to work most days.

310
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,920
I'd especially be curious if reinvention

311
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,700
is the key to this.

312
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:48,080
For example, Brent's recent foray into data science.

313
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,960
I'll let you answer this first.

314
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,800
Okay.

315
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,640
All right.

316
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know if it's reinvention as much as its adaptation.

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,800
One of the things I love about what I've done in the field

318
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,680
or my approach to the field

319
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,760
and really what's kept me interested,

320
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,360
this actually, we didn't plan on this,

321
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,400
but you know from me that I hate repetition.

322
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,380
I hate inefficiency.

323
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,260
The thing that's kept me invigorated is that I've-

324
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,620
I also know you hate idle.

325
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,440
Yes.

326
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,280
The thing that's kept me invigorated

327
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,980
is that I've always been given,

328
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,100
or at least in the last almost 20 years of my career,

329
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,640
given a green field to play with

330
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,950
and knowing that big part of my job

331
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,670
is to discover what work there needs to get done

332
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,230
and then go work on that.

333
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,110
And then always knowing that there are new things

334
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,390
for me to discover.

335
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,470
For example, I've done a crap ton of different things.

336
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,390
At Microsoft, even though I was there for 22 years,

337
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,390
I probably had 15 different jobs.

338
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,950
Brett used to tease me about changing jobs every 18 months,

339
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,260
which was, which remained remarkably accurate

340
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,500
even though I denied it.

341
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,820
But it was always for a new challenge, something new.

342
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,380
The moment I got bored,

343
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,700
and there were very few times I got bored on a job.

344
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,060
I was very bored working on that science project

345
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,660
to make Android apps run on Windows Phone.

346
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,780
But for the most part I had exciting-

347
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,620
By the way, I still get feedback from random people going,

348
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,860
man, I do not understand why Microsoft canned that.

349
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,310
And I'm like-

350
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,270
Think about it.

351
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,180
I do to some degree, I understand.

352
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,900
And turns out my podcast partner was on the team.

353
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,740
Yeah.

354
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,510
As a tangent, there was no way that could ever ship

355
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:51,670
and our PMs were just idiots, just freaking idiots.

356
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,590
They thought, they were adamant.

357
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:56,150
Yeah, people that have built Android apps

358
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,670
will just want to be in the window,

359
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,390
well, because Windows Phone is so awesome,

360
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,270
guess what, they all came from Windows Phone,

361
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,830
that they will just want to resubmit their Android app

362
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,310
to the Windows Store with no testing at all.

363
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,910
And it'll be in the Windows Store.

364
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,670
And it's like, think about this, just think about it.

365
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,910
Look at your market.

366
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,510
Oh my God, it was idiotic.

367
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,950
And then we had the Windows Phone developers too.

368
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,970
And while I'm on a tangent rant,

369
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,150
the number of times, this is Windows Phone, mind you,

370
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,550
I'm in a meeting and there's somebody

371
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,270
making an idiotic decision, I go, why are we doing that?

372
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,250
Hey, we did this on Windows Phone and it worked fine.

373
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,910
I just face-palmed the shit out of my head.

374
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,210
Okay, so anyway, the thing that keeps me invigorated is

375
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,490
there's always something new to learn.

376
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,490
I have written features, I've fixed static analysis issues,

377
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:45,490
I've implemented, I've done a ton of work

378
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,170
fixing build systems, I've written test frameworks,

379
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,610
I've written testing tools, I've written adapters.

380
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,170
One of the coolest projects I did on Xbox One,

381
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,450
which was a lot of fun, because you're building an OS

382
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:01,150
kind of based on Windows or adapted from Windows.

383
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:05,310
And this was a, gosh, this is a long story,

384
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,350
but I'll make it short.

385
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,750
Often in Windows, you would write programs

386
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,640
to elevate the process.

387
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,660
You wanna grab an admin token or an administrative token

388
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,920
and elevate the process.

389
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,020
I had the opposite.

390
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,720
We had these modern apps that would only run

391
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,860
in session one as a guest account.

392
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,980
So I had to take a system token running in session zero,

393
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,980
all look up sessions, and de-elevate that token.

394
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,420
Do the opposite so our test could run properly.

395
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,140
Because our test harness ran at the system level

396
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,740
with full privilege, but we didn't want our tests

397
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,540
to run there because users don't run there.

398
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,780
So anyway, that was, I know, I knew,

399
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,220
I've forgotten most of it now, thank goodness,

400
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,380
I knew a ton about the Win32 API,

401
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,100
just from all the compatibility testing

402
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,380
and API testing I did on earlier versions of Windows.

403
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:58,260
But that was a fun, fun challenge.

404
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,740
Had a lot of, eventually it worked,

405
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,820
as far as I know, it's still working for Xbox One.

406
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,040
One of our Xbox One listeners can tell me if I'm wrong,

407
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,220
but that was a fun project to do.

408
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,380
So I like just figuring out what the holes are,

409
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,820
what needs to get done, and it could be anything

410
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,700
from technical things to project management,

411
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,940
to testing, to development, to solving what I do more of

412
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,620
in my, probably the last five years,

413
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,140
is solving people problems, which is fun.

414
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,100
So what keeps me invigorated is that if I do my job right,

415
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,780
every day has a new challenge and a new way to learn.

416
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,060
And that's what keeps, and learning every day,

417
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,120
that's what keeps me invigorated.

418
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,850
I'm gonna generalize it.

419
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,010
So I can't pronounce the guy's name,

420
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:40,970
we've talked about it before.

421
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,220
I, well, Chevallet-

422
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,060
Oh, the Flow Guy?

423
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,080
He's Flow, yeah.

424
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah, okay, yeah.

425
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Usually we say Shama-

426
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,010
He's got like 30 character names with like three vowels in it.

427
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,890
First off, I will share a little brief perspective

428
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,730
about me, where I come from, but I will also share,

429
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,110
this is not a born in attribute of me.

430
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,350
I have actually taken this and I've mentored folks

431
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,230
and I know it is teachable.

432
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:18,330
The old phrase, turn lemons into lemonade,

433
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,610
is 100% true in this case.

434
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,910
So every time some big change occurs,

435
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,640
it is absolutely true that humans will respond

436
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,260
with a great sense of fear.

437
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,660
But those who can push down the fear,

438
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,860
as I mentioned several episodes ago,

439
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,130
the problem with fear is fear is not real.

440
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,250
Fear is the, fear is about what might be, not what is.

441
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,490
But is this such a strong human instinct

442
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,180
that it's just natural for people to freak out about that.

443
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,660
But for those who don't,

444
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,580
and realize that every time there's a change,

445
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,060
there's an opportunity.

446
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,580
I kind of equivalent to what Alan is talking about

447
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,740
for the part of my career, every time I change teams,

448
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,860
what attracted me the most were the teams

449
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,100
that I knew nothing about.

450
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,140
Because for me it is fun to say,

451
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,100
it was fun for me to go and figure out

452
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,010
how I could make my prior experience benefit

453
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,050
this new thing that has nothing to do with,

454
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,810
with anything I've ever done before.

455
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,920
And every single time I took on that challenge,

456
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,680
I won that challenge,

457
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,440
and I was able to create something new,

458
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,840
which excites me, but also new to that team.

459
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,120
Because most teams are very deeply focused

460
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,180
in how they've always done things.

461
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,960
So when you get a fresh set of ideas coming in,

462
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,180
it ends up being an accelerant.

463
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,120
That's stuff I love.

464
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,880
The important thing I would say here,

465
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,770
in terms of our discussion of modern testing,

466
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,410
is that we have gone through multiple transitions.

467
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,410
And Alex, or not Alex, Alex is my son's name, Alan,

468
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,880
years ago, actually did a great deck on this.

469
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,760
And one of the things that we realized

470
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,780
is literally every single time we went through

471
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,640
one of these huge transitions,

472
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,280
the most common feedback was,

473
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,560
you know I was afraid of it,

474
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,220
but my role is significantly more rewarding

475
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,060
than it was before.

476
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,900
Every single time.

477
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,700
True, true, true.

478
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:07,750
And I think we went through three, four major transitions.

479
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,910
One of the most common bits of career advice I give

480
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:19,000
employees, people I mentor, is not constantly,

481
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,180
but every once in a while, at a frequent pace

482
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:25,120
throughout your career, you should be in a place

483
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,280
where you're scared, you're not sure what you need to do,

484
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,600
and maybe you're worried you might get discovered as a fraud.

485
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,380
Because when you're in that position,

486
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,000
you're forced to learn, and as you crawl out of that hole

487
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,320
and begin learning and figuring things out,

488
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,100
that is invigorating, it's exciting.

489
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,400
You go, oh my, and it's a huge, it's a stair step,

490
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,240
not a linear growth, it's a stair step growth

491
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,560
in your personal and professional career.

492
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:01,660
The only caveat to that one is

493
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,440
you want it to be a healthy fear,

494
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,840
or a healthy motivator.

495
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,240
So dangling the carrot.

496
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,400
I do admit, you could be so scared you're afraid

497
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,400
to go to work, but uncomfortable is I think just fine.

498
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,600
Well, uncomfortable actually is perfect,

499
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,460
and that's what the flow guy says.

500
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,300
You want to-

501
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,490
Chickset me high.

502
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,330
Say that again?

503
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,570
His last name, Chickset me high.

504
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,510
I have the inability to prove or disprove that,

505
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,350
so we'll go with that.

506
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,030
His first name is Mihai.

507
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,870
That one I can do.

508
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,770
Mihai, Chickset me high.

509
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,010
All right, well done.

510
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,750
I'm sure the three will correct me if I'm wrong,

511
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,210
but I'm pretty sure that's it.

512
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,050
What you have to pay attention to is two things.

513
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:55,560
One of the reasons why we're talking about MT a lot

514
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,420
is so that, so as most of you are aware,

515
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:03,820
Alan and I are, we can't really say when.

516
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,360
I'm still paying attention to a tipping point,

517
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,520
but to at least me, it does seem

518
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,100
this is the direction the industry is coming.

519
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,100
What we're doing is we're trying to get the word out

520
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,520
so that when it hits you, if it does,

521
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,000
but when it does, it's not a surprise.

522
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,080
You have time.

523
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,180
You have time to train up.

524
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,320
You have time to grow yourself

525
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,220
so that you're very prepared.

526
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,600
Alan and I were talking about this

527
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,640
within Microsoft three years beforehand,

528
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,420
and we very much saw how the wind was blowing,

529
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,640
and I had multiple people.

530
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,880
When it actually hit, I had multiple people come in and say,

531
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,680
damn it, I wish I'd listened to you.

532
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,940
I have no doubt that there are people

533
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,820
listening to podcasts that might post that

534
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,630
when that time comes.

535
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:08,790
Our goal, so fear plus surprise

536
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,830
constructs an irrational response that is not productive.

537
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,080
As long as it's sort of a healthy fear, great.

538
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,120
Ideally, fear motivates people.

539
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,800
My preference is that people figure out

540
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,920
where they wanna go and target that

541
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,680
instead of what they're trying to avoid.

542
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,360
But this ties into the theory,

543
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,840
and we can move off the mailbag after this, I think.

544
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,120
The Heffetz book I mentioned all the frickin' time,

545
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,280
leadership on the line, has the quote that I use

546
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,680
way too often, but it's worth it.

547
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,340
Leadership is disappointing people

548
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,920
at a level they can absorb.

549
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,950
And there's a diagram or a discussion,

550
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,190
I can't remember what from the book

551
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:59,070
that talks about an organization, not just the person,

552
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,190
but we can talk about it in the organization level.

553
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,930
If an organization or a person, I'll add,

554
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:07,270
is complacent, your productivity,

555
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,390
actually your interest is down,

556
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,630
therefore your productivity is down.

557
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,820
If an organization or a person is too uncomfortable,

558
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,080
they're at that boiling point, they're freaked out,

559
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,020
they're frozen, they're not getting anything done either.

560
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,280
Works true for the person or the organization.

561
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,880
What you wanna do as a leader,

562
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,900
and what you wanna drive yourself to do,

563
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,420
is live at that simmering point

564
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,120
where you're slightly uncomfortable,

565
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,960
but you have an idea what you're doing.

566
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,800
That is where productivity happens at an organization,

567
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,890
and that is where growth happens as an individual.

568
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:45,570
And then if you add in some sort of program

569
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:51,760
that boosts employee engagement from a positive angle,

570
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,970
because happy, uncomfortable employees

571
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,730
are absolutely the most productive.

572
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,530
Yeah, for sure-sies.

573
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,370
Yep.

574
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,210
I can't believe I just said that.

575
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,070
So thank you, thank you very much for your question.

576
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,150
If you have questions, you can email them

577
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,730
to alanandangrewiesel.com,

578
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:16,250
or join our Slack channel and ask there.

579
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,290
But thank you very much,

580
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,510
and we appreciate those.

581
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,580
Little bit of a transition here.

582
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,180
You mentioned that we're getting the word out

583
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,260
about modern testing,

584
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,100
and one thing I wanna call out is

585
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,620
for those of you not in our Slack group,

586
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,780
for those of you, maybe the fourth listener,

587
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:35,740
if there ever was one, I can't imagine that happening.

588
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,700
Dear God.

589
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,060
I'm a little freaked out and blown away

590
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,060
at how many of the three

591
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,180
are sharing modern testing principles

592
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,780
with their teams at meetups,

593
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,220
and how much the MT Army, should we call them that?

594
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,380
Or maybe- No.

595
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,580
Okay, the MT Clan.

596
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,260
No, the Clan's not right either.

597
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,780
We'll figure out, hey, three.

598
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,300
Okay, the three.

599
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,220
I'm happily surprised-

600
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:09,130
Wait, I wanna, I do not want to associate MT

601
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:11,090
with any sort of thing that is based on

602
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,090
an irrational belief,

603
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,810
because I think that's one of the biggest problems.

604
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,450
Yeah, I'm just, you know words come out,

605
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,810
and then I go, ah, not the right word.

606
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:24,570
So anyway, how much people are sharing

607
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,010
and giving us the feedback and sharing what they've learned.

608
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,730
We just added this morning, we, meaning Salty Gunner,

609
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,930
just added a lessons learned channel to our Slack team

610
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,370
to talk about lessons they've learned

611
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,490
from rolling out these principles.

612
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,290
I'm just blown away, happily blown away.

613
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,330
People are looking at these and sharing them.

614
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,440
People have posted to the group

615
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,560
and posted to me privately,

616
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,480
things they're doing, what's working out,

617
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,280
the feedback on their team.

618
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,240
There have been people that have

619
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,600
shown my Test Bash video to their team,

620
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,520
and had discussions based on that.

621
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,100
Amazing, just, I'm, wow.

622
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,100
So, that said, I was invited to be part of a webinar

623
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,380
yesterday as part of the Test Masters Academy

624
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:18,770
webinar series, and I think the topic was something,

625
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,370
I forget the exact title,

626
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:25,520
but it was talking about modern testing.

627
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,360
Okay.

628
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,600
And modern testing round table.

629
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,890
Big M or little m?

630
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,970
Well, in the title it was a big m,

631
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,410
in reality when I joined the call,

632
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:37,890
it was a little teeny itsy bitsy m.

633
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,610
Did you notice Lisa's tweet yesterday?

634
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,220
No.

635
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,420
She talked about modern testing,

636
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,920
little m, little t, and double quoted.

637
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,760
All right.

638
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,600
I'm like, hmm.

639
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,440
Huh, hmm, huh.

640
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,280
Yeah, exactly, hmm.

641
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,120
So, this was an interesting round table,

642
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,400
or panel discussion, because I thought it may be

643
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,580
about modern testing, capital M,

644
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,860
and it was about what people,

645
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,680
I mean, it was about testing

646
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,860
and random future testing stuff.

647
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,860
So, I was definitely shaking things up.

648
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,820
We had four of us on the panel.

649
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:21,720
One person was your very typical test manager.

650
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,340
At the point, I won't go in order here,

651
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,660
but the point where I mentioned,

652
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,060
some of my teams no longer use a bug tracking database.

653
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,380
He just about crapped his pants and said,

654
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,580
that just will not fly.

655
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,140
You have to have that, it's necessary.

656
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,940
Another person, test architect, sort of roll,

657
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,260
I think that might've been her title,

658
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,460
was all about, this was Microsoft 1999, 2000,

659
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,820
we need to architect automation frameworks,

660
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,780
and all the testers need to write automation all the time.

661
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:55,220
And then one person, even more traditional,

662
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,540
and oddly, been in testing since 2003,

663
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:05,300
and was very, and again, nothing,

664
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,200
how shall I put this?

665
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,250
Because I'm not ranking on waterfall,

666
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,850
but that's what modern testing.

667
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,410
That's my job.

668
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,290
Well, put it this way, that's what modern testing was,

669
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,210
and I said modern testing is an antidote

670
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,650
to the discussions around traditional software testing

671
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,210
that are popular in the 90s and before,

672
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,610
where the testing was done at the end of the product cycle.

673
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,570
Yes, where the testing was done

674
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,610
at the end of the product cycle, quality was tested in,

675
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:31,890
and we're talking about modern testing

676
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,010
as a way to combat that.

677
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,970
She had Migo, the moderator had Migo first,

678
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:37,810
and then as I'm talking, I'm watching,

679
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,450
the other presenters kind of go,

680
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,770
and I never saw so much head shaking

681
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,290
while I was talking in my life,

682
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,250
throughout the whole webinar.

683
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,170
And very much embraceable,

684
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,170
I have a product that requires waterfall,

685
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,770
and waterfall's not a bad thing, and blah, blah, blah,

686
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,170
and it's a great, own it, own it, own it, that's fine.

687
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,690
Both of those statements are false,

688
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,490
I'm going to assert it, and I don't know anything about,

689
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,490
you do not require waterfall, and it is a bad thing.

690
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,650
I chose my battles,

691
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,490
but I was firm to the principles of modern testing.

692
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,050
Did you meet it in a room, or was it like a,

693
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,850
No, virtual. Four-way virtual.

694
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,530
Four-way virtual.

695
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,130
And it was fun.

696
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,250
And it was good.

697
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,370
I would love to do, I could do one of those

698
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,410
every single day, I don't like giving that many

699
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,570
presentations, but someone's put me on a panel

700
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,530
of people that are from a more traditional background,

701
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:34,660
and the most closest, the closest to modern from the group,

702
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,300
there was one of the test managers said they did Agile,

703
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,940
but it was all focused on iteration, iteration, iteration,

704
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,940
and nothing about actually learning and adaptation.

705
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,340
So, but it was fun.

706
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,180
One of the things, maybe the final question,

707
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,450
I won't go through them all,

708
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:56,930
I don't think there's a recording, and I'm glad I did it,

709
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:59,290
it wasn't what I expected, but I'm glad I did it,

710
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,130
and I had fun.

711
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:03,290
Oh my God, it was fun, because after a while,

712
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,570
after watching all the headshakes and the disagreement,

713
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,010
and it was just kind of fun to just talk about what I see.

714
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,690
And the last question I was asked is,

715
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,290
what is the, we're all test managers or leaders here,

716
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:19,320
what is the feature of the modern testing manager?

717
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,520
And I go, please, please let me go first,

718
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,520
please let me go first, please let me go first.

719
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,040
Alan, what do you think?

720
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,910
I said, my role is to work myself out of a job.

721
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,910
I have, I joined my current company with 45,

722
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,350
whatever people are working for me throughout my organization,

723
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,510
I'm down to about 12, and I say within the next three,

724
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,310
six months at the most, I will no longer have QA

725
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,350
reporting to me because I think it's an inefficient way

726
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,510
to run a modern organization.

727
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,200
I added some more stuff in there, it's like.

728
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:59,200
And the waterfall guy said, oh, he said,

729
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,040
I agree with you, and at a good answer,

730
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,240
he said, I agree with you, we all should be working

731
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,020
ourselves out of a job, but I don't know if he believes it

732
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,680
in the way I believe it.

733
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
No, so.

734
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,720
And I wanna talk a little bit more about the last question,

735
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,560
because I was thinking about this since I said that,

736
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,840
so again, another reason I love this

737
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,320
made me think about why am I doing that,

738
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,520
and what makes me feel like that's an okay thing to do.

739
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,040
And one thing I've done, and I may have mentioned this

740
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,080
on here before, and I do have, for a transition,

741
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,760
I have one other comment from the presentation

742
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,520
or the roundtable to talk about,

743
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,950
but I realized that as I coach,

744
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,030
I coach my team on leadership and how to influence

745
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,750
the developers they work with to embrace quality,

746
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,660
to write tests, to embrace the quality culture.

747
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,740
At the same time, I meet, along with them,

748
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:54,420
in a lot of cases, I meet regularly with most or all

749
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,820
of the dev lead that I work with regularly.

750
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,260
And I realized, in retrospective, that I treat them

751
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,680
the way a traditional test manager may treat a test lead.

752
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,000
So the dev leads I work with are my virtual test leads.

753
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
When I talk to them, I find out what's going on in the team,

754
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,680
we'll talk about how things are going,

755
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,200
whether they feel, it's like a one-on-one,

756
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,720
but then I'll also have questions about quality,

757
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,840
and what's your approach to quality here?

758
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,360
What do you think you can do better?

759
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,040
What are some things you think you can do better?

760
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm treating them like they are a test lead in some ways,

761
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,480
and now that's in my head,

762
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,320
I'm thinking I want to do more of that.

763
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,600
I want to have fewer QA people report to me,

764
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,560
and more dev leads that I meet with

765
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,560
to coach on them leading testing and quality.

766
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,360
So anyway.

767
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,360
You need to teach them the value of them

768
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,480
asking the same question.

769
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Yeah, and they've learned that.

770
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,520
That's how you go viral.

771
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,560
And it's interesting, because I start to see that happen,

772
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,480
and it wasn't until this reflection

773
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,920
from this round table yesterday,

774
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,840
I realized, oh, that is what I'm doing,

775
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,240
and I see why it's working where it's working.

776
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,600
So I want to do more of that.

777
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,840
Anyway, you were going to say something earlier,

778
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,290
I'll cut you off, please jump in.

779
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,130
Glad you did that.

780
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:22,900
I wonder if you won anyone over.

781
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:27,460
I don't, there was a relative tiny audience,

782
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,140
so I don't know if I won them over.

783
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,620
To be his credit, the waterfall guy,

784
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,220
he sent me a note afterwards saying it was great to,

785
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:38,190
and it says great to hear your opinions,

786
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,670
nice meeting you today.

787
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,430
So he was very cordial about it,

788
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:47,560
even though we were on different sides of what testing is.

789
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,240
Yeah.

790
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,600
Sorry, I gotta add one more thing.

791
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,440
Go ahead.

792
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,560
Another question was,

793
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,720
what skills should someone getting into testing today learn?

794
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,040
I said a lot of stuff besides testing.

795
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,100
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

796
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,340
And I was serious, but oh my God, the looks.

797
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,500
Yeah, anyway, go on.

798
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,740
Yeah, I know.

799
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,080
I had to look at that webinar.

800
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,480
Right, you're having too much fun

801
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,640
rethinking it right now,

802
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,440
and of course the problem is,

803
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,240
if you're not careful,

804
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,960
then you can come across as all you're trying to do

805
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,640
is screw with the other panelists.

806
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,770
Right, and I don't think I...

807
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,610
And that's not our goal.

808
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,930
That wasn't my goal.

809
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,250
I answered the questions as honestly as I could.

810
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,650
I wasn't screwing with them.

811
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,490
Right.

812
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,310
And I let them have their piece.

813
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,930
I didn't argue with them on everything I disagreed with.

814
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,650
We have a different perspective,

816
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,050
and it's one that I've repeatedly vetted out.

817
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,530
You're going in a direction I have never gone,

818
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,730
but I think you'll succeed in that.

819
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,130
I've never been a director of QA

820
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:08,810
trying to get rid of my whole team.

821
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,490
Right, and still make...

822
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,090
But that's not your ultimate goal.

823
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:16,690
It's essentially, how do I make this business function better

824
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,650
and then recognizing the way you need to do that

825
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:22,490
will result in your team disappearing.

826
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,890
Exactly, the goal isn't to get rid of the team.

827
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,530
The goal is to...

828
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,990
What's the first principle of modern testing?

829
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,870
Business first.

830
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:31,750
My goal is to improve the business.

831
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,890
I'm improving the business

832
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,150
and sort of making principle number seven happen

833
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,900
because it's the right thing to do for the business.

834
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,740
Absolutely.

835
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,580
I didn't even pre-think that, but holy crap, that's cool.

836
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,580
We're expressing, even with Agile testing out and Agile out,

837
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,700
I still accuse the Agile manifesto of this,

838
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:59,170
but essentially, with as long as it's been out,

839
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,170
there's still far too many people that are polarized.

840
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:07,570
There is absolutely no valid place for waterfall.

841
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:12,570
It never should have existed, even in the paper.

842
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:14,410
It says don't do this.

843
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,290
I used to highlight that, yeah, yeah.

844
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,360
And granted, most people doing waterfall

845
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:24,240
are usually doing something closer to spiral model, but still.

846
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,240
But a lot of folks have come up with a definition of success

847
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,640
based off years of experience, and it's still very true.

848
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,700
When you have years of experience of solving problems

849
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,440
using a particular toolset,

850
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,920
you kind of generally tend to look at all problems

851
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,720
with that toolset.

852
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,140
And then at some point in time,

853
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,260
you're just basically trying to solve problems,

854
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,820
and oftentimes you don't actually have the time

855
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,600
to sit back and say, is there a better way?

856
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,900
And the waterfall approach today, in my view,

857
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,400
they're sort of taking an evolutionary approach,

858
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,240
and I do think the time is right

859
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,120
for taking a revolutionary approach

860
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,160
and rethink the whole system.

861
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,890
And that's what I think modern testing is about.

862
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,570
One other question, and we're not gonna get

863
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:24,570
super deep into this, but this is gonna kick off

864
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,490
a nice discussion for the next podcast.

865
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,330
Yes.

866
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,010
Is another, it wasn't a question.

867
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,690
Oh, I use this line, which I know I've used

868
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,970
on the podcast before, probably when talking about

869
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,810
the principle around our job

870
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,610
as nurturing the quality culture.

871
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,050
I think that's four, I could be wrong.

872
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,610
Josh, why did we number them?

873
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,770
Yeah, we even had the Ministry of Testing

874
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,870
even created this fan-

875
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,270
Wonderful poster.

876
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,110
Cheat cheat.

877
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:56,930
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:58,130
We should just...

879
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:01,170
Oh, by the way, Ministry of Testing,

880
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:02,450
three of all heard of them.

881
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,810
You know they have the boss boss,

882
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,570
which are Bradshaw, they also have different bosses,

883
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,690
different features.

884
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,740
They have an editor boss, Melissa Eden.

885
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,820
Yep, I just hired her for the Unity office.

886
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,420
She's gonna work at Unity Austin

887
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,660
and make awesome things happen.

888
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,320
You couldn't talk about it last time.

889
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,140
I couldn't, but she announced it on Twitter.

890
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,040
Oh my, this is like, I'm building the dream team.

891
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,820
This is good.

892
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,180
So anyway, back on topic.

893
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,460
Oh, the point I made, I said something very close to this.

894
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,500
I'm sure all the other panelists will agree

895
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,780
that it's not testing's job to own quality.

896
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,930
One of my few head nods.

897
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:47,410
Said, but I do think people on my team are responsible

898
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,720
and accountable for building the quality culture.

899
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,800
That was my quote.

900
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,000
And then to tie us into a conversation before,

901
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,240
as my team slowly moves into reporting to dev,

902
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,360
they're not going away, I'll still meet with them.

903
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,960
We're just swapping the dotted lines and dashed lines.

904
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,680
I will begin to hold those dev leads,

905
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,280
my virtual test leads accountable

906
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,260
for growing that quality culture.

907
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,260
And someone might say,

908
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,620
how do you hold them accountable if they don't work

909
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,460
for you?

910
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,340
And I can hold them accountable.

911
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,620
I know how to do leadership.

912
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,460
Anyway.

913
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,740
The answer is leadership.

914
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,580
Yeah.

915
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,460
So one of the panelists, a waterfall panelist,

916
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,620
I'll call him out by name, said, well,

917
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,740
you can talk about that,

918
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,960
but the quality culture is abstract.

919
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,120
And I said, well, if you just call it quality culture is,

920
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,520
but I think you can define attributes of a quality culture.

921
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,540
And these may be different contextually for every team,

922
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:49,560
but I don't know, I think you can define them.

923
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,600
And in fact, and I'm sure I've read these before

924
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,560
on the podcast,

925
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,520
but I think we'll maybe do some deeper dives into these.

926
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,680
Beginning next time.

927
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,120
I think I can define them knowing full well

928
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,280
you have already.

929
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,760
I was in a conversation with my peer managers at,

930
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,790
well, yeah, some other quality managers at Unity

931
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:16,430
and I brought up the same statement.

932
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,110
I do believe I hold my team accountable

933
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,150
for building the quality culture.

934
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,310
It's been in the principles for a while.

935
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:22,070
I fully believe that.

936
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,080
And it wasn't so blatant disaster.

937
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:26,920
Well, it's abstract.

938
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,760
What do you mean by that?

939
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,880
It was like, well, what does that mean?

940
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,400
How do we, how do we grow that?

941
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,500
Me looking for some work to do said,

942
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,950
let me see if I can define that.

943
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,690
I sat and stared at my computer and said, oh crap.

944
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,710
I don't know how to define that.

945
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,580
And, but then I thought I, I do at this stage

946
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,300
in my career, I do so much of my job,

947
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:51,460
just in my head, walking around thinking

948
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,420
and after am I myself, just cause I'm not typing

949
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,060
into keyboard, if I'm thinking

950
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,420
and maybe I'm actually working,

951
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:01,420
but I just reflected and thought for days

952
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,480
and then some things started forming in my head

953
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,980
and I wrote up and you've seen a copy.

954
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,920
When I sat down to write up what turned out

955
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,680
to be a little bit of a capability model

956
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,760
or a maturity model, if you will,

957
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:23,140
it spit out in an hour.

958
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,160
And we've used it a lot at Unity.

959
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,820
We've begun to use it as a way to identify

960
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,740
how a team is going to grow their quality culture.

961
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:36,860
And so far it's worked remarkably well.

962
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:38,420
Made a few edits, a few tweaks,

963
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,400
but it's being used by a lot of teams

964
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,860
and working very, very well.

965
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,860
So I think we'll dive into what the full maturity level is,

966
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,650
but I do wanna walk through

967
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:52,470
what the different capabilities are,

968
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,930
what the different things I think a team

969
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,790
with a high quality culture should exhibit.

970
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,820
And those are in order, and we'll take a little bit

971
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,620
of time to comment on each one,

972
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,400
but we'll dive in deeper later.

973
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,620
The first one is testing breadth.

974
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,900
And this is about, there's a lot of teams that think,

975
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,160
well, my unit test passed at 100%,

976
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,740
we must be ready to ship.

977
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,060
Just recognizing that there are different kinds of testing

978
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,360
the team needs to do, things to think about.

979
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,220
The agile testing quadrants fit really well in here

980
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:29,960
as a model, but thinking about not just functional testing,

981
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,000
but thinking upfront, are there security applications here?

982
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,360
Should we do a threat model?

983
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,740
What sort of reliability or stress testing would we do?

984
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,880
How is this going to integrate with other components?

985
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,620
Thinking about those things upfront

986
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,640
versus just writing a bunch of functional tests.

987
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,840
I think teams with a high, with a team,

988
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,280
an organization with a high quality culture

989
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,980
will consider those things strategically

990
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,220
and comprehensively throughout their product sector.

991
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:00,180
I think anything worthwhile classified

992
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,400
under something called a maturity model,

993
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,640
regardless if it's abstract or not,

994
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,860
is gonna evaluate the system at play

995
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:17,100
and essentially try to advance people

996
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,140
through the maturity model and the highest ROI.

997
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:25,240
To be clear, I hate maturity models.

998
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,700
I hated, pardon me, hated writing this

999
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,040
because I knew it would be,

1000
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,300
I guess the problem is maturity models are,

1001
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,660
the problems I've seen is one,

1002
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,860
they're treated as a scorecard, which I frickin' hate.

1003
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,280
Then rename yours.

1004
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,960
I try to call it a capability model,

1005
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,960
but everybody keeps on calling it maturity models.

1006
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,040
I don't call it a model.

1007
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:45,880
Maturity guidelines.

1008
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,200
I actually know what we call it.

1009
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,080
You know what's caught on with my peers?

1010
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,220
We call it the thing, for lack of a better name.

1011
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,060
Awesome.

1012
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:57,100
So another one is quality and test ownership.

1013
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,660
Who owns quality?

1014
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,160
A team with a low level of thinginess,

1015
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,220
maturity, capabilities.

1016
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,260
A test team would own all the quality on the team.

1017
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:09,260
They test quality in.

1018
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,920
Whereas a team that's very mature,

1019
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,580
like principle number seven,

1020
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,540
may not have the need for a quality

1021
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,380
and testing specialist.

1022
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,540
Actually, I don't think that's the lowest.

1023
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:21,260
The lowest is you've hired a test team

1024
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:23,120
who doesn't actually own it.

1025
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,900
They just serve the role of being the ones to blame.

1026
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,500
Which is, as you know,

1027
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,140
the way there's still a reasonable amount

1028
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,820
of testing out there like that.

1029
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,820
And I heard about it yesterday.

1030
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:37,300
How the team deals with technical debt and maintenance.

1031
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,580
Not just bug backlog, but technical debt in general.

1032
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,420
Is it pile up?

1033
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,500
Yeah.

1034
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,260
We'll talk about this more.

1035
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,780
But for me, that one,

1036
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,010
that one right there.

1037
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:53,290
In terms of my own transition,

1038
00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:57,050
the three have heard this story over and over again.

1039
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:01,730
I left test, went to dev as in Bing.

1040
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,710
And that one, if there was one single decision

1041
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,320
that just friggin' solidified me on this,

1042
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,000
is getting rid of the bug database.

1043
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:13,820
Yeah.

1044
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:16,410
That one thing,

1045
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:17,810
you get rid of the bug database,

1046
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:20,090
yeah, it's gonna freak out Waterfall Guy.

1047
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,090
Right?

1048
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,410
Because it's essentially, well, how do we keep up?

1049
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,530
No, the only way you can keep up

1050
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,770
is to stay clean all of the time.

1051
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,050
Yes.

1052
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,130
That is the only way.

1053
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:33,810
So, and the thing I talk about with my team is,

1054
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,110
now everybody's fully on board,

1055
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,650
on their way to getting the zero bug backlog.

1056
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,540
But the thing they're thinking about now,

1057
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,100
in our digital conversations is,

1058
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,380
what other debt do we have?

1059
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,220
What's our other debt?

1060
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,540
And thinking about that,

1061
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,820
because there are other kinds of debt than bugs.

1062
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:50,660
Code quality and tuning.

1063
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,500
Can I tell you?

1064
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,770
There's code quality, oh, you're not gonna go on?

1065
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:57,930
Okay, tell me.

1066
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,690
So, the next thing is,

1067
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:02,240
once you get rid of the technical debt,

1068
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,400
then what you need to do is

1069
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,620
evaluate your ability to scale.

1070
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,000
Build a KPI that you trust,

1071
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,140
and it's context sensitive,

1072
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:14,940
I can't give you any firmware guidance in this.

1073
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,860
Build a KPI that you trust,

1074
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:21,160
that indicates whether or not

1075
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,710
your current system can scale

1076
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:28,100
to the predicted load three months from now.

1077
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:28,940
Yeah.

1078
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,380
Okay, and that's all you care about.

1079
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,820
You wanna know, the second it goes under three months,

1080
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:37,060
you go, okay, we gotta make a change.

1081
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,100
We got three months,

1082
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,040
because we can't scale now.

1083
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,160
Code quality and tooling,

1084
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,310
and this is mostly about,

1085
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,230
again, these are contextualized

1086
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:46,110
from the things that I wanna see happen,

1087
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,790
but this is, what's happening in CI?

1088
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,400
What's happening in the check-in gates?

1089
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,060
Is it, do we have analysis tools running,

1090
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,340
which again, create debt,

1091
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,260
these things like principles overlap,

1092
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,420
and you'll see that these attributes overlap

1093
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,480
with modern testing principles as well.

1094
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:05,300
The development approach,

1095
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,980
we've all seen bad Kanban and bad Scrum.

1096
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,420
Enough said. Fragile.

1097
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,260
Enough said.

1098
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,100
Yeah.

1099
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,580
So, there's a level of maturity there.

1100
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,220
I am fascinated at the number of distinct variants

1101
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:21,140
of the said two.

1102
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:21,980
Yeah.

1103
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,820
Oh yeah.

1104
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,700
I forgot to periscope this one, like I said it would.

1105
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,940
Maybe another one, but there was a face palm right there.

1106
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,940
Learning and improvement,

1107
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:35,060
and this is for a respective time,

1108
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:37,500
think of a team doing really good retrospectives

1109
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:38,500
and acting on them,

1110
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,220
and that's being a high level of maturity,

1111
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,180
and teams that just kind of go through the motions

1112
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,780
and don't ever learn.

1113
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,100
Build, measure, learn.

1114
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,860
Not build, measure.

1115
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,020
Or just build.

1116
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,460
Build, build, build, build, build.

1117
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,460
That's iteration, right?

1118
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:53,300
Well, and sometimes the worst would be

1119
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,520
you have three separate teams.

1120
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,100
Oh, we build, measure, learn.

1121
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,040
That's the build team, that's the measure team.

1122
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,480
There's the learn team.

1123
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:02,500
There's a meta point around the quality culture,

1124
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,660
and which involves leadership support.

1125
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,260
And does leadership give a,

1126
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:10,620
there's a weird growth where leadership doesn't care.

1127
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,720
It's like, whatever, do what you want.

1128
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,680
There's a stage where they care too much,

1129
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,120
and they're driving quality through scorecards

1130
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,600
and trying to micromanage a bunch of these things.

1131
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,800
Then there's a level where the quality culture

1132
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,520
is part of what the team does,

1133
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:29,120
and they stay out of the way.

1134
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,920
So it's an interesting curve

1135
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,720
of how leadership support is needed.

1136
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,360
You need leadership to supply a rallying cry,

1137
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,960
and to emphasize that it's important.

1138
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,160
And then, like one of my favorite authors, Steve Denning,

1139
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,720
says, you give the team a framework to work in,

1140
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,960
and then get out of their way.

1141
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,280
And quality culture is a very good example.

1142
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,740
You cannot escape without that framework.

1143
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,670
That's actually the fundamental difference

1144
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:58,190
between the first stage and the last stage.

1145
00:51:58,190 --> 00:51:59,970
Yeah.

1146
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,170
All right, so maybe in the next podcast,

1147
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:05,650
we'll talk a little bit more about some or all of those,

1148
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,050
little deeper dive.

1149
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:08,750
I think we should go deeper.

1150
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,150
Yeah, for sure, but not today.

1151
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,800
We're out of time.

1152
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,640
Agreed.

1153
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,400
All right, thanks again for listening

1154
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,840
to the AB testing podcast.

1155
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,960
I am still Alan.

1156
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,800
I'm Brent.

1157
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,640
All right, bye.
