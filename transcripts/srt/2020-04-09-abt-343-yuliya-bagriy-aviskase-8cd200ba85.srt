00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,030
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything.

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,550
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,550
Let's get started.

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:27,650
We're back again for another ABT 343, and this time with another name I had to practice

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,050
to pronounce.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,850
Please welcome Yulia Bogre.

8
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,140
Hi.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,180
Did I do okay?

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,260
Almost but that's no problem.

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,260
I'll take a B plus.

12
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,260
How are you doing?

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,460
Oh, fine.

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,460
Good.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,420
A very active member of our Slack community.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,140
Happy to have you as one of our three listeners.

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:54,740
Always exciting for Brent and I to hear more about what's going on in the world of R3.

18
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,780
And this is yet another COVID-19 edition.

19
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,620
Brent and I actually recorded episode 118 this morning.

20
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,260
The remote went a little better than last time.

21
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,420
I'm excited to get that out.

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,020
But enough about Brent.

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,700
Today it's the AY podcast as I like to call it.

24
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,820
And we have Yulia here to tell us all kinds of things.

25
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,140
As you know, it's three questions for three listeners, for one of our three listeners,

26
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,860
and tangents are allowed.

27
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:27,940
I think a good first question that's worked with a lot of people is just tell me about

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,300
your path into testing and what you're doing now.

29
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,710
Yeah, that's a good question.

30
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,790
I like how almost everyone was asked about it.

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,950
And it's nice to learn about other people in our community.

32
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:48,670
So comparing to others, I'm probably maybe the youngest one because my testing career

33
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,390
is just five years.

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,390
And this is almost my whole career.

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,510
I wasn't working as anyone else before.

36
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,630
I just came to testing after the university.

37
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,410
I'm initially from Kazakhstan.

38
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:14,650
So my problem was that I wanted to start working remotely right away because my

39
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,650
current husband was working remotely too.

40
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,490
So we wanted to go around the places.

41
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:28,850
And I was very, very lucky to find the place as a junior in the remote, fully remote

42
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:34,890
company, which was specializing in testing.

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,690
And they also provided testing courses for other companies, but for the employees

44
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,500
they were obviously free.

45
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,420
So I had a place to learn from the start.

46
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,780
And some of the people in that company or the community around it are actually very

47
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,900
well known in Russian speaking testing community.

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,730
So I think it probably was the best place to start being a tester.

49
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,900
And it wasn't a product company.

50
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:20,740
We were mostly outsourcing or outstaffing because we were contracted to do that testing.

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:26,580
But we weren't like throw of the board, some people do stuff.

52
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,500
No, we were integrated into the actual development teams.

53
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,460
So it was closer to real world product company.

54
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,340
And my last project was the most important one.

55
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,980
It was a government project.

56
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,420
It was very, very big, very, very, very motivated to work on.

57
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:59,430
And I also burned out on it hugely, but that's another story.

58
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:05,110
And the best thing that what happened on it is that at some point, and I think I

59
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:15,120
don't know how you like it, I was on the crossroads to switch from the so-called manual

60
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:25,030
tester to either be automation engineer, like write Selenium how you like it, or to switch

61
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,550
to be integration tester.

62
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:32,010
So in this case, it was a SOAP services.

63
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:41,290
And I don't know how it happened, but it was me or my direct manager, who's my friend.

64
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:48,390
And I decided to go to integration testing and not automation.

65
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:55,350
And I think it was the best decision of my life because I really just a fan of API and

66
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:58,010
everything that's about it.

67
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,490
Well, you know, my opinion on that there's a level of hell that includes people who write

68
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,490
Selenium all day.

69
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:12,260
Well, I actually write Selenium now, but yeah, it's, it's complicated.

70
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:20,260
But I think it was very cool that at that point in my life, I decided not to do that.

71
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:32,580
And to learn the actual skills and the area that was a bit different from usually is expected

72
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,700
to do from the testering career.

73
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:42,460
And then I moved to the Canada, to Montreal, and I had to find local job.

74
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:48,140
And it wasn't easy because, you know, you don't have a local Canadian experience.

75
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:53,970
You don't have a French suitable to work.

76
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:00,960
Like I mean, I can speak a bit, but it's not okay for day-to-day work.

77
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,480
And also I was very picky because after that government project, I couldn't move to, you

78
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:14,920
know, to test some websites, some kind of, you know, like store pages and something like

79
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
that.

80
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,160
And I also didn't want to work in Alsace and companies anymore because there's just not

81
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,760
enough level of agency stake in the game.

82
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:35,720
When you, when you have conflicting interests, you are either working for your company or

83
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,580
for customers of that product or for who you're trying to work.

84
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:47,840
So when I was looking for work here, I was looking for the product companies and the

85
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,980
product companies who do something meaningful.

86
00:06:51,980 --> 00:07:00,720
I found one and currently I am, I have a very mixed position.

87
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,440
I write automation, yes, Selenium, yes.

88
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,920
And even because of the some project problems, it's in Python.

89
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,800
So it's not even easy stuff like, you know, Cypress or Task Affair.

90
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,560
It's a bit harder to do that in Python.

91
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,060
We don't have enough libraries in that language.

92
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,060
I also do API testing, sometimes UI testing, which I hate.

93
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Okay, now I'm liking you more.

94
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,060
Yeah.

95
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:42,220
And I also not exactly test anymore, just this week, right?

96
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:49,520
This week, really, I think I'm starting to switch not being a tester at all.

97
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,240
And I don't know real name for this position yet, but it's something about developer experience.

98
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,240
What does that mean?

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,240
We don't think of a name to it yet, but what will you be doing?

100
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,400
So I don't know about how to properly name it because it's just two weeks ago, I actually

101
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:13,160
learned that there are special teams in some bigger companies that do that.

102
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:21,640
Developer experience is all about, so user experience is for regular customers who click

103
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,480
buttons and do this kind of thing.

104
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,630
And developer experience is for customers of API.

105
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,930
So what developer experience team usually do?

106
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:44,770
Thus, it's creating API guidelines, creating or researching tooling to help writing better

107
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:53,210
APIs to enforce these guidelines, prepare documentation, and sometimes even development relationships.

108
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:59,550
So when you communicate with your external or internal users of API.

109
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,210
So that's kind of thing.

110
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,310
Is it like developer productivity, would you say?

111
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,380
Or is this more on the experience side?

112
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,950
It's yes, yeah, it is.

113
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:20,090
But there is a level of authority here because you're actually creating rules like, okay,

114
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,930
we should follow this API guideline.

115
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,400
And I need all of your input for it.

116
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,320
So please leave your comments.

117
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,000
But then this API guidelines would be enforced.

118
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,020
It's just like we're making your life easier.

119
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,660
Yeah.

120
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,800
Yeah, and I think, I brought developer productivity because that's, if you've read the Google

121
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,440
software testing book, James Whittaker, or actually he delegated most of the writing of

122
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
that book.

123
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,640
But he talks about the move of quite a few of their testers into this developer productivity

124
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,620
role where the role was to make it easier for developers to do good work.

125
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,450
And in your case, it's an interesting twist on it.

126
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,930
I think it's good where there's some leadership aspect and some standards aspect.

127
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,930
We're trying to, and this is the challenge.

128
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,450
And my favorite leadership quote, which I've used on the other podcast quite a lot is leadership

129
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,370
is disappointing people at a level they can absorb.

130
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,970
And I think in your role and your team's role, it's a lot about figuring out not just

131
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:28,810
how many processes and guidelines can we make the team follow, but the right ones to make

132
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,130
sure it's because the results of the process should be to solve a problem around productivity

133
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,930
or as you put it, their experience, improving the experience and things like guidelines that

134
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,570
make code more readable.

135
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:47,760
Those are proven to show that they make code more maintainable, easier to refactor,

136
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
et cetera.

137
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,430
So I love jobs like that.

138
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,900
I have gravitated towards things that help internal developers do their job better.

139
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,900
I'm a big fan of that kind of work.

140
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Are you excited to get started on that?

141
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Yeah.

142
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:11,540
And that's why I'm hesitant to say that it's development productivity only.

143
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,890
It's because it's not only internal developers.

144
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:23,520
The reason is that we have external developers, external customers that want to use our product

145
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
in their solutions.

146
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,560
Oh, that's different.

147
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,480
That's really cool too.

148
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah.

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:37,640
So it's connecting these lines from our developers to them and making sure that all information

150
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
is in place.

151
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes, yes, I get it.

152
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,920
A long time ago at Microsoft, I worked on a product that had this primary customer was

153
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
external developers.

154
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,720
I remember working on a lot of tools there to help them be more successful and putting

155
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,970
on, I'm not sure if this is part of your, really part of your role or part of the

156
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,970
charter or not, but I remember putting together workshops for them both.

157
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,410
They weren't online then.

158
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,330
Today I do them online, especially today today.

159
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:10,010
But I remember inviting a dozen or 20 of them to Microsoft to give them a couple days of

160
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,570
workshops on how to use our tools.

161
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:13,860
That was a lot of fun.

162
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,860
Nice.

163
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,860
Yeah.

164
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,500
It's actually one of the things that I was doing last week.

165
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:28,200
It's we are preparing a API documentation and before we just didn't have it at all.

166
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,560
So use cases and stuff like that.

167
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
I'm excited about that.

168
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,350
So you're working with a team of people working on the same thing?

169
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,550
Team of one.

170
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,950
So just you all by yourself.

171
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:46,350
Well, yes and no, because I need to connect with everyone.

172
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:55,310
And this is how company approach I mentioned to you before the starting podcast is that

173
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:03,310
the very, not the very, the most important thing is that generally I see the testers,

174
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,370
they are like, okay, I'm doing my job.

175
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,410
And that's it.

176
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:16,050
But as I see it, the really good job comes when you actually try to interact with everyone.

177
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:23,890
With not just developers and not just tech writers, though even sometimes I'm not using

178
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,330
testers don't even know who are tech writers.

179
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,770
I remember that on my previous project.

180
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,900
We didn't even saw the results of that work.

181
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,940
But also these sales with marketing, because these guys are working with our customers,

182
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
with our clients.

183
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:45,260
You should know what are they telling people about us.

184
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:52,860
In case of our sales team, they really, I think it's our first line of defense of knowing

185
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
what actually customers want.

186
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:03,320
Because our product is currently I think is most common on-premises installation behind

187
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
the firewall.

188
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,410
We don't have much telemetry there.

189
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,410
Nope.

190
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,410
Yeah.

191
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,370
We have a similar challenge to work with one of our products.

192
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,170
But yeah, that's a challenge.

193
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:21,290
Yeah, so people who work directly with customers are very important as a tester or as any other

194
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,290
member of the company.

195
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:31,050
You should talk with every department to understand it.

196
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,120
In our company, we have something called, how is it called?

197
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
Okay.

198
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,560
I forgot it.

199
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,480
But there is a management perspective of how the company should be open to everyone.

200
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,040
So every month, we have a meeting where we discuss financial statistics, what's done

201
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,510
in marketing, what's done in sales, how we can help them.

202
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:02,280
It's not just being in all your bubble, but go around and speak with these people.

203
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,720
It sounds like a really fun job.

204
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:10,340
And I'm already imagining some ways in which you may be able to apply modern testing principles

205
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,340
there.

206
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,340
But I'm curious.

207
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,140
So in your, you talk about only having five years of experience, but I think the number

208
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
isn't as important.

209
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,860
It sounds like you've had a good variety and breadth of experience.

210
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:28,290
So I'm curious how you've seen the modern testing principles manifest in the jobs you've

211
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,860
had and especially in the job you're going into.

212
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,820
Because I don't have very good memory, I have a memo with the principles and I will look

213
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,300
into it and just go one by one.

214
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,590
Brent and I don't have memorized either.

215
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,710
So the first principle is actually what I was just was talking about.

216
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,710
Yes, it is.

217
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,710
Yeah.

218
00:15:54,710 --> 00:16:02,790
And I think last month, or maybe, yeah, I think it was last month, we actually, our

219
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:11,110
monthly meeting was suspended in preference of having the meeting to brainstorm our customers

220
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:19,710
who were in the red or orange zone from the support or from development or from the sales

221
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:26,420
perspective and generated ideas about how we can move them to green zone that they like

222
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,460
us more.

223
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:35,460
And as a tester, we had lots of insight in this meeting because some of the customers

224
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,850
were in the red zone because we didn't know about their environment.

225
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,960
And we weren't testing in that particular case.

226
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,170
This ended up badly.

227
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:59,160
So the priority is to understand that all our action can improve business in some way.

228
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,890
So we need to go around to gather information about it and act on it.

229
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,930
And that's where the second principle helps is system thinking, theory constraints.

230
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:18,450
You need to understand where bottlenecks are, where problems arise, where is the loss of

231
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,450
feedback.

232
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,450
Yeah.

233
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,730
And especially all these are ringing truths.

234
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,730
You're talking about your job.

235
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,730
I'll interrupt for just a moment.

236
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,970
But you're talking about you are the glue who's connecting a lot of different parts of

237
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,210
the organization together.

238
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,210
That's principle two.

239
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,210
Yeah.

240
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,850
Oh, by the way, I remember there was a topic.

241
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:37,610
There was some talk on the conference.

242
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,530
Probably it was shared in our slack about being a glue person.

243
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,530
Yes.

244
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,530
Yeah.

245
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,130
And it's actually what I like to do most.

246
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:57,170
And I think Melissa in the previous episode said that in some of the job description, people

247
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,410
just assume that you will do one thing and don't go around with it.

248
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,250
And that's not interesting at all.

249
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:09,720
It's way better to be that kind of group to understand everything.

250
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:17,300
Well, not being an expert in everything, obviously, but to help people do their job better.

251
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Yes.

252
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,300
Yes.

253
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,100
There are some of us like you and I and others who that's where we thrive.

254
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,940
I love being the, as you've heard me call myself before, the specializing generalist.

255
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah.

256
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,720
And a lot about a little and a little about a lot.

257
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,950
Yes.

258
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,950
No.

259
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,150
It's going back to the principles with principle number three.

260
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:49,930
Well, yes, I can see us as a force of continuous improvement, but in my experience, safety net

261
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,820
culture is not going away.

262
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:01,300
So I remember my previous company and its projects and well, they hired us because they

263
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,900
wanted safety net.

264
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Yes.

265
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,900
Yes.

266
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,340
But in your new role, as you described it, you have moved yourself upstream.

267
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:19,970
There are problems with it, I think, because maybe our company sounds like a startup, but

268
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,680
you know, this openness and stuff, but it's actually not this very, very old company.

269
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,750
We have such an old code.

270
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:35,710
Our testing framework is written halfway in bash because it was written before they wrote

271
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,310
testing frameworks.

272
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:45,220
So in this position, when you don't really have a lot of unit tests and stuff, yes,

273
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,110
testing team is safety net, unfortunately.

274
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:56,870
And to go from not from being safety net and not being safety net, you need a lot of stuff

275
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,790
to do, a lot of time to do.

276
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,350
It's not one year or two years.

277
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:03,740
I think it will take a time.

278
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,540
So that's why I'm a bit skeptical when you say that there is so the tip and port or not.

279
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,220
No, I don't think so.

280
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:19,640
I saw that several companies on my previous work and there was many people who are still

281
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,440
where they rely on testers.

282
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,480
Sometimes Brent and I choose to ignore those.

283
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,200
And I've often used the diffusion of innovation curve that was made famous in the Crossing

284
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,280
the Casa book that shows that there are always be lagers.

285
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,400
There'll be the, I forget the names of the sections, but we're not on the super forefront

286
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,640
of innovation, but we're out on the front of the curve.

287
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,960
It just means that a lot of companies are still back there.

288
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,720
Some will stay back there, but we're hoping.

289
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,640
But as you know, as you've seen from talking to people on the Slack channel and hearing

290
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:59,360
other talks about modern testing, this is happening whether Brent and I were going to discuss

291
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,360
it or not.

292
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,480
We just put a name to some things we were seeing that we liked.

293
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,440
So it's going to happen.

294
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,520
In some companies we know it's going to take a long, long time.

295
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,120
And the problem is that there is a kind of bias.

296
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,400
People who participate in Slack or even in testing survey, there are active people.

297
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,610
And I don't think that many people in testing community are active people.

298
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:29,800
There are a lot of basics there.

299
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,440
So I think there is a kind of a bias in the way of saying the whole picture.

300
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,360
Maybe there should be some scientific study, but actually, you know, pick up companies at

301
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,860
random in different countries, you know.

302
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,860
Yep.

303
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,980
And any of the surveys that come out, it's hard because the testers at those companies

304
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:55,540
aren't really involved in the overall internet testing community very often.

305
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,360
Somehow you grew out of it anyway.

306
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,360
But we don't always get a fair sample size when we do testing surveys or testing polls.

307
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,360
Any other principles you wanted to call out as interesting in the scope of the work that

308
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,130
you've seen?

309
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:17,250
Well, I have anything to share about the principle number five.

310
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,250
Love it. Bring it on.

311
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,250
Yeah.

312
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:22,410
Customer capable of only customers capital judging quality.

313
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:31,010
So that government project, I mentioned that I had the burnout from it.

314
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,850
And one of the reasons was that we were not really allowed to communicate with customers,

315
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:45,300
but we were seeing support tickets because we were the people who were called test analysts

316
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:50,460
and we had the task to analyze last level of support stuff.

317
00:22:50,460 --> 00:23:01,460
And sometimes we saw things like people naming us alcoholic drunkards and stuff like that.

318
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,460
And I think a month ago I saw an article where in the comments people mentioned that they

319
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,460
didn't even think that this project had any testers at all.

320
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,460
Yeah.

321
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:22,550
That was not very good for your mental health because you know, you work hard, you try to

322
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:29,550
work hard, but this is government project and laws change and you need to change with

323
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,550
it very fast and sometimes laws doesn't make sense.

324
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:41,550
In our case, we actually had a problem when people try analytics, try to design the requirements.

325
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:48,900
They say this is some law doesn't make sense in conjunction with another law.

326
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:54,900
And they had to propagate it to the government that they should change the laws because we

327
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,900
cannot develop it like that.

328
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
It won't work.

329
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Yeah.

330
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:10,640
So in this case, the problem for me that even though we work hard, you know, and people

331
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,640
like management team was saying that yes, you're doing everything we can.

332
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,640
But because there was not enough feedback from us to customer to explain to them why we

333
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,640
have some problems and or we know we have these problems and we're working on it.

334
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:37,920
But there are some priorities in place that contradicted and something like that.

335
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:45,040
We I still see that generally external developers hated it.

336
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:50,970
And OK, and this is all that matters in the end.

337
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:58,040
When you see that, yeah, you do your hard work, but people just don't like it.

338
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,040
That's it.

339
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,480
It doesn't matter what quality culture you have if people don't like your product.

340
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah.

341
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Yeah.

342
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Wow.

343
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,480
That's that's that's quite a story.

344
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,860
It does show that I mean, although you can the point that really struck me in there is

345
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,860
the thing Brent and I don't want to see people or testers move past is the idea that

346
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,860
they're responsible for quality.

347
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,860
You know, if the customer is complaining about quality, shouldn't just be one part of

348
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,860
part of the organization feeling bad.

349
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,050
Everyone should feel bad.

350
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,050
Well, I think in that case, developers definitely felt bad.

351
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,050
OK, good, good.

352
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,050
Long as everybody's in a little bit of misery, it seems fair.

353
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah, it seems fair.

354
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
That's great.

355
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,240
I'm you know, you've brought up a few times that I mentioned earlier that you're five

356
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
years of experience.

357
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,240
But in that five years, you certainly I certainly wasn't as far along in my career

358
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:03,370
as far as thinking about things and thinking about systems thinking, thinking

359
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:08,530
about how I could affect bigger parts of the team.

360
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:11,530
So the things you're thinking about I was not doing five years into my career.

361
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,530
So I'm impressed.

362
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:16,530
And another thing I've been impressed about is how much and of course, you know,

363
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:17,530
I'm old enough.

364
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,530
There really wasn't much of an Internet when I was five years into my career.

365
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,530
But you're all over the Internet, but not as Yulia as this name I can't

366
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:31,850
pronounce. I hope you can help me with it's obvious case office costs.

367
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:35,360
Help me out and tell me where that tell me more about that name.

368
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:43,620
So there is no proper pronunciation because it was created to be unique

369
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,780
enough to be searchable on the Internet.

370
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,780
You are so much smarter than me.

371
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,640
Yeah.

372
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:59,640
So at first, it was a very long time ago when I was a teenager and I had

373
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:06,640
to come up with a nickname and we were looking for the I think it was

374
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,710
Latin dictionary and I was sounds great.

375
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,710
It's birth in Latin, you know, teenagers.

376
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:20,250
And then I found out that it's not very unique nickname and I had to

377
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:26,410
extend it somehow and I just added some suffix like case.

378
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,410
Okay, whatever.

379
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,410
So it's now with a viscous.

380
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:35,410
But generally when people need to pronounce it a lot like in video games,

381
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:40,480
they just tell it like I was I've been so that's it.

382
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
That's the story.

383
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,480
But the fun part is that at first it was a viscous result.

384
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,340
And then I added because it makes it even more unique.

385
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,910
Wow.

386
00:27:54,910 --> 00:28:01,450
You have such foresight to do that because I've told there's a long story

387
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,450
on my blog about where the name Angry Weasel came from.

388
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,450
But it is not a unique name.

389
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,450
In fact, there is another angry weasel on Twitter who has posted one post

390
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,450
ever like six years ago and can't get their handle from them.

391
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:20,450
And of course, Alan Page is the name of a famous American football player.

392
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,450
So there's no uniqueness about me.

393
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,450
And I've become searchable as I've gotten older.

394
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,450
But that is so smart.

395
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,450
Yeah, I did a little bit of internet stalking and I see GitHub repos

396
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:38,450
and references to your GitHub repos on Stack Overflow conversations.

397
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,450
It is highly searchable.

398
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,450
Someone by the way, if you search your name,

400
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,450
one of the third posts down is someone thanking you for something

401
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,450
you posted to one of your guests on GitHub.

402
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,450
Oh, no.

403
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,450
Oh, that's a very bad story by the way.

404
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,450
I admittedly only skimmed, but it was something about installing Postman,

405
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,450
I think, on Linux.

406
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,450
I broke Postman.

407
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,450
Yeah, I broke Postman at one time in my life.

408
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:09,450
It was so apparently GitHub doesn't send you a notification

409
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,450
when people comment your guests.

410
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,680
So I didn't notice that it was very popular.

411
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,680
I just created it for me to be able to install it.

412
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Which is what those are supposed to be for, but yeah.

413
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,800
Yeah, but people started finding it, commenting it, using it.

414
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,800
And I'm not using Postman by the way.

415
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,800
And I'm actually kind of against using it now.

416
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,800
I saw you have a blog post talking about that.

417
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:35,800
Yeah.

418
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:41,800
And every day it got worse for me because I think they are

419
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
almost like sole PUI now.

420
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,800
People just assume that for pay attention you need Postman

421
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,640
and that's it.

422
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,640
But that's gentle.

423
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,640
So one day, their support team from Postman approached me

424
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,640
and said that they implemented native installation

425
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
and native update.

426
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,730
And people who used my yeast install Postman are not able

427
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,730
to update it because I had some special, I think I was

428
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,730
installing it on the root.

429
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,860
So they actually had to trace it to the my yeast

430
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,860
and asked me to update it.

431
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,860
You are internet famous.

432
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,860
That's fantastic.

433
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,850
That's just one thing.

434
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:29,850
That's a wonderful story.

435
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:33,850
So the good news is I'll put a link to your blog here,

436
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,850
but people who want to find out more about you

437
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,850
and just kind of find random information about you

438
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,850
can just search on Avas case, Aviscus,

439
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,850
however you want to pronounce it.

440
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:44,850
That's what I want.

441
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,850
It doesn't matter, but that is so smart.

442
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,850
That should be every teenager should do that.

443
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,850
Everyone should actually work harder to find a unique name

444
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,950
versus their first and last name plus some numbers afterwards.

445
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,950
I'm so impressed.

446
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,950
This has blown my mind.

447
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:06,110
It's made my whole month and it's only April 3rd.

448
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,300
Well, the thing is that my first and last name

449
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,300
is pretty unique as well, at least in Kazakhstan, Canada.

450
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Yes, but no one wants to be stalked on the internet

451
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,300
by their first and last name.

452
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,490
It helps you separate the person from you,

453
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,490
the internet personality.

454
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,780
That's my take on it.

455
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:29,780
All right, we are out of time, but this has been great.

456
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,780
I've loved talking to you.

457
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,780
Thank you for volunteering to be on the show.

458
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,780
It's been great.

459
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,780
And any last words or are you on Twitter?

460
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,360
No.

461
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
You don't seem like a Twitter person,

462
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,360
but I will give the links to your blog in the show notes.

463
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,160
Anything else I should point to?

464
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
I don't think so.

465
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,160
If somebody just wants to talk to me,

466
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,160
just ping me somewhere where you find me.

467
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,160
Good advice.

468
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,160
Good advice.

469
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
All right, well, thank you very much.

470
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Have a wonderful weekend and good luck with the quarantine.

471
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
Good luck to you too.
