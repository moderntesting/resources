00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:18,060
Hey, everybody. Howdy. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. Still, huh? Welcome to AB Testing. Especially

2
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,940
welcome to our new listeners. I did a webinar last week and picked up a few new listeners.

3
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:29,660
AB Testing is your best podcast in the world for, oh well, actually nothing. AB Podcast.

4
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,900
Going gently to sleep at night. AB Podcast is a possibly interesting podcast for those

5
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:41,400
interested in software quality. Agile testing and what Brent and I call modern testing. We

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,340
talk about everything from test management, leadership, agile quite a bit, software engineering,

7
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:56,380
tools, favorite colors, squirrels. And data science. And data science. Look, Brent, someone's

8
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,880
talking about data science. We did pick up a few new listeners, as I mentioned a moment

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:09,760
ago from, I gave a webinar on Tuesday. Was it Tuesday? Yes. Okay, that correlates.

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,600
Because Webinar Wednesday rolls off the tongue where that alliteration did not happen. You

11
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,080
know what? It really should be. I mean, that works perfect. Well, interestingly enough,

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,840
I don't even know which direction to go. The tangents are going to start. I gave the

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,440
webinar on Tuesday for AST on the use and abuse, capital AB for AB testing, abuse. Test

14
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,840
automation, give a lot of my rants, got some good feedback on that. I was really happy

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,080
with the way that went. Webinars are always tough because you can't read the audience.

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,640
And just to challenge myself again, doing another webinar next Tuesday. Not the next

17
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,480
week I'm skiing, the following Tuesday, the 27th I'll be giving a webinar. I put

18
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,720
the link on Twitter, but I'll put it in the show notes today. It's on the future of test

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,880
automation. I'm doing it with Orin, whose name I can't remember, who is the CEO at

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,120
TestM, test.im, who make a tool for applying machine learning to testing.

21
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:17,420
Nice. Yeah, I need like that part. But yet we have some different ideas on where things

22
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,100
are going. My ideas are very much aligned with what you and I talk about with modern

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,500
testing. I was a little concerned when you mentioned

24
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,740
that you're doing two person panel for that one. And I'm like, okay, who's this guy?

25
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,860
But now I feel a lot better about what this panel could be.

26
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,020
And what's really cool if you want to watch it is there will be a demo of his tool at

27
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,940
the end, which normally I don't like, ah, marketing thing. But he and I, we've actually

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,060
prepped for this thing. We spent some time talking about questions that may come up

29
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,700
and actually preparing for this thing, which is a new thing for me.

30
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:58,380
Wow. There is crazy crap going down the diesel end. How does that work?

31
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:05,820
So it may actually be all right. Nice. We already have a lot of people signed up to

32
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,020
help more of the three listen. Brent, again, for the new listeners, I've mentioned

33
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,740
the three a few times. Can you tell our new listeners what that means?

34
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:21,020
Yes, it's very simple. We have three listeners and we affectionately refer to them as the

35
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,420
three. And if any one of you asks a question, we say, oh, you're one of the three.

36
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,660
Absolutely. It's kind of like, I don't know, Jimmy Buffett calls his guys the parrot

37
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:39,460
heads. And then Justin Bieber has one. Who is this Justin Bieber?

38
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,060
Some stupid kid from Canada. Yeah, that sort of thing.

39
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,220
I'm going to Canada next week. I can't say dumb things about Canadians, perhaps, are listening.

40
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,420
Or perhaps they'll just apologize for Justin Bieber.

41
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,420
Well, yeah, they have several people to apologize for.

42
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,500
Oh, like we don't? Like we don't?

43
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:05,020
No, no, for sure. For sure. I was thinking Celine Dion. Anyway.

44
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,740
Oh, Brent, Brent, Brent, we're going to make so many people mad. We're going to have

45
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,600
two listeners next week. We always have three.

46
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,000
Early on in our podcast, Brett and I would joke about our three listeners and then people

47
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
would. It was actually our first episode.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,360
Was it really? It was.

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,080
Maybe we'll get three listeners. But then people, we kept on stuck and then people would

50
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,680
go, hey, I'm one of the three. And it kind of developed. So that's where that came from.

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,960
If there are other things you don't know about us, you want to know, you're welcome

52
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,120
to ask us questions for the and Brent trashed hands on this for the mailbag and some ways

53
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,960
to get mailbag questions to us. I know Brent's going to bring this up in a minute. So I'm

54
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,280
not going to leave even an ounce of silence in my talk.

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,240
So he cannot get any words in. But the way you get information to the mailbag and to

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,000
us to answer your question, to give us something intelligent for once to talk about is to

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,040
either ping us on Slack. I'm Alan Page, A-L-A-N-P-A-G-E. And Brent is Brent M Jensen, Jensen

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,600
with an E or you can...

59
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,000
You have to breathe sometime, Alan.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,920
...email me at Alan, A-L-A-N-P-A-G-E. And I'll take it there. In fact, I had one question

61
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,000
there from the webinar I was going to answer today, but I'm not going to. I'm going to

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,800
save it for another mailbag and I'm really not going to give you a chance. And we're

63
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,040
going to go on. In fact, the rest of the show...

64
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,830
I'll just sit here in time.

65
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,150
We also have a Slack group, one of the three.slack.com. You will need to use one

66
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,110
of the aforementioned communication methods to get me your email address so I

67
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,070
can send you an invitation. Happy to have you there. All three of us discuss

68
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:47,830
things about the show, about things related to the show. It's a good little

69
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,110
micro discussion. And as I found out this week, some people join the Slack

70
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,470
channel just to get an A-B testing sticker. And yes, if you join the Slack

71
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,190
group and you find your way there and you join the channel called I Want a

72
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,270
Sticker and you post your address, eventually, usually fairly quickly, but

73
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,510
eventually I will send you A-B testing stickers. If you are listening and you

74
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,070
posted your... You didn't think I'd do it this long, did you, Brent? If you are

75
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:19,430
listening, I had three people post their addresses this week and those went out

76
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,910
in the mail yesterday, so look in your mailbox. Okay, Brent, I have to breathe.

77
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,870
And in the episode, this episode comes out... Oh, actually, I can't predict.

78
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:35,550
You gonna finish it today? Yeah, I'll get it out. It'll come out on Sunday, probably.

79
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,510
Okay, so... It may come out... If you're listening to this episode, you'll need to figure out

80
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,430
how to go back in time because Alan committed to shipping all the stickers

81
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,190
out today. Yeah, if there's any more posted today, I'll get them out tomorrow.

82
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,190
I'm driving to Canada on Sunday, possibly according to the weather

83
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:55,950
forecast in a snowstorm, but we'll see what happens. Whistler? Going to

84
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:02,110
Whistler. Nice. Favorite ski place. Last time I was there, my 19-year-old was three.

85
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:09,690
I've gone every year for about the last eight years. I really... Yeah, it's my

86
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:14,530
therapy. It's how I get through the winters. Okay, oh, is this episode 76?

87
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:23,530
Episode 76. Not that we're counting. So, what would, on your webinar, what was the key

88
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,880
things people were questioning about? I can post a link to the recording. I have

89
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,880
to remember now. So, the webinar was about all my grabs about test automation. In

90
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,860
fact, much of it was based on many of the things I rant about in the A word, free

91
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:46,220
on Lean Pub. Yep. You notice how, like, I had AB in the webinar, AB testing,

92
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,940
abuse and misuse of test automation. One thing I did on purpose that maybe was

93
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:57,220
too subtle is in the A word, that the A and the W kind of squished together a

94
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:05,480
little bit like angry weasel. Look at you. I'm all... Subliminal. I'm the

95
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:14,670
Illuminati. Questions were the typical things about what if management wants me

96
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,920
to write UI automation? Well, you can change your manager or you can change

97
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,640
your manager. Often, in the answer, of course, we talked about a lot is pilot,

98
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,760
use data, don't be complacent, don't be afraid to make change.

99
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:38,140
I... Branch? There's definitely... You asked. I know, I know. That one, if your

100
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:45,640
manager wants you to write UI automation in particular, right, then you as the

101
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,640
knowledge expert that he has hired, I think the onus is on you to correct

102
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,680
your manager's understanding on the ROI of this topic. Sure, sure. And I've told

103
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,320
the story, I think it was in How We Test Software at Microsoft. Remember that

104
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
book? Yeah. Yeah. And, but I've mentioned a lot of times, it's my very first day at

105
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Microsoft, I was given a list of test cases and asked to run them every day.

106
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,760
I said, when do you need these automated? They said, oh no, we don't have time to

107
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,640
automate. But I automated them anyway, because it was the right thing to do.

108
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,960
And I just did it... There are things like that where I will automate it,

109
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:26,020
because I am not doing this again manually. Well, I think... Boy, we could go

110
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,300
way off into tangent, you want to get to the main topic of community, which we

111
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,740
started last time and didn't get as far as we wanted. So we want to go a little

112
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:41,100
bit farther there. Yep. But as far as... We've talked about command and control

113
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,820
and the spider and the starfish and empowered people and all these

114
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,100
different things. But I think in knowledge work in general, one, management

115
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,060
doesn't work if you just tell people what to do and just give them exact

116
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,820
destructor. Here's what you do all day today. We're not building widgets in

117
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,260
the factory. But that freedom, being able to take advantage of that freedom

118
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,140
properly and knowing when to push back, I think is part of being successful in

119
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,700
knowledge work. I don't think most... So management as a whole, right, is a

120
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,550
command and control structure. But I don't think most managers are really

121
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:22,030
wired that way. For example, every manager I've ever worked for, let's

122
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:27,340
imagine... I work for you, Alan. Let's imagine I come to you and say...

123
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,860
Oh, wait. I got this. Brent, you're fired.

124
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:38,050
All right, great. So I work for another Alan and I come to him and I

125
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,630
have two options for R101. One, I say, hey, Alan, I'm done with this. What

126
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:49,150
would you like me to do next? Or two, Alan, I'm done with this. I'm thinking

127
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:55,580
these next three things are the next things I should work on. Is there an

128
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:00,600
order that you think would best value the business? Right? It's one of those

129
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,990
things where I'm just like... A lot of the times, particularly I see it in tests,

130
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:12,830
I think a big part of it is the... Well, we talked about the enablement loop or

131
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:19,210
the disablement loop, where I think a lot of tests is just used to just getting

132
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,690
instructions and they've gotten to the point that that's how they operate.

133
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:30,130
I don't think... The optimist in me likes to think that's not as true as it used

134
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:37,250
to be. I know it's not as true as it used to be. So delving deeper into

135
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,050
Tangentville, I mentioned last time or time before, but anyway, sometime last

136
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:47,410
month I met with my leads and then again met with my peers to discuss just people

137
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,260
in the org and how they were doing. We're talking about levels and

138
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,900
internally Unity has some levels which we're figuring them out so we

139
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,340
don't really communicate them to people, but just helps us talk about

140
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,570
people the same way, which I think is fine. We're in that part of growth.

141
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,930
But what came out of that, and this is true of levels at Microsoft and

142
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,450
those are the only two I'm intimately familiar with, although I've

143
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,930
talked with people a lot about levels at Google and Facebook as well.

144
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,280
But the point is that the point I was eventually going to make sometime down

145
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,600
the road was that when someone's brand new, maybe out of college or

146
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,200
barely or changing disciplines, they need more instruction. They need

147
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,120
more hand-holding. They need to be sometimes like that first

148
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,400
person you described. And then there's a maturity where they start figuring out

149
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,680
what work to get done and they come to you to bounce them off you, get

150
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:50,750
prioritization. And then there's that maturity continues. I spent until my

151
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,710
last job, I spent where I was a little bit more of the micromanagy. Actually,

152
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,950
even there I still figured out what I did still define all my own work. It

153
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:06,140
was just a little more stressful environment. But I spent my last 10,

154
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,500
maybe more years, maybe 15 years at Microsoft, defining and prioritizing

155
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:17,010
all of my own work. And that was the expectation for someone at my level of

156
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,850
seniority and maturity is that I should figure out what's the most

157
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,770
important thing to do. And I was better suited for prioritization than my

158
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,450
manager was. I made balance ideas off of him for bigger scale things like

159
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:34,090
that may involve organizational change or affect a big number of people to

160
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,330
get some feedback. But it was more of a discussion and brainstorming than it

161
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,300
was a prioritization. So anyway, taking the subject away from me, because

162
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,100
that's not what it's all about today, at least, is that that maturation

163
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,340
happens. And I expect as people get more senior in their knowledge work and

164
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,460
more experience that not only do they seek out and figure out what the most

165
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,300
important work is to do, but they're able to prioritize it correctly most of

166
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,740
or all the time. There is, I don't know if they're still active, but one of the

167
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:11,330
best topics I've ever studied on this is, well, classes rather is situational

168
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,970
leadership, which walks through the manager employee relationship on a

169
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,290
particular task. And it's very similar to what you just talked about, right? A

170
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,930
manager's job is to direct initially and then try to shift it over to more of a

171
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:31,890
coaching style and then get the hell out of the person's way. But I don't think

172
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:39,440
it's a person level maturity, but rather a topic level maturity. People at any level

173
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:48,850
at any time are more than welcome and welcomed to with the tools that they

174
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:54,010
have in their tool bag, identify problems, try to connect it to something that the

175
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:58,250
business cares about, and then also bring forward with a solution. That's one of

176
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:04,890
the biggest things I push my people towards, like look, as you and I have

177
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:14,600
said on the podcast, ideas come from other ideas and good ideas can come

178
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:22,000
from anywhere. You have to create an environment in which you encourage

179
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,930
that to occur. So one of the things that I think is actually relevant to the topic

180
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,810
today. I thought you were just about to lead into it. If ever we bring it up. You're practically

181
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:39,020
segueing until now. So ideas can come from anywhere. The environmental

182
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:49,560
context can help suppress people coming up with the ideas or sharing them. And at

183
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,200
least I, and this is one of the issues with command and control, particularly with

184
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,800
new managers. I see this a lot with new managers. They go, I am accountable,

185
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,860
therefore I must make the decisions. Whereas my approach is I am

186
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:13,250
accountable, therefore I must make decisions that are correct. And I don't

187
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:19,810
necessarily presume that my decisions are. If there's a timeliness stuff, right, I

188
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,520
still hold veto power. One of my favorite phrases on my team. As you know,

189
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:34,820
I run a, I execute via a Kanban style. All the things we talk about around no

190
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,620
specialists, no generalists. I live and breathe that on every single day. So I've

191
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,460
created something. I don't know fully enough of how what Lisa talks about when

192
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:51,980
she says whole team. But I certainly know the concept. But nevertheless, at

193
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:59,460
times my team is reminded that I spend a lot of time and effort to make my

194
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:07,960
team feel like a democracy, but it's not. So it's interesting to bring that up. I

195
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,440
was just at a conversation yesterday as someone gave me actually a lot of

196
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,040
parallels here. The one of the people on my team was going over his suggestion or

197
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,760
he was working with the dev team and I'm, I'm hands on hands off. I'm hands

198
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,530
on as a coach hands off as far as I think the team makes the decisions. I

199
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:33,650
will give strong suggestions, but I won't very few if I can recall any, I'll

200
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,370
bring them up, but mandates like we're all gonna do this. Like let's go in this

201
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,730
direction. You're on board? Okay. I'll help you get there. So the question was

202
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:47,390
around setting up a Kanban board. Okay. And I had some suggestions on like if you

203
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:51,690
don't, I think if you don't do this, this will happen. But it goes, so it

204
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,610
sounds like you want to do this. I said my suggestion is you have a way to

205
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,690
handle this and here's one way to do it. The decisions yours. And I realized I do

206
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:06,130
that a lot. I try, I don't try and make decisions for people even if they ask me

207
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,690
to make it for them because I want them. One of the things I think helps people

208
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,650
grow in maturity and grow in leadership skills. I think when you're in modern

209
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,850
testing and you need to be influential over your team, having leadership skills

210
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,970
are important. And I found the only way to get good at decision-making is to

211
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,780
practice decision-making and practice making changes that people may not be

212
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:31,980
comfortable with. The Heffetz quote from leadership on the line, I use a lot. People

213
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,860
nod their head. They laugh and they nod their head. His leadership is disappointing

214
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:40,880
people at a level they can absorb. And Brett just nodded his head and laughed.

215
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,080
That's what I get every time someone hears that. And it really is. If you're

216
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:51,040
just complacent, not gonna get changed. If you're, I know leaders who say this

217
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,880
we're doing this, this is what we're doing, and people are, they're not

218
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,640
on board. It's too much disappointment at once. And the right things

219
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,960
don't happen there either. But you want to keep people, I mean, for organizational

220
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,640
change especially, there's a level of uncomfortableness where you actually get

221
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,880
the most productivity and the most change. Something to think about.

222
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,900
There's almost every book on the planet around business project management. We'll

223
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:25,260
talk about that. That you make them just a little uncomfortable. You get a lot

224
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,620
more productivity. I often change absorb to tolerate. I think leadership is

225
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,300
disappointing people at a level they can tolerate. I think it's, to me that one

226
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,840
works a little bit better, but it's the same thing. The issue though, like what

227
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,080
you brought up with your discussion. And I do think it, this is an

228
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,040
important one. Like if this individual had come to me, they would have

229
00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:03,350
start getting my speech on leadership. Because there's, you cannot

230
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:14,870
come to me and ask for permission to be a leader. Right. It's no, like what

231
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,370
they're saying is really, can I be the decision maker and hold you still

232
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:28,760
accountable? No. That's not what leadership is. All right. Shall we start the episode?

233
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,240
Sure. Okay, I'm gonna hit record. Just kidding. We wanted to continue our discussion from

234
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,560
the last episode on community. A couple topics on the board, but I'll let you

235
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:47,300
kick it off. So, because you have some notes Brent. Well, it's just the agenda.

236
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:52,900
Last time we started talking about community and building community and

237
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:59,940
Alan shared a lot of his experiences. But the question that was asked of us

238
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:07,740
was rather deep. There's a lot of subtlety there and we felt it was

239
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:16,990
worthwhile bringing it up again. I don't have the question written down, but in

240
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:24,560
essence the question was, hey how do I create a community when my target

241
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:30,640
audience is essentially testers who the person has observed don't see the

242
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:43,300
need, aren't engaged, and want to be spoon fed. And I think the prior topic

243
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,760
that we just had, well, it's not as much of a tangent on this one. Did we

244
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:53,280
accidentally talk about something relevant? We did. That's so weird. Yeah. So,

245
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:02,700
Alan, what are the problems that you see in constructing a community from

246
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,120
ground up? Like we did spend a lot of time talking about the vision of how you

247
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:15,670
build a community, right? You need to, and we talked about your approach, which we

248
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:21,370
resolved as essentially we want to shift from a spider organization to a starfish

249
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:26,230
organization. That's the vision. Now, today let's talk about the specific

250
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,270
context, the test community that he's referring to here, and what would

251
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:37,600
be the first step. So, I've spun up, we talked about my communities in Microsoft.

252
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,080
I've spun up several, without realizing it, without intending to, I spun up

253
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:51,230
several communities at Microsoft and then probably the best, as far as the

254
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,050
most mature community, as far as any sort of community maturity model is my QA

255
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:03,410
slash test community at Unity. But starting from scratch, you need a little

256
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:08,590
bit of a shared, like what is the purpose of the community? First, we have a nice

257
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,270
little mission statement you may have heard of at Unity, accelerate the

258
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:14,750
achievement at Shipable Quality. I have heard this mission statement a couple

259
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,670
times before. And it gives you a thing to rally around. And then, but even beyond

260
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:26,790
there, one thing I've done at Unity, I probably do this by heart, but maybe

261
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,270
three months in, about the time I was realizing it was a community, about

262
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,170
the time I knew enough about the org to want to develop some rallying cries for

263
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:41,940
us, I realized a couple points I wanted us to rally around. One is moving

264
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,980
towards data-driven culture. We will use data to evaluate the quality of our

265
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:50,420
product in production and use that to make decisions, get us close to the

266
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,820
customer, etc. The paragraph follows that. But everyone knows that's very,

267
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,420
very important. And I'm going to come back to something in a second. We will

268
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,000
share our successes and failures with each other and use those to learn and get

269
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,040
better. And that's pretty much it. And then I use the community, it's

270
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,800
self-fulfilling, because the second one's about community, but I use the

271
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,040
community to make that happen. And then there's some tactical things I've done

272
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,120
to help build that community. And I want to go back and reflect on this

273
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,800
process with some of my Microsoft communities as well. I think it'll be

274
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,560
fairly similar.

275
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:29,150
Let me change the scenario briefly, right? Because you have an advantage in this

276
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:35,420
particular case, because you're the boss, right? If you need to...

277
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,220
I thought you were going to say you're incredibly good looking, but I'll be

278
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:38,820
the boss, okay.

279
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,580
The last check that you sent me hasn't cleared yet, so there'll be no

280
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:54,240
compliments today. And when you have a role of authority, there

281
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,100
is absolutely an advantage, particularly if you know that this is your vision.

282
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:05,940
My job is to create this community and then get it self-sustained and get out.

283
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,340
So let me finish the Unity story. Then I'll go back and reflect on my

284
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,140
Microsoft communities, which in no case was I the boss of.

285
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,030
But also a scenario I want you to think about, and maybe it's aligned

286
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,230
with that second one, is let's imagine that Tony, who asked this

287
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,930
question, hired you to be a community consultant.

288
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:26,610
Okay.

289
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,740
And you were going to go to his company, spend a week there, and create a

290
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,660
thriving community and then disappear.

291
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:34,700
A week.

292
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:40,520
So let me go through those scenarios in order. So let me finish the Unity

293
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,340
story. I found ways to reinforce community. And this is weird. I did not

294
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,900
come up with this idea myself, but the leads...

295
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,620
Beer.

296
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,800
My leads and I came up with this, mostly them. In fact, maybe all of them

297
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:58,980
at our offsite last August. We had talked a lot about community before them.

298
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,620
One of the things we've done, just sent out the 20th weekly newsletter yesterday.

299
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,020
And the newsletter is, in this case, it's sometimes, not always, it's

300
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:15,680
just something everyone needs to know. Like, or something about...

301
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,240
We ship your thing.

302
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,020
Here's our vision. Or no, because it's too many things going on. No.

303
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,820
I don't welcome new people. I don't say things shipped. A lot of the

304
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,500
initial newsletters were promoting something else we did for community,

305
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:30,260
was get everyone together from around the world in one spot for a

306
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,010
couple of days. That helped build community, helped get everybody on

307
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,370
the same page, get everybody in alignment on things.

308
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,850
A lot of times I just share articles, web articles about

309
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:46,570
software quality or about being data driven, about things that align

310
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,630
with our mission. And it adds some commentary and those are taking

311
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,510
off. I start getting replies like yesterday, I sent one out and today

312
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,590
I got, oh, you mentioned this. Have you seen these articles and some

313
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:01,350
really cool articles? So that was cool. What I try to do, I don't

314
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,590
do often enough yet, but remember my goal around sharing each other's

315
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,830
successes and failures. So I try to, and each one, I don't get

316
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:11,310
everyone, is to get someone to share something going on in their

317
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,190
team. Like, hey, I use this. The last one was last week, a guy on

318
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,840
my team put together, who's also occasionally one of the three.

319
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,620
He was playing with using Grafana to map out web errors,

320
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,560
50X errors from one of our websites and saw an interesting

321
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,220
number of 503s that shouldn't have been there. It's a static

322
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,640
web page. And he dug in and found out, oh, this is a bug.

323
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,820
And worse yet, it's a bug that could be exploited as a security

324
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,820
issue. So it was just a nice little issue of like, I'm going

325
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,980
to use this tool and I'm going to see what I discover. Ooh,

326
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,960
look, I discovered something bad. And then here I wrote this up

327
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,600
on this page in our wiki page on how you can do this yourself

328
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,920
and test your own stuff out. So it's really good for sharing

329
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,200
an experience of what you learned. And I like those things.

330
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,220
Those things help build community. So I do some things

331
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,980
like that. I make sure I celebrate in Slack, in our

332
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,940
company Slack, the things that people do that align with our

333
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,660
accelerate the achievement of a quality or moving towards

334
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,620
being more data driven.

335
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:16,000
Let me go back to Microsoft. I'll get to Tony eventually,

336
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,190
where I ran a couple of different communities. Some from

337
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,150
the beginning, some I joined and sort of took over. For some

338
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:26,350
reason, I've fallen back on writing newsletters because I

339
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:30,030
can do it very quickly. I enjoy writing. I can get

340
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,810
newsletters people like done. So when I was in engineering

341
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,110
excellence at Microsoft, I would send a monthly test

342
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,310
newsletter to all testers at Microsoft.

343
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,470
I don't remember a single one of those.

344
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:46,890
Yeah, thanks. And we started doing a newsletter with the

345
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,950
testing quality experts, quality and test experts

346
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,480
community. I would include like bug. It was just some

347
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,520
ways to get people interested as trying to grow, make

348
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,560
that community self-sustaining got partially there.

349
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,800
Eventually, someone took over the newsletter for me for

350
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,080
that community died when TCN died. And I also did that

351
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,240
much less frequently for the test architect group.

352
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:18,220
But an Xbox also had a weekly weekly every other week. We

353
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,320
did a frequent newsletter was that one was a lot of fun.

354
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,820
It worked. I had a lot of people contribute articles and

355
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,100
ideas for that. It was a way to share ideas, tools,

356
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,380
concepts across the org. I did one of my best April

357
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,540
Fool's newsletters was was in the Xbox org. I really

358
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,580
need to dig that up sometime. Really happy with that

359
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,150
problem. But it's just finding some ways to get people

360
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,950
together. It could be meetings. It could be events.

361
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:51,190
It could be beer. But finding a way to get to have

362
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,910
one you have a mission or vision, a thing you want to

363
00:29:53,910 --> 00:30:03,100
accomplish together and a way to encourage people to be a

364
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,420
part of that community contribute to the community

365
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:11,220
and leverage leverage people leverage the community to

366
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,420
grow. I think a community is a means to discover what

367
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,220
you don't know. You don't know. You also get out what

368
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,020
you put into the community. If you contribute and

369
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,980
share your ideas, you're probably going to find more

370
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,940
ideas that inspire you and help you create new ideas.

371
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,860
So a bunch of things I want to. OK. And then I'll go

372
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
on to what I do if I'm I'm a consultant for Tony.

373
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,580
But go ahead and add your your stuff. Yeah. And

374
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,340
it'll be good because I think it'll help frame your

375
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,500
next topic. So a lot of the communities that Alan

376
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,340
just mentioned. I was a member of one in particular.

377
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,940
I'm thinking about the test architect group. There

378
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:59,160
was one phenomenon that that that I noticed in

379
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,000
that whenever it was the scheduled day for the

380
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,980
community and Alan couldn't make it it got canceled.

381
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,190
Right. So part of the problem in this particular case

382
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:13,150
is Alan loves this stuff. He's very effective at it.

383
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,490
But he ended up being the virtual leader. And when

384
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:21,110
the leader wasn't there it didn't happen. And so

385
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:23,750
one of the things why I say self sustaining right

386
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,790
often is the goal. It's also saying is and one

387
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,990
of the things I would I would actually. So a couple

388
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,230
suggestions I have for you based off of the

389
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:34,750
experience and what you just described for me. OK.

390
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,930
Create a community of the newsletter producers and

391
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,890
your first task is say hey I want the newsletter

392
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,030
to go out every month. I want us to first figure

393
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,320
out what is the principles around how it's going

394
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,560
to be built because I want people to look at

395
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,440
that and not tell not be able to tell that it

396
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,480
was a different person sending them each month.

397
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,980
And then the next thing we're going to do is

398
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,760
figure out a rotational model. I was I will do

399
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,880
the first few of them until we are happy with

400
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,810
the iteration. But by the end of summer each of

401
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,330
you guys is going to is going to take point

402
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,850
and we're going to rotate through and you're

403
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,710
going to own sending this. What you have to do

404
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,870
is then use that command and control to force

405
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,870
them to learn and to spread the next phase

406
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:37,300
after that is how do you get them to want to

407
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:42,020
maintain the rotational model. It would take

408
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,740
longer than two podcasts for me to go through

409
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,420
suggestions on that one. And I wouldn't even.

410
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,420
I'll build on that. The last thing I would suggest

411
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:58,580
to you is make a key section of your of your

412
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,380
newsletter. Are you sending out monthly weekly

413
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,720
weekly. OK. Make a key section of your weekly

414
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,600
newsletter. The most glorious fail that occurred

415
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,690
in your team and figure out a way to send that

416
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:20,130
person a gift card or some sort of little

417
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,010
incentive. Yeah I do agree that one thing we

418
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,850
could do more of is I mentioned in my my

419
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:29,890
principles is celebrate our successes and

420
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,000
failures. Actually both internally and publicly

421
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,720
I want to post more of what we're doing around

422
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,120
quality and. You know services on the unity

423
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,440
blog and we're getting there. But we don't

424
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,240
celebrate the failures enough and we I do

425
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,920
want to do more of that and it's harder to

426
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,640
get people of course to to recognize those

427
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,920
and thankfully we're not making very many epic

428
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,720
failures. So that's good but yes I agree

429
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,960
those things should be there. I agree that I

430
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,000
want to add. No it's my turn now. And I also

431
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,320
agree that. You do want a community of people

432
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,190
distributing the newsletter. And I do agree you

433
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:08,630
want to have a group of people that can send

434
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,790
the newsletter. Kicking it off here for the

435
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,110
first several months. I've been happy to do it

436
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,470
I think it's the right thing for me to do it

437
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,150
to establish a cadence to prove we can do it

438
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:19,750
weekly to prove that we can get value from that.

439
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,790
I'm stepping away next week and people are no

440
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:25,990
problem. Stepping in and making sure there's a

441
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,590
newsletter done while I'm gone and eventually

442
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,210
they will contribute more more. They actually

443
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,770
all contribute the article ideas. They they

444
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:38,010
they get ideas for articles from their team and

445
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,320
I play editor. A lot of times. And sometimes

446
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
for light on stuff I have no problem just

447
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,080
kind of writing a little mini blog post about

448
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,280
because I read a lot of articles on the

449
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,200
Internet that I find this to be interesting for

450
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,040
the team. Let me add a little commentary to

451
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,400
get them engaged in it and explain why it's

452
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,800
relevant to our mission. And then they are

453
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,360
pretty good about jumping in and getting some

454
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,720
new ideas. You want to say something I want to

455
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,560
talk about what I do for Tony's team. If I'm

456
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,860
his consultant. Go ahead. Talk about Tony. OK

457
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,580
Tony hires me to come in to help me build the

458
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,860
community. I don't come into Tony's team and

459
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,820
say OK I'm going to give you a newsletter.

460
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:17,240
That you only have a week. I have a week. So

461
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,240
the first thing I want to do is find out from

462
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,800
Tony what's the goal of your community. We

463
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,840
get paid six months later after they seem the

464
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,160
result. Fine fine. All right. Good fine. I want

465
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,680
to find out what. I would start with why. What

466
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,800
do you want to accomplish. What's the reason

467
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,810
for having a community. And I'm going to

468
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,930
hypothesize that it's we have a lot of silo

469
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,290
ism people aren't we have people working on

470
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,650
the same things because they don't know what

471
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,530
each other are working on. We're not people

472
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,330
aren't learning as much as they could if they

473
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,650
had a way to connect with each other. I say

474
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,690
OK great. So let's come up with a. What's

475
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,010
the mission of the goal for the community. And

476
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:59,170
maybe it's we want given that criteria. We

477
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:01,290
want to have a means of discovering what we

478
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,890
don't know we don't know. And maybe we'll work.

479
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,730
I'll work with Tony a little bit. This is all

480
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,330
like over coffee in the morning. We'll come up

481
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:10,420
with. As a test community of practice at

482
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,160
Rungco widget factory. We want to share ideas

483
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,920
with each other and use those ideas to develop

484
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,600
bigger ideas that help us accelerate the

485
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,680
achievement of quality or help us achieve our

486
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,160
quality goals or help us whatever have a purpose

487
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,080
for community have and something that's

488
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,360
compelling and you think if I told people that

489
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,160
the sum I think they go yeah that's something

490
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,270
that we should do. I would start with that. And

491
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,660
then I would meet maybe team by team depending

492
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,620
on the org how big the org is now structured

493
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,220
is I want to get some information from people

494
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,740
on what their biggest challenges are and are

495
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,100
their challenges being with their challenges be

496
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,500
addressed by this community or would some of

497
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,260
their challenges be addressed by this community

498
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:01,460
and find out if the community idea makes sense

499
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,500
for solving their problems. Chances are it will.

500
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,870
But I don't know that I don't want to. Last thing

501
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,470
you want to do is think OK we got to really

502
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,470
push this community thing when it's not the

503
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:15,670
biggest problem. Eventually community a

504
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,910
community of practice if you will at a small

505
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,550
scale. Someone pointed out an article this week

506
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,470
on communities of practice I was talking about

507
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,910
communities at a very very large scale which I

508
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,070
think is a different beast entirely. So within a

509
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,470
company that a small organization this community

510
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,990
of practice can help solve a lot of problems. So

511
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,910
anyway I've talked to people talk to some

512
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,750
people on maybe maybe people that aren't even

513
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,350
going to be in the community say what do you

514
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,550
expect if we had a community of the testers

515
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,990
in this or what would you expect that

516
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,750
community to accomplish that they're not

517
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,470
accomplished now and chances are if community is

518
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,350
an issue they've seen things like well I talked

519
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,910
to Joe and Cindy and they're both working on

520
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,950
the same thing but they don't know they've

521
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,480
there's no desire for them to connect and learn

522
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,540
from each other. So once I have all that. Can

523
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,740
you talk briefly. Because I think our listeners

524
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,060
know very well we we care very much about

525
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,530
learning organizations. But we've also spent a

526
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,370
lot of time this episode and the last episode

527
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,810
sort of framing community as something that is

528
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,460
inherently valuable and I don't think it is. I

529
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:32,740
think community is a means to an end. Sure. So why

530
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,860
would the business care about you building a

531
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,620
community. The business cares about continuous

532
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:42,740
improvement and I think the business cares

533
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,900
whether they know it's called this or not a

534
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,970
learning organization. I think the business cares

535
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:54,420
that about efficiency and I think the business

536
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,020
cares about results. The last one community

537
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,300
helps indirectly but everything else community

538
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:06,670
helps directly. The community helps. I think it

539
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,850
helps directly for results. Yeah. I think the

540
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:17,380
biggest reason to form a community is to create

541
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,100
a means by which people don't know what they

542
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,260
don't know. OK. So community solves a knowledge

543
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,690
sharing problem. If you if you're a bit you run a

544
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,250
business and you realize that there is rampant

545
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,770
duplication of effort you have two choices.

546
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:37,150
Generally allow it to continue and let your

547
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,230
leaders run their business as they see fit.

548
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:45,390
Build a central centralized organization that's

549
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,750
going to be responsible for this duplication of

550
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:51,750
effort and force everyone else. I call that the

551
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:56,790
WTF model. Windows test framework but a community

552
00:39:56,790 --> 00:40:00,230
is no less. It's more of an in between when it

553
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,270
comes to business results. I realize as I we've

554
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:08,400
been talking that I wonder if this community

555
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,960
evolved for me over time and I wonder if

556
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,480
starting with the idea of I need to build the

557
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,480
community isn't what I in my consultant role at

558
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,280
Tony's org isn't what I do. I would actually focus

559
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,680
on. I would do everything I did before but I may

560
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,160
leave after I talked to everyone leave Tony a list

561
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,520
of here's some things you could do on your team

562
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,960
that would help grow community potentially. But

563
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,920
I maybe you have to plant a bunch of seeds to

564
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,800
get the nucleus of the community going versus

565
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,920
going. We're just going to start a community.

566
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,080
Let me give you an example going way back. You

567
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,200
reminded me that around the turn of the century

568
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,920
seriously when I was working on starting with

569
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,600
Windows Millennium and then moving on to Windows

570
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,240
CE when I again actually I was a lead back then.

571
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,600
So I had a fairly large org. One of the things I

572
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,040
did was a weekly it started off as a group code

573
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,680
review ended up being sort of show and tell and

574
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,640
it isn't the kind of code review where you'd

575
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,920
look at every single line and the kind we do

576
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,720
day to day pure code review. This was more of

577
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,320
a group show and tell where we'd sometimes

578
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,440
mostly walk through code like here's architecture

579
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,000
of how I built this thing or here's how it's

580
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,520
working. That knowledge sharing a lot of it was oh

581
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,800
there's a DLL that does this thing you're doing

582
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,680
or don't you find some more big sweeping things

583
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,680
those great opportunity for learning and

584
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,680
sharing. But sometimes I had PM's on my team at

585
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,000
the time program managers and they would go

586
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,360
over more conceptual things they're working on

587
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,720
like here's the way this framework is going

588
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,280
to work. We had a CE test kit we gave developers

589
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,120
and a PM on my team in charge of that and you

590
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,120
talk about the direction and what it was going to

591
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:53,160
do for our customers etc. But that show and tell

592
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,280
we had a community again I was in charge ish but

593
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,680
that even that was a form of community. So I'm

594
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,840
going to leave Tony with is based on the

595
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,880
problems there from his team. I'm going to

596
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,920
look for ways where knowledge sharing may

597
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,520
help and I might start right with knowledge

598
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,120
sharing. You should do this group code review

599
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,360
thing just get people doing it get it regular. I

600
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,560
think people will latch onto it. It could be

601
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,440
maybe we're going to do a test talk once a month

602
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,160
and some someone or maybe it's Tony starting at

603
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,240
first. We'll see if we get a few people signed up

604
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,920
that have some good ideas and we'll get them

605
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,240
to once a month talk for a half hour we'll

606
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,400
bring in some snacks get people connecting and

607
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,480
maybe a list of things that may help build

608
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,640
community but maybe not even start with the

609
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,370
goal of community because communities the means

610
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,210
to an end on becoming a learning organization

611
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,490
on getting ideas to mesh and learning new ideas.

612
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:49,700
But I think if I had a week to kind of get

613
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,340
things going I would and I'm going to be

614
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,180
evaluated on how things are going in six months.

615
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,180
I'm going to give Tony a fairly tactical list

616
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,580
of here do these things for the next six

617
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,860
months. It should take a fairly minimal amount

618
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,780
of effort. It's going to take some effort. And

619
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,810
let's see what's in the sea what builds over

620
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,550
that time. Sure. Sure. I mean the

621
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,160
value I would add to that I think I'll tell

622
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,240
you the one thing that I've learned from Google

623
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,560
and I've still not seen Microsoft do this. Tony

624
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,920
talks about testers aren't engaged because they

625
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,920
don't see the value and what you had to do is

626
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,920
boil the frog here and find ways to get

627
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,960
people to see the value on their own without

628
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,600
you telling them. And I didn't say that directly.

629
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,640
One of the reasons I want to talk to the

630
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,760
individuals on the team find out what they're

631
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,800
interested in what would engage them and make

632
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,160
sure we have. I think if you might see someone

633
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,320
is unengaged until you find the topic they

634
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,400
care about the topics they care about and all

635
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,600
of a sudden they have an opinion. Yes. Like the

636
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:06,510
biggest problem with siloism is since your

637
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:09,670
siloed you don't know what other people know.

638
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,470
And I can guarantee you in any organization of

639
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:20,830
sufficient size there are two people working on

640
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,790
similar things that would prefer to work

641
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,420
together to get it done faster. And the more you

642
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,860
can use find those folks and get them connected

643
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,140
and working together towards a common goal.

644
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,120
That's your seed. You just need two people.

645
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,870
Two people to use as an in-house case study and

646
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:49,310
motivate them to succeed. Google does this

647
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,390
practice. I don't know if they still do it but

648
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:54,860
the weekly status report as I understand it

649
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,540
everyone in Google every day or every Friday

650
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:01,540
writes a status report. You and it goes into a

651
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:05,860
public index. I love this idea. Which is then

652
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:09,780
searchable. It's searchable. I people can go

653
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:12,180
how many other people are working on a similar

654
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,460
concept. Now you don't use terms like duplication

655
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,340
of effort because that's jurisdiction and

656
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,700
command and control and gets people defensive.

657
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,700
You cannot build a community of defensive people.

658
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,030
It's just impossible. But you can encourage and

659
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:31,870
say hey maybe you guys can learn from each

660
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,790
other or maybe you guys could kill this

661
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:40,810
faster. One my particular team highly values

662
00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:45,250
knowledge sharing because I started off with

663
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,610
pushing command and control. No you will write

664
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:49,730
this doc. You will put it in one note. You will

665
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,290
blah blah blah. And then they would discover

666
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,450
like oh crap I had to fix this bug. I didn't

667
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,750
write this code. Thank God. One note had

668
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,950
documented who did it. What their approach was

669
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,070
and what they're thinking. I could go and search

670
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:10,070
one note and I got the answer immediately and I

671
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,670
saw it and they knew it's that knowledge sharing

672
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,190
actually had just saved them five hours of

673
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:20,760
searching through get. So you start small and

674
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,960
you begin to break down those barriers and

675
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,080
that's how you get engagement going. I like

676
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,600
the status report idea because it's then it's

677
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:35,380
very easy to go. It's just scale and figure out

678
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:40,860
which people have sort of a similar bent on

679
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:47,360
topics of interest. The there is a great book on

680
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:52,260
this topic. It's called influencer how to

681
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,420
change anything. And it goes through and it

682
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,060
talks about a very tactical set of steps that

683
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,780
they've done studies on. And if you follow the

684
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:09,020
steps it's a complex framework once you've

685
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,100
practiced it a couple of times. I have deployed

686
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:18,060
it multiple times. It is extremely effective.

687
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:24,420
Their answers or rather their numbers show that

688
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,580
it's a greater than 90 percent success rate in

689
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:32,410
terms of executing a change. Influencer how to

690
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:34,810
change anything again is the title of the book.

691
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,840
If I'm fine good I'll put a link in but the rest

692
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,550
you know how to use a search engine. Yep. To build

693
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,750
a community you have to address simultaneously

694
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,590
the extrinsic value. Why you're building a

695
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,350
community. What what problem for the business is

696
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:55,650
going to always start with why. And you also have

697
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:00,130
to address the intrinsic value. Why is. All right.

698
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,210
I'm going to build the community because I think

699
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,360
Alan and Steve need to knowledge share and that

700
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,640
the business is going to benefit be more productive.

701
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,040
That's not a very good why. No. But you also have

702
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,560
to address why Alan and Steve care. How you're

703
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,040
going to get what's what's their motivation.

704
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,460
What are they going to get out of it. And if

705
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,180
you have a model and an approach that addresses

706
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,980
both of these concerns and it's going to be very

707
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,540
context sensitive. You can move forward. You know

708
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:39,320
that it's a test community. If I were going into

709
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,000
doing a test community I would start on something

710
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,600
very tactical probably on the topic of modern

711
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,520
testing like Alan's got this webinar. Hey check

712
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:54,230
out this cool machine learning test case. I just

713
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:57,670
spent last week and did your team's entire job

714
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,990
using this tool. Yes I agree. Yeah. Find a way

715
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,390
to get people engaged and think but first think

716
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,830
about the problem you really want to solve and

717
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,670
understand why building a community if that's your

718
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:10,830
goal or what are the ways that will solve that

719
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,030
problem. But always start with why. What are you

720
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,830
going to do with it. And then of course make

721
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:17,670
sure people are engaged understand why it's

722
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:22,710
important for them. We are out of time. I am

723
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:27,740
still Alan. And I am Brent. Thank you. We'll see

724
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:28,820
you next time. Bye.
