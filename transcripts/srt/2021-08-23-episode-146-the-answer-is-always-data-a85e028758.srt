00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:11,620
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:19,360
Topics on testing leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show. Hey everyone

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,190
I'm Alan and Brent's not here. I decided as threatened

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:27,850
Previously on a podcast that if Brent wasn't here on time

5
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,530
I would just start without him and you could hear just how bad a solo podcast can be

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,690
Got a couple good topics lined up today. None of them have anything to do with sports nor politics nor the weather

7
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,290
I don't think all I want to say is Covid is not a political thing despite the fact that

8
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,450
Far too many people see it as such, you know, my preference is that everyone gets vaccinated

9
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,710
I know there are some people that don't want to for various reasons

10
00:00:54,710 --> 00:01:00,490
What I do ask is that for everyone look past the misinformation that's out there find out what's right for you

11
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,630
but please be careful and

12
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,110
realize that this is a real thing and

13
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,390
That it does get people sick and just do your best to be careful

14
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,650
Put some effort into being careful to make sure you're not being part of the spread of this and then maybe someday that light

15
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,510
At the end of the tunnel will begin to come back into view again

16
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,050
All right. Well, let's get on Brent's gonna get on here

17
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,570
He's gonna go blah blah blah and talk about stuff

18
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,210
I'm gonna make fun of him a little bit and then we get going with the podcast

19
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,250
But I do have somewhere an agenda for today

20
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,990
And I may as well start without him and we'll catch him up when he gets here

21
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,110
the first thing is I

22
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:48,950
Think it was the last podcast within the last few we talked about the wasn't the last one for sure. Oh, hey Brent's here

23
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:56,190
Brand I've already pressed record. I started the podcast without you. Welcome to the welcome to the A B testing podcast Brent

24
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:01,470
Thank you, Alan. I thought maybe we could do just one more without you. This is oh

25
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:10,350
Anyway, let's pause. I can go right back into where I was because Brent knows my agenda. How's it going? I will survive I

26
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,910
will survive

27
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,110
Things are a foot

28
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,590
That will have a negative impact on my life

29
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,070
That I am not quite ready to share publicly on the podcast

30
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,570
Understood understood as much as we do leave a lot of things out there Brett and I both leave a few

31
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,230
Things to our private lives so I get that we can chat about that a little at the end if we have time

32
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,790
So yeah, that sucks. Um

33
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,830
Already talked about kovat. You missed that. Oh

34
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,030
Did you yeah any I'm not gonna add anything else. Do you have any short?

35
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,830
Statements you want to make about the current surge in Delta variants, etc

36
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,310
No

37
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:59,870
The Delta the Delta variant surge concerns me far less than what's happening with Afghanistan. I

38
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:05,190
Think it wise for us to just skip over the political

39
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,670
I will just say this I'll just say I won't mention anything specifically and we'll move on between

40
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,290
everything going on

41
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,650
sometimes even

42
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:23,580
Optimistic Alan has to wonder if the end of the world is coming. That's all I have to say about that

43
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,900
Yeah, so, um, yeah, let's talk about stuff about the podcast. We have a podcast and

44
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,770
What's interesting about this podcast is called modern testing Brent and I are two old people

45
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,050
So we're not that modern and we don't really talk about testing very much, but we do and we will today

46
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,170
We talk about a lot about

47
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,810
Agile and agile flavors and we talk a lot about

48
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,910
How to improve quality? In fact, I would say I can safely say that Brent and I care

49
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,210
Deeply about quality but not so much about testing

50
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:09,660
No, no testing. I don't understand why we would talk so much about testing since it is clearly Dev's job

51
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,620
Alright, you got to stop chewing and bang on your desk just saying that but you're right

52
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,860
Oh, and I I want to read now I threw with Chatham House rules

53
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,620
I'm not this so this is so another slack I'm on says

54
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,910
And I'm gonna breaker. I'm gonna try not to break a rule by paraphrasing. See if I can find the channel here

55
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,590
someone was asking about

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,720
QA teams, I'm not gonna mention the slack or the people and I'm gonna paraphrase

57
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,680
I think I'm I think I'm gonna be okay here then cuz I'm not outing anybody

58
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,440
But someone was asking about how QA works at different orgs. This is a

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,440
Cross company industry slack. That's as far as I'll go and what's interesting is all of the replies in this thread

60
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,810
Saying we don't have QA, but we do lots of testing these people these and the thing is with modern testing

61
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,530
We're describing what's already happening in the world. These people haven't been

62
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,250
indoctrinated by modern testing

63
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,330
They're doing this because it's the right thing to do

64
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,410
Response to that is same here. No dedicated QA

65
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,650
Teams own entire services also on the testing of that service someone else says for what it's worth for us

66
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,650
It's similar to what they said

67
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,730
The function of QA is owned by engineering

68
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,810
There is no dedicated QA team three people three different companies

69
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,970
Somebody else says QA is a skill set and present on every team or I work so it says QA

70
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:38,210
What's QA and then in parentheses says engineers write automated tests and do manual aggression testing and it goes on and on and on

71
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,450
It's a long thread and there's good discussion on it, too

72
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,850
I don't want to go into that but this is something

73
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,330
This is a thread like you expect to see on one of the three dot slack comm plug

74
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,970
You can go to modern testing org enjoying that but to see this pop up

75
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,830
The thing we're talking about with modern testing

76
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,930
It's happening frickin everywhere and a lot of people are just blind to it and it bugs me

77
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,930
So here is my question

78
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,890
Two and I think I've asked this before to our listeners and by the way if you're listening to this podcast

79
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,450
Thank you

80
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:18,850
I don't really know who would but you're cool and I like you and I appreciate you listening because it just blows me away that

81
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:24,090
About a thousand of you a month listen every month and go. Hey, I'm gonna do this again in two more weeks

82
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,720
I I

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,880
Feel like there's a chunk and maybe it's the title of the podcast which are not gonna change

84
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,720
But I feel like there's a chunk of people who would benefit from this podcast a big chunk that we're not reaching

85
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,750
And I don't know how to reach them

86
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,650
Actually, I do have some ideas, but I'm gonna pause there. How do we reach?

87
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:50,010
First you agree with me. Is there a chunk of people that were not reaching that would find this beneficial and then part two

88
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:54,230
If so, what are some ways you can think of that we should reach those folks?

89
00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,450
So there absolutely is a chunk right all you have to all you have to do to prove that

90
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:08,670
And you in particular can do this. I'm not certain I can but you in particular good. All you have to do is go to Twitter and

91
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:15,410
Just just copy paste one of the principles in particular like principle five like even today

92
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,230
Maybe that could be a heuristic when Alan

93
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:26,110
Quarterly will will copy paste principle five into his Twitter feed and then we just count how many hate responses

94
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,910
Alan gets and and see if that starts to temper down, you know, I should do it

95
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,790
I should just post a principle a week and I should probably do some more

96
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:44,510
Conferences but not test conferences and talk about the podcast there. I never really fully made that transition

97
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,830
I was kind of in the process of it and then

98
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:53,810
Then Covid so that's something else like I should really I'm gonna actually put that into my to-do list here

99
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:01,510
Speaking of actual dev or DevOps conference and I may have to start over like I got so lazy with test conferences

100
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,610
I get at least a request a week to speak at some test conference

101
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,450
I say no to almost all of them, but it's easy. Oh, that one's cool

102
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,090
Or I like that, you know ministry of testing looking at you. I like you. I'll always when you ask I'll always do it

103
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:19,970
Right. Honestly, I'm I'm a little bit in the echo chamber there and I probably just need especially now things are remote

104
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,970
I don't have to travel I

105
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:29,130
Should probably just actually go through the old-school process of applying to speak at some dev conferences and just talk about

106
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,970
Quality cultures whatever I probably a lot of things I could talk about but we yeah

107
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,830
Even some modern testing a B testing stuff. I'm actually wondering like based on what you just said

108
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,150
I'm wondering if that's even needed

109
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,390
Right because if you talk about Devco things like the stats that you just shared

110
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,660
I mean, it's not really stats. It's it's sort of a small sample set

111
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,300
essentially

112
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:03,140
The universe is moving on in the direction that we've been talking about for who knows how many friggin years now

113
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,140
It might already be past the tipping right it we've had conversations

114
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,700
We have we've had conversations around

115
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
How big is the bubble we're in?

116
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,880
Right in and now I'm actually wondering. Okay are are are we actually in the bubble or

117
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,040
We just think we're in the bubble because we have

118
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,440
We're bumping up against the bubble

119
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,280
But are we the ones that are in it or is it is it the traditionalists that are now in the bubble and that bubble?

120
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,500
shrinking because as

121
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,780
Like I'm seeing over and over again that the world is in fact not functioning

122
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,960
The way it did 20 years ago. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

123
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,840
It's actually segues really well into the first topic how long we've been talking about this

124
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,720
Well, we didn't know what modern testing was

125
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,680
We don't were sure exactly what we were gonna talk about when the podcast formed very early on like in the first

126
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,840
Few episodes we began talking about the ways which this works we explored it

127
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,120
We talked about it as I was learning sort of how to make that transition myself

128
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,240
But then five years ago, which I got a note in Twitter that five years ago

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Someone asked me about what I thought the future of test was actually asked about ten people what they thought the future of test

130
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,280
was and

131
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,920
Because Covid has blurred it. I thought blurred time. I

132
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,200
Thought five years ago. Jeez, what was I was that Xbox? When was that?

133
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,160
And no five years ago was towards the end of my time at Microsoft

134
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,360
I've been at Unity now about four and a half years actually a little bit more

135
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,840
But they asked me five years ago. What was the question? The question I was asked five years ago was

136
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,850
Blah blah blah preface preface. What will software development look like in one three or five years?

137
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,930
How will that impact testing approaches?

138
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:03,890
I guess I chose five and I'll skip all the other people that my answer is actually in hindsight is contradictory

139
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,690
because I said at first I said

140
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,970
Nothing super different

141
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:16,890
I expect that more companies even those not shipping weekly or more often will still move toward more agile ish engineering approaches

142
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,330
Smaller aeration smaller batches build measure learn data collection and analysis will also continue to grow in importance and use I

143
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,250
think I wrote that from a little bit of a bubble because those things have definitely taken off and

144
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:35,770
Maybe I assumed there was more of those around than I thought from a Microsoft bubble bit outside. Definitely see more of that stuff

145
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,250
Also said to me. It means more teams forget about what to call people

146
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,800
Integrated or unified engineering teams become more of the norm and dedicated test teams become rarer and rarer

147
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,680
I think I nailed that one

148
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,600
The good testers will be fine on those teams as I expect is more teams move in this direction

149
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,440
They recognize the need for a quality specialist among an engineering team

150
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,600
So I feel like we're seeing more and more of that this idea of a test coach

151
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,840
Which I had been doing for a while at that time is almost mainstream

152
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,310
Mm-hmm. I said, I don't know that any of that changes testing approaches and even five years ago

153
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:19,510
I said software developers are certainly capable of writing good unit functional integration tests and more and they'll be doing a lot more of

154
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,780
This and if you recall a few months ago and I wrote an article talking about how they could do this the hate I took

155
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,780
About well our developers don't want to do that and I'm better at it. So I should do it anyway, etc

156
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:37,740
Etc, but all this stuff is happening and I think it was it was pretty much I didn't take a risk in the prediction

157
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:43,260
I don't think you I still so I didn't I didn't take a risk at all. All these things I think were pretty well

158
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,060
predictable and

159
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,580
In hindsight, I'm a little surprised we haven't moved even farther

160
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,260
I think sometimes we think five years is a long long time for change big changes to happen across the industry

161
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,780
But they just don't go like that. So we could I could be well well into retirement and

162
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,980
sipping a

163
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,560
senior special my tie at a beach somewhere watching the

164
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,390
planet burn and

165
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:18,470
There will still be somebody spinning up a test automation team totally disconnected from the dev team so they can do their automated freakin checking

166
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,720
Yeah, actually I'm looking at the website I do think their predictions are spot-on

167
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,400
I notice that other people in here like Jerry Weinberg's in here. I miss Jerry I do too

168
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,900
I don't want to I'm trying to scan it and it's not

169
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,100
For the listeners because I probably forget to put a link in the show notes because I'm freaking lazy

170
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,940
My five for Friday today does include a link to this you can check it out there

171
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,300
And then merit had a really good follow-up approach merit who was on episode. I'm gonna guess

172
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,780
128

173
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,980
Somewhere last year wrote a blog post about following up on her predictions and and you know, I feel a little I have to say

174
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,380
When someone who's English is a second language emeritus a self-professed polyglot

175
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,380
She she speaks and write several languages

176
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:17,580
She writes better than I do as a native English speaker and it's just I don't say intimidated

177
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,140
I'm not sure what the word is how I feel about that, but it's I feel

178
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,460
Definitely impressive and awesome and I feel a little like why can't I be a better writer?

179
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,780
I bet she's very prolific too and she practices but she's really good

180
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,820
I read all of her blog articles and this one particularly good. So unplanned plug go merit

181
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,020
Yeah, I'm looking like it's interesting. I'd like to see her follow up

182
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,040
Yeah, it's also also in my five for Friday link so you can check that out and then Bach is in here as well

183
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,520
Yep, everybody has lots of I love it. Look got lots of opinions, but worth talking about today

184
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,620
I wanted to bring that up what happens in the next five years. What do you think?

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Is it just more of the same? What's something I'm gonna ask you is on the spot

186
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,880
What's something that's gonna happen in the next couple of years? You don't have to time bound it

187
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,380
that

188
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,140
People may find surprising. What's something that you think?

189
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,980
May happen in the next couple of years one to three to five years that maybe a lot of people aren't expecting

190
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:24,260
Yeah, you know what this I'm suffering a

191
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:31,160
A flashback because I feel like we've done this on the podcast. Well, we do our we do our prediction episode

192
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:38,140
Like I I'm actually seriously thinking are we now on the on the path to

193
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,620
To start developing the postmodern testing principle. No, no, I think next five years

194
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,200
My I definitely see momentum continuing in this direction

195
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:58,360
Because I do think I do think what is the there was this one book that Al Shalloway talked to me about

196
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Right, but it's essentially

197
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,240
We're now talking about things that are mainstream not we're not on the leading edge with them

198
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,400
MTP not at all when we started talking about this we were we were kind of more on the leading edge

199
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,600
Cuz we were observing and when I first talked about it at test bash a couple years ago

200
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,520
When we first heard the public talk about it, I actually used I used the what's the curve?

201
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Yeah

202
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,000
The the the pace of innovation curve, which is actually from somebody else's work

203
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,240
But anyway, I showed that modern testing was out towards the front

204
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,840
But it's not it's not totally mainstream, but it's definitely to the big part of the curve. It's not a bizarre idea

205
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,120
There's too many people

206
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,680
There's too many people doing things we describe as modern testing without even knowing what the hell modern testing is and that's fine

207
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,720
It's absolutely fine. And then what I'm saying is it's far more mainstream today than it was when we started

208
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Working on what are the principles?

209
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,280
Conversation I just reading from another slack where oh, yeah

210
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,400
devs owning this stuff and understanding they can and teams being data driven and

211
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,600
Shipping in small chunks to get feedback from customers all that stuff is happening. Yeah

212
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,440
so the thing is like in the context of testing or in

213
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,640
automated

214
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Checking I

215
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:28,040
As you already covered, I don't know what's happening on the front the front lines of that. I'm sure things are

216
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
But in terms of testing or checking

217
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Honestly, I don't care. Oh, yeah

218
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,040
That's so far outside. I don't want to get into that stuff. I've kind of decided that with

219
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,880
With checking versus testing with if you find value in it, but what the heck go ahead

220
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:53,720
I don't but that's me you be you know, but in terms of in in terms of the question you asked like the prediction

221
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,680
I mean, maybe you have a better one. Yeah

222
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:02,440
Well nobody's what I'm basically saying is I don't think I'm currently in a position where I would be able to actually

223
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,440
Sort of say put my finger in the air and say what's coming next as it relates to testing

224
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
Right. Oh, yeah, it's a release of quality

225
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,120
Yeah, let's let's let's have that discussion. But as it relates to testing, I don't have that visibility

226
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,780
It's it's it's out of my life. Yeah

227
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
Yeah

228
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:31,260
Where where we came from before it was still very much in both of our lives and we had seen much better

229
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,820
Techniques and and and actually even experienced them and rolled them out. We were definitely

230
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,820
Coming from a point of experience and we developed the the MTP. Yeah. Yeah

231
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:52,900
So I want to pause you there because everything is segueing so well and I want to jump in at the segue point

232
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,500
Okay, you don't know how these things segue I send because

233
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,420
There was a time when Brent and I would both contribute to a bolded list

234
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:07,100
We prioritize but Brett now phones in the podcast and I send them a list and tell them what we're talking about in advance

235
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
But going from there

236
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
I've been listening to

237
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,780
The testing peers podcast and you should check it out

238
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:20,420
It's they get three or four people to talk about I have a nice conversation about different things around testing. I like it

239
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,560
There is the one before last they actually brought up principle number five and they didn't poo-poo it

240
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,800
They said they said oh, yeah that makes sense. It fit in with their thoughts that ultimately the customer

241
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,360
The customer determines what quality is which goes back to something I wrote in an article which is I think is worth

242
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Again, I just kind of tweet these little sound bites more often to get people thinking about what we do here with modern testing

243
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:49,280
But the point I brought up in that article and I'm all over the place

244
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,680
Gotta loop it all in and meanwhile my dog decides she wants to play just brought her toy so she could play while I talk

245
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,800
That's gonna be fun. Somebody in that podcast this last one

246
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,080
Said made the statement. We're talking about quality

247
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,320
They said well at least nobody brought up that quality is conformance to requirements

248
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,420
Actually, I believe that quality is conformance to requirements

249
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:15,400
But only the customer can define those requirements not some PM somewhere, right?

250
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:22,000
And if you put that twist on it all of a sudden, yeah Crosby's right quality is conformist to requirements. So ha

251
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,760
Anyway, they that was the one about quality this last one. They did a cool thing

252
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,400
I don't want to steal their bit entire like as an ongoing thing, but I'm gonna steal it today

253
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:39,360
I'm gonna tell you what they did talk about one of the conversations they had and then we're gonna do it ourselves

254
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,240
You have no idea what any of that means. I'm gonna walk you through it

255
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,960
It's kind of like when you're playing one of those complicated games for the first time you have no idea what to do. So

256
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,880
Let me talk about test sphere. Have you seen test sphere cards?

257
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,840
No, these are from ministry of testing

258
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,760
They're super freaking cool and what they are is a bunch of cards and different kinds of topics

259
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,360
and I just have the standard set here and

260
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,300
Just discussion starters around quality and testing. I can't find the exact card. I may not have it

261
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,440
They have like a because they're all cool. They have like a bonus deck full of stuff

262
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,340
But what they did is they kind of spun a wheel or they chose random cards to talk about it was pretty cool

263
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,840
but one thing they talked about and I know we've talked about this a long time in the past but

264
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,320
It's something that I'm you know serendipitously or coincidentally. I'm not even sure what the difference is

265
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,520
It's come up with me a couple times recently is they were talking about

266
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,680
Something about you creates a regression test for a bug that was found

267
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,280
Three years later. You're still running that regression test

268
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,540
Because once we especially with automated tests once we write them they run forever

269
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,240
These tests never the situation were that regression test you wrote that test for a bug that was in the product

270
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,640
It's impossible for it to happen again

271
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,760
You can't actually make that bug happen again because has something to do with like a particular version of Chrome

272
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,440
That's three years old or whatever and that regression test remains even though it provides no value

273
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,120
It can never actually find another bug some of those my words

274
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,960
One thing they didn't get to they talked about

275
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,600
They had a lot of things to talk about it

276
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,660
But one thing that doesn't get talked about enough in the industry is

277
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,820
Because I've been I've listened in on two or three of these things via Twitter and LinkedIn in this podcast

278
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:29,620
Is the idea of test selection this idea of specifically choosing certain tests to run in a certain situation and thus

279
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:33,410
choosing other tests not to run and I wonder if

280
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,500
Well one with developers writing the bulk or most or all of these tests

281
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,130
Do you think they'll fall into that same trap of running every regression test and ever release?

282
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:50,090
Will they be quicker to retire tests or the or will they do what I think you and I have both done in

283
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,410
The past and write a smart test selection engine to make sure they're selecting the proper tests for whatever they're changing

284
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:03,290
I think none of the above Oh better. What what happens? I think by the time that that becomes problematic

285
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,650
Right the the thing that's happened

286
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:13,270
What were the friends that we just talked to rocket? I think that that company I think by the time that matters

287
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:19,530
Actually, the tooling will improve to automatically do that. It'll become part of the tool

288
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:27,900
Right. So the one benefit that that the industry that the industry has in my view around test

289
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,500
That the the testing responsibility primarily be being shouldered by

290
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,980
Developer is as as I actually said in that podcast

291
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,150
developers are inherently lazy and

292
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:49,190
Of course with with with the the advent of cloud like one of the reasons that that

293
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,070
We had we had to do this test selection thing is because

294
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:57,030
like our our code

295
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,170
Depending on which team was doing it, right?

296
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,470
It had varying degrees of being able to parallelize

297
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,570
Everyone had like it back in the day. Everyone had labs and and

298
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,050
Those labs were of limited resources

299
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:17,690
So we had to go we ended up being forced to go to test selection because we our test pass had to complete by this date

300
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,930
We now had too many tests to run them all

301
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,090
Now and with the cloud the story is going to get changed

302
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,530
We're not going to hit the issue of having

303
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:35,290
Too few resources to run it because the the cloud offers sort of unlimited capacity

304
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,810
Well, I mean you still pay for that. You're still that's what I'm going to get to

305
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,450
but I compute

306
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,850
You pay for both commute and compute

307
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,370
That's where I was getting to like it becomes a new constraint and it's going to be it's the cost

308
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:55,050
So now actually test selection said turns into more of an roi statement. Okay

309
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,690
Given the cost of this test

310
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,570
What's the predicted value of the of the result of the test?

311
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,450
Cost is readily computable today

312
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,870
It's the the relative value of that that needs to be operationalized

313
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,750
And that to me is just a matter of time

314
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:17,390
my brain was spinning from the beginning when you said the tools were going to get there because

315
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,750
I'm tempted to quit my job today. I could I

316
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,070
I have done so much with test selection and I am so confident

317
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:29,230
I could write a generic thing that people could use to plug in and select tests based on

318
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,590
I mean, I just want to make my startup right now and make a test selection tool for the industry

319
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,750
Do you want to stop talking about it so that no i'm good i'm good

320
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:44,430
I'm probably that's not really going to happen because i'm i'm far too lazy to do that. I like the day-to-day challenges of

321
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,570
of

322
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,570
working at my current job, but

323
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,580
honestly if

324
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:57,420
You know that that's a there's a business there and I am happy to be i'm on the advisory board for one

325
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,100
Test automation company and so if you want to spin this up

326
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,900
Put me on your board and i'll just take some stock for me to help you make your billion dollar test selection business

327
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:13,980
Give me a ping because I I know i've done this multiple times. I know how to do it

328
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:18,060
I think I could make we could make it in a way that could be applied at multiple companies

329
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,540
Um, but yeah i'm available

330
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,820
But definitely on a board consulting type

331
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:30,060
Uh position more than quitting my day job because I like getting I like getting a twice a month paycheck

332
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,860
So yeah, yeah, but but again if you just have to share ideas and you know

333
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,200
Free money of any sort rolls in you know

334
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,400
net positive

335
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,000
Yes, so

336
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,080
What's interesting in the modern so that was?

337
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Listening then talk about it. It was cool because that came up

338
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,880
They never talked about test selection and I don't hear people talk about it enough

339
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,320
So they just wanted to plant that seed for all three of the listeners. So, uh, thanks for that

340
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,720
But it made me think it might be fun

341
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,640
today

342
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,760
To for me to randomly pick some of these cards here

343
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,240
Because what I found was this is not just like oh, I want to copy them

344
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,280
What I found was for every question they asked

345
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,560
They were answering it like a I don't want to say a traditional tester

346
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,360
But more like you'd expect a tester to answer it and not the way you and I would answer it

347
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh picking up what i'm laying down

348
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,880
Yeah

349
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,880
So this is not quite traditional

350
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,480
I mean we could do this and we could do the traditional manager versus agile manager

351
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,880
But we're not going to do that or modern modern test manager

352
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,360
I do want to pick a couple random cards

353
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,000
And i'll actually random within a

354
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,520
A subset so there's some blue cards which are quality aspects. There's green cards which techniques

355
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,800
Probably do one of a couple of these see if we can do it

356
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:54,360
I grabbed a quality aspects card, which is blue and what they do is they have a statement at the top and then some

357
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:59,400
Supporting statements below and we'll just kind of see where this takes us. And if it's done, we'll talk about something else

358
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,200
This one is the usability aspect

359
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,840
Will users find the product convenient and easy to work with but more important will they enjoy it?

360
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
Hey, I picked a principle five call card

361
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,320
And the state supportive statements below are what makes an app attractive speed ease of use reliability question mark

362
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,520
Are the most important features available in the middle of your screen?

363
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,840
Have your app. I track tested to find out people easily find what they're looking for

364
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,440
Some things are intrusive yet. People love them. For example the group on space cat logo. I haven't seen it

365
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:33,160
This makes your app unique identify memorable

366
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,680
So i'm gonna go back to the top and have you answer this from a eric reese modern testing point of view

367
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,240
Okay, how do you know if users are finding the product convenient and easy to work with?

368
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,060
well, my my my

369
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,980
50 000 level answer is that they are the

370
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,500
They are showing that they are solving the problem

371
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:59,020
That they're solving problems with it with a ui app

372
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,300
I think the way I would look at it is

373
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,280
Is from a kpi standpoint and I would look at uh, what's called the dow mau

374
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,800
uh

375
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,480
Uh equation is basically am i've seen

376
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,120
Am I seeing repeat visits from the same customer? Am I am I am I observing that there is stickiness with?

377
00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:26,010
With the customer. Yeah in general

378
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,570
So in short data, let's talk about that. This is where we differ like this is where this is

379
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,290
I think my answer is going to be data on every one of these

380
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:40,250
Let's talk about how we'd use data here because this middle statement says are the most important features available in the middle of your screen

381
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,890
Well, it isn't for the tester to decide but those most important features are

382
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,050
Right, you can you can gather that from data are the things people using the most most easily accessible

383
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:57,690
Or how how difficult are some of the things that uh, they're using a lot to find

384
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:04,350
Well, and even then like there is there is a concept that's coming up in the data science space

385
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,470
That's that for me been coming up more and more

386
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,030
Right. How do you define most?

387
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,550
The you that user's most because here's here's one thing i'll call out that a lot of

388
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:20,930
At that when you start doing basic sort of data analysis, it's very attractive

389
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:24,830
To go after and target the average

390
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:29,790
Okay, but here's the deal and there's multiple stories on on this that I could share

391
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,950
but

392
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,950
There's actually no one that is

393
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,910
That fits into the average persona. Uh-huh. You're right

394
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:42,990
Nobody no pilot is the actually the average height for a pilot

395
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,990
Actually, yeah. Yeah, uh, there was a recent story that

396
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:51,230
On that same topic where back in world war something

397
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:54,110
Where they designed the cockpits

398
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:57,230
And they designed the competes for the average

399
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:04,110
Uh pilot right they they measured height they measured weight they measured chest size etc. Okay

400
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,910
and of course

401
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,790
No one actually fit in the plane and in

402
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:12,110
hindsight 2020

403
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:17,230
They looked at and that was one of the main causes for why there were accidents in the plane

404
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:24,330
Because the pilots themselves like literally no one fit correct when you look at humans

405
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,840
Right. There's a certain studies where you'll

406
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,720
like the average human

407
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,160
Is going to have half of their body parts be male and the other half of their body parts be female

408
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,200
And it turns out there's no actual human that fulfills that criteria

409
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,880
That's one of the problems with averages and and when you try to I would I would restate the statement

410
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,450
like

411
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,260
Is what?

412
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:53,020
each individual

413
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,460
To what degree are each individual customer?

414
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,820
Finding their needs and finding that the ui

415
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:09,660
Is where they expect those things to be right in some places it and sometimes it may not actually be

416
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:18,400
Um, like for example in in the azure portal we will we have actually multiple entry points into certain aspects

417
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,960
uh that we know are popular because we

418
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,920
We want we don't want to have to try to train the customer on where to find how we hard-coded it

419
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,600
We want to shortcut

420
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,520
To okay. What are their needs here here? This is how you get to it

421
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,760
Yeah, I I think um, the important thing here is for that question is

422
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,920
And i've actually looked through a couple of these while you've been talking and they're all going to end up in data

423
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,480
So I may not go through many more unless I find a good one

424
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,000
but

425
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,400
A lot of testers think like we have to act like the customer will use personas and you can't you're not the customers

426
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,440
That's what principle five is about you have to use data and I have and I have to tell you I haven't used an office app in

427
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,520
Four years, but I assume office still has the ribbon

428
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,320
Yeah, okay. So when the ribbon came out it pissed a lot of people off

429
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,080
And a lot of people liked it. It was a good often when you innovate

430
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,560
Uh, you can tell you're innovating when half the people love it and half people hate it. You get a polarized

431
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,440
Response, but the reason they did that and I heard all kinds of theories

432
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,760
I was at a conference once and somebody told me

433
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,080
They had some wild conspiracy story on why the ribbon was the way the ribbon was and it was I was

434
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,800
A little shocked that someone could have that imagination

435
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,880
but the reason the ribbon existed and they came out with it was

436
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:46,480
A whole bunch of customers were requesting features that already existed in office apps. They just couldn't find them

437
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And the ribbon was about trying to make sure that every feature was

438
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,160
Two clicks or three clicks away and taking those most important features of putting them one click away

439
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,040
The next level down two clicks away just making it easier

440
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,520
And if you have been using office for a long time, you'll remember their attempt before

441
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,760
Was to do this thing where they'd hide menu items. You remember this?

442
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,720
They would hide the menu items that you hadn't used recently. So you go to look and it was that was more confusing

443
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,400
That was a horrible solution for that customer problem

444
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,200
But they're able to discover that through data and lots of feedback that that wasn't working

445
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,640
They thought okay. We'll limit your view to the stuff you use

446
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,240
But there's it was there was a pain in the butt for those things you only use once in a while like mail merge

447
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:39,280
You have to go dig around and remember which menu it was in to find it. It was just ridiculous

448
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:45,760
So all that's data driven, you know, love or hate office. I haven't used it because I haven't needed it

449
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,160
Although honestly as a tangent if I had a windows machine, I would have excel

450
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
Just so I could run power bi

451
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,380
Other than that, but I don't so I don't and it's all right

452
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,920
anyway

453
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,560
Data to understand what

454
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,360
Challenges the customers are having how are they using the product?

455
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,510
right, I grabbed a card from the

456
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,990
The green which are techniques, but the first one I grabbed I

457
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,070
Is very similar to the test selection one. It's a different car

458
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,310
But i'm gonna go ahead and read it for you and then i'll grab and maybe i'll grab another not sure

459
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:33,550
It's on the sampling technique when faced with unlimited possibilities testers select the most likely options the one most prone to risks

460
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,030
Okay, so we wait what?

461
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,670
when faced with unlimited possibilities

462
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,360
Testers select the most likely options the ones most prone to risks. This is saying wait

463
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,080
Wait, is that a is there a comma in there or no?

464
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,680
I had to add I had to add commas to make it make sense

465
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,280
I will read it as written when faced with unlimited possibilities testers select the most likely options the ones most prone to risks

466
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,320
What they're saying is we do risk-based that we

467
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,680
The number of ways I could test something is indeed

468
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
basically infinite

469
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:13,880
But we do risk-based testing. Okay, I just tried to think through what

470
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,280
What they mean by the most likely but I got it

471
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,080
All testing is sampling. We can't run all tests. They say checks. I'm going to say tests. So we settle for a subset

472
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,240
Being honest about this keep this in mind. What keeps us humble? Yes, of course risk-based testing means you can't test everything

473
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,760
Choosing which set you will test is very important

474
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,040
So this is all they call this sampling technique, but really it's risk-based testing

475
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,240
And the last one is not going to read that whole second one

476
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,760
Let's test more different variations of ordering english language books as 99 of our businesses in that module

477
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:55,160
So actually like this one at the end because i'm going to assume that's based on data and yeah

478
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,520
You can

479
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,840
Use all kinds of demographic data to figure out how much time you're going to spend testing

480
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,520
if you have a feature of your application that is

481
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,720
A very small subset of your customers find useful you can spend less time

482
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,120
Both adding new features to that section or testing that section for the product

483
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,120
But i'm not sure what else to add to that one other than

484
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,560
I don't know any comments on that one before I grab one from

485
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,320
The most

486
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,320
the most likely the ones

487
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,670
Right. What was the last statement the something around most likely though?

488
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,710
What they're saying is this one isn't super well written, but but what they're basically saying is

489
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,930
because

490
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,830
99 of our business is in

491
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,710
ordering english language books

492
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,670
Let's wait our testing in that area

493
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,660
Oh, okay

494
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,020
Yeah, to me that makes sense

495
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:55,200
So if you have a limited test selection, you're going to want to prioritize

496
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,140
The way I always phrase it is you're going to want to prioritize the tests

497
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,300
That's kind of gonna okay gonna have the biggest oh shit factor if they fail we're gonna do a lightning round

498
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,500
All right. I'm gonna read you a heuristic and you're gonna say

499
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,540
Tell me whether you can solve that problem with data

500
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:19,340
Or not data. So the game is data and not data. I just made this up. All right. All right data

501
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,920
Yes, all right. What's the next question data a product that is hard to explain might be too hard for a user to understand

502
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:29,930
Data

503
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:33,850
We all have expectations of the world around us. Our app should be no exception

504
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,960
I can't parse that one. Okay, fine

505
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:43,360
I'll just default to data. There is much to learn from earlier versions. What did they tell you about risk and failure?

506
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,240
Oh data is your product true to the image and reputation you or the app's company wishes to project

507
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,040
I've been saying mix on that. Okay. Are your competitors doing things different maybe even in a better way?

508
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Uh data if you have it

509
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,560
That's going to be another mix. I'm I'm I'm I'm uh, created a third choice. Okay

510
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,080
What's the third choice mix

511
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:14,240
Yeah data no data mix. Okay, so i'm basically viewing it now as quantitative qualitative or both

512
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
All right. Can your product live up to the hype?

513
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's got to be both. Okay

514
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,520
What are the user's desires and does the product live up to them?

515
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,440
That's both does the product solve a problem will it fulfill its ultimate mission data?

516
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,100
Your app will have to adhere to standards norms regulations or the law

517
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,050
Um that for sure is both. Yep

518
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:42,330
What can you learn from a workflow by executing it in opposite order or a different order?

519
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,970
I I can't parse that one. I think that's data. What they want to know is

520
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,490
Is if someone goes off the happy path will they still be successful?

521
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:57,850
Yeah, the way I interpret workflow is like a sequence of steps and how do you execute it in reverse order, right? It's a sequence

522
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,810
How does your app handle zeros and negatives?

523
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,370
Okay, i'm inventing

524
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,890
A fourth option. All right, man. Don't care. Don't care. Great

525
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,330
Dev's job

526
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:16,410
I think I think we have another one for category four blank fields too many records or exactly one input can lead to horrible errors

527
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,620
Yeah, dev

528
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,340
When we look at uh, i'm gonna do there's four more things i'll do for heresics and we'll stop but all right

529
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,220
But i'll pause there because when we one thing we can look at which should exist is

530
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,860
Error rates what errors are customers seeing? Yes. How many are they seeing?

531
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:36,140
Uh, it's it's a great denominator. So you say

532
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:38,860
you might see oh we had

533
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,900
10 000 users last month and

534
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:48,540
A thousand of them encountered errors and a hundred of them encountered more than 20 errors per session

535
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:51,790
Yep, we can go look at that and figure out what to do

536
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:58,670
What is wrong with these people and they all live in texas or something and and desantis shut off their internet who knows?

537
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,830
uh, but we can

538
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:05,230
If we have those areas we can dig in and debug and i've talked about this before but

539
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,270
Worth a pause here before we finish this up is

540
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:12,110
I love to debug from data

541
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:19,630
I like to look at an anomaly and then dig in and figure out why what's unique about this anomaly?

542
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,710
What's going on here? Why?

543
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:26,030
Did this customer get this error? Oh, that is absolutely my favorite thing to do

544
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:29,790
And just to be clear. I don't think brent's being sarcastic

545
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
No, it's not. It's not

546
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:39,500
I'll tell you why because once I find the answer to that question and then I can generalize it to okay

547
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,620
How well does this broaden in terms of impact?

548
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,780
I will say 50 of the time it allows me to

549
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:54,780
To do my even more favorite thing to do and that is go to the executives and inform them that their business is not

550
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,900
Operating the way they think it is. Yeah, but

551
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,860
I even did that that's that's on big scale

552
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,900
But I remember even on we had so much data on even on the xbox console that

553
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,860
We would hear customers having an error with something

554
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,980
So we go look in the data and find out who was having that error

555
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,460
Then we check on all the different things about them and slowly like what's in common

556
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:22,060
It's just like debugging with the debugger, but we're just kind of going through we're doing sql queries instead of debugger commands

557
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,980
And in the end you find out if they're on a certain version of the console and they have this game installed and they have

558
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,660
More than two controllers set up they get this error. Yeah

559
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,300
Love that so much fun

560
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,940
There is so I think I may have shared with them the podcast that one of one of my team's key missions is around

561
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,740
Uh, we call it support supportability

562
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,080
One of the kpis that manages sort of success and supportability

563
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,620
is

564
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,220
self-help solution

565
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Okay, and that's to the degree

566
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,020
Do we publish documentation and bring that documentation to the customer?

567
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:09,820
On their ability to to understand the docket and actually solve it themselves like they don't actually need to engage support

568
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,940
Actually, it's funny that you brought the errors thing up

569
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,060
Because literally just this week I was in a meeting on a very similar context

570
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,110
and

571
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,170
the kpi

572
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,810
Just it's very simply measured

573
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,370
Like the numerator is

574
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,890
the number of people that that deflected

575
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:40,890
Uh a case that we deflected them from entering a case. That's the numerator and then the denominator is the number of people

576
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:48,250
That went into that that particular problem space that that were deflection opportunities and one of the things

577
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,330
I stated for the first time actually this week

578
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,370
that was controversial, uh because

579
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:01,530
Everybody everybody is focused on the numerator the numerator. How do we get that numerator to 100%?

580
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,930
How do we deflect all of these things and I said, yeah, I just want to let you know

581
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:12,410
I'm I'm actually no longer interested in the numerator. I care about the denominator. I want to drive that to zero

582
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,570
How do I get the customers?

583
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,770
No longer having problems in this space

584
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:24,030
Because if I get them to know how to have no longer having problems then I don't care if we even have documentation

585
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:28,750
Right. They don't need to go and click it. How do we improve our platform?

586
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,110
To be smarter to actually solve it in the first place. Yep. I use the left shift

587
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:41,870
Language like our goal is to bring solutions to the customers. It's the absolute most tragic of a fail

588
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,830
If a customer does go through

589
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:48,430
Through support and walks away feeling like they did not get a solution

590
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:49,950
but we've been

591
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:53,230
A lot of companies and microsoft included has sort of been

592
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:58,910
Optimizing for a safety net around around the support staff

593
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:06,270
But that's expensive and that's manually driven and and it it at some point in time

594
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,550
It fails to scale. Yeah, if you if your customer has to call support you're losing money

595
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,400
In our case, not so much. All right. Well in general, I would say that's true

596
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,640
Yeah in general, I would say that's potentially true like with microsoft

597
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,560
right now for

598
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,040
For for the majority of our support topic or support plans

599
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,800
These are add-ons that that customers actually need to buy

600
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,880
And so people who are going in and creating creating these support cases in some degree

601
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,040
They've already decided that they're going to be active on the on the platform

602
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,040
but

603
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
Even if you want to keep that model

604
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,960
Right you want then more people to to funnel into it. How do we get more people buying?

605
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,080
finding so much value and it's worthwhile to

606
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,160
uh

607
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,960
Buy a support plan. I get it. I get it. So

608
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,720
One of the thing I wanted to mention so I got excited thinking about debugging through data

609
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,000
I didn't know we're gonna get here when we started but i'm glad I remembered that but it reminded me a thing we did

610
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
even on teams

611
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,200
There's something I liked a lot about what we did on teams and it was a

612
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,000
A dirt simple solution and almost lazy, but it was great

613
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,800
We had a in the beta

614
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,800
We had a form where a message care how it worked

615
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,760
We had a way for any customer using our product internal external to just give

616
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:36,660
plain text feedback, of course, we had we had data on error rates on the server side that people could give us

617
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,060
Any sort of feedback we wanted and they and we dump it into a database

618
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,940
And we'd never look at it

619
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,100
directly, at least never on purpose

620
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,180
but

621
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,060
What we got is we just wrapped an elastic search

622
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:59,620
Elastic search around that data and then when somebody internally would say hey i'm seeing something weird where the uh

623
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:05,060
The fonts are really small. I go we go. I wonder if customers are seeing this

624
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:09,230
Small font and we see okay. Here's five reports. What's going on there?

625
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,550
and we get a much more context and information on why that may happen or

626
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,800
daily usually someone would just type crash

627
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:22,350
And see if if if a lot of customers reporting crashes, but it's a pretty

628
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:29,870
It ended up being a pretty cheap way to kind of check on the pulse of what of customer feedback

629
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,940
Because there's no way to look at all of it, but I wanted but we collected it all so we'd have it for

630
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,740
Often you get something from like satya's office. You want to know is this a

631
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,780
butts and chairs figure this out or a

632
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:46,780
A one-off thing. We just need to go over and babysit someone through and having

633
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:49,420
being able to pull from

634
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:55,420
A thousand entries a day on random feedback from customers gave us a way to see if those are things that are really happening

635
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,500
But you you seem like you don't like this

636
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,980
No, no, no, I I like it very much

637
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,140
Uh, but question I think I missed it. Did you say that's in teams or in unity? No, we did that in teams

638
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,540
Okay, do you do something? No, not yet

639
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,460
But okay

640
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:12,590
all right, so

641
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:18,350
Do you have a pad and paper? I'm going to give you some terms. I want you to go talk to your data science team

642
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:21,040
and

643
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,240
Do your charismatic hand wavy?

644
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,720
Fucking do the shit that alan asked you to do thing. Okay, i'm listening

645
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,640
You need to get a feedback stream going just like you did in teams

646
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,240
That's number one like obviously your data science team is not going to be able to do that

647
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,160
You're going to have to talk to your desk. I I can populate that. Yeah, okay

648
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,200
Then what you want?

649
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,520
Is against that stream

650
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,680
You want your data science team to produce a daily?

651
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,740
TF idf

652
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,940
Vector

653
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:02,180
Okay, and what a tf idf is a is an nlp algorithm and what a basic fuck it's damn

654
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:07,220
I don't know what it means. No it's term frequency. It stands for term frequency

655
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:10,580
That's cool. I got it. I got what else verse document, okay

656
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,940
Then what you want to do is do anomaly detection against that vector

657
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,640
Okay, and wouldn't you have done that?

658
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,380
What you will now have

659
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,140
Is a feed that tells you in near real time

660
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,100
when certain terms

661
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:35,250
Are anomalous and starting to appear in your feedback stream

662
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,930
In other words instead of what you did with teams

663
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:40,930
where

664
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:43,410
Customers provided feedback and you looked at it

665
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:51,250
You know when when reactively when someone decided to care you're now going to have a feed that tells you

666
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:56,770
Hey something weird is happening and the customers know about it before we do

667
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:03,760
You turn it to near real time reaction instead of hmm. I wonder if anyone's ever talked about this

668
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,560
That is cool. So now what I wanted so another thing no i'm excited

669
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:13,120
Okay, we don't have a lot of time to talk about this. But another thing I want to do is

670
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,120
Again xbox live use this i'm sure a lot of teams did this. This is actually similar to this is um

671
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,320
Just a sentiment analysis on all the different feedback streams where people can give feedback. What's your what's your view on sentiment analysis?

672
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:32,750
Sentiment analysis. So if you have the right data set and if you have customers that are providing sentiment

673
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:39,870
Um, it's it's handy. Uh, but but what i'm what i'm hearing in your voice is what I really want is the ti

674
00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:41,870
Tfidf vector

675
00:50:41,870 --> 00:50:47,550
Well, so that one's easy and it should work with your data set. That's the problem is you need like

676
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,630
You need near office level degree of usage

677
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:55,390
Because customers don't generally provide feedback, right?

678
00:50:56,030 --> 00:51:03,230
Uh, the the response rate is rather low like two three five seven percent. Yeah, I thought more like two I think is is is

679
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:05,070
Going going well

680
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:11,230
So to do something useful with data science on that one you need a lot of users

681
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:18,590
And I I don't know if unity is at that space in terms of where they have customer feedback stuff, but

682
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,770
Yeah, certainly

683
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:26,690
And you know no product plans here i'll do this for the part of the product that I ship which is um documentation

684
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,330
But it's a place where right feedback

685
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:34,530
and the other thing that is problematic with sentiment analysis is

686
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:40,450
Do you remember back when you were at microsoft when we did, uh the peer feedback?

687
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,090
where where

688
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,090
You know you you had to ask

689
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,490
20 people to give you peer feedback and then they would answer

690
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:56,130
Uh, these these questions that scaled from one to five and and then some random text that like ms 360

691
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:59,730
Right to what degree did you find that useful?

692
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:03,170
To it. I I found it. I found it useful to a degree

693
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,290
a very slight degree, right?

694
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:10,690
then the problem the reason why is um

695
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,080
Anything that was sort of constructive feedback

696
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,520
A lot of the times end up being overblown constructive, right?

697
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,280
Because it's somebody that actually hates your guts and now their interaction with you was personal

698
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,920
Um, but over overall the majority of time you you get oh sure

699
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
555 allen is perfect in every way

700
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,140
Which doesn't help you grow doesn't help you improve

701
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,500
right, so

702
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:41,380
What what I got from from mine was and we do need to close her i'm late for another meeting is uh

703
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:47,410
I I met with the hr person to go over with me and they said alan everyone your work with

704
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,330
Thinks you do great work and they love how you get it done

705
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,210
But they kind of think you're an asshole

706
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,040
And this was very early in my microsoft career. All my role models were assholes

707
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,160
And that's when I began. Oh I can you're right

708
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,080
But I was kind of almost told that was the way I had to do it

709
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,520
That's that it was at that point. I began to actually learn

710
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,400
How to read people and build an emotional quotient and think about how I was coming across

711
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,480
Which is the only reason i'm still employed thought I kept on being an asshole to get stuff done and left bodies in my wake

712
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,520
And not been and burned bridges right and left or to get done what I wanted to get done

713
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I'd be in a different place in my career

714
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:32,430
Yeah, but when we both started at microsoft, I mean, that's how you get shit done

715
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:35,790
Yep, exactly back in the day. All right, man. Uh

716
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,150
We better close it up here so I can get going but this was fun

717
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:44,990
Uh always good surprising you with agenda items the last minute and see how you react but again you get an a plus

718
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:46,670
Data

719
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:52,270
And the the answer is all the data. Yeah. All right. Uh, thanks everyone for listening. I am

720
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,140
Alan and I am brent. All right, man. See you later
