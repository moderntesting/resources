00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
How does someone who is working on test automation or CI tools during exploratory testing,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,760
how do they become a tester in the sense of experimentation?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,400
How do they become someone who administers experiments to customers?

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,430
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,030
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,390
leadership, ads, and anything else that comes to mind.

7
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,830
Now on with the show.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,830
Okay, thank you.

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,330
We should do that.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,970
It's AB Testing, the Yacht Rock version.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,640
Next up, let's do it now.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,380
So we have been, we are going to have a shorter podcast today.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,060
One, because I have a hard cutoff and two, because I have been struggling with the

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
non-sponsored so I can talk about them.

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:05,730
However, I feel like Zencaster, which has been mean and grody today.

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,850
So let me talk about my user experience here, because I'm that,

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,050
I want to be that guy.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,730
I'm going to be that guy briefly.

19
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,450
Logged on, new interface, couldn't figure out where to go.

20
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,010
Finally started an episode, took me to a blank screen,

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,010
refreshed about 10 times, restarted.

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,970
Finally, I got to a place and it kind of worked and my audio is not great on Brent's side.

23
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,650
Hopefully the local recording works.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:32,450
Then I pressed start the episode, it refreshed again and then it restarted again.

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,930
Finally, we're here recording and we're here for the AB Testing podcast,

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,410
which is about testing and it is modern.

27
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:39,890
Right.

28
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,610
Unless you're just listening to this episode, not the one before and you're very confused.

29
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,290
Because that's kind of what we do.

30
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,130
I got a thing to tell you about the last episode and what I've done since then.

31
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:59,250
But what's going on with you, Mr. Brent Jensen, aka aka El Queso Frito?

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,090
Yes. Do you know what that means?

33
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,890
It means cheese fry.

34
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,810
The fried cheese.

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,390
Either way, it's an old joke between me and my brother.

36
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,390
We've always felt that El Queso Frito sounds like a superhero name.

37
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,950
If there was a superhero man of fried cheese, that would be you.

38
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,990
El Queso Frito.

39
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,550
What did you ask me?

40
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,030
Oh, yes.

41
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,550
So school, school's back from summer.

42
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,550
It's interesting in terms of the Microsoft hybridization report.

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,350
Wait, what is the Microsoft hybridization report?

44
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,270
This is where I report out on the work from home.

45
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,070
Hybridization?

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,310
Yeah.

47
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,670
Oh, that hybridization.

48
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,310
Yes.

49
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,550
As you know, I am sitting in my office.

50
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:52,990
I do know.

51
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:02,030
And Microsoft opened up at the end of last March, at which point in time we went from

52
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:15,790
five cars consistently in the parking lot, which mine was 20 percent, to maybe 20 cars.

53
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:20,590
And now I would say we're closer to 40, 50.

54
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,550
It means still plenty of empty parking spots.

55
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:24,510
Yeah.

56
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,750
I remember the days of, I know what building you're in.

57
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,350
I remember the days of walking around that parking lot and not walking,

58
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,110
driving around in circles and going, damn it, I'm going to have to park farther away.

59
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,590
Oh, yeah.

60
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:34,990
No, no.

61
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:45,230
Before COVID, I've had to, if I got in after nine, I wouldn't even try going into my building.

62
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,150
Because I had already learned, nope, I'm just going to go park in the big garage in the Commons.

63
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,950
Can you share the details?

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,070
What's the high level?

65
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,670
What is the hybridization mean?

66
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,710
We're at a stage where some people go to work and some don't.

67
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,430
We're good with that?

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,500
Microsoft's open for working from work, but people can choose.

69
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,060
So we have a survey.

70
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,300
Same.

71
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,500
All right.

72
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:20,740
But what's happened is this week, I would say there's been an increase between 30 and 50% of

73
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,900
cards. There's still plenty of open parking spots.

74
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,900
But why do you think that is this week?

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,140
Because summer end and.

76
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,380
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

77
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,340
And I think a lot of people just made the decision.

78
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,340
We'll just stay working from home while the kids out for summer.

79
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,420
Yeah, I was in the office a couple of days this week.

80
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,660
Three days matter of fact, and we're still not.

81
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,340
We're still looking sparse.

82
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,490
So we're open for business, but yeah.

83
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,130
Yeah, there's one thing that's fascinating, though.

84
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:56,290
So because of this, Microsoft kind of put a halt on building.

85
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,690
They have a whole bunch of new buildings that they're working through,

86
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,930
but they put a halt on trying to find new space.

87
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,650
And before COVID, we are having a problem.

88
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:03,730
Same.

89
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
The same.

90
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,040
Before COVID, we were having a problem because we were running out of space.

91
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,760
And we're like, where are we going to put all these people?

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,840
And so now what's happening, it's messed up.

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
So if you remember, there used to be like seniority rules around.

94
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,880
Who gets the window office?

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,680
Who gets single?

96
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,040
Who gets doubled?

97
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,080
Crap like that.

98
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,880
So now it's.

99
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,940
Seniority rules are still in play.

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,900
Around who gets an office.

101
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,940
Without regard as to whether or not those people are coming in.

102
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,420
Right.

103
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,660
So that's the weird thing about Microsoft.

104
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,740
I think I got to imagine your building is still a little bit of the minority overall.

105
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,300
Maybe not.

106
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,580
But in the rest of the industry, I think individual offices don't exist that much.

107
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,020
So hot desking is a little easier and just, you know, just showing up.

108
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,900
And we have a system for reserving desks.

109
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,380
I figure out where I want to work when I get tired of that place.

110
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,580
I move around, but actually I'm in a good spot now because it's close to little lockers

111
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,300
where I keep my my Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.

112
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,540
So yeah, just kind of work.

113
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,570
So with offices, it's kind of weird if you're going to have like,

114
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,650
it's like you're there all the time.

115
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,370
So it makes sense.

116
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:23,010
You keep stuff in there and you go there every day.

117
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,010
But if you're going in once or twice a week, are you saying those people have offices too?

118
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,450
Like permanent.

119
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,410
They they do and they don't depending on on the person.

120
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,450
So so for example, we have a bunch of new hires.

121
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,740
Um, and right now,

122
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,340
this is one of those things where I just like, okay, is it just humanly the default

123
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,660
that we never go back and revisit old rules.

124
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,390
We just add new rules, right?

125
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:00,510
It's like you could make your life easier if you take this existing rule and delete it.

126
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,390
Right.

127
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,430
So we're keeping alive the the seniority rule.

128
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,190
But because that that makes us out of space,

129
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,510
then new hires, the rule is you don't get an office.

130
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:17,630
Even though you want to come in, you know, eight, eight days a week.

131
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,790
And I'm like, this is dumb.

132
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,590
Yeah, it is dumb.

133
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,470
This is dumb.

134
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:25,310
I will tell you, we don't need all of our listeners, even all of them,

135
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,430
because they're all smarter than us.

136
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,390
They know this is dumb.

137
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:28,430
Yes.

138
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,390
So I guess one of the things that's new for me is it's, um,

139
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:42,420
so because of this, I have actually for for my organization taken over the move map

140
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,700
multiple years in a row.

141
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:55,300
And, uh, just last week, I put my final touches on an AI for defining the move map.

142
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,220
I've been wanting to build this for years and I finally did it

143
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,500
because it's, it's way smarter than the decisions we've been making.

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,180
All right. I'll, I'll trust you.

145
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,300
I'll trust you. It's going to work out.

146
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,660
So that's interesting.

147
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:12,820
I think a lot of companies are in that space that people like,

148
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:16,420
I can tell you, I think it's probably fair to tell you that we have some offices

149
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,100
that are basically full, not on the West coast.

150
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,860
West coast of the US has been the slowest to return to office.

151
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,420
Full and occupied.

152
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,580
Full. Well, not full occupied, like at 80%.

153
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,050
So pretty good idea.

154
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:33,730
Okay.

155
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:37,330
Lot of our offices, like we don't have a single office that will hold all the

156
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,410
people associated with that office.

157
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,930
Like in, you know, we have an office that holds 200 people.

158
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:49,170
For example, we may have our internal employee database may show 350 people

159
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,650
associated with that office, but, uh, we think we have quite a while before,

160
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,130
of a reach capacity where everybody can find a desk.

161
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,970
So we have also slowed down.

162
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:03,950
I guess some projects that were in process in 2019 stopped and remain stopped.

163
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,150
And we're not even filling most of the space we have now.

164
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,260
So anyway, I think that's pretty common for everyone else.

165
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,380
I do want to talk about AB testing.

166
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:20,940
Okay. Do you at all have any interest in talking about Her Majesty the Queen?

167
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,940
Oh, just that.

168
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,990
I mean, I do because I have a lot of Brits on my team and it's,

169
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,590
it's, it's kind of like, um, when you have a little bit, so kind of like when you have a

170
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:42,340
family member who you maybe know they're about to pass soon and, or they will pass sometime

171
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,500
in the next year or two sometime.

172
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,060
But when they do, it's still kind of shocking in a way.

173
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,290
And I think that's where a lot of folks are right now.

174
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:56,580
I mean, she was queen for 70 years, our condolences.

175
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,540
And it's going to be weird because as long as we've been alive and much, much longer,

176
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,380
there has been a queen of England.

177
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,580
It's a little trippy.

178
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,980
Right. There's multiple generations of literally there are multiple generations.

179
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,820
Like her, she reigned for 76 years.

180
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,900
I thought it was 70, right?

181
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,820
She was, she was queen since she was 26 and she died at 96.

182
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,940
Oh, 70 years then.

183
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,620
Right. That's.

184
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,420
If I have that right.

185
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,580
And someone, one of our listeners will correct me because people know more stuff than I do

186
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,140
all the time.

187
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,660
Yeah. I'm trying to, it's fascinating.

188
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,620
And then I'm wondering, like, I find the whole thing fascinating just simply because I'm just

189
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,740
like, okay, number one, why are, is there still monarchies?

190
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,190
That whole, that whole concept, right?

191
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,870
There's still an emperor of Japan.

192
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:57,650
It's not, it's not a monarchy in the sense of an autocrat or an authoritarian or a dictator.

193
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,980
Right. Right. And then the new.

194
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,020
There is a political system in both cases that supports.

195
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,980
Right. And, and the thing that's fascinating, right? The, the new king of England is 73.

196
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:11,940
Right.

197
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,880
Right. And, and I just.

198
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,640
That's, that's good, solid blood, blood, man. He'll be, he'll be alive longer than I will.

199
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
Yeah. He'll definitely be alive longer than me most likely.

200
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,800
All right. A B test, A B testing or as it's sometimes called ab testing, we're going to

201
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,360
be sending out some self assessments where you do as many sit ups and leg raises as you can.

202
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,720
It's part of the ab testing network. Oh wait, I'm sorry. That that's, that's later.

203
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,960
That's a later evolution of AB testing.

204
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,720
You just have to be able to do at least as many as I can.

205
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
Yeah. That's one.

206
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,200
That's zero.

207
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,390
Last time on the podcast, we talked about a slash B testing or experimentation. So we had a little

208
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,590
talk about that and, and about this article. And I actually.

209
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,030
Right. And how did that go?

210
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,670
I don't think it's been played yet. I recorded the talk that we talked about me making last time.

211
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,360
And it went, I think it went well. I can, um, if this, if we had screen sharing,

212
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
I'd show you my slides, but, uh, we probably do. I just don't, I turn it on.

213
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,080
It was pretty much a recap. I talked a little bit about where I came from.

214
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,600
Talking about, okay, I did this kind of testing at first where I explored stuff.

215
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
A lot of people do that today. That's cool. Um, there probably always be need for that

216
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,680
on some teams, but it's going away. And then I did a bunch of API testing,

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,520
both things that would be at the unit level today and wider, some diagnostic tools.

218
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Uh, those things live 90 to a hundred percent in the lives in developers.

219
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,040
So I'm not really going to do that again. That's somebody else's job.

220
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
And then I talked about accelerating test teams, accelerating teams through

221
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,040
CI systems. And that's another role, um, that accelerates quality.

222
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,440
But then I said, but another kind of testing I want to do is, and I,

223
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I talked about experimentation first, um, went into AB testing and talked about the fact that

224
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,570
in those scenarios, the tester is the person that doesn't check inputs and put in values.

225
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:15,170
The tester is the person that administers the AB test and talked a little bit about that,

226
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,650
how to learn more. I mentioned, uh, Ronnie Kowavi's book. You remember Ronnie from Microsoft?

227
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,050
Pretty good, smart mind in this area and tell us, has lots of good stories and stuff.

228
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,210
I've stolen over the years. So good stuff there. And it's, it's a 14 minute talk.

229
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,210
So not a lot there, but at the end, I'm sure it's a twist that'll piss people off.

230
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,970
But then, but then, but then, but then you probably didn't see my five for Friday today.

231
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,810
Did you know, I haven't seen that yet.

232
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,930
You can bring it up while I talk if you want, but one of the links now,

233
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,250
I think link number four is believe it or not. I came across an article.

234
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,730
I do believe it. That said how your QA team can use AB testing.

235
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:54,510
And I was talking about using the QA team to, to administer experiments.

236
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,340
I thought, huh, there's always someone smarter and ahead of me out there.

237
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,100
Yeah. No, I don't view our job on this podcast is to invent new things.

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,500
No, we never do. We never do. We highlight what's already happening.

239
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,260
Even if we don't know it's already happening and then try to accelerate it.

240
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:19,100
Yes. Yes. So I did that. I'm going to write the article based on that sometime soon, but, uh,

241
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:26,850
I was thinking, my question for you is this recording. I didn't record it just to, you know,

242
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,850
anger people, even though I'm sure it's going to get a couple of reactions like,

243
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:37,230
what, I don't get this. Why is this here? Alan, you're so stuck in the bubble kind of thing.

244
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:43,580
So what do you think if you were, let's say, imagine you were the tester you were 20 years ago,

245
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,820
because that's probably at least a chunk of the people watching this talk.

246
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,500
Okay. But you have an open mind and you love to learn. Well, what do you think when you see this

247
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,140
talk that goes, okay, that kind of testing, I know that kind of testing. I know I know people

248
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,290
that do DevOps stuff and acceleration. That's good. That's good. You want me to what?

249
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:15,680
If I were the tester 20 years ago, but in today's context, I assume, I think I would be worried,

250
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,730
obviously, right? I don't know what the value proposition I'm giving up. Like,

251
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,410
what are we losing? That's where people are going to freak out.

252
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,930
Well, and here's where I think I can help you. I think what's different,

253
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:36,370
as kind of a little bit rhetorical, as you and I both know, there are some testers who are,

254
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,730
we'll dig in their heels a little bit on this is the kind of testing I do. I think that's fine.

255
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,690
You can do what you want. I'm not going to tell you to do something you're not doing as long as

256
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,490
you're gainfully employed and happy and learning. If you like your job matters, autonomy, mastery,

257
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:53,170
and purpose, just go for it. But you're going to have to leave that behind. As you know,

258
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:58,290
there's a lot of testers who do exploratory testing all day. There's nothing wrong with that.

259
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:05,650
That's not what we're talking about. There's a lot of testers who do all day doing Selenium

260
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:13,860
testing to automate UI. That's fine. I don't consider that my job anymore. That's not going

261
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,540
to stop it. So you'd have to leave those things behind in order to focus on experimentation.

262
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,100
Right. If we think about what were the principles, why did we write the principles of

263
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:37,460
modern testing? We wrote them essentially because we saw people didn't have a clear road path

264
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,710
to get to the world we were already living in.

265
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,670
Right. We saw, yeah, exactly. We saw the changes happening. We saw people struggling with those

266
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:55,070
changes. We wanted to help them navigate those changes. And we've been doing that for five,

267
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:02,590
six years. What we're doing now is saying there's a new place that we're already living,

268
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,750
but there's a new place maybe we're going. We want to talk to you how to navigate that.

269
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:20,270
So the place we're talking about is OK. If we were to sum up MTP in less than seven principles,

270
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:29,870
we're basically saying, hey, it's a new world. Your expertise is valuable. But it's valuable in terms

271
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:37,870
of transitioning, helping to transition Dev to actually doing their job, coaching, and

272
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,550
increasing or accelerating the team. But a pivot is around coaching. Now, the question,

273
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:52,110
of course, and we started talking about this. And right now, I can't believe this is the first time

274
00:17:52,110 --> 00:18:00,740
I'm thinking these thoughts. OK. Once it's ingrained in the culture of how to do this and coaching

275
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:10,370
isn't needed, what then? Right. And that's what I think we're going into or the path that we're

276
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:17,890
discussing. Maybe. But I think what's different, though, is moving from tester to test developer

277
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:26,050
is just a shift. It's not a big thing. Moving from that into coaching or into working on

278
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,090
CI systems, not that big of a change. The change we're talking about here, moving from,

279
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:37,330
it isn't a progression, moving from any one of those, I'll call them all traditional testing or

280
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:43,410
checking roles, into an experimentation role, I think, is a much bigger jump than any of the

281
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:49,090
others we've talked about. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. For sure. So that's the thing

282
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:53,650
I'd like to explore a little bit today than in the future episodes is how does someone who is a,

283
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,750
well, I have answers for these. We can talk about it a little bit. How does someone who is

284
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:04,830
working on test automation or CI tools, doing exploratory testing, how do they become a tester

285
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,390
in the sense of experimentation? How do they become someone who administers experiments to customers?

286
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:16,510
A little bit of a yet another, again, Principle 5 rant is people get mad at Principle 5 because they

287
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,350
say, you just want the customers to test your software. And the thing is, yes, we do, but not

288
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:27,760
in the sense that you're thinking of. You know what I mean, but I'm going to expand. We don't

289
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,080
want the customers to test our software to find functional correctness. If you give your customers

290
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,960
something that isn't functionally correct for them to discover, you're a crappy developer.

291
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,600
That's not the goal. Yeah. We're not talking about code correct. Yeah, right. Exactly. But we do

292
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,600
want customers to test our software. We want them to test to see if the treatment or the experiment

293
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:55,360
we are proposing to them is a better experience than the one that the control group or everyone

294
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,560
else is getting. We do want them to test our software. If someone were to come to me and

295
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:07,200
today say, oh, I think Principle 5 is bullshit because you guys just want your customers to

296
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:19,340
test the software. My response would be yes. But specifically, it would be yes. For me to evaluate

297
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:29,980
the quality of my software, I absolutely need my customers to use it. Right? Because what I'm

298
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:39,250
trying to do there is look, I do not expect my customers to encounter code correctness issues.

299
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:48,430
That is Dev's job. Dev's job now. Okay. Sorry. Dev's job. But whether or not my software has

300
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,630
quality has nothing to do with, in my view, with code correctness. It has some things to do with

301
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:03,740
code correctness. But what I'm now trying to understand is to what degree this is valuable,

302
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:12,700
this is useful, this is adding improvements to my customer's life. And that is the definition of

303
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:20,780
quality that I care about. And if my customers aren't using it, then either I have crap or I have

304
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:27,820
another problem because I cannot validate that hypothesis without usage.

305
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:35,980
Yes. The more I've thought about it, this is the biggest hurdle that traditional tester has to get

306
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,660
over, understanding that you actually do need customers to test your software to know if it's

307
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:47,420
quality software. And again, words, as some of our colleagues in the industry will say,

308
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,260
words have meanings and the meanings for the words I spoke and the meanings that are maybe

309
00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:01,820
more traditionally or commonly used do not match. I want my customers to test my software. I just

310
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,620
don't repeat myself that they need to. But when people hear that, they think of another kind of

311
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,700
testing. It's not actually, it's what's weird to say, we want to use testing and checking,

312
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:18,860
not mocking in this case, if you want to use those terms from Bock and Bolton is you don't

313
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,580
want customers to air quote, check your software, but you do want them to test your software.

314
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,100
I don't know. And actually, that's not quite right because then I'm using their

315
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,500
definition for check, but our definition for test doesn't quite work.

316
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:42,720
I am reminded of one of my first presentations I did in Bing. Because I paid attention to

317
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,160
what was going on and Bing, when I joined Bing, as you know, we were getting read a test,

318
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,760
but there were still tests, there were still small pockets of tests there, including test managers.

319
00:22:53,760 --> 00:23:00,720
And so I saw what they did. And I had my test manager hat on and I was just amazed.

320
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,760
Right? The one of the ways I started off that slide deck, as I said, here's something that is

321
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:18,080
just incredibly cool about Bing. Every single day, there were 600 million test cases being done.

322
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:28,370
And not only that, there was no way to argue, even with the duplicate test cases being executed,

323
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:33,730
there was no way to argue that those were anything other than the important test cases

324
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,780
for that day. Because those were the ones being done by the customer.

325
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:49,100
And then if you combine it with this intelligence that early on, I truly believe this is why in the

326
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:57,580
early search wars, why Google won. Because they realized it's okay to ship bucks.

327
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:07,010
What is what we need to do is prioritize our resources around those things that are impactful.

328
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:19,040
So Google mastered the art of shipping bugs and then looking at which ones were high impact.

329
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:23,040
Obviously, they couldn't ship anything that would be catastrophic. They couldn't have

330
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,920
outages or blocking little things. It helps you figure out which bugs matter.

331
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,320
How many times have you seen in a blog post or a presentation, someone showing the convoluted way

332
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,800
in which they exposed a bug that nobody cares about?

333
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:48,320
I think about one of the first bugs that as you know, my career is long and

334
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,000
every day, the time I spent as an IC, as a percentile, incredibly shrinks. I spent,

335
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,160
I think, a total of nine months as a full-time IC in the company. But one of my bugs was so freaking

336
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:11,520
convoluted. Instead of having the P, the P ended the triage. Instead of having them go through and

337
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,680
figure out what the hell happened, he just won't fix it and then caught it the Brint beep.

338
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:25,740
Because what happened is I found these weird like 30 random steps and then it would suddenly beep

339
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:33,330
for no reason. Oh, the Brint beep. Yeah, that's nice. He's like, yep, this is the Brint beep.

340
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:39,570
And he reframed it as an Easter egg. There you go, Brint. You can be proud. You spent the effort.

341
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,810
You found this issue. And then I just sit back and they go, I think about the Brint beep and go,

342
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:51,730
how much time did I waste on that stupid freaking bug? Happens all the time though. It's a little

343
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,850
bit of a rite of passage, but I would argue though, there is learning that happened there.

344
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:02,610
You learn how to explore. It's more of an exercise than a value to the customer. So there is value to

345
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:07,010
you, but not to the customer. That would help your growth, but it really did nothing for the

346
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:13,490
customer. Now, I remember this particular thing. This bug did not help me in any way, shape,

347
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:20,610
or form. It just, it might've helped me trying to recall that was I under a bug quota during that

348
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:29,330
time. It might've helped me not get yelled at that week. Let's go back to old style testing

349
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,410
because now I want to tell a different story. Nothing to do with what we're talking about with

350
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:36,960
the customer. But when I first started at Microsoft, I did have a bug quota. I was expected

351
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,420
to find 10 bugs a week. And I was told that it was Windows 95. There are plenty of bugs and I

352
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,220
was doing networking. So plenty of bugs. And I had cool ideas. They don't have to all get fixed,

353
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,300
just bugs. And the manager would kind of spot check and make sure you weren't being stupid.

354
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:58,050
People would do silly things like open up often sometimes as dumb as seeing an un localized

355
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:02,130
string in Japanese and also opening up the localized string in Chinese and Korean.

356
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,010
But I would report, I would find 10, actually I would report 10 or 11 bugs every week,

357
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,090
sometimes 12 because I wanted to overachieve a little bit. But some weeks I find about 20,

358
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,730
25, 30, but I would save them for the next week in case my well dried,

359
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:21,170
which is a horrible behavior. I hate bug quotas are dumb. But one of the bugs I found with me

360
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:27,730
goofing around was I was working on localized, far east localized versions of Windows 95,

361
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:31,890
which was a mixed byte character system. So all kinds of cool stuff could happen because the

362
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:36,770
backslash could be the 5C character could be the second half of a double byte character.

363
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:42,450
So I would do all kinds of weird network tests between NetWare and NT and Japanese NT and

364
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,290
Japanese NetWare, just copying a bunch of files around with weird names to see what would happen.

365
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:56,800
And at the time I didn't realize how cool this bug was. But I was running my test and it hung,

366
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,520
it just stopped. I said, shoot. So I walked down the hall to the lab where the machine was.

367
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,580
It was an NT machine. Must have been 3.5 at the time. And the machine had blue screen. I thought,

368
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,100
well, that's stupid. I mean, they blue screen all the time. So I rebooted it, got it back up,

369
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,250
went back to my office, ran the test again. And my test hung again. I walked down to the

370
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:23,840
down to the lab and I looked at the machine and rebooted it and went back to my office.

371
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
Okay, coincidence. It's got to be a coincidence, right? Because these are, and it's like 50

372
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,680
yards away after walk, other part of the building. I run the test, I start the test,

373
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:36,400
and I kind of jog down to the lab, open the door. I think there was a number key on there.

374
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,800
I get in there, look at the machine and I watch it just blue screen right in front of me. I said,

375
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:49,900
cool. This is like a superpower. And probably out of all the bugs I found,

376
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:57,420
I was testing from Windows 95, but that bug on NT got fixed faster than any of my Win95 bugs.

377
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,900
So did you find a way to corrupt memory?

378
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,220
No, I know what this is 30 years ago. So I don't remember what happened. I just know that,

379
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:13,980
because what happened with these was hitting out before with these mixed by character sets.

380
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:19,180
If anything in the network stack would parse those as single bytes rather than characters,

381
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:24,060
it could screw something up and do something unexpected. So the blue screen was an unexpected

382
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:30,340
behavior of a poorly parsed mixed byte string. Okay, interesting.

383
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:35,140
You don't want your customers finding that one. No, it's kind of an edge case. So maybe

384
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,900
devs may not find it, but the moment you see that crash, you got to be able to debug it,

385
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:44,820
figure it out and get patches in, which reminds me of, do you remember years ago, they may still

386
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,460
have something like this? Again, learning from the customer, SQL had this, it's called like a

387
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,340
no repro policy or something. Meaning when they got a crash report from a customer,

388
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,620
they wanted to be able to have the logs in order to figure out exactly what went on and fixed it.

389
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,820
They didn't want to set up repros anymore. And anytime you had to set up a reproduction

390
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,980
environment in order to isolate the bug and fix it, part of fixing it was adding all the logging.

391
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,140
So if anything like it ever happened again, you could figure out what went wrong.

392
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,100
I think it's a good way to use customer crash data, use it to make your processes faster.

393
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:27,300
And then here we are today, 25 years later. I forgot about the days of doing repros.

394
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:37,740
I know. I don't like, I don't, um, this is one place where going back to when I went to,

395
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:47,250
when I went to Bing, right. Um, I joined about a year after one of the best testers in terms of like

396
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:53,620
the tester mindset and all that he had joined. And he's like, he saw that I was there and he's

397
00:30:53,620 --> 00:31:01,140
like, Oh, Britt, I wish you had told me before you come, this place is horrible. The issue was,

398
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:09,710
he was just phenomenal at finding bugs, but bugs didn't matter in Bing because there was so many

399
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:17,280
different things that were happening every single second that literally, and I think even right now,

400
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:24,400
you type, you go to Bing, you type a query and you take a snapshot and you hit refresh and take

401
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,880
another snapshot. You'll see that there is a big difference between the snapshot, no matter how

402
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,840
often you hit refresh or how quickly you hit refresh because we had new data coming in. We

403
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:46,720
have a, we have a very smart AI that's making new decisions. And so he thought he'd find bugs,

404
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:55,950
but then they were completely non-reproducible. And so in this case, it was frustrating with him

405
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:04,610
or for him because the thing that he had to do, the thing that was valuable is what's the pattern,

406
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:13,980
right? He couldn't just say what's occurring. He had to in some way, shape or form explain why is

407
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:20,780
is it occurring. He had also been one of those, one of those testers that said, I am never going

408
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:29,970
to learn the code. And so he felt stuck. And I, I, I advise him and I said, look,

409
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:40,060
my life is easier because I, I do know how to code on this front, but I don't see a reason right now

410
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:45,260
for you to let go of that principle. You just have to learn a new trick. You can't rely on your old

411
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:53,330
trick all by itself. Like you are a brilliant tester. You are able to connect thoughts between

412
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,690
the systems. Now you're going to have to figure out how to do that from a strategic sense,

413
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:05,730
not just a pure tactical sense. And he understood, but he did not find any way to do that.

414
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:11,330
And I don't even think he's at the company anymore. All right, man. So, yeah. So what I

415
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,130
want to get into next time when we chat is kind of how people can get in, like,

416
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:21,170
how does someone get into experimentation and what skills from testing help with that?

417
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,410
What's going to be hard to learn? How do you learn those things? What does that mean for the

418
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,610
folks you work with? Obviously, you can't just decide as a tester that you want to

419
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,250
do experimentation and have nobody around you to help you. So let's talk through that next time.

420
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,770
A little bit of a shorter podcast this time to kind of kick things off because

421
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:42,610
Zencaster was mean to me today and I have a hard stop at about two minutes ago.

422
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:49,090
So good catching up. It was good reminiscing a little bit. And thank you, everyone, for listening.

423
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,370
Have a great time. Stay safe. God bless the queen. And we'll talk to you soon. I'm Alan.

424
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,010
I'm Brent.

425
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:56,370
Bye bye.

426
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,650
Bye.
