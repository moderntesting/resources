1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:18,370
Brent almost spoke first, but I dove in ahead on the microphone and the cool thing is is that even if you would have spoken first

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,870
This morning. I would have edited you out

3
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,110
Cuz I'm a dick and I'm Brent

4
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,320
My

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,340
Goodness. Oh my goodness. So we are here for episode

6
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,220
66 double sixes double sixes I guess sixes

7
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,720
There's a friend of mine

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,480
This is total non. Well, it's tangential. I'm not gonna call a total non sequitur

9
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,060
His friend was in a band and the name of one of their albums was six six eight the neighbor of the beast

10
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,990
On the same side of the street

11
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:05,300
Hey

12
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,260
So we're gonna say something I was okay cool any exciting adventures in your life this week

13
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,900
Not so far week was pretty pretty straightforward. I'm heading to Helsinki today. Oh

14
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,520
So not yet

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,240
Not yet flying to Chicago shy town spending an hour and a half hour and a half there in the lovely airport and then flying from

16
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,920
There to Helsinki shy town Chicago. Oh got chai town. Yeah. Yeah, whatever

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,280
one thing speaking of so you're kicking off your kick-ass day of

18
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
Travel yeah

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,180
Travel I'm all packed, you know, I cannot invent

20
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,020
self

21
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,900
dry self

22
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,420
propelling everything fast enough and

23
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,280
Personal self propelling everything fast enough or teleportation after we record here

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,540
I'm heading into the office just long enough to pack up my desk and move it about 20 feet away

25
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,180
I'm giving my desk

26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,740
I have a new hire starting on my team

27
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,700
The Monday when I get back and I'm giving my desk to him so he can sit closer to the rest of the team

28
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,340
I'm sort of it's I'm overhead ish I can be moved anywhere. Yeah, that I completely understand

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,900
I do the same thing. Hey, I don't know if I've mentioned this and I'm pretty sure I haven't to you even

30
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,740
fairly close within a thousand miles proximity to Helsinki is

31
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,380
Moscow and I am heading to the Heisenberg testing conference in Moscow this December

32
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,310
Okay, are you gonna be hanging out in Helsinki until that time? No, I'm coming back

33
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,550
But I forgot I'm giving a talk. I'm gonna give

34
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,030
spin on my technical testing

35
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,870
Talk as a keynote. I started editing that yesterday because I'm gonna do another spin on it

36
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,750
I can't give the same exact same talk twice

37
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,910
So I was gonna make some small tweaks because I'm actually giving a talk when I'm in Helsinki and a meetup there

38
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,650
There are already like 50 people signed up at the Unity offices should be fun

39
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:16,740
I'm going to do a spin on technical testing talk I gave for the online testing conference. I

40
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,740
Started making some tweaks and ended up kind of redoing the whole presentation, which is good for me because it keeps it fresh

41
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,940
I like to change it and I'll probably do the same thing for Heisenberg

42
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,500
I'm also going to give a talk on the use and abuse of test automation

43
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,460
Which is?

44
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,780
Obviously related to part of my rant in that I'll make sure there's a good separation between the two for the talk

45
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,020
Are you gonna throw in some over the top embellishments?

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,400
for example

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,670
The reason why I ask will make the example super clear to you. Anyway, I

48
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,670
Think the testing community is is at a loss

49
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,830
Now that Whitaker is focused on how AI is gonna change. Oh, that's right

50
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:14,690
Nobody's being mad and with Bach kind of out of the picture to nobody's really out there causing controversy

51
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,310
Even when I go try and cause controversy and say things like the role of test automator is going away

52
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:27,030
I are I have people like Richard Bradshaw who make a living doing test automation going. Yeah, you're pretty much, right?

53
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,270
Or the role of tests is as information providers is going away. Yeah

54
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,210
like I mean

55
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,740
You're gonna have to like there's it there's an there is a hole there

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,640
I think you can fill it but you're gonna have to step up your game on there is

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,440
Let me think about it may not be the right audience to do that

58
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,940
but in my head, I just visit I just visualized a

59
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,830
Normal distribution curve. Yeah, and

60
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,970
with modern testing sort of being in the

61
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:07,830
Towards the front end of that wave of the curve, but keeping in mind that a lot of testing is

62
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,550
Back there right as I as I gesture

63
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,030
Yeah, no, no, you're I mean you're you're in the

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
You're in and from Mike's

65
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Knowledge of it you're near

66
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:28,200
Outlier on the the normal distribution, but you're not there yet. You're still kind of in the oh, yes is normal

67
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,320
But you know high on the normal range got a ways to go. Yeah, get a ways. I mean, it's fine much

68
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,880
You just got to be more you know plus plus on drama. All right, I will work on the drama

69
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,560
Hey, so I have something that was exciting this week. Oh, hey, Brent. Did you have anything exciting this week? Hey, yes

70
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
I did. Thank you for asking Alan

71
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,180
I'm a sucky co-host

72
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
My mother-in-law is right

73
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,180
You you're like you're like mom look there's a reason why the podcast starts with a

74
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,740
Anyway, no

75
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,540
There is speaking of

76
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,180
Vacuous holes there is now a vacuous hole in one of the bedrooms in my house

77
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,080
You mentioned your last in the last episode that you're approaching a

78
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,900
Partial empty nest

79
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:29,300
Hey, has it become the man cave yet? No, actually what we're gonna do is my a sewing room

80
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,180
No, my my middle son. Mm-hmm

81
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,420
Is gonna move into that in terms of like real estate

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,160
And not the master. That's the best of the non master bedrooms. Ah

83
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,760
So someone's getting an upgrade someone's getting an upgrade like yeah, that was an interesting experience

84
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,000
It's kind of like when someone leaves like if someone leaves the team

85
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,890
Like if it's a good office someone will immediately claim it versus let the new guy have it

86
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,990
Yeah, so just a couple of nutshell things that I learned from the experience

87
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,550
first and foremost

88
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,670
he's going to school in wazoo and

89
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:14,270
From where we're at that is a five and a half hour drive one way

90
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,310
Yep, unless it's winter then it's 12. I took

91
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:25,160
Wednesday off and I did that trip in one day there help them unpack back

92
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
That was extremely unpleasant

93
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,420
Yeah, because it's not all for those

94
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,340
Even Washingtonians wouldn't know that necessarily but it's not even freeway the whole way a big chunk of the trip

95
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,340
It's just on a two-lane road

96
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,630
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean

97
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,700
There's a thing I found the most interesting. So my son

98
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:55,170
while he was at at home the last few years he generally liked to spend most of his time in his room and

99
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,740
I've been prepping for empty nest syndrome for like the last three years

100
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,080
But when the day hits you no matter prep makes a difference

101
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,960
Right, so you talked last time like hey, yeah, no, I've

102
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,560
I've been since before the kids were born. I've been looking forward to when they leave and

103
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,320
You know what when you're in the moment

104
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,760
All of that stuff that you hold on to like I can't wait till they leave goes out the window

105
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,310
It was it was and I'm generally

106
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,240
Generally my EQ is quite low

107
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,500
People go. Oh, thank you. Carry much about me and I'm like, yeah

108
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,220
What is faking?

109
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,240
But with him

110
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
It was an interesting

111
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,560
For me. I'm just I had like a 10-minute speech that I wanted to talk to him as sort of the final words of daddiness and

112
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,300
That took me a good 40 minutes to get out

113
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,700
I

114
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:08,740
Print I've never known you to be long-winded. No, it wasn't was those long wind I was I kept on choking up

115
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,230
Yeah

116
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,900
and then going home

117
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,880
I go home and

118
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,160
It's still instinctive. I'm like, oh

119
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,040
Alex's cars not here. I wonder where he is. Oh

120
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
Anyway, yeah, that was

121
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,040
Life changing moments in the gentle, you know minor rites of passage

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,320
This is my first one through it and I'm like, oh, this is interesting

123
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,340
I got a ways to go any prediction on what episode we're on when my soon to be eighth grader goes off to college

124
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,620
So four years maybe two hundred two

125
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Can you imagine? Yeah. All right

126
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,180
Like your youngest

127
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:59,060
My youngest is going into seventh grade. Yeah, I'm actually thinking like when my youngest

128
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:07,060
Goes goes off. We'll probably be done with the podcast cuz you'll have been dead by then probably yeah. Yeah. Yeah

129
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,220
love the support

130
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,020
Hey, you know, I'm just a couple years away from being all about ageism

131
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,020
No, you ageist like I'll be joining your party. Yeah

132
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,860
although I have to say and

133
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,380
You can't tell on the podcast but I look much younger than Brad

134
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,230
Yes, he does. All right. Yeah. Hey

135
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:45,780
Once again, I would like to thank the fine folks at Techwell and star conferences for sponsoring this episode of a B testing

136
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,360
That's it

137
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,000
Kidding I'm kidding. I'm kidding. So I am

138
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,920
excited to say that

139
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:06,160
Star Canada is returning to Toronto. You've been to Toronto. I have not great city. They have a great soccer team

140
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I haven't even been to Canada in

141
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:16,300
Probably 20 years. Oh really? Yeah, I gave a few talks at Star Canada in Vancouver

142
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,660
Three years ago. It was just a fact. I love they take such good terror speakers. It's a great conference

143
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,700
Always a big fan of the star conferences. So returning to downtown Toronto in October

144
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,620
Which means that it's playoff time and Toronto FC are definitely making the playoffs

145
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:41,580
Just in case those two coincide I will stop I will stop promoting Toronto FC who are not a sponsor of this podcast and get back

146
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,660
To star so Toronto in October is star Canada

147
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:50,660
If you've not yet attended a star conference, there has never been a better time to join the fun

148
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,100
And I agree it will have over 50 testing sessions to choose from for a week packed with learning and networking

149
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,640
Opportunities and I would like to emphasize that luck always lots of great information in the talks

150
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,360
I think the networking and talking to people and spending time

151
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,740
Talking to other testers talking to speakers is a huge part of the value you get from a conference

152
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,260
conferring

153
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,560
Talking is so important

154
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:25,820
There will be keynotes from recognized thought leaders Dorothy Graham Graham who wrote a couple books on test automation been in testing for a while

155
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Very knowledgeable Jeffrey Payne

156
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,380
Good. I've met Jeffrey a few times

157
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,400
Knows a ton about agile. I'll just put it that way. I'm really really really respect him Isabel Evans and Janet Gregory

158
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,960
Who is Lisa Christmas co-author on the agile testing books?

159
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,880
Also for the first time at Star Canada, there will be a test lab where you can break software air quotes for a good cause

160
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:58,640
In fact, the test lab is partnering with play-doh testing an organization truly making a social impact by helping the Aboriginal people of Canada

161
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,280
Become experts in software testing

162
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:09,080
Students from play-doh testing will be attending star Canada on scholarship and will be assisting other attendees while in the test lab

163
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,640
That sounds fun. I love if you've been to a conference and they do like a test lab

164
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,400
I love diving into this. I love getting an excuse to I'm still trying to figure out what play-doh testing is. Oh, it's right

165
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
It's play-doh, it's P L A T. Oh, oh

166
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,760
It's my annunciation my enunciations, which is failing

167
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,200
Sorry, sorry. Sorry. Sorry

168
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Sorry

169
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,360
Students from play-doh testing will be attending star Canada on scholarship as I mentioned and assisting other attendees while in the test lab

170
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,640
If you are thinking about attending star Canada, and why wouldn't you be?

171
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,300
20% off your conference fees when you register with the promo code

172
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,270
A B testing all one word by September 15th

173
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,860
This is the biggest star discount offer to date

174
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,540
20% off and star was actually our first promo code

175
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,860
Yeah, and I will be I'll be doing a few star conferences coming up. I think I'm doing

176
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,750
star West

177
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,670
Next year. Oh, I'll be at some star conferences star. Oh, it's star West and a star East in 2018

178
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,490
I can't remember which one I'm doing first what the order is, but they're coming up

179
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:31,250
To register or learn more about the full conference program. You can go to their website at

180
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:37,110
Well dot TC whack go star Canada. I will post all of this information

181
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:43,390
In the blog post which I will likely I'll likely edit this podcast on my flight

182
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,060
Tonight interesting note remember to bring headphones. Okay?

183
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:55,680
Mental note anyway star Canada a be testing earbuds on the plane. That's excellent. I kind of need I

184
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:03,360
Guaranteed I'm sitting next to a screaming child or a very large person or

185
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,560
Someone who hasn't showered in three months

186
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,560
Yes, or all one person a screaming baby who hasn't showered

187
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,750
Hey, so one of the things before you go too much further, right?

188
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,810
So as we've talked about before

189
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:32,350
We don't view ourselves as a professional podcast necessarily. I think we are ebbing on

190
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,790
Professionalism, I don't know what you're talking about anyway continue. Okay, so we're half of this room

191
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:42,830
We're an ebbing the a half one half may be more professional than the other

192
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,350
but on the sponsors

193
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:53,730
We would not be sponsoring them on the show if if it's not if it was something we didn't agree with

194
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,170
Absolutely. We are we are

195
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,360
not

196
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,840
Anyway shape or form at a point where we're doing this

197
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,860
For the money we're doing this because we're old geezers and we like to talk and we want to share

198
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,680
absolutely and

199
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,070
the star

200
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,430
conferences

201
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,460
They are keeping pace. I think well

202
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,020
Certainly better than other conferences. I'm a perhaps

203
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:30,120
There's one other that I could think of that that is on the same line, but because this one's sponsored by Techwell

204
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,700
I'm not gonna mention that one, but if you're an avid listener to this

205
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
podcast because

206
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,340
you you value what we're saying because you think we're

207
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,100
Taking a different point of view that isn't

208
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:56,180
Out there. I'm gonna tell you if you want to get more information on this that is aligned with the content of what we talk about here

209
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:03,500
Consider star I agree with everything Brent said which is weird

210
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,940
Yeah, let's move on before you think too much about it

211
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,380
Yeah, I do want to reemphasize

212
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,580
We get spot as you can tell being a listener we get people asking if they can sponsor our show for a

213
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,790
Nominal fee and I'm always happy to do that if the product is something

214
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:31,800
That I think that I would want to use myself or I have used myself or something

215
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,540
I believe our listeners or I think it's it's yeah, it's in line with like yeah

216
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,460
This is this is I think beneficial happy to happy to pass on some savings opportunities. Yep

217
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,170
Okay, so on with the Kanban board over here the

218
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,050
Prioritized list and speaking of Kanban one thing I wanted to mention is

219
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,930
For many many years. I've used personal Kanban to sort of track my work and I and I merge it

220
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:06,970
It's it's work stuff. It's personal stuff everything from pay the bills to do these tasks

221
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:14,010
Interestingly, I stopped using personal Kanban about a year ago quite a while

222
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,270
And I did it because I had read

223
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,210
JD Myers book. I don't know if you read his book call getting results the agile way and

224
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:25,710
I was ready

225
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:33,190
I'm always ready to experiment and try something new and he and the idea is you list out. I'm putting this I apologize JD for

226
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,260
Totally paraphrasing your concepts down to nothing, but it's a good book

227
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,780
three goals for the month

228
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,480
That you set at the beginning of the month three goals for the week

229
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:51,740
You set on Monday morning or Sunday night and then three goals every day. I did that for a while and

230
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,490
What happened with that is I came I went in and out of it

231
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,870
There's some good things I liked and I'll come back to that in a minute

232
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,590
I used it for quite a while, but it ended up being more like a to-do list and

233
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,350
A to-do list in my experience ends up being stuff you never do

234
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,780
So I just I just did what needed to be done and didn't really track things that closely

235
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,100
I still liked doing the three goals for the month. I always did that I

236
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,780
Will probably continue to still do that

237
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,700
But the reason I bring it up is I went back to personal Kanban two weeks ago

238
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,380
but I'm gonna go back and give this a try and

239
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,790
It's like coming back to a long-lost friend my

240
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,970
my productivity and and

241
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,330
throughput are just

242
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,820
Thought that they were awful before but definitely accelerated

243
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,660
It's just it's a it's a I just wanted to give a shout out to it for those that haven't

244
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,220
Or haven't thought about doing it as a way to track the items that you work on but it's it's

245
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,060
for me, I

246
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:06,150
realized it definitely works and it's just something that it's it it's a way for me to get things done Oh

247
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:13,550
Jim Benson. Yeah, Jim Benson wrote a book on personal Kanban. I got to go to a seminar. He gave once which was excellent

248
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,900
and

249
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,740
anyway, just want to give a shout out to the concept because it's

250
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,700
No advertisement here

251
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,260
But if but it's sort of this along the same lines of it's something I believe in something

252
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,420
I think it would be beneficial beneficial to a B testing listeners

253
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:38,340
So I wanted to give it a few moments to share now Brent's making a face or he's I'm making himself

254
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:46,540
I'm making a face. Tell me why you're making a face. Mr. Brent getting things done the agile way and that's the implementation

255
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,430
well

256
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,430
WTF so I again

257
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:58,630
I squished an entire book which is pretty good and filled with some great anecdotes and stories down to a nutshell

258
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,540
It's an alternate prioritization scheme

259
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:08,860
I do and again one thing I will you want to know when I learned that party prioritization scheme

260
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,750
kindergarten, no, I once attended a

261
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,610
seminar

262
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:16,940
put on by Franklin Covey

263
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,340
whose job was to sell taskbooks and

264
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,980
This particular seminar was how to align the tasks of Microsoft Project

265
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Oh

266
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,260
my like

267
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,280
God, I'm like

268
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:42,440
Wow, I wish you had talked to me about before you started executing that model and abandoning personal count-bound because I would have

269
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:50,560
Mocked your waterfall. What what happened was and actually it worked at the task level

270
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,340
It doesn't work for me. It's worked when I needed sort of meta level goals like I need to

271
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:04,840
Something that I take care of this requires multiple things for me to do the personal bond addresses that I know personal compound is much better

272
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,020
and so I

273
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,900
Basically, I just fell away. I used it for I used personal compound for a long long time and

274
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:18,500
I just for some reason I read this book wanted to try something new and I tried it for a while and it was okay

275
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,660
But not good enough. I wanted to keep on using it

276
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:26,260
So I fell into nothing for a while and then just recently came back to personal compound. So that's kind of my

277
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:33,990
I don't know about how you feel about this. Like you mentioned you can't do the same presentation twice, right?

278
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:40,770
I will say that my view the agile community isn't innovating fast enough for

279
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,560
me at this moment in time because

280
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:53,970
If I'm executing the same model over and over and over and over and over and over and over even though it's the in

281
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,110
My view the best model there is I get bored with it

282
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:04,010
And I'm like and this is why this is why I tried the new system because this is exactly why I don't give the same

283
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:09,250
Presentation twice as I want to even if I give it the second time my attempt is to make it better and it's worse

284
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,890
Now well, I changed it at least I tried something new

285
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:17,190
Same thing here. I tried something new. I always want to tweak

286
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,930
What I'm doing what I'm building

287
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:23,410
Anything I want to tweak and see if I can make it better

288
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,590
See if I can make it more interesting see if I can learn more from it

289
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,650
So what I've done

290
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,490
When I first learned personal Kanban, I I ran with it for a very long time

291
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:40,770
and then I went and did the safe training and then I took some concepts from safe and

292
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:46,440
tweaked how I did my personal Kanban, but now I'm at a point where

293
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,280
There's no difference between my team board and my board. I just put it all on the one

294
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,250
Right in as you know, I've I've done

295
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,490
I still have to document this one day, but I've I've

296
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,220
Made my own version of

297
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,920
An agile process that in my view is a is

298
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,950
It's probably context sensitive, but it's very effective for the world

299
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,670
I live in and it takes bits and pieces from these different models

300
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,200
But it's now on the same. It's all on the same board

301
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,790
So

302
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:32,190
Let's go into tangent bill a bit. Okay, did a little theme song for that

303
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:36,510
Recently had a discussion and a

304
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,710
Something I want to try discussion with one of my team members

305
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:42,090
it led to something I want to try is I

306
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,750
am in charge of

307
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,920
More teams than I can count

308
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:53,200
More features than I can count more feature teams and I can't count very high, but it's more than I'll fit on my fingers

309
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,360
each has their own product backlog and of course because

310
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,180
My team members are embedded on feature teams. Their work items are are part of the feature team

311
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,080
boards I

312
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,680
Was thinking it would be cool. I want to start

313
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,360
And I'll get into this tangent in a minute

314
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,020
I want to start finding ways for a few more cross team sort of projects and more sharing

315
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:24,580
One of the things I think I'm going to do and actually one of the things I'm going to do is find a way to tag

316
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,730
items effect I'm acting like this is difficult. I'm going to tag the

317
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:37,010
The quality the QA items on the individual boards so that I can view a master board of all the anyway

318
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:42,330
Actually, anyone can view a master board of all the QA items across the organization. Okay

319
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,630
Hoping that if people view that they might inspire like oh, this is kind of like this

320
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,470
We should talk about this as people are working on some more cross functional tools

321
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,510
across team tools find some ways to connect on those and this leads into

322
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,370
my team needs some

323
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:07,390
My organization services organization needs a manager who can actually complete a sentence for one

324
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:11,230
Definitely leadership to back to number one

325
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,300
As I show my favorite finger

326
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,280
Yep

327
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,520
My team the organization needs some

328
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,360
There's some tools we need across the services organization

329
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:26,880
Okay

330
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,240
What the engine team at unity add has is something they called a toolsmith org small number of people that kind of old miss

331
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,640
Toolsmiths Oh Smith's okay who work on infrastructure and tools for the testing org

332
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,640
Ideally, I would have a few people in the services org dedicated to that

333
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,910
I don't have any head count for that

334
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:51,290
I can start peeling some people toward that over the long term or

335
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:55,310
I could do kind of what I did when I was on the Xbox team

336
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,630
Where I had no one reporting to me but was in charge of building all of the

337
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,550
Organizing the building of all of the testing tools for Xbox

338
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:12,380
Okay, and I'm hoping that in building some visibility

339
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,060
Towards what we need across the org that I can start building some cross

340
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:24,040
Team hey, I don't want to call them a virtual team because you know, I'm allergic to that term cross

341
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,340
team

342
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,140
Initiatives to build some of those things and get people working together

343
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:35,680
It's not open source, but generally the term I use under this is shared source

344
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,120
Yeah, and shared initiative. This is this is my world of Warcraft guide to project management

345
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,470
I will say that once you break the boundary and

346
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,430
Between the organizations and you get people

347
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,630
volunteering

348
00:27:52,630 --> 00:28:00,590
To do that shift magic really starts to happen. Yeah, and but it's so hard to get them to do that. I

349
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:07,630
This is where I live. I I'm a as you know, I'm a more of a community builder than a manager

350
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:14,710
I am confident and excited more excited than confident that I can get this to happen. I think I have never

351
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:20,580
Never worked with the team more eager to learn and try new things

352
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:27,580
Than this organization at Unity. So I'm it frightens me sometimes when I plant seeds and they grow so fast

353
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,020
if I were in your shoes

354
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,840
With what I understand of what you

355
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:39,450
What powers you have in versus what you don't

356
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:42,410
one of the things that I may

357
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,730
consider is

358
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:52,030
To bootstrap this bootstrap this along with sort of a long-term strategy, which you'll it's context sensitive

359
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:58,730
I don't have enough information to guide you on it offer a one-off bonus program where

360
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:05,170
Successfully completing and checking in work that belongs to another team

361
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:11,360
You're gonna artificially reward that with a one-off sort of yeah, I do want to

362
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,840
There is the idea of the spot bonus that I want to I want to be able to yes, I

363
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,070
I'm gonna figure out a way to make that happen. Yeah, and

364
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,450
The great thing is is unlike Microsoft that would be a pipe dream and ever get to do actually when I there's something

365
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:29,690
I think I want to make happen

366
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,810
It does it's not like automatically it happens

367
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:36,730
But usually we can find a way there were times in my career where I had the ability to influence it

368
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:44,090
But now that I'm in a front manager role the incentives have to be more Daniel pink related and not necessarily money

369
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:51,170
Yeah, and ideally which are more powerful as we as we know, but they're harder to you can do getting it across

370
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Definitely do both

371
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,280
Don't do money and not

372
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,090
Have not and not praise you have to do both. Hey speaking of praising. Yeah, let's go on to the next topic. Oh

373
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,370
Yeah, which has very little to do with praising

374
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:14,060
In fact maybe the opposite yeah, so you wrote the item down

375
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,780
I'll let you set this up and then I'll make a face and tear it apart

376
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:22,240
Yeah, so it's it's I've agreed with you enough for one day. Just so you know

377
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,150
Sorry

378
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:27,560
Sorry, yeah, my

379
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:35,860
How many times can Alan interrupt there is so at Microsoft we're at the we're out of the review process and

380
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,320
This topic is something that Alan and I have been sort of talking about

381
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:50,860
Outside of the podcast and given our last theme was really around management and leadership our last podcast. Yep. I remember I was there. Yep

382
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,090
one of the things I realized that we really didn't talk about in terms of

383
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,050
Management philosophy and

384
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:09,600
One of the worst the most unpleasant things that managers have to do and that is communicating bad messages

385
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,500
Now I'll start off

386
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:21,160
basically saying at this one of the things that's a full philosophical foundation for me is

387
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,190
Surprises and adjectives are

388
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,790
criminal

389
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:33,550
Surprise what do you mean by adjectives because I've said the first statement before but

390
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,430
Adjectives I know what an adjective is but give me an example in the situation

391
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,430
This person was awesome this person sucked

392
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,960
The the well those are judgments which are also bad

393
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:55,210
but adjectives best worst

394
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,400
Adjectives are criminal when it comes to

395
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:05,480
But it certainly when it comes to communicating bad message messages in my humble opinion. Yeah, and

396
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,240
Good, I get that and the that first part of it is the most important. So a bad message should never be a surprise

397
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,560
for sure, it's

398
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,840
We had

399
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,330
And I'll bring us up a couple times because I've had even as a non manager

400
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,410
I took a lot of management training at Microsoft

401
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:29,890
Just because I was in a leadership position because that's to go because I was in engineering excellence as part of what I did

402
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:35,170
So I've had a few decades of different sorts of management training

403
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,210
I had a leadership training at unity took two days and

404
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,880
Of course knowing you knowing me I walked in very skeptical

405
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,920
Then ah, yeah, it was the best

406
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,200
Management training I've ever had

407
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:00,200
Nice and not to say it was awesome from end to end. There are a few points where I did ask the BTF

408
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,560
but it was great because I could ask the BTF and and

409
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,970
Just unity culture of transparency and respect if I do it. I said I don't get how this it was great

410
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:14,370
Yeah, great. Great. Um, and they there was a couple things that

411
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,490
One of the bits of feedback I gave they asked us to sort of invent like not invent

412
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,970
but think of some critical feedback you need to give someone in your team and

413
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,680
Frame it in this framework, which I may talk about in a little bit if relevant and I did it

414
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,160
But I said I told him this feels contrived because

415
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,860
by the time

416
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,180
The conversation that it would never get this far to this

417
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,580
I would have mentioned this to them. We would have had discussions about this five ten times before we had this

418
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,100
Air-quote fierce feedback conversation

419
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,510
Okay, so which goes into the surprise it's like

420
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,230
brit

421
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,470
When you interrupt me on the podcast

422
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,000
It causes me to feel blah blah blah or and and this little lot to happen

423
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,560
And so what's up?

424
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:11,810
So what should we what's your point? What should we do about it?

425
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,810
Ignore your feedback and versus just ignoring him for having going bread. I hate you. I quit

426
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,610
You want to bring up that critical feedback

427
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,130
Wait, so as soon as you need it the the punch line to this is is

428
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,250
To then shift to Socratic and say what should we do about it? No, I'm

429
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,880
I'm uh

430
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:41,040
Giving a very bad example of giving you to the point and critical feedback

431
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,000
before it escalates to a point where it's a

432
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,080
it's uh

433
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,360
a job ending or a review diving feedback. Yes

434
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,120
and

435
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,680
As you know, and this is one of my beefs at Microsoft is I've had

436
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,030
Almost every single one of my managers only gave me feedback during reviews

437
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,800
Especially my last one. I had one manager who I was

438
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,080
Maybe two months into a new job at Microsoft and I asked him. Hey, how am I doing? His response was?

439
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
Oh, wow. I didn't know you're gonna put me on the spot

440
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,460
Um

441
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,900
Yeah, I know that one too and often you talk about review season while i'm on a little bit of a soapbox and rant

442
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,660
Yep, as you know many Microsoft managers will customize your feedback

443
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,360
based on

444
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:42,000
How much of a raise or not raise they're able to give you well. Yeah, there's I mean

445
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,000
We got to quote unquote own the message

446
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,400
Yeah

447
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
but the thing is is that

448
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,040
and just going back to the original point is

449
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,180
if

450
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,000
you

451
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,040
I'm

452
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,800
My blood's boiling a little bit while I try and talk about this is that you have to give people that feedback

453
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,280
All the time. So you I you have one-on-ones with your team frequently as do I as do most good managers

454
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,400
That can't just be a status report meaning I

455
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,320
Sometimes it is I try to explicitly ban

456
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,780
I got I have a daily stand-up. I have a weekly retrospective

457
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,040
um

458
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:33,400
If i'm not aware of the status, there's something else really wrong

459
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,660
Yeah, it's a little different for me. Well, i'll take a little bit of status just because i'm so spread out

460
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,860
And it's mainly as a way for me to draw out ways that I can help help you

461
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
You as my employee. Yeah

462
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,580
So i'll say well, tell me more about that. Is that is there is that going as well as it could or something?

463
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,260
I can do that those sorts of conversations. I think if I were in your role

464
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,820
There's one technique an old manager of mine taught me if I were in your role

465
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,920
I would for sure do this

466
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,720
Uh, because you're you're trying to find those things where hey

467
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,670
I'm a manager. I have resources

468
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Um, I know stuff

469
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,540
I'm talking to your peers

470
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,900
Let me help you and kind of goes to what I was talking about last time about

471
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,260
My perspective that i'm a management service provider and not a manager

472
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,380
Um, but the the technique is very simple

473
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,010
I tell tell my reports

474
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:38,690
Look, I don't care if you do it even literally two minutes before the meeting

475
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,460
But I want you to send me an agenda for our 101

476
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:47,060
Now this sounds super managerial

477
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,500
But what happens when you send the agenda and you also say

478
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,860
I don't give a rat's ass about status reports

479
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
It forces them to think through

480
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,480
What the hell they need you for?

481
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
Yeah, and I do that for yeah

482
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,460
I don't do that consistently

483
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,500
But for what I've found is when I find that that doesn't come out naturally in a one-on-one

484
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,060
I begin to ask for that or it sort of comes out organically for having like these

485
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,620
If we're not having good conversations, I definitely fall to that but I should do that for everyone on the team

486
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,680
Send me send me one to one to n number of things you want to talk about

487
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,600
Because I like then framing that is and it helps me figure out how I can help you

488
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,530
I specifically frame it as look i'm your msp

489
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,360
We're meeting

490
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,120
There there's some value you're hoping to to get from me from your time invested. Mm-hmm

491
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,530
Think about it about what?

492
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,160
That might be

493
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,240
Got it, right because so often

494
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,760
You have these one-on-ones and it ends up being a defensive conversation along the lines of

495
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Why something hasn't been done?

496
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,730
Right, and i'm like, I don't want to talk about that in one of ones

497
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,990
Right, except for where actually I take that back except for where that does

498
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:13,670
That is related to that individual's career growth

499
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,080
Like as an example, I run a data science team, but as they've blogged about

500
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,270
It's not a specialist team

501
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,860
I have people who are comfortable with some things and they can integrate but they're developers

502
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,680
that report to me

503
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,480
And for the time period that we've been in

504
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,450
Up until now that's great

505
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,250
But it's not going to help them in the next couple of years

506
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:45,810
And so i'm having conversations around. Okay. How do you go this even further?

507
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,030
But i'm communicating bad messages

508
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:52,050
Hey, someone stepped over the line

509
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:59,250
Or it's just not working out. You're now at the 11th 11th time having the same conversation

510
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,650
And you're realizing it's not a fit and you're firing them

511
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,010
Or it's a review process and whatever your company's review process is

512
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:14,210
Most people look at the numbers and that is ultimately the review they care about

513
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,800
and

514
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
How how do you communicate those things?

515
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,680
now

516
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,640
That that particular is where I think adjectives

517
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,880
suck

518
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,840
Yeah, and my my absolute least favorite one

519
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,240
Oh, yeah, you're getting this because you weren't visible enough. Oh my god that adjective. I just these are my

520
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,040
But there is a better way of doing it instead of adjectives for example

521
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,360
communicate

522
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,080
actions

523
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,440
uh

524
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,440
One of the things that I have found

525
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:56,600
Extremely helpful in this one. I've actually so back in the day when you remember when we had these labels at microsoft

526
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,320
Like underperform limited

527
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,560
Yeah, that thing

528
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,400
I've I've actually communicated a ul message and had the guy thank me afterwards

529
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,200
Yeah

530
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,000
I have

531
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,840
any manager

532
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,440
Managers don't like

533
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,240
Giving harsh feedback. It's a difficult thing for anyone to do

534
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,680
But it's it's if you need to be a machine build need to be able to do it

535
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,480
I fired someone once I had to let someone go they weren't a fit and they thanked me as well

536
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,590
um

537
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:33,830
But the reason was surprising the reason was immediately. Thank you. Yes

538
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:41,210
It was not a surprise. Oh, I see because we when there's a performance problem. You need to bring it up immediately

539
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:45,830
and talk about the impact it's causing and then have

540
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:52,390
Continued conversations about that if things aren't improving and when it got to the point it was not

541
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:57,190
Just like surprises or criminal the firing was not a surprise

542
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,930
He and I both knew it wasn't a fit

543
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:06,610
uh, I said it's not about you personally just not it's not working out and

544
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:12,210
He thanked me in in that that entire 15 minute conversation where I

545
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,570
Was prepared for him to be defensive and and in my head i'm thinking now is not the time to be defensive

546
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,930
We've talked about you know, we've talked about this before but it was

547
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:25,670
Again, because I had had multiple conversations leading up to it

548
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,350
the

549
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,190
letting the person go

550
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:31,910
Was pleasant on both sides. I was I was

551
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,870
uh proud of the way he acted and

552
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:38,710
And happy for both of it both of us. I just kind of worked out that way

553
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:44,310
He will be successful and probably is successful in some other position now, but at the time

554
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,630
uh, it just again, it worked out like it's supposed to

555
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,470
I

556
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,500
one of the things that I have

557
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,780
So first and foremost it has actually been a very long time

558
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:04,980
Since i've actually had to take the step of actually firing somebody because a microsoft is moving to another team, right? No, I don't

559
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
Sorry dig dig

560
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:15,700
Well, actually so in some cases I will if it's a if it's purely a fit problem, right for sure, right? Um, there's

561
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,780
I I had to deal with that just in the last couple of years

562
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,460
Where what they like to do and what they did well

563
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,340
Was not something

564
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,140
My organization was willing to pay them to do it

565
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,100
I also believe this goes a little bit what talked about last time

566
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:38,260
I'll let you get back on topic is our job as a manager is to find the net always be looking for the next best

567
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,740
role for all of our employees and

568
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,340
Ideally that role is something on our teams because if they're especially they're a top performer, but sometimes it's not

569
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,940
No

570
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:53,940
Sometimes that next big role i'm moving one of the people on my team at unity to a different team outside of services because that's

571
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,700
Where their passions are where they're uh where they have a lot of excellence both demonstrated and past experience

572
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:04,900
So it's this just the right thing to do. I I I completely agree. There's an emotional argument to that

573
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,220
There's a there's a logical argument to as well for um, for example

574
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:17,640
Uh, so I generally take the the more logical argument, right? I don't view firing as a negative thing

575
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,840
Particularly with the strategy that I do where I I find surprises

576
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,570
criminal

577
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:30,450
Right. I well in advance like i'm pretty good at seeing at this point in time

578
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:35,570
I'm pretty good at seeing patterns and seeing the future particular individuals and see when

579
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,770
They're on a path that's going to diverge and and sort of the timeline when it's going to be

580
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Negative for them. Yeah

581
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,240
And get them ahead and get them starting to act

582
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,040
And I try to stay in the coaching realm as much as possible like the last individual I talked

583
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,040
Was just in the last couple of years. I said look if if there isn't a change

584
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:05,040
You're not going to be talking to coach brent anymore. You're going to be talking to manager brent

585
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,800
And manager brent

586
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,600
Has to worry about his business and has to worry about how his resources are applied

587
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,160
And there are very specific things that he has to do when things are out of alignment

588
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,800
So what and we don't want to have a conversation with manager brent

589
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:27,160
So let's figure out how we solve this while it's still coach brent

590
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,000
So what techniques or frameworks do you have for giving if any?

591
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:37,660
For or maybe it's contextual for giving that critical feedback when needed. It's always contextual

592
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,280
but

593
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,320
there is

594
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,600
I will say that if there is secret sauce to this

595
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,080
is

596
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:54,880
Your feedback cannot contain adjectives. They must instead contain

597
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,160
actions

598
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,640
So I think of it as a retrospective

599
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,120
And then I go

600
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,160
So people want to know how do they get in this space?

601
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,160
Okay, so yeah, you're going to have to cover some sort of contextual

602
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:13,460
You know what lettuce here?

603
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,460
But what I then do in in my conversation is i'll go

604
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,750
Hey

605
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,750
You know looking back on this now

606
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:24,790
It's very clear to me

607
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,830
That if you had taken these sets of actions instead of the ones that you took

608
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,980
That would have led you to a much better place

609
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,440
And moving forward it is critical

610
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,700
That you continue to take these type of actions, but that's not the stuff I love to do

611
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:46,180
It's an often often thing because another thing that that happens

612
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,780
Is people like but i'm awesome

613
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,580
Why I why aren't I being rewarded for being awesome?

614
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,880
and

615
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,040
This a lot of times employees don't really understand this

616
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:06,360
Fitness concept it sounds like management speak

617
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:08,770
I'm like look

618
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:12,610
I'll give you i'll give you an example. Uh, I had a guy

619
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:16,960
A few years back was just a talented

620
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,920
Uh build engineer one of the best

621
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,290
But I was in an organization that gave a rat's ass

622
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,760
And and i'm like it's so you know going back to what I talked about last time that's that

623
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,120
That um venn diagram what you do

624
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,960
Well what you like to do and what you can get paid to do and I said look

625
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:40,080
Yeah, you know what what you're doing is valuable

626
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:47,040
But it's never going to it's never going to be in this team and the problems that we have

627
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,120
It's never going to stack high

628
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:51,460
invaluable results

629
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:53,410
It's just not

630
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:58,290
I want to be clear on one thing which is that when you give the critical fee, it's not always about firing someone

631
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:02,290
No, it's about more often than not. It's just about course corrections

632
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:08,610
So i'm fully it's always about course. I I mentioned in the last podcast. It's more relevant now

633
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:12,690
This book by I think it's kim scott

634
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:19,970
I forget her name a book called radical candor which I read and now i'm rereading

635
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:22,920
it's

636
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,440
Some of it's

637
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,640
Actually, it's it's very good. It's one of the best management books i've read and i'm not sure I but i'm not sure why yet

638
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,720
I'm trying to figure that out

639
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:39,400
It's maybe like when I sometimes I read sometimes I read a book it connects things I believe in and adds some more

640
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,100
Background to them, but it's how to give that

641
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,520
how

642
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,740
Some of it it's like tying

643
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:52,100
Some good frameworks for giving feedback in radical candor. It reminds me a little bit of the this

644
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:55,460
Model we call fierce feedback at unity, which is uh

645
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,180
Sort of what's the way I remember it is what so what now what what's next?

646
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,660
And they get about the action. So I tell you you did this and it caused this action and then

647
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,160
We discussed before I even tell i'm not going to going to tell you right away

648
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,000
If I have ideas how to do that, i'm gonna say brent when you do this, it causes this problem

649
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,160
And then i'm gonna let you talk

650
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:26,040
I'm gonna let you lead the conversation from there. So yeah, maybe you realize it. Maybe you don't maybe have an excuse

651
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,320
Maybe you don't but we're gonna have a discussion about it for a while and then

652
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:31,480
when

653
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,360
We feel like that discussion important thing on that one

654
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,500
Actually is that you're discussing the employee's behavior

655
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:46,680
Not the employee right when you do this what it causes when you don't get your work done on time

656
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,000
It slows down the whole team from getting this getting this the this deliverable done

657
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,830
every human being

658
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,360
is awesome

659
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,320
but

660
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,880
in this in in the environmental context

661
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,480
Their behaviors in one environment

662
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:10,360
Maybe a winning success equation and but in another environment the exact opposite

663
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,840
Yeah a big difference I know of for example between

664
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,510
google and microsoft

665
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:22,950
There's google's in the news a lot and and they're being framed as sort of a utopian

666
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:29,590
Technology company and i'm like, yeah, you know what that's probably hyperbole, but I can see where they're coming from

667
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:32,390
The google model sort of rewards

668
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:35,320
similar thinking

669
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,560
convergence consensus

670
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,760
The microsoft model is significantly more competitive

671
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:47,800
Definitely. No your idea is stupid. It's built around that it's it's too definitely to a fault. Yeah

672
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,120
Well, I think they're both

673
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:57,400
Dysfunctional to some degree. Let me finish with what so what now what what's next and tie that back to radical candor and maybe reasons

674
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,520
It's overlapping. So you have this discussion about the behavior

675
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,160
And then at some point you go so and this could be a five minute conversation could be an hour conversation

676
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,560
uh

677
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,670
So what do we do about it?

678
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:14,390
And maybe maybe you have some ideas become some together. Okay, then what are the next steps?

679
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:16,470
Maybe it's to sync in a week. Maybe it's to

680
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,830
Let me give you an example. I'm gonna try this a radical candor and give an example

681
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:23,750
One of the things you want to do in feedback is give feedback

682
00:51:24,070 --> 00:51:29,190
As close to the moment that it happened than necessary like the microsoft model is in the review

683
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,950
When you're getting your crappy performance number you go. Yeah back in january you were a dick in that meeting

684
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,510
And that really affected really affected the vp's view of you. So you're getting a poor score

685
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:42,470
Well, yeah

686
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,430
The other problem with that is of course a lot of the times

687
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:50,610
The consequences aren't readily apparent. Yeah, so instead

688
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:56,530
Uh, I can apply that and this is very much the radical candor model is give that feedback in the moment

689
00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:02,050
Say brent when you interrupt like after a meeting we walk out of hey brent when you interrupt in a meeting it

690
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,610
Makes people feel like you don't care about what they have to say

691
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,910
And this is all like in a two-minute conversation

692
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:10,100
so

693
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,500
Next time you're in a meeting and you have and maybe we can

694
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:15,620
Depends on the people and context we can figure out a plan for that

695
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:18,980
But in that moment give that and again, these are contrived examples

696
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:25,700
But the moment you observe a behavior or an action that you want to correct give that correction and just

697
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:32,900
Hopefully you've built a culture of trust this actually ties to the pat lynchioni work on trust

698
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,560
Yep

699
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,920
So I want to have that culture of trust and respect

700
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:43,520
So that I can just give you that feedback and you don't take it personally go. We have good feedback and I don't have to put

701
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,400
Pretty flowery words around it that that

702
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:55,430
Lead you they don't the problem with some of these things like a lot of times managers

703
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:04,020
Um will will do oh, yeah. No, I love you, but uh, my manager hates your guts. So, you know own the message, right?

704
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:09,460
Um, no, but the thing is I I actually agree with that portion of owning the message

705
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,560
because what you're saying

706
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,440
You're telling your employee. Oh by the way you got victimized

707
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,240
But it's okay. I did too

708
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:27,170
Great. You know what? I don't want to be victimized. Give me some feedback that allows me to

709
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:29,970
learn from my mistakes and and

710
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:34,610
Gets me puts me in control of my own destiny and prevent this from happening again

711
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,970
That's right the primary reason why I hate adjectives

712
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:40,770
because when when

713
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:42,050
when

714
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,450
You are told that you are awesome

715
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,880
Or you are told that you are that you suck

716
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
You you're not being communicated

717
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,120
What behaviors you have that are being rewarded or penalized?

718
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:01,560
Absolutely. So you're just as in the dark except you either have more or less money

719
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,160
And you don't always and this is a microsoft thing too, but uh, don't always tie

720
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,720
feedback to

721
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,570
rewards

722
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,250
You think they don't always say no don't i'm i'm telling you don't

723
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:21,970
Microsoft and you just in your example, you just said you do you just tied it to money again

724
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:25,170
And it's it's reviewed season. So it's it's inevitable but

725
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:28,290
Yeah, unfortunately microsoft's not

726
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:36,120
Very good at that yet. It's still part of our life blood in our culture. Yeah, and right many many episodes ago. We talked about our

727
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,080
ways to fix that but

728
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,840
I don't care anymore

729
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,960
No, no, so um an old manager of mine who has left

730
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:47,160
Microsoft and gone to another big company

731
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,960
In seattle that is not amazon. I like their review model

732
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,880
what they do

733
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:57,220
everybody

734
00:54:57,220 --> 00:54:59,620
Gets their bonus. There's no competing for bonus

735
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:04,550
And then the manager has discretionary spot bonus money

736
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,580
That he can reward throughout the entire year

737
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,700
As that was kick ass. Here's a couple thousand

738
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,790
so

739
00:55:14,790 --> 00:55:16,790
you have people

740
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,390
On a continuous basis trying to deliver awesome

741
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,760
versus

742
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:29,160
Spend a whole year strategizing around. Okay. Yeah, this is how i'm gonna tear alan down to make sure and again

743
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,960
microsoft is very competitive and a very

744
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:38,200
Nepotistic the part. Is that can make that a word? Uh environment where if you

745
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,720
Suck up to your manager you will be rewarded

746
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:46,530
You can be yeah, that's right. You can be rewarded. Yeah in radical candor

747
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:53,490
Talks about the google review promotion model where it's not the manager's choice at all to promote someone

748
00:55:54,200 --> 00:56:00,520
The manager can be involved of course, but you put together a packet. It's called a I forget what it's called a

749
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,960
They call it a packet. Uh, it's a portfolio of your work

750
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:06,950
Which is reviewed by?

751
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:11,750
A peer group a level above the level you want to go to yep

752
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:15,830
And they go yay nay and if that happens great

753
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,430
if not, they get some feedback there and it's

754
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:26,310
And I had heard about it all of the people that they're evaluating or none or any place in between

755
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:33,670
Yeah, and so the quality bar I had heard about it before but reading the book reminded me of what a fair

756
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,310
model that is

757
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,310
It's fairer than what we're used to

758
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:40,720
But there is an update

759
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
I don't have all of the details

760
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,920
But much like anything else that's written word

761
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,600
And google contains smart people just like microsoft does

762
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,480
It is not an ungameable system

763
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,840
Every system is gameable. So with enough time and enough

764
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,640
Um pattern matching

765
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,120
Yeah, you could write your stack of things

766
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,040
um

767
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,610
that

768
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,130
fulfills

769
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,130
what is uh

770
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:18,450
Unwritten but known criteria sure and back in the day like in 15 years ago if microsoft had done this I can guarantee you

771
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,170
Like wrote test harness

772
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:25,490
Would have been on the list in test. Yeah, one of the things uh, and i'm surprised

773
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:32,050
Actually, if this existed 15 years ago the thing that you did where you typified everybody and created the test segments

774
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:37,170
That would have been used for so much evil for sure for sure. And I think that

775
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,720
I lost track of how many reviews this was microsoft had while I was there

776
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,640
but

777
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:48,760
Pretty much they last until they've been gamified by too many people and then they go to a new model

778
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,780
Yeah, and my favorite part about how microsoft does it is they go to they go to the new model

779
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,520
Literally two weeks after you've written the review

780
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,800
You know

781
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:09,000
A lot of times the whole surprise thing isn't something that uh, my company in my humble opinion

782
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,600
Sort of agrees with up and down the stack and i'm pretty certain that actually executives would

783
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,360
but it's

784
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,360
um, it's it's

785
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:23,800
Legal that's that that's putting these sort of constraints on there one of the ways to work through this

786
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:31,160
I'll just go through it quickly. We'll talk about this in terms of like project but a lot of um,

787
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,480
so safe has a model

788
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:40,280
Alan was telling me earlier that my amazon has the model that before you start doing a chunk of work

789
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,760
Write the press release announcing the completion of that work. It's an extension of bdd. Yeah, um

790
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:52,900
In my team we we go through this we have it's acceptance criteria

791
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:57,380
We have a process we call the definition of done and i'm like it's not done until

792
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,020
A customer can do these four things. Yep. I I don't care how it's implemented

793
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,060
similar thing

794
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,540
It it it works in a in a nutshell. So if in the connect

795
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:16,100
Or what we what micro connect is the microsoft review the name of the microsoft review process if in the review

796
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:18,180
So if you have some of these

797
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,500
It would work positive and negative

798
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,680
It works better if you have an official review process that's frequent

799
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,380
Because things in today's world change so fast

800
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:32,260
But you can do the same thing

801
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,100
I could say alan

802
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,700
You know what? We're gonna you're gonna be writing another connect in a few months

803
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,260
What I would like you to do

804
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,260
After we're done with this one is I want you to go write that connect

805
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:48,720
I want you to write up right now. Yeah

806
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,200
What you did?

807
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,880
in the next three months

808
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:54,920
Yep, I get it

809
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,760
that process

810
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,200
As long as that person's continuously rereading it or revising it or rethinking it

811
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,360
right, um

812
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,610
That's going to help them

813
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,010
Stay on the path towards the goal

814
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:13,410
So it reminds me one of the things that when I was doing

815
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:18,690
When I was doing mentoring at microsoft, one of the things that always have my serious mentees do

816
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:21,670
is ones are like

817
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:26,090
Obsessed with career growth or interested in career growth or wanted to do some sort of transformation

818
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:28,970
Is I said write a paragraph?

819
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:31,030
that

820
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:35,110
That is written that someone is writing about you six months from now. How would they describe you?

821
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:37,110
How is someone describing you six months from now?

822
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:41,430
And I make him write that paragraph and that would be the framework of what we talked about

823
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:46,630
Over the next n number of sessions. It's like, how are you moving toward that? How are you becoming?

824
01:00:46,790 --> 01:00:50,390
I want to be an accomplished author. Well, how much are you writing? So I I I

825
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:54,950
That model is super helpful. Uh, I I love it

826
01:00:55,350 --> 01:01:00,790
It reminds me of my favorite lewis carroll quote if you don't know where you're going any road will get you there

827
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,460
and a lot of the times with the mentees is

828
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,420
They don't know where they're going

829
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:12,780
And so you spend time and you say you you you get them to come up with their own way

830
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:18,340
Right the the challenge is yeah, sure. I have a lot of experience. I could sit down

831
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:20,820
I'm not your manager, but I could easily tell you where to go

832
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:27,350
But that's not what's helpful what's helpful is for you to learn how to control your own destiny

833
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:32,390
And how to align it with your business and your managers and all of those things if you don't

834
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,190
Employees may not think about where they want to go

835
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:38,710
Other than i'm just going to come to work every day and show up and do my thing

836
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:44,950
Right, but then those are the people who go. Well, wait a minute. I'm awesome. How come I didn't get a good review

837
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,220
Well, you know you decided to to track your career

838
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,980
Uh, you know very similar to a butterfly flying at the whims of the wind

839
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:02,010
Sometimes the wind goes in a positive direction and sometimes the wind goes straight into the volcano

840
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:04,870
right if you

841
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:06,940
If you don't like that model

842
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:12,700
Quit being a butterfly. So one of the things this is probably waxing political now, but one of the things

843
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:17,500
I grew up with a father that got paralyzed in the vietnam war

844
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:21,880
Half of his body paralyzed he went in right handed came out left handed

845
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,000
he does not agree

846
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,880
with the ada

847
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,720
and

848
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,320
a lot of these sort of

849
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,080
mentalities around

850
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,890
protecting

851
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:42,660
The disabled he his philosophy is much more along the lines of yep. You got delta crappy hand of cards

852
01:02:43,850 --> 01:02:49,370
It doesn't change what you need to do in terms of play that hand the best that you can always

853
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,540
so us as humans

854
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,980
We don't have any

855
01:02:54,980 --> 01:03:00,180
Control over whether or not we get victimized but being a victim is a choice

856
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:09,690
Absolutely, and some people are happier with that and that's fine. That's a good choice if that makes you happy if it makes you feel better

857
01:03:10,570 --> 01:03:15,050
Having this as a label. That's fine. I'm not judging on that but but

858
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,740
Those choices have consequences

859
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:22,340
And a lot of times you can't have the cake and eat it too

860
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,150
Anyway, I think we can end now. All right. Hey, I am

861
01:03:28,790 --> 01:03:30,790
Alan and i'm brent. We'll see you next time
