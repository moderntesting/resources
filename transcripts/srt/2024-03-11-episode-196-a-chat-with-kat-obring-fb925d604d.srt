1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Will those big corporations that sit on 20 year old code bases change in parts?

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
Maybe I have seen parts of them change.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Will they always be entirely modern?

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,720
I doubt it.

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,520
The bigger the ship, the harder it is to change the course, right?

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,660
Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,260
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,620
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

9
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,060
Now, on with the show.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,020
Hey everybody, welcome to AVE Testing Podcast.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,580
Brent's here.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,140
Say hi, Brent.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,860
Hi.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,900
Okay, our part's over.

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,940
We have the wonderful Kat Obering here today on the podcast with us to share all kinds of

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,700
wonderful testing knowledge and just sort of hang out with us and give Brent and I a

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,420
chance to get to know you.

18
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,540
So welcome, Kat.

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,060
Can you introduce yourself?

20
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,940
Yeah, sure.

21
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,580
Hello.

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,380
Thanks for having me.

23
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,660
First up, I am extremely, I feel extremely honored to be here.

24
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,660
I mean, you guys have been running for eight years.

25
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,620
We're the honored ones.

26
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,500
Let's be clear on that.

27
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:12,380
I have been a tester slash QA engineer slash test architect slash head of delivery for

28
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,660
about just shy of 20 years now.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,820
So I worked across the space.

30
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,700
I kind of fell into testing like many people do, right?

31
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,780
I worked in customer support.

32
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,540
My manager got a little bit fed up with me complaining about all the bugs I found.

33
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,340
We were hiring for QA engineers in the company.

34
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,020
So he kind of encouraged me to apply.

35
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,140
That's how I got into it.

36
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,140
And things went from there.

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,500
I have had the luck.

38
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,700
You can't see I'm doing air quotes here of mainly working in agile teams or teams

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
that call themselves agile.

40
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,580
You know, I think there was a little bit of inflation to that term and it's not

41
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,060
getting any better the longer it runs.

42
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,500
But generally speaking, I worked as a tester or QA engineer that worked within the team.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,340
I've never been outside of the team.

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,020
I've never done the kind of right automation suites after the fact thing.

45
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,260
And that has obviously shaped my views on testing quite significantly.

46
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,620
And yeah, these days I run my own company.

47
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,900
And now I'm here.

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,100
I want to maybe at the end, we'll do some plugs.

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,380
I want to talk a lot about your company and your newsletter and what you're doing.

50
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,220
But I didn't realize to you told that story because I've been watching you on

51
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,300
LinkedIn for a while how we have a lot of parallels in our paths.

52
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,300
I fell my way into testing.

53
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,900
I had a job doing tech support at a company that made music software.

54
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,260
They also had me do testing.

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,300
They didn't tell me what it was.

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,260
I was the only tester.

57
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,460
I figured it out.

58
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,340
Eventually, I was a test architect and I did more on the tools side and helping

59
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,100
people test than I did testing.

60
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,620
I also did a lot of testing and people thought I was good at it.

61
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,580
But I'm moderately okay at it.

62
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,020
I just know a lot about it.

63
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,300
And then I got into, you mentioned release engineering.

64
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,740
And I did some of that too.

65
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,140
It's what I began to do work on DevOps and pipelines and release engineering.

66
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,860
I began to realize that I knew I could have a lot more control over quality there.

67
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,500
I also like and I want to call out, there's been a bunch of articles this last few

68
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,300
weeks on Agile is dead, long live Agile, because the term has kind of been,

69
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,380
it means different things to different people.

70
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,660
It's been abused.

71
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,980
So I love the path.

72
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,580
And I think, Brant nodding his head, which our listeners can't see.

73
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,780
So there's just a lot of similarities where we've come from.

74
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,120
One thing that I know you have some opinions I want to talk about is,

75
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,160
this is our modern testing principle number seven we talk about.

76
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,760
We want to increase testing knowledge across the team.

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,920
Not that specialists aren't necessarily needed, but they aren't the bottleneck.

78
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,620
So can you talk a little bit like this idea that only a tester can do testing

79
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,980
and whether that's true or not and sort of your experience there?

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,780
Yeah, you hear me sigh or you saw me sigh, right?

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,940
I think this is one of the myths.

82
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,780
We completely understand every sigh that you might express.

83
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,340
Well, yeah, this is a safe place.

84
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:08,980
Go for it.

85
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,020
It has to be the company of like-minded people, really,

86
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,980
because there is, you know, a lot of hubbub and noise around this.

87
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,900
How can I put this one?

88
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:25,460
I think the idea, so the main argument I see is that developers are focused on building stuff

89
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,500
and thus kind of prevents them from critically thinking about whether what they build actually

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,780
works because they are so focused and they cannot, you know, A, biologically, exactly.

91
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,300
Biologically, this is nonsense.

92
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,100
If we weren't capable of test of switching our model mindset or mindset,

93
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,340
you know, the mental model that we operate from, then we would be,

94
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,220
I don't know, we would all be talking all day long to our bus driver or top wood or,

95
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,420
you know, whatever.

96
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,380
We would not be able to do different things with different people, with different attitudes.

97
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,180
So I don't really know where people, so you can hear, I feel quite strongly about this.

98
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:05,300
Yeah, so no, I don't think that only testers can test.

99
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,860
I think everybody in a team can test and I think everybody should be encouraged to test.

100
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,420
I think there is maybe a point to be made that you don't,

101
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,540
you should not just build and test on your own.

102
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,300
You always want to at least a second set of eyes,

103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,380
but that's just good practice for everything that you want to deliver to somebody else.

104
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,860
Right.

105
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,060
Whether it is a text or a piece of software doesn't really matter.

106
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,300
It is good practice to run it by somebody else and to play ideas off with somebody else

107
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,500
and to get another, you know, thought process run over what you have done there.

108
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,820
But that is a completely different topic, I think.

109
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,340
I think it is, I muted Brent because he was making a bunch of noise,

110
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,740
but you unmute yourself if you want to jump in here.

111
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,460
You hit on a couple things and we have video on for the recording because it is good for us to

112
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,940
read each other and I made like my head was exploding.

113
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,300
We are talking about this idea that we see written about a lot.

114
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,060
I like you to talk a little bit more about this.

115
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,780
Can you expand a little bit more on your thoughts of the developers having a builder mindset

116
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,860
and they can't test their own stuff?

117
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,180
I, by the way, I totally agree with the point, like work with a partner to help you test.

118
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,580
And we had Brian Finster on like a month or two ago, like Brent and I have gone as far as to say,

119
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,420
and I'm asking a horrible question here because we're horrible interviews, but I'll get there.

120
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,060
Brent and I have gone as far to say that a lot of teams don't even need dedicated testers,

121
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,980
which I still think is true.

122
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,780
I don't think everything I think and Brent would say every team doesn't need it.

123
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,860
I would say that most teams don't, but where the testers can really, really help.

124
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Where I don't want testers to go sit off in their silo and do a bunch of testing on their own.

125
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,300
And I'm answering your question for you.

126
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,420
I'm horrible at this job.

127
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,620
I want the testers to accelerate the developer's ability to get quality software done.

128
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,180
And I see that Brent also wants to say something.

129
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,620
So I'll just be brief and then give you a chance to talk as well.

130
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:03,780
However, I get into hot water about this.

131
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,140
One second.

132
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,740
I'm absolutely glad that our interviewing skills on this podcast have shown that we're absolutely

133
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,540
flatlining.

134
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,820
Maybe even going down.

135
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,620
Maybe after this, you will be.

136
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,140
Anyways.

137
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:26,260
So I get into hot water with this all the time, but I tend to agree that teams don't

138
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,020
necessarily need dedicated testers.

139
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,580
What teams need though is testing knowledge.

140
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:38,100
I think teams need somebody on the team that is interested enough, you know, to advocate

141
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,700
for quality, to learn stuff, to keep on top of newer developments and so on and so forth.

142
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,340
Right.

143
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,940
That doesn't need to be a tester.

144
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,980
I don't care who it is.

145
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,350
So that was, I answer that question.

146
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,070
I mean, we're going to be singing to the choir.

147
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,230
I think a good portion of this podcast.

148
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,830
When I think of, of, oh, the builder mindset.

149
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,230
There's one thing, I mean, we've come up with all kinds of analogies on this topic, on

150
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:09,460
the podcast over the years, but what I'm like, you know, if all of these people had,

151
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,860
you know, had a fixed mindset that only succeeded, like one question I'm like, okay,

152
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,940
what percentage of them went through college?

153
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,940
What percent of them passed college?

154
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,180
Because how, how does that possible?

155
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,130
There's so many things.

156
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,490
How did they, how did they go home and live their life?

157
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:38,690
The reality is everyone has to acquire and use a diversity of knowledge.

158
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,810
So when everyone, just quite honestly, when people say, oh, they're ever builder, I mean,

159
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,370
they're using hyperbole.

160
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,330
We could rephrase it and maybe have a different discussion around.

161
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:51,570
Okay.

162
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,290
Does that optimize?

163
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:59,810
Like I'm honestly really tired of, uh, is it, that's the only way to do it.

164
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,970
Like everyone on those call knows that that's complete and utter nonsense.

165
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,290
But is it, is it, is it optimal?

166
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,210
And even there, I would say no.

167
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,290
Now, Alan quoted me earlier, uh, around that.

168
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,290
I would say it's always the case.

169
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,930
It's not.

170
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:23,250
There are certain places where, uh, if your shipping model is,

171
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,730
if you're doing a box product, you do want to have that extra risk control.

172
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:35,650
If you have, if you're under government compliance, you do want to have a specialist

173
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,290
under that in that arena.

174
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,770
But the general stuff that we do on day to day.

175
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:49,520
No, your, your, your investment in my humble opinion is, is better served by going and

176
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,180
getting your, your staff, whatever their title is trained on this stuff.

177
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,660
Exactly.

178
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,540
Then hiring somebody that then becomes a, it then encourages the code dependency loop.

179
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,700
We've talked about a million times on here where it essentially people can't live

180
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,420
without this person, but if that person goes, then the sky falls, right?

181
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,580
That's not a sustainable way to run a, uh,

182
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,540
It's also not a good place to be in.

183
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:19,860
Right.

184
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,890
I mean, for both sides, for the team that depends on the test, but also not on the tester.

185
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,170
I can't count the amount of times I have come into teams to help them,

186
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,970
like modernize that their testing approaches.

187
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,290
And the first thing that the testers tell me is that either they sit twiddling their thumbs

188
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,050
because they're working agile, right?

189
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,130
They twiddle their thumbs until the day before the sprint is over, and then they get all of

190
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,770
the stories to test and know that you feel stressed.

191
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,470
I'm like, yeah, sure.

192
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,230
Because that's not how you should be doing this.

193
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,470
Right.

194
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,220
I, I haven't had those days in 15 years.

195
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,220
And I am so grateful.

196
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,260
They exist.

197
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,140
Grateful they're gone.

198
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,390
Yeah.

199
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:10,110
So Brent and I are quite a bit removed from that type of thing, but I do know what goes on.

200
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:15,710
And I imagine in your business, you see a lot of that even before Brent and I begin to podcast,

201
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,350
I think, uh, and before we had principles kind of outlined, they're really delivery

202
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,110
principles, but Brent came up with this, uh, when he was leading a test team,

203
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:29,310
this mission statement was that we accelerate the achievement and a shippable quality.

204
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,110
And I know that you've also talked about how testing, if it's well integrated,

205
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,790
it will speed up delivery testing.

206
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,550
It's on a bottleneck as an accelerant.

207
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,990
And I wrote, and I've written about this a couple of times, but I know I want to hear

208
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:43,790
your, I think we're going to nod our heads, but I want to hear it from you.

209
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,270
Like, how do you view testing as speeding up the team versus slowing it down?

210
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,190
Well, the way I see it, there are multiple ways, right?

211
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,670
It begins, I mean, and when, when we say testing speeds up the team, then we talk

212
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,030
about a specific kind of testing done in a specific way.

213
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,710
I want to be clear about this, right?

214
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:09,490
We talk about testing that is done in a mainly automated fashion, and that is done in a way

215
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:16,400
where tests are committed with the code through an automated pipeline, and they run

216
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,520
automatically every time you want to merge your code, right?

217
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,760
So this is very specific, obviously.

218
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,560
And the way this speeds you up is obviously any, any malfunction, any issue you've,

219
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,360
you detect at the time you're writing the code is, we all know this, right?

220
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,400
It's easier to fix.

221
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,840
It's cheaper to fix because your mind is still in the code.

222
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,920
You don't have to remember what you did three weeks ago or, and, you know,

223
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,080
work through the additions that three other people may have made in the meantime and so on and so

224
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,160
forth. So that is the first and most obvious benefit here.

225
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,680
But also it means obviously that code will be written in a way that it is testable,

226
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,120
which means later on, if you actually do release an issue into production and you will be releasing

227
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,480
issues in production, because that, you know, that stuff happens, then debugging is going to be much,

228
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
much easier and much more straightforward.

229
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,800
You have tests that may not have caught everything, but those tests can also, because now you are

230
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,680
maybe month, years down the line, but you have tests that also can serve as documentation.

231
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,760
So you have, you know, a list of things that you expected your code to do.

232
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,400
And you already know that that is covered.

233
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,760
So these are the main, main benefits, I would say, where things just speed you up, right?

234
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,760
And obviously you don't need to go through these cycles of the developer has done their work.

235
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,840
They hand it over to a tester who then deploys it into an environment, maybe immediately,

236
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,800
maybe a day later, then they test the stuff, you know, then they write their bug reports,

237
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,200
they go back. So that, that process in itself usually takes a day or two,

238
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,040
whereas a well configured pipeline with well written tests takes 15 minutes.

239
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,040
Again, people can't see the video, but Brett and I aren't doing happy dances, because

240
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,800
it is so refreshing to hear someone just like this is makes so much sense, yet so many people

241
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,280
don't get it. And so I'm really curious, because I live in my little bubble here of

242
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,360
edging towards continuous delivery. And my world is a lot like this. I imagine in your business,

243
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
you encounter, like folks across the board, or where this seems impossible,

244
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,400
where they think the right thing to do is have a separate team of testers writing automation

245
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,840
isolated from development. Like what's that like for you and your business? How do you help teams

246
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,120
see that light? And before let me ask one follow up to that question. Are you seeing a light at

247
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,830
the end of the tunnel? Like it how much of your job is helping people transition? And are you

248
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:52,750
seeing that person or that portion of your job actually trending either up down or staying the

249
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,310
same? So the main majority I have seen of this started really when I was working in a consultancy

250
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:04,510
just before I opened my own business, right? So that was a consultancy that was in the business

251
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:09,630
of digital transformation. There were the air quotes again, that I would just call out because

252
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:15,710
you can't see. And there it was, like you say, it was there, I usually went in with a team of

253
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,430
developers. So the way we worked in that consultancy was generally we bring in a whole team

254
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:26,510
that then blends or becomes a blended team with developers and testers from the client.

255
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:32,750
And we work with them together and we show them how we develop stuff using DevOps principles in

256
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:40,590
a nutshell. And quite often, part of my assignment was then work with a wider QA community in the

257
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:49,500
client to teach them how to move towards these goals, how to educate their testers and train

258
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,420
their testers up. Because quite often, if a tester has worked for 15 years on the job,

259
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,580
but all they know is testing after the fact, then they will need a little bit of training

260
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:04,500
to slot into a team like that. That was a lovely way. Do I see a light at the end of the tunnel?

261
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:13,860
Yes and no. I would say yes and no. I think by and large, it is like many things. Older habits

262
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,140
don't necessarily change. They got just replaced by a new generation. And I think the newer

263
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:25,780
generation of companies tend to work in more modern ways, in more DevOps-y ways, in more

264
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:30,980
continuous delivery, continuous improvement ways. So yes, I think there is a light at the end of the

265
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:40,980
tunnel. Will those big corporations that sit on 20-year-old code bases change in parts? Maybe I have

266
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:49,010
seen parts of them change. Will they always be entirely modern? I doubt it. The bigger the ship,

267
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,930
the harder it is to change the course. Did I answer all the questions?

268
00:16:53,730 --> 00:17:00,130
Oh, you did. Yeah, I heard the yes part. I got excited that it was followed by yes and no.

269
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:10,050
She's right. It's essentially, until these other VM myths realize that the smaller, more

270
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:22,210
agile companies are able to destroy their business, it's essentially until the great software asteroid

271
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:29,090
hits and knocks out these people with all of these ancient thought patterns, it's still going to

272
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:35,730
persist. I wonder what it takes for them to see the light. These days, because I used to

273
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:42,130
spend my time on Twitter, but I don't because for obvious reasons, Elon, thanks for wrecking my

274
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,410
little home away from home. But my bro is linked in. There's definitely a bubble there of,

275
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,720
like, I live in a different bubble and I don't know. Here's my dilemma. I would love your advice,

276
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,360
Kat, your free consulting advice because I'm cheap. Brett and I started this podcast eight,

277
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,120
nine, ten years, almost ten years ago because we were seeing these changes happening and we

278
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,000
didn't want to invent anything. We wanted to talk about what we were seeing and see if we could

279
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,200
just talk about it and help people understand the changes that were coming and how tests could

280
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,160
accelerate the team and how handoffs were slowing down delivery versus helping delivery.

281
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,520
I see posts on LinkedIn that say only testers have the testers mindset and all teams like to talk

282
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,320
about the automation team and how they have a team of dozens of people writing Selenium all day,

283
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:44,290
writing tests for the developers. What can I do? Should I ignore it and block those people so I can

284
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:50,130
live in my echo chamber? Is there a way I can engage with them and try and help them or am

285
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,690
I trying to be too much of a savior in that case? I should just stay out of the way. What can I

286
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:00,130
do to help bring some of the industry to where we are today or should I just butt out?

287
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,850
I was wondering if you would ask this question funny enough. I don't know why.

288
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:12,690
I was thinking about this earlier. I definitely have incurred the wrath of some of the

289
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:18,290
more old-fashioned camp occasionally and they still have a lot of friends on Facebook.

290
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:26,450
I now have generally a couple of people who are dissent with what I say on my posts in

291
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,770
more or less engaging ways. Personally, I can't tell you what you should be doing. What I do

292
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:38,770
personally is if I feel that the person is asking a genuine question and quite happy to discuss,

293
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:44,210
if I feel the person is asking a question just to start an argument with me, I will generally

294
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:50,930
ignore it because I don't have time for that. Other than that, I think the best way to spread

295
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,250
knowledge is to make it available to people who wants to engage with it, will engage with it,

296
00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:00,850
you know who wants to dissent, will dissent. Who just wants to go their way slightly blindfolded,

297
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:06,210
they will do that as well. I can't make those decisions for other people. I just can't offer

298
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,890
what I have. Take it out even. Without going into details, I think a lot of the dissent that comes

299
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:20,210
to strong voices like yours, Kat, come out of fear. It's fear, digging. They don't want their

300
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:25,890
world to change because they're comfortable and they are kings and queens in their world.

301
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,810
So the idea of that world changing is very, very frightening to those folks. But I think we need

302
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:39,360
new ideas. The one thing while you're talking, I think I can do is rather than me bring my savior

303
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,560
into, I'm going to teach you how to not be wrong. Like I'm going to go to having done this for a

304
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:51,120
gazillion years and being old as hell, amplify the voices who are saying the good things and

305
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,680
let people see a different way from more than just my angle. I think people are tired of

306
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,440
hearing from me. We need to hear from people like you and others in the industry who are doing

307
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,840
really good things. Just support. Well, and I think she's right. We do need to broadcast the

308
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:13,820
knowledge. Like I was, I think you're right. It is fear. I think not only that, at some point in

309
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:21,100
time, you have to conclude is it's like the knowledge is out there, but these so-called

310
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:30,290
experts, there seems to be a refusal to look at it. I'll just posit this. If you have been

311
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:37,180
experienced in testing, and maybe I'm too far gone on this one. Like I don't know how to take the

312
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:43,180
other side of my hypothetical, but if you have read Accelerate and if you have read Lean Startup and

313
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:51,420
if you have read Phoenix Project, how can you responsibly continue doing things the way you have?

314
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:58,510
Excellent question. I don't know. I mean, you know, and I fairly frequently have people

315
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:06,750
question my posts on LinkedIn, for example, can you prove this with a study? And I'm like, yeah,

316
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:13,470
I could, but really, should I show you how to Google this? Really? If you were interested

317
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:18,030
in finding the facts about this, then you would have found the facts. Okay.

318
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:25,870
Exactly. Exactly. Right. It's a strong man's argument when say, can you prove this? Right.

319
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:34,540
It's a strong man's argument. I'm not, I am not trying to battle. I'm not playing testing King

320
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:40,540
of the Hill. I don't want to be the high priest that everyone follows. What I'm trying to do is

321
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:47,260
exactly what Kat's saying is it's, hey, here's a bunch of knowledge. If you want to learn the

322
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,780
same knowledge I did, I just listed off, for example, three of the Magellian books on this.

323
00:22:53,620 --> 00:23:00,820
Go learn for yourself and make your own decisions. Really, like, Alan invented this term a long time

324
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:09,060
ago, test zombies. And I've been rather fond of it. And I'm just like, we have talked about it

325
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:13,540
for me. I'm sorry, Kat. Like, this is frustrating for me because I just like we have talked about

326
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:22,080
this for so many years. We have absolutely lived and observed that testers in this space really

327
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,640
don't have a reason to fear. If they if they go in the right direction, they're actually even more

328
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:36,400
valuable. I have, I switched over to dev years ago. And we created a blending team. And guess what?

329
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:45,920
My testers ended up being better developers than the dev did. Of course, because it's it. Because

330
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:57,070
thinking about how do I make this work turns out to be a much better skill set, or much harder skill

331
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:04,700
set to sort of adapting it in than it is on how to code. There's another sort of bubble that I think

332
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:12,140
doesn't. It's just code. It's not magic. Yes. And I think it is. On that note, I think it is really

333
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:19,820
ironic. These days, the most kind of influential developer advocates you see, you know, on social

334
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:26,460
media, talk a lot about how coding or how knowing how to write code really is not what gets you ahead

335
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,220
as a pro as a developer. Learning to code is fairly easy. What you need to learn is how to think

336
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,820
about a problem, how to define a problem and how to define a solution to your problem. And then you

337
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:43,660
need to learn how to talk to the people around you to understand what they really want and how what

338
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,660
you are going to deliver is actually going to deliver value to a run range of different stakeholders.

339
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:56,700
Right. So now we are suddenly in this space where developers claim the soft skills that testers have

340
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,860
for years claimed they can only they can bring to the team. They need to be the translators between

341
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,420
the people who write the code over there in the corner and the people of the great ideas over

342
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:12,610
there in the other corner. Right? Sorry. Yeah. And neither of which are the customer.

343
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,690
I'm gonna unmute so I can clap.

344
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:30,850
It's very relevant. Like right now, I am staring at a website talking about a presentation that

345
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:39,970
Kat did in Prague last December called delete that test column. Yes, I think it was it was actually in

346
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:46,690
September not December, but yes. Okay. Very nice. That's true to Prague, by the way. Lovely city.

347
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:55,490
I completely agree with that. But piggybacking on that, one of the things that I did is on my

348
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:04,900
agile board, the columns go release. Then after that, which is typically done on my board,

349
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:14,320
it says customer validate. I like that. And I expect, I expect actually the whoever owns that ticket

350
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:22,750
to do that, whether they talk to the customer, whether they do something via telemetric means,

351
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:29,950
I don't care, but it's not done until we have evidence of validation from the customer.

352
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:37,380
I really like that. And that is super powerful. Because, well, anyway, you can guess it.

353
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,420
Yeah, no, no, I really like that. I mean, so what I another thing that I really like is that part of

354
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,940
our definition of done in the teams I work with generally is at least some sort of monitoring

355
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,180
and setup, right? Because talking to the customers is one way to validate. But there's, of course,

356
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,060
also the other side where if you just get good information back from your production environment,

357
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:04,820
you have good monitoring in place, and that gives you another data set that is also important to have,

358
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:12,420
right? I totally totally agree. Done doesn't stop with it's no, no released deployed. Again,

359
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,980
also, we don't need to talk about, you know, separating deploy from release. I know we're

360
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,260
singing the same song in that. I'm sure we were talking earlier. It's like, I was thinking I

361
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,580
watched the State of the Union in the US last night, and watch the reactions from both sides.

362
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:35,040
And I, there's a phenomenon where I think folks seek to like they're seeking their echo chambers.

363
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,920
These are people that that tout their critical thinking abilities, but they're not actually like

364
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,600
going back to the books, they're not actually looking to see why would people think the other

365
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,320
way. And I do this looking at the right wing in America, I try and figure out why do they feel

366
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,840
the way they do. And it's usually not for good reasons, but I'm not going to go into that on

367
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,600
this this podcast. But I kind of see the same thing in the world of testing people there,

368
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,480
they're comfortable in their echo chamber, they don't want to hear other ideas or consider them

369
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,880
and testers tout themselves on critical thinking. So I want to just put that out there. You can

370
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,160
comment on that if you want. But like the testers I read on LinkedIn, they're very like

371
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,200
only we can test because we have the tester mindset because we have attention to detail. And

372
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,520
we have critical thinking, whether they do or not, I don't know, apparently not. But what

373
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,440
but also I think for years, air quote, technical skills for a testament, write code, but there's

374
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,520
a lot more to that, of course, writing being able to write code to help not necessarily to

375
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,880
automate tests, but to help accelerate your testing is a really good idea. So what's anyway,

376
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm going to stop there. I want to talk about the critical thinking thing and get your opinions

377
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,360
on that and then talk about what technical skills do you think testers, people saying and testing

378
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,160
need to be successful. Yes, on the critical thinking thing, right? I totally agree. I think

379
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,800
it is highly ironic that the people who claim that they they are the experts in critical thinking

380
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:07,280
are also the people who are most close to hearing any information outside of their echo chamber. Yes.

381
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:15,600
And I think, you know, we all have a tendency to seek the company or of like minded people, you know,

382
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:24,830
that that is human nature, that is fine. But I think if you want want to view yourself as somebody

383
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:30,670
who operates on logic and critical thinking, then you need to allow a few uncomfortable facts into

384
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:36,030
your life, whether you like them or not. Right. So that is the one bit, there is the other bit,

385
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:42,220
however, where and this has been the case in my entire testing career, I always found it

386
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:49,820
somewhat baffling that people think they can build a career purely on what is generally

387
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:57,180
regarded as the softer skills that personally I would expect any professional in the field to have,

388
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,580
because what do I do with a developer who can't ask questions? And that that is the basis of

389
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:08,780
critical thinking. Right. What do I do with a developer who cannot communicate with people

390
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,820
around them? Not very much. This may and I doubt it to be honest, this may have been a thing in the

391
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,180
80s, but at least not in the 20 years I have been in the industry. So I really don't understand

392
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:25,740
this. And from there going into what you already touched upon it on the technical side,

393
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:31,580
if I find find an issue with my application, and obviously having the technical knowledge to be

394
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:39,660
able to isolate where this stems from, and to have at least an idea what is going on under the hood,

395
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:46,540
will make it much, much easier to write it up in a way that will mean something to other people

396
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:55,020
and allow them to prioritize the level of criticalness of the issue. So that was a horrible

397
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:59,980
sentence. However, and also it just makes it easier to have conversations around this, even

398
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,740
if I'm not even even if I don't become a super proficient coder, or programmer or developer,

399
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:12,460
or however you want to call it, right, at least having a fundamental understanding of what we work

400
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:20,400
with is something that I would expect every tester to have. So at least learn to read code,

401
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:26,160
at least be proficient enough to help people with code reviews, right? You may not be able to spot

402
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:33,920
every gnarly bit, but you can start there by questioning tests, by looking at tests, helping

403
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,200
developers think about tests, help them learn what kind of tests you want to write, you know,

404
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,920
go away from the happy path. Yes, we want every path, but we also want edge cases, we want all

405
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:50,000
sorts of things, right? So there are many ways I think into this without becoming the best coder

406
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,390
on the planet. But yes, you need to at least be proficient enough to understand what you're

407
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:01,310
working with. I want to emphasize one point in there, because I said in a prediction episode back

408
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:07,550
in December that the ability to read code is going to become more and more critical as AI

409
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:13,390
begins to write code for you, and both as developers, a tester, reading code is so critical.

410
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:19,390
And I'm far better reader at code that I'm a writer, a reasonable writer. But I actually have

411
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:27,870
a study on this that I did for P and SQC like 20 years ago, I did a study of testers reviewing

412
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:33,630
code and and like we did I did extensive over a period of many months, probably not as you know,

413
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:38,430
as researchy as Nicole for a screen of the PhDs. But I have a study on this, it makes a difference

414
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:43,150
the ability to read code and ask questions and apply critical thinking, even when you don't

415
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,030
understand like I have reviewed and found bugs in so much code that I could not have written

416
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:52,830
myself, just because I'm not afraid to ask questions. What does this do this seems I found

417
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:56,510
so many bugs like saying, Can you explain this to me? I don't quite get it. And they go, Oh, you're

418
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:02,240
absolutely right. That's broken. I'm so pleased that you have a study on this. That's amazing.

419
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,360
Somewhere buried. But but but that's the thing, right? I mean, even that's what I mean, even even

420
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,160
if my, my knowledge about programming doesn't extend to understand extremely abstracted away

421
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:21,360
functions, I can still spot badly named variables, for example, and in changing that I will already

422
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,760
already have improved the quality of the code quite significantly. In fact, right, I can spot if

423
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,160
something is far too long and nested, and maybe should be broken down in small into lots of smaller

424
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:42,560
functions. I think what cat what you said is, is, is fine. I'll be honest, when people come to me

425
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:50,990
and say this, I'm like, look, think about the short term, think about the long term. And I kind of

426
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,230
try to encourage people to set a two to three year goal, literally to move it if they're in this

427
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:07,060
position, move into depth. And it's quite literally that it's identified, like, don't lose your existing

428
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:13,780
skills. Like the way you are able to understand variables, the way you are able to understand

429
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:23,860
code, the way you're able to do critical thinking, right? Because that is the thing that is going to

430
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:30,340
differentiate you from your peers and dev. And again, as we've already talked on the call,

431
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:39,040
like the researchers are in my view, the research is kind of closed on that now. Right? If we look at

432
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:48,320
and then here, I'm mostly citing accelerate on which did a very thorough research on this.

433
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:55,120
But if you if you don't want to read the research, right, again, lean startup approaches this from a

434
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,880
business point of view and Phoenix project points approaches this from a DevOps point of view, like

435
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:10,000
shifting the dev and then help your team figure out how to do 10 deployments to production a day.

436
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:16,510
Right. And those two things, those two things will bring so much goodness along with it.

437
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:22,830
I agree. And I think in the middle long term, right, again, this, this, this is something a lot

438
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:30,190
of testers hate, he says, I got to say it anyways. I think tester should really be a specialization

439
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:36,750
within death, like front end, back end, whatever you have, right? Because I think it is absolutely

440
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:43,230
preposterous, actually, to have somebody on a team who only does one thing, and none of the 50

441
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:48,670
million other things that also need doing right. So even if you don't want to get get too deep

442
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:53,870
into code, at least learn how to work with a pipeline, learn how to configure a delivery

443
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:58,750
pipeline, right? Learn some of that stuff. If you don't know where to start,

444
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,460
Brent and I have a sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

445
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,260
No, I was done. I was just Brent and I have a long standing statement on here,

446
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:18,500
Brent, what do we call a specialist? A bottleneck. Yep, exactly. Specialists slow your delivery

447
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:27,460
cycle down. Yes. But again, if you if you go through and you set a goal, okay, our company is

448
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:36,690
going to do 10 releases to production a day, okay, a day, like bottlenecks like, hey, you know what,

449
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:43,410
we can't get everything we can't get anything out because they all have to be sent to Sally to do

450
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:52,050
her test pass and validate, right? You're gonna go, you're gonna, well, like, I think about the

451
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:58,290
Phoenix project and unfortunately, the anti hero in that book, his name is Brent, right? And Brent

452
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:02,290
was the bottleneck. They couldn't get anything out because Brent was the only one that knew anything.

453
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:11,810
And once they realized that they started doing the test code strategy, which, which Alan over

454
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:19,330
the years has absolutely, in my view, mastered, it's around taking that knowledge. And we talked

455
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:24,130
earlier around spreading the knowledge. But in some places, if you want to make these moves,

456
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:32,450
you kind of have to force the knowledge. Right? No, I'm not going to just live in the world where

457
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:38,850
devs are specialists, it's time to broaden, you two are going to start also taking responsibility

458
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:44,610
for the build pipeline. And then you start creating that pattern. I found that actually,

459
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:50,900
the right things then start happening. Yep. Yep. But I don't want to learn all of this. I just

460
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,300
want to write code. It's Brent because you're lazy. And that's why you're obsolete. Right.

461
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,180
You know, one thing I found, because you've brought in Mr. Talk about this, the best way

462
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,040
to highlight your problems in your delivery process or to try and do can use delivery.

463
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,560
And so a quick story that I want to get some some more thoughts from from Kat on this. But

464
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,880
back when BDD was the thing, people got all excited about if we can write these given when

465
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,440
then statements and then we'll write automation before we the start. And it's great. And

466
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,800
but what I found this story is going somewhere, believe me. What I found is that just doing just

467
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,080
having the discussion talking about the behaviors of the software, we're 90% of the value.

468
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,720
Talking about the behaviors before you wrote it, the automation was like a little frosting thing.

469
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,760
It was it was fun. But just talking about the behaviors is really good. I think it's I found

470
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,920
the same thing true with CD, even if you don't want to do CD, even if it's not practical, ask a

471
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,360
team to, hey, what would it take? What would you have to do in order to do continuous delivery

472
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,240
and start listing through it? Even if you have no need? No, there's no business need to do CD.

473
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:00,720
There's no business needs delivered 20 times a day. I would challenge any team just to

474
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,720
enumerate what they'd have to do in order to have continuous delivery, because going to highlight

475
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,960
all the problems that you should fix. So that was the cap there. So we got a couple of minutes left.

476
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,560
But Kat, you do so much for you have a newsletter, you have your active on LinkedIn,

477
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,480
you're giving talks, you have a business, can you take a little time and kind of talk about I

478
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,240
want you to talk about your newsletter, your business, I want a little a little self promo

479
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:36,000
here, not because I'm trying to sell your business, although I'm sure it's very good. But

480
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,520
you do a lot for the community. I want to make sure we get that highlighted here.

481
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,240
The business to start with that. And by the way, I do have a little bit of space right now. And

482
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,620
unexpectedly, mainly I do. I do help teams to figure out tomorrow, tomorrow,

483
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,220
that has strategy basically, right? So that that is it in a nutshell. If you have a team,

484
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:03,540
and you want you wondering why you why you testing goes awry, why there was lots of frictions between

485
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:09,300
developers and testers, how you can speed that up. So that is kind of the area in which I operate.

486
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:16,420
The newsletter came about, I think because I've been thinking about newsletter for a while,

487
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,340
but I couldn't really settle on anything that I thought would hold my interest enough. And I'm

488
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:26,820
not going to embark on a weekly newsletter that was me to death, because words will want to read it.

489
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,900
Right. However, one of the questions I often or one one of the misconceptions I quite often ran

490
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,500
into was that improving quality in a team, especially in a team that is struggling in many

491
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:47,380
ways, is this kind of massive thing that needs a five year commitment and a big 2020 page plan,

492
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:52,260
and so on and so forth. And that is just not true. There are many, many, many small ways in which

493
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,060
you can improve quality. And that is the way way to go. I mean, I don't know if you guys,

494
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:02,420
I'm sure you have heard about atomic habits or tiny habits, and that concept. And that I think

495
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,140
is exactly how you go about changing things, right? You change a small thing, you do it long

496
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:11,220
enough until it becomes a habit, and then you change the next small thing, and so on and so forth.

497
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,940
And that works for individuals and it works for teams, because teams are groups of individuals,

498
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:24,370
right? So that is the newsletter. And I really enjoy public speaking. Funny enough, I consider

499
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:29,570
myself to be a fairly introverted person, and everybody who knows me in my normal life,

500
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:37,090
I am right. But I kind of enjoy public speaking, weirdly. And this all started when I was working

501
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:43,010
in a consultancy, and that consultancy hired a public speaking trainer. Because if you are a

502
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:50,530
consultant, you kind of have to be able to somewhat, you know, convincingly present something to clients.

503
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:56,930
So you need some basic, basic skills in public speaking, at least. And so this guy worked with

504
00:41:56,930 --> 00:42:03,410
me, and he encouraged me to apply to some conferences I did. And much to my surprise,

505
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:08,690
the first time I applied, I was accepted. I'm like, oh, okay, this is weird. So I went to New York

506
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,890
City and spoke at a conference in New York City, which was great. However, it is a really good way

507
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:20,130
I found to, A, to clear my own hand, because presenting something to explain it to some,

508
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,770
to, you know, an audience of people is a really good way to get clarity on what you actually

509
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:31,250
want to say. And I really enjoy having conversations that come out of this. So I always enjoy the

510
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,410
question answers much more than my presentation, because I already know what I'm saying. I've

511
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,930
thought about this for quite a while at that point, right? But people have good questions.

512
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:45,810
So I really like that. Yeah, I agree completely. Brent and I are also introverts where INTPs on

513
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:50,450
the Myers-Briggs, but it's exhaust. I also like public speaking. I'm very, and I like the

514
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:54,690
questions afterwards. I always find it funny that nobody asks questions during the talk,

515
00:42:54,690 --> 00:42:59,250
but they all will line up to talk to you afterwards. But it's exhausting. I'm very

516
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:04,450
tired afterwards, but also fulfilled. So I get it completely. James Clear is the author of

517
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:09,970
Atomic Habits. He also has a nice newsletter. Big fan of that stuff. You also have a book,

518
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:16,050
I think it's fairly recent, Testing in DevOps, which is out and available. I have a copy.

519
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:24,400
Yeah, on Amazon. Indeed. All kinds of cool stuff. This is, I cannot, like you can't see

520
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,640
from the podcast because we don't do video, but how much Brent and I have nodded our heads and

521
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,200
smiled and celebrated listening to you talk. It's just a complete breath of fresh air. Love

522
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,640
what you're doing. If people aren't following you on LinkedIn or getting your newsletter or reading

523
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,920
your stuff, they absolutely should. When's your next conference talk? So the next one that is,

524
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,080
instead of waiting on confirmation for a few that I have submitted for this year, but the first

525
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:58,080
one that is confirmed is what I have a very small appearance in Leeds. So I live in the

526
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:04,240
North of England and Leeds is fairly local to me. So there's a small meetup where I will be presenting.

527
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,840
But the bigger one is a CTO CraftCon in London with, you know, big names like Charity Majors

528
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,640
with whom by the way, I worked in my first job, which was quite funny because my first testing

529
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,040
wow was at a company called Linlab. I don't know if you remember Second Life, the big virtual

530
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:27,840
world that was going to take. Oh, I do. Oh my God. Well, yeah. So that was my first, first tech job.

531
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:34,240
So now we have a whole other podcast. I wanted to review conversation entirely in Second Life.

532
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,560
Well, I did my interview for that job in Second Life, which was, of course,

533
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,640
that was actually before that before Second Life had voice. So I did an interview for a job in

534
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:53,280
text chat. If you hated it, you probably wouldn't like working there. So CTO CraftCon 8 and 9th of

535
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,680
March, May in London. If you want to come see me. Got it. So exciting. All that I thought of a

536
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,360
question in the middle of my just complete admiration for you. But thank you so much

537
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,800
for being here with us. Absolutely a pleasure. Absolutely exciting. Love what you're saying.

538
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,760
Everyone should go check out everything you're doing.

539
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,640
Well, thank you for inviting me. It was a pleasure talking to you.

540
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,880
I mean, it was a joy. Thank you, Kevin.

541
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,250
All right. Thank you, everyone. We'll see you next time.
