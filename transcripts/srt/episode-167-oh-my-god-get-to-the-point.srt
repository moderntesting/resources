1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
And to be clear, when I was in college, I worked at a grocery store and I was a checker.

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:17,310
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,750
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, Agile, and anything else

4
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:28,990
that comes to mind. Now, on with the show. Hey, hey, everybody. Hey, hey, hey.

5
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:36,450
Hey, it's AB Testing. It's AAB Testing. I was thinking Fat Albert.

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,540
We're doing a podcast and did you know we're doing a podcast? Are you aware of this fact?

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,350
Are you aware that we have a podcast? I just call in. What are we on? 167.

8
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:01,470
So we've been doing this podcast. Here is the question of the day, a little podcast trivia,

9
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,190
and you can play along at home. Just open your favorite podcast app and put in this code.

10
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:13,500
What was the date that we posted episode one of AAB Testing?

11
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,740
Wasn't that April? April something April 1st?

12
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,940
What year? Oh, God, I have no idea.

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,690
April 13th, 2014. Okay.

14
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,130
We are coming up, you know, we're six months away from our nine year anniversary.

15
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:42,430
Not too bad for two people who started a podcast for really almost on a dare from Michael Hunter,

16
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:49,390
right? Yeah. I don't know if it was a dare. You guys should make a podcast. We're dumb enough to go.

17
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:55,870
Sure. I interpreted it a little bit differently.

18
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:59,710
He could have said you guys should stick your finger in a light socket. We would have gone.

19
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,950
Yeah, sounds great. You might have.

20
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,270
So I might have because I'm not particularly bright, but what's interesting.

21
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,890
And I want to do a little meta and talk about the podcast a little bit here today.

22
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,450
I was in a meeting today with some folks, external to unity and with some folks internal to unity and

23
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:27,250
and almost all the time I'm finding more and more stalkers and you know who you are.

24
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,530
It's like the podcast was a different thing when everybody who listened was an anonymous

25
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,740
human being. We didn't know. Remember when we had three listeners and like Jim Moore would come up

26
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,060
and say, Hey, I'm one of your three listeners. And Steve would say, I'm one of your three

27
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,440
listeners and we only have three listeners, but yeah. Okay, good. Anyway, the point I was getting

28
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,760
to was as you type away on your fucking keyboard is that these folks in this meeting are like,

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,200
Oh, hey, man, you know, Alan is a podcast. They listen to the podcast. So hi,

30
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,800
Wyatt. Hi, John. Hi, Steven. I and anybody else is listening. It's not a very good podcast.

31
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,650
I guess it is an excellent example of the, this is no 98% invisible.

32
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:21,490
Malcolm Gladwell. Stop. This is an excellent example of a podcast for the genre we invented.

33
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,530
What's the genre? I'm leaving that for the listeners. Oh,

34
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:33,490
you know, actually we are the number one podcast of all time in our genre as well.

35
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:42,130
Absolutely. I completely agree. I'm picking up what you're laying down. So I switched

36
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:47,010
to anchor FM for hosting, which has been really good. And this I'm not, I could do ads for anchor

37
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,650
and they pay us, but I don't, you know, uh, but anchor has been pretty good. There's your ad

38
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,970
anchor if you're grepping text in our podcast, but they keep stats much better than my previous

39
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,650
platforms I used. Do you know? So it's been less than a year. It was last January. I changed

40
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,170
everything over to anchor and screwed up everybody's feeds and got it all correct again.

41
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,730
Guess how many another Japanese question. Another is on your quiz app. Everybody

42
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:20,530
guess how many people in that last year have gone back to listen to episode number one and

43
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:29,580
and made it through the vast majority of it. Three. Oh, that what's weird. It could,

44
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:38,140
it could be the same three people each doing it 254 times because we have 700 or two

45
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,300
wrong math. You know, we have 712 listens of episode one in that last year. I don't know what

46
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:51,180
you people are doing. That is, uh, even though even its debut episode was still the top of our genre.

47
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,460
It was not even meh. It was, it was Brenton Allen trying to figure out how equipment to work,

48
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,340
trying to figure out what to talk about, which is kind of what we're doing here.

49
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,880
Eight and a half years later. Yeah. You know, when you, when you master a skill,

50
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,200
you make it part of the environment and we'll call it the dark genre as well.

51
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,560
But we've made it very clear on this podcast and specializing generalists that I'm really a master

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,560
of nothing. My secret skill is I can learn enough of anything to be super effective,

53
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,200
but I'm not a master of anything. I will say your secret power in this context.

54
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:42,640
And I do not, I do think that this phrase very well captures it and I do not in any way, shape,

55
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,240
or form mean any offense. This is nothing but praise, right? You are the master of fake it till

56
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,080
you make it. Oh, I, 100% that is, you know, maybe that's how we work together. So I was thinking

57
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,320
about how different you and I are. Like I was making, um, they're asking about the podcast and

58
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,240
someone brought up the fact we're talking about politics sometimes. I said, yeah, Brent's one of

59
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,880
those stupid libertarian to let his political views get in the way of actually making progress

60
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,910
in the country. But we'll get, we'll get back to that later. But, um, but also in this context,

61
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,270
you know, Brent's saying you're number one, number, number one of my genre. That's great.

62
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:30,110
So, uh, you have, you are a deeper expert in the areas where you need to be like, you were deep in

63
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:36,670
test automation and wrote a, a very good and probably one of the best test automation

64
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:44,110
harnesses used at Microsoft. Um, both a praise and a dig. Also what you're doing now with data

65
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,030
science and it's, it's super deep, what you know, and I'm more of a, I mean, you've seen me,

66
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,030
I can get around in the data science world and, uh, but I faked everything, but it's,

67
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:59,410
it's even before I got into tech, that was my thing. Uh, I played in high school, I played

68
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:05,010
clarinet and saxophone. I did not want to bring my nice saxophone outside to play in the marching

69
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,490
band. So I, I learned how to play drums well enough to make the drum line in my high school.

70
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,130
So then I played drums and drum core, I played drums in college, college marching band. I even,

71
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,850
I, I, I did not know that. So here's the funny part. Uh, not only did I do that,

72
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:26,880
and then I played, I played percussion. I made the top jazz band playing vibraphone, uh, vibes.

73
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,760
If those are, is that the cool thing that they use to make the, the Star Trek sound?

74
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:40,640
It's like, no, no, no, that's a theremin. It's like a xylophone, but metal wider keys, uh,

75
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,680
two octaves or one octave below often use in jazz. So a big fan of Gary Burton for those you want to

76
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,720
dig in there. So I, I wanted to do it. It was actually easier path. There was an easier path to

77
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,720
me to get in the top touring jazz band playing mallet percussion than it was for me to get in

78
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,080
the long, long line of saxophones. So I did that for a while. And then here's the funny part. I went

79
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,720
out enough. Everybody knows this that I taught school for four years after I graduated. I came

80
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:17,520
back to graduate school.
