You probably have noticed if you unless this is your first episode

9
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,030
I have a string of going on three episodes now where I've had something

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,870
Go haywire with the audio quality of this podcast on the positive note

11
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,710
Like your setup time today is probably the fastest has been since you've got the new gear. Yeah. Well, I

12
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:09,030
Actually, I'm getting caught up on my sleep. Maybe I don't know anyway today is the day that I hope the audio is good

13
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,030
So if it is

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,270

you can go to you can go to modern testing org or the podcast hosting this website and

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,800
There's a link there to join our slack group

17
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:31,110
Yes, and in there you can send tacos that you can send tacos. You can also order stickers. I'm behind the sticker

18
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,110
Just remember it. I'll send that out today. Sorry. I

19
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,730
Did know how's the house the house is good. I'm slowly moved in

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,470
People I used to have my bookshelves behind me

21
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,710
I do a lot of video calls and my bookshelves used to be behind me and people were upset the

22
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,750
Bookshelves they do my new office configuration that don't work there

23
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,630
But I do have the dog behind me now the dog sleeps on the couch behind me all day

24
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:01,860
That's pretty our place replace the bookshelves of the dog, which I think is an upgrade

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,900
You still doing mostly work from home?

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,780
Three days a week right now, but two to three days a week

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:16,560
Actually, it's two days. It was two days this week and I don't plan and it's like oh I'm working from home today

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,900
It's like oh I've had meetings since

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,180
530 a.m. And now it's noon. I'm not gonna bother going into work. I need that window to drive to work

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,120
and sometimes I said meetings back to back and I start early because of Europe and

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,280
Sometimes there's some making in but I always go in on

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,720
Tuesdays and Fridays and usually there's one sometimes another day I go in this I work. Yes. I work from the office yesterday

33
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,900
Yeah, I got a pretty sweet home office gig at home, but I find

34
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,900
That I can't get work done

35
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,380
Number one

36
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,880
I'm easily distractible in the first place

37
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,900
Number two there are a lot of distractions at home

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:11,630
Yeah, it took me a while. I think it took me a long time of having days working from get used to it

39
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,470
Definitely in the new house. I have a new

40
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,410
An elevated compared to my old house level of production. I'm not sure why I'm getting a lot more done there

41
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,590
especially when the

42
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:29,550
Media room as we call it with the TV of my Xbox literally across the hall from my home office and

43
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Borderlands 3 is begging me to come play

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,240
Yeah, I haven't I haven't even I haven't I so far I have not played Borderlands

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Dear before like six or seven at night. So and I have to say

46
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,010
The game is a little buggy. I haven't even I haven't even downloaded it

47
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:56,050
It's like the first sort of noticeably buggy game I played and I've had since I've started playing it a week or so ago

48
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:03,310
It's had I feel like a dozen little updates. So it is getting better. I haven't even launched

49
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,030
X

50
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:12,310
Hell, I haven't even gone into my media room in about a month. Yeah, we want to go dust it. Okay

51
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,710
Anything interesting last thing from my end is

52
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,990
still

53
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,990
We've wrapped up now. I've the modern testing course on ministry of test

54
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,830
It'll be another few weeks to a month before it appears on the dojo

55
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:34,390
Brent was marveling over my dojo instructor sticker on my laptop. Oh, there you go. So that's why I have that

56
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,030
So excited about that anything with you before we get started

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,440
Took advantage of

58
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
The

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,360
Appliance sales that happens on the last 3d weekend I can I can never remember if it's Memorial or Labor Day

60
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,480
Oh, would you buy I bought a

61
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,840
killer

62
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,280
Samsung

63
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,110
new stove a

64
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,460
New Samsung refrigerator as well as a new Bosch dishwasher

65
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:06,820
Oh

66
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,920
We have a Bosch dishwasher and I have and and this is the appliance portion of the a Bt

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,960
Because now I have opinion. So which boss did you get?

68
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:24,090
The expensive one. I don't right we have an expensive Bosch in our new house. It's nice. It's silent 44 decibels

69
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:32,610
But it is nothing compared is a downgrade from the melee we had in our old house. Oh, sorry. You should have moved it

70
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:38,490
I I thought about I I thought about going back to get it

71
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,490
We and I took advantage of a appliance sale a while back I have become

72
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,250
Maybe I'm not sure at what stage of having teenagers has happened probably to everyone

73
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,570
But I have become one of those people that has a second refrigerator in their garage. Oh

74
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,780
I've been in that place since

75
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,440
In that place since I had a you know shortly after I purchased a house

76
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:08,700
Yeah, it is great. It is actually it's not even full but it's good just to have it

77
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,500
But the drama this time around is I for for a period of an hour. I had three

78
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:22,940
But I sweet talked the guys who delivered the last refrigerator to take the the lesser of the three away

79
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,620
So I didn't have to pay, you know

80
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,810
some random person to

81
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,530
Either two hundred dollars if you pay some random person to come and pick it up

82
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,690
They're gonna charge you an arm and a leg these guys did it for free

83
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,040
My reef my raising a refrigerator. Yeah

84
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,660
So is it the time where you can knock on the outside shows to us inside?

85
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,960
It's gonna knock on the outside. I can show you on the inside of my refrigerator

86
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,580
right now

87
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:02,030
The internet oh, yeah, cuz I put my washer and dryer my new washer and dryer on on our internet a few weeks ago

88
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,030
So it can tell me what loads are done

89
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:11,590
Yeah, it's weird and it's it's kind of like high-tech meets old people because we're talking about appliances here on a yeah

90
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,930
I there you can organize that a lot better. Oh, and here's the thing. Here's one thing that's cool

91
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,930
Doesn't really work well for the podcast

92
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,510
But for say like this thing. Yes this thing. Oh

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Damn it. I can't do it on this one

94
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Brent's pointing at his phone

95
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:35,130
All right. I sought to work through it. But there is a there is one of these damn apps a lot

96
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,470
allows me to bring crosshairs and say that thing I

97
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,720
either needed order a new one of these or

98
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,340
that one expires in end days or

99
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,610
All sorts of things this hooks up to to Google home

100
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,910
And then once you get up to Google home, obviously you can use

101
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,040
IFFT or

102
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,840
FTT or my FTT is the property. Yeah that one or Zapier. We're not we're not married either

103
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,440
in recently I dropped about

104
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
$400 on

105
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,080
Phillips hue

106
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,080
lighting for the media room

107
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,150
That you haven't been in in a month that I yeah, but

108
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,590
Literally, I I

109
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,310
Finished that purchase and installed it all like a week before

110
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,350
School started that's the main reason why I haven't got a mini room. I don't have the time

111
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:43,390
But at first when I thought I'm like why why everyone into this Phillips hue thing it's who cares

112
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,800
Hey, oh, it's cool

113
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,510
Alright, when you hook it up. Yeah, yeah to Xbox streaming and you can have whatever is on your Xbox

114
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,830
Have your room match the colors

115
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,140
It's cool when you're playing minecraft and you go underwater. The whole room is underwater. Not just the screen. Yeah

116
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,020
That may happen. I'm digging. I don't play a lot of minecraft, but whatever I'm digging I'm digging the IOT world

117
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,820
Okay, you need IPV6 for your house to get enough personal addresses through stuff

118
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,440
Just saying yeah, not yet. Yeah, so should we have something about?

119
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,560
Oh

120
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,930
Software, I guess we kind of a software. How about we talk about that not yet. So the other we're not ready

121
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,850
Okay mesh network. Do you have was pressing 30 seconds 30 seconds faster?

122
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,370
Come on you guys get there

123
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,910
Realize that I have gone through and in the last two months. I have seriously upgraded

124
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,760
The electronics of my house so mesh networking mesh network. Do you have one of those course? Okay?

125
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,420
Which one do you have Evo? Okay, I have the deco

126
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
and

127
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
OMG

128
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,640
Those things are awesome. Yes. All right now I'm done

129
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:11,040
Yeah, so and I thought I would hate like I've had the traditional router forever where I can go in and control and tweak everything

130
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,240
And on my deco the TP link echo for those of you looking it up

131
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,880
Just get an app with a handful of those settings, but actually it's everything I need to do

132
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,280
I can assign static IPs. I can it has some built-in stuff so I can I use the parental controls

133
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Mm-hmm, that shut off my kids internet at a particular time

134
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,900
Question I get at least once a week dad. Can I have 15 more minutes of internet? I need to do some work

135
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,920
Oh really? What is it you need to do?

136
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,820
Research what research video

137
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,060
Good night. Good night

138
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Beat it kid. Oh

139
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Yeah, so

140
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,780
Been there done that we should have been there done

141
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:02,220
We have an all tangent episode once where we never actually got to anything, but that's not today. No, don't shut it off

142
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah, we have things I might have I might have the only episode in the last three months where there's not awful sound

143
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,640
Yeah, the the parental controls

144
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:21,110
So my daughter doesn't have anything I'm worried about yet and she's still too young my oldest

145
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,430
Has finally gotten through the hump

146
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,730
but there was times where

147
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,990
Not only was the internet

148
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,630
I

149
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,270
Did so many things number one?

150
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:44,580
Most most of the wireless routers offer the ability to do a guest network. Okay, I

151
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,950
I

152
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,910
Dedicated the guest network to him

153
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,710
gave a separate

154
00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:01,170
Account and it's because my router at that time allowed me to remotely turn off and on the guest network

155
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:09,530
So anytime my wife sent me a text going oh my god, this kid's driving me nuts. My response was off

156
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,880
And

157
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
But that kid is a smart kid

158
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,640
and

159
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:24,880
And he's kind of has a hacker mentality like his dad and he'll find a way to work around it. So it

160
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,850
at

161
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:33,690
Some point in time I was creating mechanisms and chasing. Okay. How is he connecting the internet this time?

162
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,450
Okay, that one's gone. How about this time? Okay, that one's gone. How about this?

163
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,050
Yeah, but that's over

164
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,710
Okay, cool

165
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,220
So is this an all-male bank show?

166
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah, no, we just spent half hour doing tendons

167
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,960
By the time I edit it, it'll only be 10 minutes. Yeah. Yeah

168
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,060
Okay, should we have some mailbag questions? Is that correct? We do

169
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,730
I'll start while Brett looks up his phone. No, I got it. Oh, you got it. Okay. Go ahead

170
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,090
One of our listeners on the slack channel asked

171
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,440
This is kind of connected to a question. I wanted to ask

172
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,840
Oh, yeah out of context. I think Alan's gonna bring us bring the context in

173
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,840
I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just bored. I'm playing some video games over here. Let me know you know

174
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,800
This was the okay. Go on from what brain was saying

175
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,640
I got the impression that all Microsoft teams to move moved to the unified engineering work model

176
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,460
But from what I hear not you

177
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,560
Yeah, not true

178
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,960
him

179
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
We've talked about this before we have yeah

180
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:54,480
But what I hear from my friends working in Microsoft in Prague that developer tester model is still there and they are

181
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,320
Even unaware that in USA you work differently

182
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,480
When I pointed them to your article on the subject. It was the first time they had learned about it

183
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,310
So my question is is what is the adoption rate of unified engineering model in Microsoft?

184
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:18,070
Well, if you go by and this is by three coming up on three-year-old data if you go by address book information, it's 100%

185
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,010
Well, no, I'm not percent what I what I what I left

186
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,130
if you looked in the

187
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,170
They ever replace head tracks anything better

188
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,860
So you looked in the the employee tracking the employee HR system

189
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,040
There were I think I saw two or three people with the the word test in their title. Mm-hmm

190
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,960
out of

191
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,880
at the time

192
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,880
25,000 30,000 engineers care member here here in Redmond

193
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,880
The only teams that I know of that still have a

194
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,400
QA

195
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,790
element

196
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:04,030
Similar to what we would have done in the traditional world are those in the hardware space

197
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,990
and what a little different yes, and what they're validating is

198
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,310
essentially the

199
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,170
That the hardware that we were just delivered

200
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,400
is

201
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,760
Meeting standards before we start applying but but but but but let me let you all in on a little secret

202
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,280
Facebook even years before Microsoft made this move or that we don't have testers were able to test our own stuff and

203
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,560
Facebook like Microsoft

204
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,960
employees a whole lot of

205
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,960
Contract testers and not full-time in the address book, but there are

206
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
thousands and thousands of

207
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,120
testers dedicated to testing Microsoft products paid as contract employees not as full-time employees

208
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,600
Yes, but the unified

209
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,400
engineering adoption and again, I'll say in in in Redmond

210
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,020
By payroll cost by headcount by any of those measures is not only the dominant situation

211
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,220
It is by far the dominant situation. Yeah, it's odd to me

212
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm not sure about the teams in Prague or I'm not sure how they're set up or how they could be

213
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,560
So separated they would not have heard of this before. It seems weird

214
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,440
Here I think the three years time difference has made you forget one of the more common things

215
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,630
that is rampant in Microsoft and that is not invented here and

216
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,870
one of the

217
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,870
easiest ways to

218
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:48,150
To continue to support a culture of not invented here is

219
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,300
To make sure you don't talk to any other team

220
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:59,690
True, but those satellite teams tend to work with other teams like my like when I was on teams

221
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,850
It had a chunk of the team based in Prague

222
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:11,470
Did they yep? Okay, cuz I was about to say I don't even I didn't even know we had a development sub in Prague

223
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:16,910
This leads into I think I don't know this shows up in the mailbag or not

224
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:22,230
This leads into a video that came out in the last couple of weeks by a youtuber

225
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,870
slash

226
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:30,630
Former Microsoft employer named barnacles. That's not his real name. I don't know what his real name doesn't matter

227
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,270
Where and Brett hasn't watched the video

228
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,790
I watched it because I had a bunch of people point me to and say Alan

229
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:43,630
What do you think of this and the gist of the article is this guy is a pretty good speaker

230
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,230
yeah, he has a reasonable following on YouTube and

231
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,750
he's

232
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,910
as I mentioned former Microsoft tester on the Windows team and

233
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,580
his basic premise is

234
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,560
Windows 10

235
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,800
These is getting buggier and buggier and every release is like we're stepping over a

236
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,640
minefield of bugs and

237
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,240
this is because Microsoft laid off all their testers for Windows and

238
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,420
they should hire a test team back to bring back quality and

239
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,940
One of those statements is true and two of those statements are false

240
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,920
I would say one is half true. Maybe one is half true

241
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,040
Well, and and even in its explanation of the and it's hard because I've been away for a while

242
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,040
So I have to make stuff up

243
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,140
Let's kind of go through that I can bring I can bring in some details to catch you up

244
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,380
You'll feel like you've watched the video. So let's start with the first question

245
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,350
And this has been a great one to have Steve Rowe here, but I think you would have hand waved a little bit

246
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,350
I don't know Steve. Let us know chime in on slack

247
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,310
is

248
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,310
Windows 10

249
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:58,320
Buggier is it does it have a bug or a quality problem and you don't work on Windows?

250
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,080
I know you probably don't want to answer in case any hi in case soft you listen to our podcast, right?

251
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,540
So I don't know the answer to that question

252
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
Steve Rowe definitely

253
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,980
would

254
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,180
And again, I'm not certain that he would

255
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,420
share it. I do think that that there is a

256
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:28,620
So I mentioned half I do think it's a half truth, right so

257
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,500
It did absolutely start when Microsoft got rid of their testers

258
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,590
What that organization did not do? Oh

259
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,710
Did you want to leave there? No, no, no, I know I know where you're going. Okay, you went right where I thought you would which is great, right?

260
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,850
What they did not do is something that Alan and I have

261
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,990
Talked about a lot of times Alan said told or shared this guidance

262
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,590
I don't know 30,000 times on stage

263
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,990
what the

264
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,990
You know the underwear gnomes

265
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,390
No, have you heard of the underwear? No, okay

266
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,090
so South Park

267
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:24,230
They they have these characters called the underwear gnomes and the problem that the underwear gnomes have

268
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:32,490
Is everyone goes to Amazon and others to get their shoes so they don't need gnomes to make magical shoes anymore

269
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:38,130
So they realized that they need to come up with a new business proposition

270
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,690
Okay. Now what they learned is

271
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
They have a three-step plan

272
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:53,150
Okay, and they had an idea and the first step is they're gonna go steal everyone's underwear

273
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,900
Okay, and they have the last step of the plan

274
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,170
Massive profit, so they're gonna start by stealing everyone's underwear

275
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:08,450
And that's gonna deliver massive profit now. The problem is

276
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,060
They don't know what step two is and even on their advertising the step two is a question mark

277
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,180
but this is actually a very good analogy it is metaphor go on but

278
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,960
Even without knowing what step two is that they have a clear step one

279
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,800
So they can start executing that while you know the the brain ear gnomes I guess figure out

280
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,770
What step two is that connects the dots between ceiling underwear and massive profit?

281
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,330
to me I

282
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,110
Use the underwear gnome metaphor a lot

283
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
It's not just at Microsoft

284
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,740
Microsoft because it's a pattern of behavior I see all of the time

285
00:21:54,010 --> 00:22:01,530
It's just a huge amount of confidence that oh, yeah once we start this we'll figure out a way to connect the dots to to the goal

286
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:08,040
Some of those situations in fact succeed

287
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,150
Some of those situations don't and

288
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,150
And I would say with because I was there for the transition in Windows and I want to correct a bunch of

289
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,470
misstatements in the video

290
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:28,670
I'm sure we'll have a fraction of the listeners a tiny fraction of the listeners is this podcast has have watched the video but

291
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,390
so what I saw being on the front lines as transition to Windows was

292
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,590
One they did not lay off all the testers they

293
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,550
There was a time when they merged Xbox Windows phone and Windows into one big org

294
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,550
And there was some redundant people that were laid off

295
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,190
And there's some good people laid off there. I I

296
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,110
Fully on board that did out lay off the whole testing

297
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,830
but what they did was took the whole test team and said you're the data and

298
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,790
Quality team or something they put people into new rules or your developers

299
00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,310
so they dissolved the testing more than laid them all off and then

300
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:07,250
The sort of the question mark happened and you could say there's a strategy that and I kept on going back and forth between thinking

301
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,420
there's no plan here big just a question mark and

302
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,620
maybe there's just letting a thousand flowers bloom and this is where I saw to his credit Steve Rowe just latch on to data science and

303
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,620
then go from someone who was

304
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,660
Definitely where there was a point in time where I think I knew more

305
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,220
About data science and Steve Rowe it lasted about a minute

306
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,060
And then he got excited about it, and then now is full-on like figured out how to make this work

307
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,850
so the thousand flowers blooming thing happened, but I feel like

308
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:43,130
There was a plan missing there as well, so I'm not sure quite the balance there, but anyway go on

309
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,490
Oh, so what I saw what I saw over and over again at Microsoft at that time

310
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,740
was

311
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,430
You could completely remove the test team

312
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,780
But then there was a complete assumption

313
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,620
well, then of course dev is gonna do the right thing and pick up the slack and

314
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,500
That was the assumption that I saw over and over again as

315
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,700
false

316
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,980
because

317
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:19,140
As many people want to call it a point point out when we bring up MT

318
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,500
But Alan and Bryn dev doesn't want a test. Yeah, that is absolutely true and

319
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,270
That is why we pulled in principle seven as part of MT is

320
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,310
It's the right thing for the business

321
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,110
We need to figure out strategies

322
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,750
to to succeed

323
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:44,070
Even though they don't want to

324
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,780
So I've yes, and now I want to get into the points of the barnacles video

325
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,020
Which are I hope go not only disagree with butter, but I flat out wrong

326
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:57,100
So I think he does have an argument that

327
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:04,100
There is more buggy behavior in the recent builds of Windows than maybe they were in the past. I

328
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,880
Disagree completely that having bringing back a test team to be test buddies

329
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,900
Is the right way to do it? In fact, let me talk about a few things. He says from my memory, which as no is bad

330
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,570
He said believe it or not

331
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:26,410
Testing needs to be there to be the gatekeepers. In fact, we called ourselves that we were the gatekeepers of quality

332
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,410
Oh my god, that triggered you

333
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:35,050
That's pretty much that might be a slight paraphrase pretty much

334
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:39,730
He did say we were called the gate we called ourselves the gatekeepers that well, that's the wrong way to do it

335
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,930
so he went off a few different times on dump files and and

336
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,740
I feel like he didn't understand them completely but he talked eloquently about them

337
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,420
But he said we get these mini dumps which we do from crashes and they don't have all the information

338
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:01,180
So what I do is a tester is I would look at the mini dump and I would debug it and make sure I figured

339
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,860
I'd make sure I get the developer at all the information they needed to figure out the right way to fix the bug and

340
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:12,800
They need someone to do that and I'm thinking do you did they also need someone to bring them their coffee in the morning

341
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,580
And lunch in the afternoon

342
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,140
It's like why are they unable to do that? He went off

343
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,330
for a while on these this codependency we've talked about how but it's weird because

344
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:31,010
Is it centering for me because these things we talked about as being inefficient?

345
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,850
he saw as

346
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:41,450
Necessary in order to generate quality and I use the word generate there purposely because it's really a big story about how

347
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:48,530
This video still with things about how the test team is necessary in order to test quality into developers crappy code

348
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,810
That was essentially his

349
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,810
So the story went from Windows 10 is buggy

350
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,580
The right way to do that is to have a bunch of people who do developers work for them

351
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:06,980
So it's less buggy. He even brought back the fact of you to bring back all the UI automation that

352
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
Windows 10 had

353
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,100
It's really like that and

354
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:19,180
And it's the one of these things like let's harken back to the old days when things were much simpler and easier

355
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:26,140
and so the solution to if a new problem pops up because of moving forward the answer is

356
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,390
Not always or rarely I wouldn't say never

357
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,890
Rarely to move backward if I deploy a bug to production

358
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,230
Yes

359
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,630
I want to roll back if I make a process change if I make a bet on doing things

360
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:46,910
Differently because I think it'll help my business proud principal one our priorities for the business and I screw it up

361
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,310
I may want to fix forward versus roll back and in this case

362
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:58,490
Yeah, I'm as you can tell I am one million percent against the idea that

363
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:02,270
Hiring a test team is the right way to

364
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,860
Fix any perceived or real bugs in Windows quality

365
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,780
Now and so in generic advice, right is

366
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,430
if

367
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:17,820
You realize you pulled the trigger too soon, right?

368
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,340
And and I'm not saying if Windows did or did not but there are multiple teams that I have observed

369
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,900
And were involved in where I felt oh

370
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,780
That team absolutely pulled the trigger too soon

371
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,090
Sure. Do you solve?

372
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,250
critical quality

373
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,650
Issues with the dollar sign

374
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,470
absolutely

375
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,550
Were I in a strategic role on those teams? Sure. I would go I would spend

376
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:54,950
The necessary money on vendor dollars to bring things up to speed

377
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,470
But now without a plan that was proactively communicated

378
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:06,510
around when these guys are going away and my expectations of the of

379
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:10,530
The people who will be left behind

380
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,400
See you would start with why I?

381
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:21,560
Absolutely. Yeah, and that's that's super important organizational change and I and that I don't want to I I don't want to be yet another

382
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,960
Microsoft employee harping on why Microsoft sucks and

383
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
You do that well already

384
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,680
I do want to mention that the issues with updating from build to build on

385
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,280
Windows are what drove me away from using Windows

386
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,880
Sure. So it there are issues there

387
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,670
And I think the end in my experience was you know being at Microsoft my bills were updated much more often

388
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,150
my experience was that

389
00:29:51,770 --> 00:30:01,400
It's been over a year since I've used Windows, but my personal experience was yes quality did go down. I have I

390
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,840
have similar

391
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,920
similar

392
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,670
complaints on a broad aspect

393
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,630
I have no proof of this

394
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:23,870
But I do except for this is the thing that drives me the most nuts nowadays and I do feel like

395
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:30,950
UI design has taken a hit

396
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,420
right at the

397
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,930
Teams your your old product. Yep. Okay, it does weird things

398
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,490
with microphones

399
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:47,350
Like it didn't just pick up the default OS microphone

400
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,520
And apparently the only time I can go and change the microphone is when I'm on a call

401
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,160
And I'm like what the hell?

402
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,160
Right in you it has a settings button and

403
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:05,670
That you go to that one you click the settings button and it takes you to oh

404
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,390
Here's a whole bunch of apps you can install for teams. I'm like

405
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:15,020
Why is that not a downloads apps button?

406
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,140
How is that settings?

407
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:22,640
No, where do I change the goddamn microphone for this product?

408
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:30,120
The because I happen to have one of I got a new computer and the new computer

409
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:39,080
Is a desktop, but it's I don't know why companies still build these but it's one where the desktop has an integrated microphone

410
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:45,380
Who the hell uses that what the hell who the hell uses that nobody? No, no, buddy

411
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,600
That well, let me tell you the challenges

412
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,360
Of course that I guess they want to add it because it's ten cents

413
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,960
But I hate to do this in the context this conversation

414
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:04,640
But the integrated microphone on my MacBook is actually very very good. I use the one

415
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,200
shocking

416
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,760
Very shocking. It's the the MacBook microphones are very very good. I have a Lenovo

417
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,880
And I do conference calls and I'd say no one complains

418
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,520
Yeah

419
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,120
In fact if you I was on the test and code podcast maybe three months ago

420
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,560
Yep, if you listen to that my entire audio is recorded off of my MacBook microphone

421
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,600
Yeah, so just saying anyway go on

422
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,130
Where were we when it occurred and

423
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:44,080
Like I don't know when that article came out

424
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:50,420
The the one with the video that you're talking about. Oh just within the last few weeks. Yeah, okay

425
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
So that would be the latest example

426
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:02,160
When they were going through the transition I heard all sorts of dev and testers fighting it

427
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,860
Three years later I'm aware of devs devs coming to insane we need to do this

428
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,090
And I would say

429
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,330
to

430
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,230
Microsoft's credit most of those teams those requests have been denied

431
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:32,050
In in steel to bring back testers, yeah, okay, and I had a good finish then I want to build on that story the

432
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,290
Steve would do would do a much more detailed

433
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,340
job I

434
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,220
Guess the nice thing though is the fact that you and I are not on the teams

435
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,140
And don't know much about it except for the people we talked to it

436
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,660
Reduces our risk of or at least my risk of exposing an NDA

437
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,620
right and and to be fair an operating system is very complex and

438
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,750
It's the hardware ecosystem the fact that that PCs can contain a

439
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:09,270
Virtually infinite or combinatorial infinite number of

440
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,410
Combination of devices makes things difficult. I know how I said that right but

441
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,750
And if you look at Microsoft's main customers, which are corporations

442
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:23,370
They tend to buy a lot of the same PCs for all their employees. They get a much higher success rate

443
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,860
It's I think it's tough on the home user though. Well, and the other thing so I

444
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,290
Will say I am

445
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,650
Pro Satya I

446
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:39,490
Very say I'm too. I'm very supportive of the direction. I like I didn't leave because of him. I

447
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Like that. He is taking a proactive

448
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
stance I felt

449
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,320
Bomber spent most of his time trying to defend a position and

450
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,980
When you when you need do that

451
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,830
It

452
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:06,270
Makes it just so much easier for a small upstart to come from nowhere and take your market, right?

453
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,530
I

454
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,530
Told this story before

455
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:14,850
Ten years ago or so. I was having discussions with a manager of mine and

456
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,010
They were like, oh

457
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:21,130
We own the OS market and we will forever

458
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,450
because we have

459
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:29,650
18 quadrillion lines of code and it is so complex and

460
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:37,220
Company like Android OS is my favorite example here. It came from nowhere

461
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,580
to dominance and it's because of

462
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,980
They took a service service mentality to deploy it

463
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
so

464
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,020
Barna Cleese or whatever the guy's name is

465
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,010
If we want to go back in time, there is one point in time where I'll agree

466
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:02,860
If we're gonna go back in time, we need to go back in the time before services existed and

467
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:11,490
Never create service and never create services and then everything he's saying is correct. But until then there's going to be

468
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,330
companies

469
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:19,110
Like that that were that that approaches ludicrous so I have two stories to tell

470
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,110
One is I was in a

471
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
some leadership training at Microsoft

472
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,940
15 years ago and there was a since retired air quote retired VP of

473
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
In I think he was in networking

474
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:37,980
But he was talking about this same thing as OS dominance and dad

475
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,740
I did it up and this is just the time the Chromebook was announced but not out yet

476
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,060
But I asked I said my question was pretty much along the lines of

477
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,220
The way I work today given the fact that

478
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,170
An information worker can work largely in a browser all day long

479
00:36:56,090 --> 00:37:00,370
Do you see a need for Microsoft to compete with a lighter weight OS that?

480
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:09,010
Focuses on the browser experience basically I said should we have a Chrome should we have a Chrome OS competitor and his answer was

481
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:16,230
It's like the spinal tap answer, but our apps go to 11 says but why would you want that when you couldn't have windows and play games, too?

482
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:22,840
So that's not the point and they just kind of double down on well, I can play games in the browser

483
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:29,680
His whole line of questioning this whole line of answers to me were but we can do more with Windows

484
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,840
Yes, it's true, but you can

485
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,360
When you're trying to increase market share you have two options you can go after someone else's market share or

486
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:44,360
Like the smart people do go grab market share that hasn't been grabbed yet

487
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,750
Or create a new market or create a new market. Yes, which is kind of the same thing

488
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,250
the the other so that that happened that was yet another brick in the wall of my

489
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,230
my long exit

490
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,670
But the interesting story is now I don't fast-forward this to last week

491
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:11,180
When I had a conversation, maybe it was this Monday. I had a conversation with someone on my in my org

492
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,970
at Unity

493
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,140
Where we have I

494
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,580
Wouldn't call him a tester

495
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:25,920
I have someone who is a sort of a test coach testing quality coach for an entire half of the team

496
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,480
I think I want to hire someone else to do the other half of the team

497
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,360
I think it actually works out really well to have someone float and help and coach and not do all the work

498
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:36,340
And I think that's a right way. I think it's like it aligns MT very well

499
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,120
I need that coach there

500
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:44,720
But anyway, they said their question was I think we need to hire a test team and they thought I would be oh great

501
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,800
I can build my empire and hire testers and I told them why they were wrong

502
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,920
They said but but but but but and which is gonna dovetail into our next question a little bit maybe

503
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,480
But my answer the answer was no and then it was no and they said but but what about we have to

504
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:09,530
For this particular part. We need to test across

505
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,230
60 different phones and this and I said great

506
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,900
We have

507
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,140
Bit bar we can use for that. It goes no, no, no we can use for something. Okay. Okay

508
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,340
There's a little bit of stuff

509
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:27,180
We need to spot check on each of the phones and make sure things we have to do we need eyeballs on it

510
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,580
I'm not against eyeball testing and not I'm not in the automate everything camp. So it's okay. Cool. Cool

511
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:40,880
That's the perfect thing to hire out. I would not hire a test team a full-time tester to come in and check

512
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,400
the not to

513
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,400
degrade

514
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,960
Offshore teams or even even near store teams that do this manual verification

515
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,400
I would even give them narratives and do some exploratory testing for us, but I would definitely contract that workout and

516
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,680
They didn't once I kind of explained that view

517
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,400
there was

518
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,560
Right now this is just Monday. There's the the reaction was somewhere between yeah, of course you write Alan and and

519
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,640
Well, let me ponder that a little bit. They're sort of thinking about that

520
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,520
I think that makes sense to them. But anyway, that just happened. So I am NOT hiring a test team

521
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:25,720
However, I'll probably hire one kind of senior coachable tester in San Francisco. Hey three

522
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,540
At some point in the next few months. But anyway

523
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,480
Did you have more on barnacles? Did you want to dovetail this into the next mail bed question?

524
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,120
Yeah, look we can we can go in the next mail

525
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,320
Like and I if I remember I'll link the video it should be easy to find

526
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,720
I think it was shared a whole bunch of times. He makes a joke about the video going viral

527
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I think it actually did sort of go viral

528
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,360
But

529
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
Yeah, it's worth checking out

530
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,280
Only to get your own only to build your own opinion versus the one I've created for either

531
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,750
It it is human nature

532
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,870
to resist

533
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,470
change

534
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:13,400
The the thing like as you talked about right a long term

535
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:17,760
long term

536
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,000
I mean, I'm this is not the prediction episode

537
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,400
No that comes up in another few months, but as you talked about right

538
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,170
You can do a lot with just the browser alone

539
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:36,210
Will there be a concept of a universal cloud OS?

540
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:42,920
Where maybe whatever limitations browsers have get fixed

541
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:48,490
The cloud is growing the cloud is not gonna go away and

542
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:52,650
Well what we're observing is

543
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,250
What people want is compute?

544
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:06,360
Not anything underneath it. Why do I even need to know there is hardware in today's world?

545
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,760
Right in what we're finding is is that so you can play games friends

546
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:19,540
I don't need to know that so it for those who have studied object oriented design

547
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,860
Right what we're seeing is is

548
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,390
Encapsulation even in the compute space and it continues to grow right

549
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,090
Microservices everywhere is going to be a thing that happens

550
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:41,090
Right, and then you hook that up to IOT or right? I am more worried about

551
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:48,110
Things just magically happen and no one knows why anymore

552
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
because they we

553
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,560
Humans just don't have the ability to pay that much attention to the complexity

554
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:03,560
And if we have individual teams deploying these small little widgets and and we have millions of teams and millions of widgets

555
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,670
Right it just to me feels like it gets a little bit closer to

556
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,850
Magic I was talking with my daughter just yesterday and

557
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:17,810
She's super excited about her having her phone

558
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:24,610
And she was asking about laptops and phones and right now Samsung 10 are actually

559
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,350
They're making a statement that their phones can be used

560
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:34,280
in a place of a laptop and viable a

561
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,410
Make a

562
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,450
phone with a terabyte of storage

563
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:41,530
I'll essentially

564
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,570
in memory

565
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:48,940
Right, that's I mean if you can deal with the the small form factor

566
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,860
You're good to go. Yeah, and interesting

567
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,460
I do want to get to the next question in our last 10 minutes or so here, but I built a new

568
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,420
home computer maybe coming up on three years right when I left Microsoft and

569
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,490
on your recommendation I got

570
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,670
The what do they call the m1 m2 m2 drive? Isn't that thing cool? It's cool

571
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,150
I've also got an SSD. I figured okay, I should I feel like I need a gig of

572
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:19,520
Storage a gig a terabyte. Thanks

573
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,520
512 m2 and a 512

574
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,680
SSD I

575
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:33,920
Forget I have the SSD because the 512 m2 is more than enough

576
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,920
I just don't have enough stuff that I store and this is I started syncing my Google drives

577
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:46,160
To my box as well. I just don't store that much stuff on I don't keep them any artifacts locally

578
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:50,570
Right because you have it, you know used to be

579
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,890
You're adding

580
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,570
You have your computer for a year you add another hard drive to it

581
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:02,170
You keep on adding storage till you have this massive storage and I remember doing this for years

582
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,610
I just don't need as much anymore. The only reason why I have

583
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,350
storage on my box at home because I do the same thing I'm like

584
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:15,580
Hey, if I just load it up to to one drive

585
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,870
I have a lot more confidence

586
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:21,860
that

587
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:27,020
That's gonna be protected and secured and backed up than I do if I did it manually

588
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:32,460
Yeah, because I hate doing it and I'm lazy. Yeah, I have rule of three for backups. So we have a

589
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:38,020
server at home a NAS server which is backed up continuously to

590
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:44,210
Actually Amazon I pay for carbonate

591
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,950
so Amazon is Prime members at 60 bucks a year for a terabyte and that's

592
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,350
I say just under that because photos are free

593
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:57,550
Then first stuff I have my entire CD collection over CDs

594
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:03,510
Ripped to flak which is lossless audio and that's all backed up to Glacier storage. I pay a dollar a month for that

595
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,050
dollar 50 maybe

596
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:10,730
Yeah, it's just there for like I don't want to re-rip them all again, but I want so it's I spend

597
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:19,960
$15 a year just to make sure never have to re-rip my entire CD collection. So I have about

598
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:27,220
Three thousand CDs in boxes sitting underneath my bed and I have

599
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:30,700
No idea what I'm gonna do with these things. Yeah, I mean

600
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:36,830
The hundred dollar a year Spotify subscription. I'm good. Yeah, it is

601
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:44,330
Shall we call not ripping these things I'm not playing them. I don't know what to do

602
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:50,280
All right. We'll do go to the next time. So I do want to get into the second question. Let's do it briefly here

603
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,960
So can you read the question?

604
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,160
The questions long we have 10 minutes. I'll summarize it. That's that's what I hoped. Okay, can you summarize the question? I meant to say hi

605
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,040
Alan. Hey, how's it going? I am fine. Thank you. I

606
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,730
Work for a QA agency. I'm all aboard on MT

607
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:19,240
But ultimately I go to my clients and they say that's great

608
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,360
Here's a bunch of test cases. Please go automate them

609
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,120
So the question is is how do I apply MT in that scenario?

610
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:35,890
That's an excellent question. It is so anyway, we're out of time

611
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:44,530
It'll generate more questions we can talk about yeah, no, let's let's do it. I'm kidding

612
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,730
Yeah, no, I think it's it's tough because you're getting paid

613
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,790
In a situation like that you're getting paid to do what?

614
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:57,510
The customer wants you to do if they tell you that you need your job is to go

615
00:47:58,530 --> 00:48:02,010
Clean their bathroom. I guess you do it or you quit the same thing with

616
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,730
Please run all these test cases reminds me again going back to my first day at Microsoft when

617
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:12,570
My manager gave me an Excel spreadsheet full of these UI test case these test cases

618
00:48:12,570 --> 00:48:15,650
I said great when you need these automated because oh, no, we don't have time to automate

619
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:18,290
You just need to run these every day. So I automated them anyway

620
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:25,120
My first act of defiance at Microsoft took about two days and I never stopped but in this situation

621
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,280
I think it's tough because on one hand

622
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,040
There's what the customer wants versus what they need and obviously you can't go in there and say no

623
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:39,440
I'm not gonna run your test cases. I'm going to transform your organization into the 21st century

624
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,440
That's not what they want to hear

625
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,230
But I would say and I sure you have some ideas as well is sure you go you go do that testing

626
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:51,310
But you start doing some things that enable

627
00:48:51,990 --> 00:48:57,350
The growth of the quality culture and maybe that may be quality culture is where you start with principle

628
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:02,310
Number four is where you start in a row click. This is you do the testing but you talk when you go

629
00:49:03,430 --> 00:49:10,670
Deliver the bug to the developer as barnaclay's is talking about as with some huge awesome thing

630
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:14,070
You have a conversation about so cool. Do you want to?

631
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:20,470
Do you want to pair up on fixing it? Do you want to pair up on testing it when you have the fix ready?

632
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,630
Can we talk about how we could have prevented this? What do you think we should do differently?

633
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,510
Think we could add tools and see I should we have a CI system?

634
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:33,870
That'll make my job easier because then you guys would find these bugs what test Oh my favorite question ask the developers

635
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:40,420
When they say like you please test this for me if they were to say that to me, they're not that stupid. I would say

636
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:47,360
What tests have you already run and just to get those conversations going say no, it's your job

637
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,880
Well, actually no, my job is different. I would say it's even as a QA agency is look I

638
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,120
Can't come in here and find all your bugs for you. It's not gonna scale that way

639
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:02,020
I'm gonna find the bugs that you can't find. So let's look at this as a bandpass filter

640
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,360
So there's a bunch of bugs that you are more suitable and more able to find

641
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,080
I'm not gonna be your safety net. I'm not gonna be your

642
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,040
It's we're gonna be more efficient. We're gonna have a better relationship

643
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:18,080
We're gonna deliver higher quality software together if you find the bugs that you're capable of finding and over time as we work together

644
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,440
You're gonna get better at that

645
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,240
But for now

646
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,640
Let's talk about what testing you're going to do and then I can figure out how to build on that and make sure we deliver

647
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,600
A high quality product together. I would have a conversation kind of like that and see

648
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,620
Where that builds to and obviously it's gonna go in one of ten thousand different directions

649
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:38,160
it is interesting given like the

650
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,760
They're in a contract position

651
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,550
but

652
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:43,870
the

653
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:49,190
Specific scenario I think is actually something we spent a good amount of time in the same episode talking about

654
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:52,830
in cases of crises, that's that's

655
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:54,870
appropriate so

656
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,270
this particular person said

657
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:01,250
Their scenario. I don't know if this is real or just

658
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,940
Hypothetical but their scenario was

659
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,660
Their company or him were being hired

660
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,530
To convert manual test cases to automate

661
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:19,470
All right, that is one of the levels of hell I think

662
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,400
It is

663
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,390
But let's let's do it this way

664
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,620
startup company

665
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:36,260
Right it the the the role of a startup is to find a stable business plan before the money runs out

666
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,530
Right and so one of the first things

667
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:44,850
Why I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but one of the first things that's going to be abandoned in

668
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,850
In a situation like that if you're out of time

669
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:54,400
You're gonna go the quick path. You're not gonna not gonna invest in automating the test cases. You'll run them

670
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,290
But you're not going to invest in automating them

671
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,850
the

672
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,690
and again

673
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,690
Probably the wrong thing to do

674
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:09,850
But it seems like a time-saving cost at that moment

675
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:17,010
And it's primarily because people don't really pay attention to all the missed bugs that they're now having to fund

676
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,570
instead of writing new features I

677
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:27,200
Am perfectly okay that once you realize you have that as technical debt and that is actually bottle necking you

678
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,840
I'm perfectly okay spending money to buy it down

679
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,100
There's a technique to I mean my read my my

680
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:44,410
Hell reactions because not all air quote manual tests can be air quote automated

681
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,640
That's it's a different is a test design problem

682
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:54,120
There may be a bunch of tests set. Yes, we could automate these

683
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:58,340
There may be a bunch of tests like no actually it makes sense to have eyeballs on these

684
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:02,160
we should not we should make sure we just do a little sanity walkthrough or

685
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,480
Realize it's never going to break and not run those tests at all

686
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:10,880
And there's another group of tests like maybe we need just write a diagnostic tool that will tell us what's going on

687
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,240
that would highlight issues that happen like this, but take a list of

688
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:22,080
Test cases that are scripted and to automate them is I think more often than not a fool's errand

689
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,040
Here's or at least approached blindly. Here's what I would do

690
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:31,820
Here's my answer to that question in what I would do in that person's shoes and

691
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,990
Generalizing what you just said, okay?

692
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:43,440
So I'm being hired and being paid to do a job. I will do that job. Okay, but I

693
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,250
Will write up

694
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:49,290
at some point when I have sufficient knowledge I

695
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,120
Will write up a

696
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,810
proposal that would very much align with MT

697
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,210
Titled

698
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:05,920
Here's the things that in in the process of doing work that I learned and

699
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:08,390
and I'm now going to give you as

700
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,670
Recommendations because you're my client

701
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:20,650
For the explicit purpose to making it harder for you to have to make the decision to hire me or someone like me

702
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:27,330
It's a tough thing to do as a consultant because or as a contractor because you're coming in you're hired to solve

703
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:34,010
Earlier I said how I'd use contractors to solve a short-term problem, but you're coming in to solve a short-term problem

704
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,010
But you want to also give them a long-term solution

705
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,490
and

706
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:42,090
In this particular case, even if you were in a QA agency

707
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:44,930
I

708
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:51,690
Would do that because it would positively impact my brand with that company or every other client I have

709
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:59,040
They go so they I would officially turn myself into the Mary Poppins of QA

710
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,800
That might even be the name of the company if it's not trademarked. I'm sure it's trademark

711
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,620
Alright, so we will we will we will dig into this later as more questions come up

712
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,680
But hopefully I can get this released and the sound doesn't suck

713
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,520
All right. Good chatting with you Brent and you Alan. All right
