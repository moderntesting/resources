1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
Because now it's more martial arts. It's not boxing, right?

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,720
It's not like who can punch each other in the head the hardest

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,360
It is can you use the momentum of the people around you to be able to achieve the effect you're looking for?

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,170
Welcome to a be testing podcast your modern testing podcast

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,950
Your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,070
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

7
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,150
Everyone welcome to episode 182 of the a be testing podcast

8
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:42,830
Brent is I mean, I can't even see Brent. I think he's lost but we do have Brian Pulliam here. Say hi Brian. Hey

9
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,910
And oh, there's Brent Brent just came in he was shoveling out the barn. Hey Brent, how's it going? Hey

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,870
Yeah, so I hear I'm

11
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,230
I'm on today to interview my replacement. Is that right?

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,070
The B does stand for Brent and the B could stand for Brian. So yeah, we're doing a trial run here. Okay

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:10,510
Actually, there's a reason I wanted to have Brian here and it goes back to I don't know

14
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,510
I think you maybe you can

15
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,830
Brian we all worked at Mike Brent still of Microsoft. I left Microsoft seven years ago

16
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,710
I think Brian left before then and we'll get into all that if needed or not

17
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,910
We have no plan here

18
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:30,510
But Brian can you refresh me and our listeners more because I remember most of it on how like how did we cross paths?

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,990
Yeah, so

20
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:38,590
Let's see. Wow. I worked at Microsoft for about nine years. I actually got hired

21
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,270
They say they hired me as a PM

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:46,270
But my my FTE sponsor at the time for my contract work needed an analyst

23
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,350
But he couldn't get a budget for an analyst. So I heard an analytics PM, which was no PM work whatsoever

24
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,510
They just basically straight up lied to get the right person in the role

25
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,750
So I joined as an analyst and I learned how to be a PM at Microsoft

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:04,550
Not a bad place Nathan Mira vault having come up with what that role means

27
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:11,590
originally and I worked with in a group called engineering excellence, which had a lot to do with a rotational effort to

28
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,470
Understand what it meant to be a really good tester or a really good PM or a really good engineer and then rotate back

29
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,790
into the product works and bring what you've learned back to

30
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,070
office Azure

31
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,910
and name any other big orgs you'd like so there I I

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:33,950
found a close friend in the name of Paul God who was a big test champion and

33
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,630
he since moved on to Zillow and a few other places, but

34
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,790
we got to talking about product quality and

35
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,190
Then your book how we test that Microsoft came up and so ever since then I've sort of had that your name in the

36
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,390
Back of my head and I stumbled across to find out that you live in the same city

37
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,230
I do we live like a half mile from each other

38
00:02:54,230 --> 00:03:00,870
Yeah, we've walked to like what 10 minutes each way to get to a coffee shop or at least I drove it was raining

39
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,150
Drove he probably would have got there faster if he walked but that's fine. So

40
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:15,500
Good so I'm looking at this like you met outside of EE we know we I think we just barely

41
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,180
Didn't cross paths. I think I may be left as he was coming in. Yeah

42
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,020
So it never we never met while we were at Microsoft. In fact, we didn't meet until probably what like a month ago

43
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,860
Yeah, something like that

44
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:30,700
but Alan having had a background in

45
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:37,260
Microsoft and in games and me having started out my professional career as a game developer

46
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,380
There were too many commonalities to not reach out to Alan for a coffee chat

47
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:49,780
Having him having worked at Unity me having worked in children software at a small company called humongous entertainment that melon made

48
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,640
Children's games and one thing you didn't call out that I and this is what other good connection

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,780
there's a data analyst part Brent's going ooh interesting and

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,100
but

51
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,560
You know everyone knows I thought everyone knows I shouldn't say that all three listeners probably know I do a blog post every week

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,740
And there is one where I talked about the different sort of tests and a big fan of this one from Pat lunch, Yoni called

53
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,100
Working genius. I've also done strengths finders and Brian knows a lot about strengths finders

54
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,060
I thought oh, you know who else I know who loves strengths finders. It's Bert. Jertson

55
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,490
This well, I don't know who that guy is

56
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,090
But you know three then Alan

57
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,290
Yeah, and to be clear I would be very clear

58
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,170
I am NOT against strengths finders and actually Brian walked me through I took the test again

59
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,650
He gave me a key to take it and results are slightly different than before but you know in the same ballpark

60
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,450
And I've evolved it's been 10 years since I took it

61
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,570
So not not a non van

62
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,650
But I thought it'd be cool to maybe have you two talk about strengths finders a little bit because I know Brent Brent's a big fan

63
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,410
It sounds like we're gonna be singing to the choir. I've said this on this before my view is strengths

64
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,930
it's got all the

65
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,410
The mystical

66
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,650
psychotyping of things like Myers Briggs

67
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,330
But it's actually useful

68
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:16,890
Actionable and something you can develop and grow in so for example

69
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,610
My number one strength is ideator

70
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,210
But that's my top one

71
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,810
That's why you drive me crazy. No, it's actually

72
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,650
The ideator is I would say one place where we where we

73
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,050
Connect on the the problem is is every strength is also

74
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:46,650
Perceived by others as your biggest weakness sure right right my me beam ideator. That's actually the place where

75
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,650
my my

76
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,850
Tangentation comes from if I can

77
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,930
Be invited to invent a word

78
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,770
It's because I see

79
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:04,890
So a lot of people who don't have ideation will view me as constantly having my head in the clouds right

80
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,450
whereas I

81
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,010
go

82
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:10,320
well

83
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
It's it's actually the same thing

84
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,240
So Alan back in the day when we predicted the the beginning of the end for test

85
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,960
I had people come up to me and go wow that was really

86
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,760
As if I was like a prophet and dreamed it and whatever and I'm like no

87
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,240
I just saw how things were connected and I saw the momentum and I saw that

88
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,840
Yeah, unless something changes and I don't see anything in

89
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,960
The way to do that change the momentum is in this direction

90
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,840
This is an obvious conclusion as we've also talked before I kind of feel the same way around what's happening around in the AI space

91
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,800
Brian butts so I feel listeners as I was talking Brian was doing all sorts of positive body language like thumbs up like oh wow

92
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,560
I'll interpret it as someone who can at least pretend to know least talking about on this topic

93
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,990
Oh for sure. I will tell you I'll give you my quick spiel

94
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,230
I think the gallon might have heard this already, but

95
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:17,710
I've been in tech for about 26 years, but it hasn't been in one discipline. I was a TPM for a while was an engineer

96
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,870
I was an EM

97
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:25,390
Work for Microsoft Zillow Coinbase and other companies, but my most fulfilling role was none of those

98
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:31,790
my most fulfilling role was this volunteer volleyball coach role with my wife for 13 years and

99
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,230
What really struck me about this is I didn't even want to go the first day

100
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:41,950
My wife got this job as coach. She and I met playing volleyball

101
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,630
It's kind of like part-time relationship status, and I said why would I ever want to coach like I love playing volleyball

102
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,150
Why would I ever want to help people that are terrible at it get better at it and?

103
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:57,110
And then after the first season I remember thinking wow if I had three million in the bank

104
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,270
I would probably just do this for the rest of my life until I was physically unable to do it anymore and

105
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,420
Then maybe five minutes later Brent. I said wait a minute

106
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,260
how am I so bad at

107
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,260
interpreting or

108
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,980
Predicting what will make me fulfilled in life if I can go from something

109
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,180
I thought was going to be stupid to it being one of the most fulfilling activities. I've ever had

110
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,080
That freaked me out

111
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm like wait do I have to say yes to everything going forward or to all I know I need to go learn a little

112
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,760
Bit more about myself. I need to run this post mortem and figure out why I felt so differently before versus after

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,840
And I turned it turns out

114
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,200
I love helping other people succeed, but only when they are excited and committed to their goals so not a teacher

115
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:50,120
Okay, so I'm guessing you have developer in your top five. I don't anymore. I used to okay mine are strategic

116
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,270
maximizer who

117
00:08:53,790 --> 00:09:00,230
Communication and positivity if that's not a coach. I don't know what is but that's that is 100% a coach

118
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:06,970
Yeah, yeah, it's it's amazing so I remember or sales or sales could be sales

119
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:13,690
Yeah, easy to I like influencing other people as long as it's for a good cause so that's great and to the listeners

120
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,010
Yeah, yeah, please translate to English for everyone else

121
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,970
Alan is is

122
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,470
Like I think this episode might just be for Alan because he is busily cracking him home

123
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:30,250
His own self up so Alan maybe you should share with the audience

124
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,810
We're not doing a live feed today

125
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,050
No, no, no live feed today

126
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:42,810
But maybe I'll draw some pictures for the show notes. Yeah, the it's interesting like you you mentioned maximizer

127
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,130
I am a restorative. So for for the audience

128
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:51,250
Maximizer is a strength. They want

129
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,970
I'll put it this way

130
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,970
maximizers can't stand the use of the 80-20 rule like what do you mean 80-20?

131
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,090
I want a hundred right it maximizers

132
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,530
strive for

133
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:13,410
Perfection one one fact I don't know Brian if you've ever actually done this Gallup has a bunch of really

134
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,890
educational things on on YouTube for each of the strengths and if you have if you have

135
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,290
restorative in your top five

136
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,890
something ungodly like 95 percent chance that

137
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,650
Maximizer is your number 34

138
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:37,870
Interesting. Yeah, it's someone with restorative is driven to fix broken things

139
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:45,110
They're good at identifying broken things and they want them fixed, but I'll tell you once it's fixed. I'm good

140
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:50,230
I don't I don't need to take it the extra 5% that differs from a

141
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:57,270
Maximizer who's like no wait wait. Why are we stopping? We still got more

142
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:04,110
So how when you're a maximizer, how are you doing on your investment? I mean, I'm I'm coast fire now

143
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,730
So I guess you could say good. I mean, you know, I work maybe three hours a day

144
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,670
Oh, no, that that that's fantastic. I'm just thinking I'm not a maximizer obviously

145
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,150
Yeah, but I'm wondering do you ever find yourself going? No. No, I'm not gonna sell now. It's gonna go another point

146
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,450
It's gonna go another point. No, not at all. Like okay

147
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,390
philosophically, I have a certain approach to

148
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:33,340
Money I have now can be used for something that not only is useful for me now

149
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,980
But better for long term and with as much as research I've done

150
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,700
Most people lose money when they make decisions to change where their money is. That's where most people lose their money

151
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,820
so

152
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,660
I'm okay with the Ron Pope you'll sort of set it and forget it approach with you know

153
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,650
call me a boggle head or focused on index funds and I have a year of

154
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,050
Savings set aside kind of guy, you know live within my means. Yeah, I

155
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:06,250
When it comes to investment, I refuse to accept that I am in my 50s

156
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:14,530
So I still like oh I totally could make it a killing on that one. Let's go see. Anyway, all right

157
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:19,170
I will tell you like this I've been grabbed glad you brought up this idea of

158
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,010
What's the flip side of that strength and how other people would be annoyed by it?

159
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,010
Because that is something I think a lot of people

160
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:32,280
Who are exposed to this originally don't don't see there's a there's the three or four perspectives here. There's

161
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,980
How does it help you in your career?

162
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,620
There's

163
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,620
Given that strength. What does your manager need to know about you and to get the best out of you with that strength?

164
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:45,220
Sometimes you have to manage up because they don't know this framework

165
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,180
What kind of environment is really good for you like is the team you're on?

166
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,660
Recognize your strength as a currency. Is it even valued there?

167
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,620
And then thirdly like what are those red flags to watch out for?

168
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,620
Because with maximizer, for example, it is

169
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,880
Very much you want to eke out that last bit like I used to work you guys know Bruce Dawson at all like

170
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,980
Don't know that name. Okay. No, so Bruce Dawson

171
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,020
I used to work with Bruce Dawson back in the day in game development and he went on

172
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,460
To go work on very nerdy stuff at Google

173
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:23,260
But he is like the maximizers maximizer like he's trying to figure out how to optimize the last little bit out of every single thing

174
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,460
So if there was a picture in the dictionary of maximizer, it would be pushed awesome

175
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,940
But with ideation right it is about how do you not come across scatterbrained?

176
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
And how do you make sure you're balancing?

177
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,780
Your ideation with execution right because other people will be like when are you actually going to do something?

178
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,580
Rather than just spout these ideas but with the restorative they help balance each other out, right?

179
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:53,020
So you you get sort of more of the centrist approach where you don't have to worry about it as much if I didn't have

180
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,780
Restorative and I did have ideation. I don't even know that we would be having this conversation

181
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,460
Yeah, right it the the other problem with people

182
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,660
With with ideation so think of it from like an architectural those who are good at identifying

183
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
better ways of doing thing

184
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:20,260
Suddenly lose interest in how we're doing it now, right? This is the common phenomenon with with a lot of architects like segue

185
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,300
they they invented a but I think is a brilliant strategy and that is

186
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:31,460
Run your your v1 project sort of partially shifted with your v2 project

187
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:39,220
That way once your your v1 project is halfway done you start funneling off your your architects

188
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,900
On to v2 and let them go ahead and start ideating for v2

189
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:50,640
But then you have your closers working on the v1 and I'm like, oh, that's freaking

190
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,460
Beautiful. Everybody's happy

191
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,220
Yeah, the the product ships on time because when again one of the flaws with architects is that?

192
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,100
We're really good at coming up with a better way of doing it

193
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,100
And if we get the power to stop ship we will because it's better. Let's do it this way

194
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:16,340
This is smarter and then because we continuously do that will never actually ship that has been

195
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,580
Without my wrist even with my restorative at times that that has been a struggle

196
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,580
But I learned early on how to balance it

197
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:32,200
Yeah, you said maximizer what else were yours Oh strategic maximizer

198
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,120
whoo

199
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,250
communication and positivity Oh

200
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,470
Yeah with those strengths

201
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,390
I'll just tell you straight up

202
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:50,290
Having someone on my team with those strengths because my team is all data scientists

203
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:57,850
Right. I remember one of the best employees I ever had in one regard

204
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,050
And I'm thinking through if it was the best because he really complimented the team

205
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:08,230
He had communication and it was his number one and he would send status reports

206
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,490
I one day I was I just tried to experiment, you know what? I'm gonna have him. I hate writing the status reports

207
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,930
I find them a waste of my time

208
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:19,650
I hate writing in general because one of my strengths is analytical

209
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,250
So I will literally spend a half hour looking at the same sentence and judging every possible way

210
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:32,790
Whether you combine and restorative and I'll go no that's broken. I got a rephrase it this way. No, that's it's torturous

211
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:36,330
I hate it. Whereas I live in the moment. We'll talk about that in a minute

212
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:44,250
Alan Alan I'm amazed at Ellen when he and I've commented on just different skills, man

213
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,250
It's it's different skills different talents. I had him take over my status report

214
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,730
now number one

215
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:58,810
He loved it. Right? This is the first thing to learn about strengths. I don't have communication

216
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:07,090
He does so I go to him and go and I I really can't ask my employee to do this thing that I guess to me

217
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,570
Status report and pain like there is no there's it's a perfect Union

218
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:19,970
It's it's complete intersection. No, not only did he love it. I had people

219
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,750
Asked to subscribe to my status reports never had that before ever

220
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:34,370
Like are you serious? Right? It's this is what I like about both strengths finders and working genius

221
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,610
In a little bit different, but it's actually two things I like and what I want to talk about

222
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:43,190
But what you just said is if you understand how they work

223
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,600
you understand how to actually maximize and play that jigsaw Pete puzzle maker or conductor of a team and

224
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,400
Leverage each other's strengths working genius. I could go deep into that

225
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,080
But it's the same sort of thing

226
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,660
It says some people are you're good at two of the six of these things wonder invention discernment galvanizing enablement or trinasty

227
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,400
and

228
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,120
there's two things probably in there you kind of hate and if you things you're kind of in the middle and if you

229
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,800
understand that different people are good at different parts of this

230
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,320
Of going from an idea or wondering what can be done to actually getting it done

231
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,380
You can orchestrate your team that way the other thing that's interesting and brain

232
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,840
I haven't gone over this with you

233
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:27,800
I'd love to get your feedback on it and Brian are gate already gave me a walkthrough so he can give me add some

234
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,120
certificate commentary as well, but is they both can if they can change

235
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
Yeah, I

236
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,320
Myers Briggs based on the work of Carl Jung and says it's to you are it's not gonna change you can adapt but

237
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,920
And it's a little horoscope and I like it I can read mine and go yeah, that's pretty much me but these are much more

238
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,040
applicable and

239
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,160
Here's the thing brain. You've known me since the first time I took it

240
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,560
You know what I was doing and then in my I've evolved and I've I found other things

241
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,180
I like doing more and I'm better at I took it last time. I was basically an IC

242
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
building tools on Xbox

243
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:08,140
Lots of influence involved that back then I was in order strategic learner

244
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,260
Achiever

245
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,180
analytical

246
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,830
Intellection ten years ago. Okay, maybe 12 years ago

247
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,590
today, I'm

248
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,710
strategic still

249
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:26,290
Relator because I'm I've I've become a stupid VP and I have to have to relate

250
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:32,930
Arranger, which I actually love it's the favorite part of my job or like

251
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:39,290
Seeing what can like putting all the pieces together. Look here's the pieces I have okay here and here and here

252
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,330
It's like cooking. It's fun

253
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,530
adaptability

254
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,890
and

255
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,870
Intellection so I'm just kind of curious maybe for you like I missed one

256
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,910
Strategic Relator arranger adaptability

257
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:56,430
Intellection are my nose. Okay, my old ones here

258
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,990
strategic learner

259
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,310
achiever

260
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,150
analytical

261
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,920
Intellection and probably if we went down and got my top ten, they probably have much more overlap

262
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,880
So Brent just maybe starting with actually starting for either one of you like

263
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:15,840
one am I correct in my interpretation that these can change over time and

264
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,360
As you grow and change there, there's no so Gallup

265
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:28,060
So the nice thing about Gallup doing this they have over 50 years of like stats on this one, right?

266
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,620
There's no evidence that these are are

267
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:38,820
permanent and even Carl Jung mentioned not Meyers that everyone calls it Meyers Briggs, but it's actually Carl Jung

268
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,260
They did it and it's his psychotyping. Yeah, he wrongly stated that it's it's

269
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:50,490
Permanent but even recent things show no. No, it's actually very common

270
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:56,770
For example traumatic events will change your change your psychotype. I will tell you I experienced this myself

271
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:04,200
I'm not gonna go into details in the traumatic event 30 years ago. I was intj and now I am intp

272
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,600
I am a strong P and previously I was a strong J

273
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,940
Didn't have much of effect obviously on the other three letters, but that one massive

274
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,900
Impact and totally makes sense in terms of you like I could see this all makes sense to me

275
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
right except maybe a

276
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,880
ranger

277
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,160
In terms of my knowledge of you relater. Yeah, I totally see that one

278
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:36,840
At the when you left Microsoft like literally the episodes I

279
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:44,430
Bet you we even recorded it because you were nervous because the majority of the time I knew you at at Microsoft

280
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:50,510
It was hell. No, I will never friggin be a manager and I want to get Brian's take on this thing

281
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:57,030
But and that reason was at the time remember this is I did not want to be a manager not couldn't like managing people

282
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:02,110
frequently thought of being a manager being a manager at Microsoft in the

283
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,750
2010s kind of sucked

284
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:11,350
These have changed because I've actually really enjoyed leading large teams and the challenges go on with that different set of challenges and I faced

285
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,030
in the old days

286
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,150
Anyway, Brian curious on your thoughts on my evolution, you know, you didn't know me back

287
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:20,870
Yeah thoughts on my evolution. I will say this

288
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,450
I think I don't you know, I didn't ask Brent this question

289
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,510
But I think I've probably taken about a hundred and five people through StrengthsFinder so far

290
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:31,740
So I've done it a bit and one of the reasons why I found it

291
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,900
So natural for me was when I became a leader

292
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,520
The only thing I could look back on for a foundation was athletics coaching. I'm like, okay

293
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,720
We here's a group of people we're trying to work together. We're trying to achieve something

294
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,220
It's hard and I remembered saying well, I need to use this strength spaced approach in the workplace

295
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:53,900
I might as well try it. This is what I know and it worked really well and it worked so well

296
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,620
I started asking other people like hey, why do you do it this way?

297
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,380
Like here I have like two years of experience as a manager and

298
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,060
Yet my didn't realize how much of my coaching experience would apply in the workplace

299
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,160
But what I didn't have were stats, right?

300
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:15,680
I didn't have stats that were meaningful in the workplace to say Alan should do this job or Alan would be good as a TPM

301
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,160
If he's unhappy being a back-end engineer and here's why

302
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,880
So if he wants to consider that discipline change, we should talk about it

303
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,080
But when I found gallup StrengthsFinder, I said aha, this is the conceptual thing I was missing

304
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,680
That is domain agnostic, but tells me what Alan will be good at it or Brent is good at

305
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,940
so now when I look at your transition those new strengths that got added there were later and the

306
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,320
Arranger and there was one other that was new. What was that a third one a cheever?

307
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,220
Cheever was there before I think? Oh, no, no adaptability

308
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:55,140
The old one sorry, yeah, so I mean it doesn't surprise me either

309
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,340
You know you get to a point where what you can accomplish by yourself

310
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:05,980
Is now a small fraction of what you're expected to accomplish in your role, right? You start off

311
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:12,160
What what's the analogy I use for early career people, you know, you become an engineer or tester

312
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,260
It's like baking a cake with a recipe like here's the ingredients. Here's the recipe now

313
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,760
Go bake a cake and I'm gonna turn around and make sure you don't burn down the kitchen and don't swap the sugar for flour

314
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:27,980
Cuz it's a bad idea. Yes, they're both white. Yes, they're both kind of look like powdery substances

315
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:34,820
But don't swap them and then you get better and now I care about what you think not just about what you know

316
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,700
But I want your opinion on things right when you become a senior

317
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,760
But at some point around senior when people need to make that transition to what to staff or principal depending on the company you're at

318
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,100
this

319
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:53,300
You need to develop these skills or focus on how do you bring other people along for the ride because it's now no longer

320
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:59,460
Whether you're the smartest or you're the loudest or you're the most successful person in the room because the projects are too complex

321
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,580
To be able to get it across the line if you can't relate with somebody right or you can't adapt

322
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,740
And so I don't think it's a surprise at all

323
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,520
to say as you advance

324
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,080
higher in leadership and the larger percentage of your work is

325
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,180
Dealing with peers that you don't really have a lot of authority over you have to relate to them

326
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,860
It's the only way you're gonna convince them that to make a to make a compromise, right?

327
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,700
Or or you're the one that has to make the compromise

328
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,980
So you have to be adaptable because now it's more martial arts. It's not boxing, right?

329
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,600
It's not like who can punch each other in the head the hardest it is

330
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,060
Can you use the momentum of the people around you to be able to achieve the effect you're looking for one thing?

331
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,980
I'd like to hear more about and maybe bring you off some stuff here, too

332
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:48,240
But like you mentioned you brought over a hundred people through this and help them

333
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,160
What often happens with these tests is is people take them they go. Oh like me like you

334
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
This is me as an example. I go. Oh

335
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:02,380
Interesting. Wow. I like this. This is really fun and then ever do anything with it. So

336
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:08,780
What advice do you have for managers on let's say let's say I put all of my directs through it

337
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,680
Again, not knowing their results. What would be my approach to look at that stuff?

338
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,720
Do I put them in different jobs? Do I what's like the quick managers guide to using this to?

339
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,700
To improve myself on my team the directs that I've had every direct I've had has gone through this

340
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,660
I made it a point in our one-on-one document

341
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,820
Right like a Google Doc or shared doc or whatever to have the strengths at the top of the one-on-one doc

342
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,980
So every time we open it we see it like so we're using process to visually remind us and there's a lot of engineers that

343
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Don't do great with verbal cognition to begin with right? They either have ADHD and attentive like I do or

344
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,440
They subconsciously got into coding because they could see it. They didn't have to remember things because they could look at them all day long

345
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,860
so

346
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,620
Re-engaging the visual preference that a lot of people in software

347
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:05,460
Have is the good first start put it at the top as a visual reminder every time. So that's number one to I

348
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:11,580
Have discussions with my directs and say hey these strengths are like tools in your tool belt

349
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:18,130
so when we talk about the projects you're gonna go on to or a situation at work the

350
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:24,900
Manager's got to reinforce that well. What are your tools in your tool belt again? I'm asking them. Oh, I'm really good at this and that

351
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,860
Really? How might you use those strengths in this scenario, right? It's a coaching question

352
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,660
It's open-ended and and then thirdly

353
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,500
I'm a big believer in having an entire team

354
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:42,740
Like you said Alan take strengths finder and then I create like a matrix and it's basically got all the strengths as rows

355
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:50,180
The people as columns and I sort it by most overlapping strength to most unique strengths like in this spreadsheet

356
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,220
And the idea is the top four or five that are up there are like the social norms of the team, right?

357
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,340
They are the cultural norms that people should expect when they join this team new employee joins

358
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,860
I show them this and I say hey this team really loves research right or this team really loves solving problems

359
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,860
This team really loves strategic thinking

360
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:16,580
But there are some people at the bottom here who have strengths that nobody else has and you need to know who those people

361
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,620
Are because if you need help with X

362
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,150
There's one person on the team that has that superpower and that's Sally or that's Sarah

363
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,350
And so it becomes a means of onboarding

364
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,990
But it also gives and unlocks capabilities for peer mentoring that didn't exist before

365
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:39,310
Because the granularity in strengths finder is so high when you talk about

366
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:48,190
34 choose 5 right that's a lot of combinations the odds you have somebody on the team that's identical to you is very very small

367
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,140
So use always something you can learn from other people and this helps

368
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,420
Provide a roadmap for that

369
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:02,580
That's that's great advice and I just want to point out because people that are not watching the video feed that doesn't exist Brent is in love

370
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Yeah, yeah

371
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,300
There's there's definitely a bromance

372
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:13,620
Potential here a couple of things that Brian said it cracked me up because I'm like yeah

373
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,860
I could I could share my version of that right now

374
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,180
We've all shared our five online except me

375
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:24,940
So I'll go through that quickly and I and then I want Brian to analyze you

376
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,580
Yeah

377
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,460
I was good just I was going to to set that stage and then I want to answer your question

378
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,000
And there's another question that I want to weigh in on as well

379
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
ideation number one

380
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,980
relater

381
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,060
individualization

382
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,700
restorative analytical now my

383
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,540
question to Brian

384
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
given

385
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:55,060
Individualization what do you think I do with strike fighters? Well, let's see if you're an individualization

386
00:29:55,700 --> 00:30:02,940
Strength you're intrigued with this unique qualities of each person if I am prime customer. Sorry, go on, right?

387
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,660
Yeah

388
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,660
You know if I was your manager

389
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:12,300
Then I would ask if you want to get deeply involved with matching people to projects because you're probably a good judge of each individual

390
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,180
Strengths and their weaknesses which is probably going to optimize the org's productivity

391
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,600
I'm probably gonna ask you if you want to teach internal training classes or mentor new employees

392
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Because you're likely gonna spot how each person learns differently. Yep. I would say I don't like the teaching idea, but I love mentoring

393
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,180
Yeah, yeah, it kind of depends on the person right? No, no getting at the strength like in in its isolation

394
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,700
We have to combine it with the rather ones. Right?

395
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,380
I was gonna say and you would have realized that once you combined it with relater, right? Right and

396
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:45,660
and

397
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,940
given that

398
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:54,140
You know your ideal environment is definitely one where you don't have leaders that think that every dev is fungible, right?

399
00:30:54,140 --> 00:31:00,140
You don't philosophically you're not a believer that I can take any dev and put them on any project because that kind of goes against

400
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,640
What you're thinking about from individualization perspective

401
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:09,250
So you don't you don't want to work where you have a leader that's like we need to hit this target

402
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,170
Like how many warm bodies like even the phrase warm bodies, you know

403
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:18,650
We're butts and seats are things that you want to steer clear of because that's it often not your ideal environment

404
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,010
Those are trigger words for yeah. Yeah

405
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:28,460
Yep, and then thirdly, you know because I work with a lot of clients trying to find to find jobs

406
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,180
There's a set of questions that I usually suggest people ask in the interview to help suss out whether or not

407
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,380
Individualization is a strength that this team that's hiring a position for

408
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:44,720
Would would find value in right and you would try to ask sort of balancing question

409
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,820
Let's say you're behind schedule on a project and you can take three people that don't understand the code base

410
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,940
But they're immediately available and they'll have to ramp up or you have one person you can apply to it

411
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,980
But it means you're not gonna hate your deadline. What do you do?

412
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:02,020
What I would look for is a leader that's like well

413
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:08,380
I'm gonna take the person who's the expert and put them on this team because those three people are likely gonna create

414
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,500
More bugs along the way and I'd rather be a little bit over the deadline

415
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:20,520
With someone who doesn't require a lot of ramp up. So I think I so in your example

416
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,320
I think I would actually I think I would far more

417
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,820
Be far more likely to actually take the three not because of the heartbeats

418
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,620
because more of my perspective on diversity and inclusion

419
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:41,380
Because I believe that with three I'm gonna get more rounded across the 34 on strengths and I do actually almost literally think in

420
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:49,980
This way. Okay. Now, how quickly can I understand these guys and get them working as a team towards a positive direction and work in the

421
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,540
The appropriate training as they go along like you did an excellent job there much of the things

422
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,620
I thought you were gonna go into like you can look at those strengths and see why

423
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:06,000
For a big part of my career people would say Britt. You should not be a manager. You should be a

424
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,620
Architect I got that for a large portion of my career

425
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:15,910
But if you look in my view correctly at these strengths you go. No, that's a mistake

426
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,450
This is not a guy. This is a guy that I don't like being an IC. I

427
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:24,530
Don't like being a manager of managers. I

428
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,850
love being a frontline manager and

429
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:35,610
With my understanding of strengths and I'm sure Brian you you you see the same thing that makes sense

430
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,410
Yeah, it makes total sense. You know if you have one of these top fives in execution

431
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,910
That's about as far away from execution as you can get without feeling like you don't get to solve

432
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:52,310
Those type of problems right restorative like there's a fingerprint to the top five

433
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,870
Where I play this game and I say guess what my job title is based on the top five strengths

434
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,710
And it doesn't mean that's the job they have but oftentimes people feel like their job is off

435
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:06,070
We do this exercise and I say, you know that fingerprint

436
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,850
It doesn't look like the title you've got and I wonder if that's

437
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,690
Supporting evidence for something for you to consider like a transition at some point

438
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:20,170
I would say I'm surprised someone said don't be a manager Brent, you know when you've got

439
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,270
This individualization and relater you've got two of these relationship building

440
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,010
strengths in your top five

441
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:30,810
Engineers on average you don't have that you know

442
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:36,130
I'd say 90% of engineers end up with what two of their top five in execution

443
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,690
Maybe one or two in strategic thinking and then the last one is you know

444
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:47,010
What it's either an influencing a relationship and that's kind of the footprint the way I would describe the scenario

445
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,690
Now looking back is that the people who made that feedback?

446
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:54,830
right number one this was

447
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:00,050
This is like the first 10 years of the career and strengths have been around a lot longer than that

448
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:03,890
But I didn't have visibility to it till I don't know last 15 years

449
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,010
So I didn't have the knowledge

450
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:10,410
But if you look at the strengths that there are certain things that people see

451
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:15,850
Though the see outside in even though they don't know the language for me being an idea guy

452
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:21,690
I got that all of the time me being effective at fixing broken things and being highly analytical

453
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,490
They saw that all the time

454
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:27,770
They didn't see the other things because they were outside looking in

455
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:34,490
The other aspect is looking back at least two of the people that I that said this

456
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,850
I'm fairly certain were activators

457
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:43,370
Okay, and and for the for our audience an activator is someone with with

458
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:50,050
It's a it's an awesome strength. It basically means they need very little data if any at all

459
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:55,090
to make a high confidence decision the risk of an activator is

460
00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:01,410
They can make bad decisions. But what they do is they they they really drive

461
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,010
This energy around Ellen my answer to your question

462
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,390
Where they don't make sense right? You're an introvert

463
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:13,550
And you're now put in a job where you you

464
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,710
Do more?

465
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,910
people

466
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,190
Work, okay

467
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:25,070
There's no way for you to avoid talking to people as much it maybe it was when you were in I see

468
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:32,870
When we talk about the strengths like why do they change? I'll go back to that question. Here's an observation I

469
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:39,350
Have done and and I have done actually several at this point in time

470
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,790
I think I'm I may not be as high as you

471
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:48,050
But I have done at least triple digits on these ones and I if you print out all

472
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,990
34 was one exercise that I find fascinating and that is

473
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:59,110
Like Gallup does the top five and they do a sort of a simplification effect

474
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:04,450
but if you print all the top four what I find to be an education or 34, sorry an

475
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,190
educational exercise is

476
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,510
Go down from the top and then write a line

477
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,750
Where where you where you feel?

478
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,440
That you are not using this on a daily basis

479
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,950
Right. So for me, I know I use my top six on a daily basis and my number six is responsibility

480
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,090
I know I use my top six on a daily basis

481
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:31,130
Then then make a new line where you go

482
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,330
You know what?

483
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:39,030
I've noticed that I can keep going down and I go I use these ones on a weekly basis

484
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:46,090
Command is for example my number 10 and I have to go to command mode

485
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:49,210
At least once a week, but I don't do it daily

486
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:55,410
Then you could also go monthly and then there's some of them like you just like straight up like for me Maximizer

487
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,810
I literally never do or if I do it is so freakin rare

488
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,770
I might as well say literally never do and if you think about that

489
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,520
Right, if you go into a new role, it would make sense

490
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,660
That you're gonna go down your strength preference and then going

491
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:19,900
Oh, I'm in a new role where where I have to use this not weekly but daily and as you practice that because they're not

492
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,820
these are

493
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:27,600
The the Gallup company will refer to them as what they are identifying here is your top

494
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,860
Inherent talents and so they're developable

495
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:40,500
Developable I'm not certain that's the word you can you can train in it the resources that that I mentioned on Gallup

496
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,620
I went there for ideation and they talk about

497
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,420
Okay

498
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,420
How do you know if you're overdoing it?

499
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,100
What to do about it?

500
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:54,260
How do you know if you're underdeveloped in your ideation and what are things to do?

501
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,260
Alan and I we spent a lot of time talking about Johnson on here

502
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:02,460
right Johnson from my point of view is a guy that is

503
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:08,700
Formerly teaching you how ideation works and how to take advantage of it

504
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,700
This is Steven Johnson author of where good ideas come from

505
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,900
Okay, and and the other thing that's fascinating if you go and look at if you go and look at

506
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,460
the Gallup stats

507
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,660
Anyone can can get better in any of these strengths

508
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:28,500
But if if it's high in your natural talent list you developing in this

509
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:35,780
You'll see they claim a ten times productivity boost because you're naturally inclined anyway

510
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,180
They're just formalizing the things that that instinctively you already understand

511
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,470
design patterns fits within

512
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:51,420
analytical and restorative in ideation and up until before I learned design patterns

513
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,340
I kind of designed that way

514
00:39:53,340 --> 00:40:00,220
But I didn't know why and what it was then when I learned that I'm like whoa and suddenly I had a huge boost in

515
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,340
In my coding Alan for me. I totally get why relater is there?

516
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:11,900
I kind of would have expect something more and I'm bringing out my cheat sheet

517
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:16,460
Yeah, was there any influencing strengths on there? Yeah, that's what I was looking at I don't see

518
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:25,300
None. No, it is fascinating that achiever was there both times because it really is just summarizes the story Brent just said right

519
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:31,420
You know if you are if achievers in your top five, so you care about doing a really good job and having a high impact

520
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:37,620
What are you gonna do you are gonna run experiments subconsciously on what skills are?

521
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,340
Working well in your new role, right? You're gonna AB test this right?

522
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,780
You're gonna have control treatment right and then you're gonna try something that works well

523
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,940
And you're gonna say I'm gonna dig deeper on that right and so it's not surprising to me that those with achiever

524
00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:00,460
Will start to develop their strengths to a point where their top five might evolve when their roles change over time

525
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:05,010
Yeah, I was just looking at it at the same the same pivot that

526
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:10,490
Brian was just mentioning in execution you have a ranger

527
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,410
who the way I summarize a ranger is

528
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:21,910
They take joy at getting large numbers of other people to do their job for them

529
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,930
What's interesting with me is that?

530
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,210
Influencing doesn't even show up in my top ten. Oh

531
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,600
Really that is pretty common in tech like I I've had a number of people take it

532
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,860
Generally speaking that the results skew a little bit more towards

533
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,620
Executing and strategic thinking as the top two themes and if I recall correctly

534
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,940
I didn't write it down, but if I recall correctly you have three and influencing Brian

535
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:54,460
Yeah, which is why you know, which is why I did well as a PM, right?

536
00:41:54,460 --> 00:42:00,040
I come into Microsoft as an analyst and then I take this career builder cuz you know

537
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:06,340
L&D offers it and like the bottom thing on the survey is like project manager and I'm like, wait a minute

538
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,100
I got a PM and the project managers like it's a hundred and thirty fourth

539
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:16,180
It's like literally like the last job title they suggest for me, but I'm like, wait a minute

540
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:22,020
Is PM a project manager in this case? And I was like, no, not really like if you could

541
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,240
Design a role where you need to influence without authority, right?

542
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:31,260
Then it is this PM role at Microsoft is why I enjoyed it while I did it

543
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:37,860
Yeah, that's the yeah, that's the the influencing skill the way I describe

544
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:44,120
So Alan the way you can think of it, right is it's almost like with Myers Briggs

545
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,200
Executing if you were if you were to think of executing as

546
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:56,440
Getting tasks done you can think of strategic thinking about getting thoughts done. So it is and the way I

547
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,980
think this works is obviously people that work with me know I I

548
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,840
Have you would say I have influence I'm able to get people to change

549
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,520
But I don't do it through the traditional influencing skills

550
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,760
I'm I'm heavy on strategic

551
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,680
Heavy strategic thinking, you know relations and executing I do it by

552
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,600
Getting I did it to it by getting stuff done

553
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,680
Here's an example. I was talking to a team today about how we're gonna do a migration and

554
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,640
It isn't about going to convince a team like this is how you do it and get them all bought on board and and

555
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,160
And doing the influencing part of that I do it via execution. We're gonna hand hold the team through

556
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,080
Initial migration or get some learning from that

557
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,550
When we're going to

558
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:44,790
From there, we're gonna get some documentation in place

559
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,310
So another team can try and follow that while it will make sure we're there for support

560
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,310
They can get through that once we get enough

561
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:55,830
Automate workflow automation documentation in place where think everybody can do the rest of the migration on their own

562
00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:00,830
We'll let them do that and it'll it'll snowball from there. But we get stuff done and people

563
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:08,430
See it as a good idea, but not because I've gone in and played the role of maximizer or or whoo

564
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,310
I just just not in my wheelhouse

565
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:14,110
I'm gonna do it through getting a good plan together

566
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:19,430
Getting the pieces in place to execute that plan and then making sure we produce results

567
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:26,590
Yeah, one of the things that that you brought up earlier you asked earlier. It's okay. I do this with my whole team

568
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:35,050
How do I how do I leverage this as a manager? Okay, the very first thing is I will say I

569
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:41,730
Now don't do the book you showed I do this one straight this is for the for the listeners

570
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:49,410
Strength finders 2.0 Brent has strengths leadership 2.0, which I probably need to go read

571
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,730
Here's one I suggest which is called. It's the manager

572
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:58,370
Okay, I gotta I gotta go expand my my book list, which is basically

573
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,970
Brent's book with an appendix for all the strengths, but it's also about

574
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,470
The role of a leader transitioning a little bit more to coach

575
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:14,490
They compared to telling us what to do in the past the thing I find it's great about this one

576
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:19,070
And I don't I don't have that other one. I have three more here

577
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,890
I could show but but I don't have that one. I'm like damn it

578
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:30,630
No, the thing that's nice around this one is you can go through and it gives you a clue as a manager

579
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:38,540
How to kind of put yourself in other people's shoes now me as an individualizer I do that fairly well

580
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,740
It's sort of the thinking man's empathy like I understand

581
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:51,540
Well, but if you don't have a clue and you need a clue because what I find is you just just start with five

582
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,540
And then you start having conversations around

583
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,660
How would you solve this problem?

584
00:45:57,890 --> 00:45:59,940
your way

585
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:04,740
Right in the confused because they're like wait a minute. I thought you're supposed to tell me your way

586
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:09,200
No, no, no, I'm not trying to clone myself what I'm trying to do

587
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:16,400
Right. If you are a clone of me then yeah that job to figuring out your way of doing this is gonna be a lot easier

588
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,400
I have a lot of hands-on experience

589
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,440
But it's it's around how do we

590
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:27,570
Because if you if you if you help them learn how to solve the problem their way

591
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,670
They are gonna do it so much better

592
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:36,510
So much differently than you most likely and they're gonna be happier at the same time

593
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:43,980
An old manager of mine used to tell me productive people are happy people and I'm going to tell you that is bullshit

594
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,980
It is happy people are productive people get causality in the correct order

595
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,770
Yeah

596
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:55,490
Yeah, I will say like when I've I've had to learn this as a parent, right?

597
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,210
You know

598
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,530
I have chores for the kids to do and you know

599
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:05,050
Not all the chores are created equal one of them takes 45 minutes and one takes five minutes and the first

600
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:10,370
Dozen times I tried coming up with the system and then I was like wait a minute

601
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:15,770
Do I care about the how here or like I didn't do we need to more be more like Alan like I need to be

602
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:20,350
In a ranger and then be like look this is the list of chores that needs to get done

603
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:27,050
You know what done to find is because I'm in tech and so of course there's requirements that list what a clean bathroom look like but

604
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:32,310
So that my ten-year-old doesn't like, you know do half the job and I said go figure it out

605
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:36,250
I don't care how you break this up and they came up with a solution

606
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,550
I would never have come up with in a million years and it was the following

607
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:44,610
We will do every job every both kids will do every chore

608
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:52,210
They will each just do half of it and I was like that is so brilliant and so simple and I wouldn't like and I was

609
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:56,530
Embarrassed like that how stupid I felt when my nine-year-old and my twelve-year-old

610
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,210
Came up with something in five minutes and I was like well

611
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:04,130
Let's come up with a wait and then you can bid on it and then there's a budget

612
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,650
You know like I'm trying to PM this with story points

613
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,410
They're like no

614
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:10,390
We're just gonna all do both that we're all gonna do both

615
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:15,830
Both of us will do all the chores and we'll just get tell when it's halfway done and then we'll switch and I was like wow

616
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,810
That I just got to get out of the way

617
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:24,830
Like I like I don't have these execution strengths like my some of my kids do so let them run with it

618
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:32,790
Into my to that I'm just gonna comment like seriously what problem can't pair programming solve exactly

619
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:39,630
All right, we are out of time here, but Brian I do want to give you I know you have

620
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:43,430
What do you do in these days anything you want to plug or talk about?

621
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:47,310
Please please take some soapbox time. Sure. So

622
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,430
I'm I now do career coaching for people in tech having been

623
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:58,870
Had something like 11 or 12 different job titles and found what fulfills me has changed over time

624
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,750
I now help people in tech with three use cases

625
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,230
Landing a job in tech getting promoted and career clarity

626
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:10,430
There's a fair number of people that are looking for two or all three of those these days

627
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,990
so if anyone's interested in talking about

628
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:18,790
My approach and how I help others they can just go to refactor coaching calm

629
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,990
All right, I'll put that link in the show notes and

630
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,650
It's basically just a landing page. It's not a lot out there

631
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:31,150
But it is very much a strengths based coaching approach to helping you achieve your career goals

632
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,610
Very cool. Very love it. This has been fun

633
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:39,330
I've never seen so many hearts come out of eyeballs. I have with Brent today, but

634
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:47,130
Super fun. I learned a lot and I'm excited to read some more about this and I have reinvigorated my interest in this stuff

635
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:52,530
I think it's really valuable. All right. Well, that's all we have time for because I have a four o'clock apartment

636
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,810
I'm Alan. I'm Brent
