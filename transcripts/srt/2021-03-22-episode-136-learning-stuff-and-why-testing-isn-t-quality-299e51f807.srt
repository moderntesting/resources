00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AB testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,260
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:20,700
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show so this is the AB testing

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:27,180
podcast how's it going Brent super so excited you should be excited because

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:38,570
this is our 136 episode and Brent types to figure it out because you can't 100 and 30 something

6
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:45,570
through drive is just 39 or 16 so we're here on another Friday afternoon a

7
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,730
beautiful spring is coming sort of time in the Northwest yeah and we're gonna do

8
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,530
a podcast and then we're going to I'm going to edit it and then through the

9
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,570
magic of the internet you will hear this these words being spoken time shifted by

10
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,290
about two and a half days on Monday or later depending on when you listen or

11
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:13,520
it's magical right or earlier if you're part of the secret club oh how does one

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:22,200
get into the secret club Brent it's really hard it's really hard you have to

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,560
magically navigate Google to find the AB testing you don't even need Google you

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,420
can just go to modern testing org oh come on I want them it's a secret club

15
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:41,440
don't work hard for it no that's the work you're being dumb and then they

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,920
have to click the link to join the one of the three slack channel yeah and

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,800
that's it and then you could ask questions there and I always post it

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,480
again a lot of people stay away from slack over the weekend so there's no

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,160
requirement to listen to it early but I always post it on our slack group for

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,080
preview of people that hang out with us the weekend before just or two days

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,720
before when I get it whatever I get done editing actually as soon as I get done

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,750
editing and which is also a good chance for me to get feedback on hey Alan you

23
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,710
accidentally posted audio from a kid's birthday party I said oops wrong video

24
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,870
wrong audio but yeah you get a chance to listen ahead of time if you'd like

25
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,070
doesn't show up in RSS feed just download it of course if you'd rather

26
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,550
just have life be simple you can be in the slack group take part in

27
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,990
conversations and wait until the podcast shows up in your feed on Monday

28
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:37,380
whatever makes your life easier yeah whatever you want that as long as it

29
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,180
also makes our life easier we're super supportive yeah we're pretty easy going

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,380
here for a bunch of old guys or a couple old guys at least two old guys

31
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,460
a couple weeks ago I did a webinar next week I'm doing another webinar nice

32
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:58,290
Thursday night which is gonna be really crappy time for those you in Europe but

33
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,250
for the Americas I think it's like starts at 6 o'clock I'll try and put a

34
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,490
link in it in the show notes but you can look at my both my LinkedIn feed and

35
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:13,050
my Twitter feed and probably find it I'm doing a a webinar on just learning

36
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,500
stuff and I'm putting together a presentation I'm gonna tell you what's

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,580
in it but was really cool the people organizing it at PNSQC said you don't

38
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,700
even have to give a presentation you can just facilitate some conversation

39
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,220
which I love so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna kick it off with a little I'll

40
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,940
kick it off I'll do a little bit of both I'll kick it off with a little bit

41
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,460
of stuff around learning I want to talk about probably largely a little recap of

42
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,300
Steven Johnson because the reason they contacted me one is they know me because

43
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,980
I've spoken at their regular in-person conference a couple times right you're a

44
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,340
favorite of theirs if I don't know if I'm a favorite but you know I'm on the

45
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,220
list they're also curious like we're like how do you find these five for

46
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,020
Friday things what motivates you to learn which is really good question of

47
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:08,460
course five for Friday comes from a brief infatuation I had with what's his

48
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,500
face Tim Ferriss and he does a five bullet Friday thing I thought you know

49
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,300
I'm gonna do something like that for the stuff that I care about but really it

50
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,340
comes back to a book I read that I don't remember the name and I don't know

51
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,180
how it is for you but I recollect what year it was by what product I was

52
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,420
working on at the time so sometime around 2001 2002 I read some book and

53
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,020
in the book it said hey if you want to get new ideas you should probably

54
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,780
read some stuff that's outside of your area because as I learned from Steven

55
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,860
Johnson years and years later ideas come from other ideas oh yeah let me can I

56
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:55,160
good no let me shit up all right no I'm sorry go ahead just like yeah go ahead

57
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:04,120
right I actually use this a great deal so as you and the three know I manage

58
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:13,280
the data science team and as you and the three may not know data science is an

59
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:22,100
extremely broad term right and there are hundreds of specialization somebody who

60
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:29,420
who for example is working on face recognition certainly he or she are gonna

61
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,620
know all about the basics you know what's clustering what's classification

62
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:42,140
etc but in terms of words yeah in terms of specific techniques there's a deep

63
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:50,340
specialization and in that context okay and so even though I have my unfair share

64
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,380
of PhDs reporting to me they do not in fact know everything about that is like

65
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:02,380
so one of the things that I do papers we spent a lot of time on on research

66
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,580
papers you go to Google Scholar use look up stuff and you can see sort of

67
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:14,420
people's prior published ideas okay but in terms of the concept of ideas always

68
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,900
come on the on the old ideas coming together a research paper is exactly

69
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:26,540
that I will call out you go to the references section and the references

70
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,060
section is not only the old ideas that are being brought together but it is a

71
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:38,820
very clean follow-up a bowl enumeration of that list and and so when I when I have

72
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,260
one of my data scientists come to me and and say hey I'm stuck I cannot figure

73
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:51,140
out how to move around this I give them the following exercise okay all I want

74
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,700
you to do is every day I want you to start off and and go to Google Scholar

75
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:03,020
and just do a search for something that you see as you know do a keyword search

76
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:07,020
for something you think is relevant that's it and then I want you to pick

77
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,660
one of those articles there and read it and then next day and don't do anything

78
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,740
with it just read it next day based off of that either do a different keyword

79
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,940
search and and read something or go to the references of that one and pick one

80
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,460
of those to do it yes and I'm gonna add that to my presentation something I've

81
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:36,940
done before but I forgot about is read a in short read a research document but go

82
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:43,580
look where they got their ideas from right and I just basically say do that

83
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,740
do that just reading that algorithm reading one paper a day for 14 days and

84
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:57,660
I promise you you will you will find the answer you're seeking yes and even

85
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:04,030
further than that you won't get the 14 days yes I'm gonna go in that's good

86
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,870
we're gonna get more anecdotes to share I do want to do an AB test here on the

87
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,630
AB testing so I'd technically be at a slash B test on the AB testing podcast could you

88
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:16,390
take your microphone maybe lower it three inches just keep it above nose

89
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:21,630
level but a little bit there try it right there now Brent on a scale of one

90
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:28,590
to ten how much of an idiot do you think I am seven oh what one to ten no four

91
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,510
five okay half an idiot that's that's fair that's so I'm gonna you know I gave

92
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,190
a presentation years ago leveraging Stephen Johnson's material and there's a

93
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,750
slide in there that's probably worth going over in our tangent weave here so

94
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,110
oh back to the presentation it is hard to keep track of all the tangent

95
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:52,470
sometimes isn't it what the bill I don't bother anymore what the book suggested

96
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,870
which was something became a part of my life for about five years and I kind of

97
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,710
lost track and it went away once I had children but it's suggested I subscribed

98
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,110
to this thing called you know just one of the ideas was science news and

99
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,920
science news was a print magazine tiny it was like it arrived every week but

100
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,200
it was maybe 12 pages and I could read through the whole thing and not

101
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,060
understand most of it but for some reason just like looking at these

102
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,140
research ideas you're for you're looking at something different every day it

103
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,740
planted seeds that made me think about some things differently and it may not

104
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,460
say oh I'm gonna apply this thing from science to this thing I was doing in

105
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,940
testing it was more of oh here's another way to think about stuff and I

106
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,140
would just maybe even subconsciously think about not applauding the thing from

107
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,500
science news but oh here's when it is experiment they thought about this thing

108
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
in two different ways can I think about this particular problem in two different

109
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,010
ways but a lot of really subtle things so definitely suggestion there I don't

110
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,570
know if they make the magazine anymore it might have gone from weekly to every

111
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,530
other week and a little thicker but at some point I stopped subscribing but

112
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,170
just fascinating I felt really smart after I read it and I've been

113
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,490
progressively dumber ever since so as part of that presentation I looked for

114
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:14,330
some titles of some of the best conference talks that were happening on

115
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:17,810
the test circle for various reasons I go over in a minute I want to share some of

116
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,130
these with you and gonna get your thoughts the art and science of load

117
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,090
testing internet applications that's applicable to developers as well as

118
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:30,250
testers model-based testing for data centric products also interesting could

119
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:35,700
be applicable managing user exceptions tests and large projects it's that could

120
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,980
be again it's a little businessy title but in the when we care about like we're

121
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,220
trying to outcome based testing those user acceptance tests can be important yes

122
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,060
architectures of test automation I'm much more comfortable having a

123
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,940
development team own that but I like to hear the ideas there habits of highly

124
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,020
effective testers very generic one but you know good so what do you think

125
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,580
about those talks I just described I don't like the last two the last two

126
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:09,900
kind of feel you know 1996 ish to me but the other one actually you're very close

127
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,580
because these are all titles from conferences given in 1999 and 2000 mmm

128
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:21,100
yeah so the point is could we please have some new ideas I'll take new ideas

129
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:28,980
and test for $500 Alex what is blank the problem one problem in the industry

130
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,140
and something we've talked about before directly and indirectly I'll just gloss

131
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,580
over is that a lot of people get their information on how to improve whatever

132
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,660
craft or knowledge work they're doing from one or two places or one or two

133
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:48,500
places or people that is not a way to get new ideas you regurgitating for

134
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,140
example I was reading and I'll name drop Michael Bolton here I was reading an

135
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,740
article he wrote on LinkedIn and someone tagged me in it and for good

136
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,060
reasons someone who is not not trying to stir anything up they had actually a

137
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,300
reason for tagging me in and since I was there I asked about this concept of

138
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,260
someone else mentioned oh I found that critical distances blah blah blah and so

139
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:15,060
I spent a bunch of time searching on what critical distance was and I asked

140
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:19,540
the person not very much to find Bolton later told me later later to look for a

141
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,860
different term called psychological distance or something but a little bit

142
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,660
better but I'm glad again they've done a lot of thinking on this stuff and they

143
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,900
get it I think this particular thing is in a little bit in a vacuum because yeah

144
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,980
if it is one person doing all of the work some of those things do exist but we

145
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,980
work collaboratively but the main thing was the main disappointment was this

146
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,620
person had no idea what the term they were using meant they just regurgitated

147
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,100
they did no like my reaction is to go figure out okay I want to see why I

148
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,180
have some cognitive dissonance with this term because I can't I want to know

149
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,300
more about it so I can understand where to apply it so I did the research try

150
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,020
and figure it out and it turns out that the person making the argument this was

151
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,180
the reason in this case why developers can't test they're using a term that

152
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,220
they had heard but never researched and to me I find that again for a

153
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,900
knowledge worker I find it some word I can't I don't remember the English word

154
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:28,570
for it bullshit stupid I mean idiotic I mean I mean you're old but I mean I came

155
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:36,040
up with three right there yeah whatever but I mean if you if you want to be good

156
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,750
at anything in knowledge work I don't care if it's testing specialty or software

157
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:49,470
development or data science or Jesus architecture anything that requires the

158
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,110
creative mind and the balance of adaptive learning work that I mean the

159
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,430
definition of knowledge work is that you are often learning as you go along you

160
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:03,830
have to take the learning part seriously so I could go I could for the

161
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:08,630
rest of this podcast talk about the different methods of where new ideas

162
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:15,670
come from Stephen Johnson and I won't know I won't but you have to seek out

163
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,030
places to expand your repertoire of ideas it can't be from one or two places

164
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,070
it can't be from 10 or 12 it needs to be from dozens or hundreds and you have to

165
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,910
be hungry to define those things I'm it's frustrating to me to see people

166
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:34,990
who their thoughts on tests are based purely on what they've seen one or two

167
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:40,110
or three people say about testing I don't get how you can I don't get it I'm

168
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:44,590
up on a soapbox I'd not intend to go on but the point that I want to go over in

169
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:51,390
this talk is you have to find ways to get new ideas into your head especially

170
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,430
in the last 12 months where you can't go meet with other people the the

171
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,630
Enlightenment and one thing from maybe Stephen Johnson's book is the idea of

172
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:04,970
coffee shops and getting people together finding a meeting place a community for

173
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:11,410
people to exchange ideas that helps innovation and ideas thrive the one line

174
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,060
from the book is chance favors the connected mind yes like being in the

175
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,620
right place at the right time to figure out how stuff works he talks about the

176
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,220
adjacent possible which is taking something that's and just and just

177
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:26,940
making that one little extra step to make to figure out that peanut butter and

178
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,480
chocolate go pretty good together but you have to constantly seek out ideas

179
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,640
and you have to not be afraid to do new stuff maybe this ties into a chapter for

180
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,640
a book I wrote that I I'm really proud of and I don't have a pulled up here to

181
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,840
read from but there's this e-book put together called around the world around

182
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,520
the testing world in 80 days or something where I was given free reign

183
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,480
to write about anything I wanted and I'm gonna tell a story which is a

184
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,520
paraphrase of my article it starts off with me saying oh hey I'll take that

185
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,730
on and it was me approaching a conversation back when I worked on that

186
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:09,010
stupid science project and I was bored and I happened to walk by on a

187
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,250
conversation of someone wanting to set up a bunch of static analysis tools and

188
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,490
sonar cube and some other tools for our product which built on Linux I joined

189
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,810
that team so I could get my Linux skills and my Java skills up to stuff

190
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:28,760
it was very early in the product I had no idea how to do the thing that I

191
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,800
just said I would love to take on because for me if I'm not in a position

192
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,600
where I have to learn in order to be successful I'm kind of bored and not

193
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,440
happy yeah and that's actually one thing that you and I have in common is going

194
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,270
back to the orders of ignorance we're pretty confident in our ability to

195
00:16:54,270 --> 00:17:01,810
construct a means by which the one thing that I'm totally mind-blinking on right

196
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,290
the fourth order that doesn't exist any means by which you don't have a suitable

197
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,810
means to discover what you don't know you don't know right you and I both have

198
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,610
a process by which we go well I'll say like for me I just go most of the time

199
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:24,450
it's like it's just code it's not magic I'll figure it out it's really not that

200
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:30,280
hard but I do know that a large number of people and I think some of our

201
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:38,710
listeners don't don't sort of have that same sort of sense the so I've always

202
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:44,510
been attracted it up until the team I'm on right now like you one thing you and

203
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,990
I had in common is we get bored and change teams for me I got more

204
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:56,590
interested in looking for and whenever it was on the team hunt is go okay what

205
00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,030
is the team that I think would most be able to leverage my strengths but at the

206
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:07,640
same time is working in the space I know little to nothing about right and if I

207
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,520
can go and find that the people culture there is great then I'm in done it's

208
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,720
over yeah but we could add another topic I want to get to but I want to stay

209
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,120
here a little bit because yes this is absolutely true and what I've sort of

210
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,720
inadvertently done as I've grown into managing a larger team which we've

211
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,000
talked about before drink is I've developed a little bit of a pattern and

212
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,280
reputation for taking on taking a hard problem on figuring out the details on

213
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,840
my own and then delegating it away to part of my team to continue to maintain

214
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,760
and grow it helps me learn a lot and then it gives me opportunities to give

215
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,080
people things to do you know when I joined my current org it was program

216
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,360
management and again I said the same thing my the by hiring manager who did

217
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,400
not have an engineering role for me to go into said hey can you do program

218
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:02,820
management because you wanted to have me on his team I said sure and I had

219
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,620
never done that before and and again to remind you Brent program management in

220
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,240
the rest of the world is much different than the hybrid thing at

221
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,500
Microsoft it's it's reducing complexity and understanding and what it turned out

222
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,110
to me in the end once I figured it out really what my role ended up being was

223
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:23,670
running the what he calls the what we both called the engineering system

224
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,350
engineering operating system that's just like running an engineering team

225
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:33,270
it's the same thing I did for what I was the senior or quality architect or

226
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,910
some high-level senior tester reporting to test directors way back in the day

227
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,750
so and because it involves coaching teams on agile practices and coaching

228
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,730
teams on quality that was great but anyway I did that I was not intend to

229
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:50,390
talk about what I did but really I took that on figured it out and now delegated

230
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,110
as someone better than me running that portion of the org which is good because

231
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,430
our projects are getting more complex in some cases same thing with quality I

232
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:02,930
have a super great quality leader on my team who I've I don't have to of

233
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:08,830
course I'm involved and I'm curious and I'm I try and remain a highly

234
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,630
opinionated about quality but really my whole org is quality but I have a part of

235
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,550
my org who are dedicated to quality coaching and someone very capable

236
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,270
they're all delegated away most recently as I believe we discussed I've

237
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:26,910
been diving deeply into cutting our again don't know how to do it sure I'll

238
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:31,710
figure it out but figuring out what we can do to cut our spend on cloud hosting

239
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,430
I learned a lot of things got it all figured out made a lot of dashboards

240
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:40,170
I'm delegating that work away I'll take on something new when we talk about

241
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:46,330
knowledge work I've found that people again I'd have to be just like me I'm

242
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:52,930
like you and I we're happy we're most happy when people can keep on giving us

243
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,950
more and more things we haven't done before I'm most happy when I get to be in

244
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:04,290
over my head at work and I see folks who pride themselves on the craft of

245
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:09,730
blah but they just want to do the same thing over and over and it just baffles

246
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:18,410
me I mean everyone at some point in time is you got pink's principles memorized

247
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,410
better than I do but mash mastery is important but it's like you and I we're

248
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,810
sort of mastering the meta like we're more we're more interested in mastering

249
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:33,330
the I don't know the journey versus any specific destination but other people

250
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:39,730
are wired differently but mastery comes from not being able to do it but being

251
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:44,290
able to have the right resources to be able to do it the first time this

252
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,170
happened to me I thought I was gonna get fired I was three years into

253
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:51,930
Microsoft remember I'm a self-taught programmer but I figure stuff out well

254
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,950
enough people gave me more credit than I was worth and I was maybe I've told

255
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,230
you this story I was paired with one of the original Microsoft OS guys to work

256
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:06,270
on the debug version of Windows because it had been neglected for a while and to

257
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,550
get it running from the Win9x platform and debugger development and I thought

258
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,030
great I'm gonna learn a lot from this guy hopefully he doesn't call it how

259
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,630
stupid I am but then he retired like a week in they said it's okay Alan you

260
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:24,870
could own it by yourself so I am scared to death but I got a book on assembly

261
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,150
language because I had to learn assembly language in order to do this because the

262
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:32,350
kernel and the debugger are largely an assembly and I slowly poked my way

263
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,290
through the same way you would you make a bug fix here a bug fix there you

264
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:41,530
tweak another thing and and eventually it was almost like I knew what I was doing

265
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,990
I knew enough what I was doing people assumed I knew what I was doing and I

266
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,290
went from I'm gonna get fired to you know what I love figuring stuff out

267
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,470
that's really hard it's what motivates me and since then I seek that out I

268
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,430
seek that steep learning curve and it sounds too much like I'm bragging but I

269
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,950
guess the point is a lot of in addition to being a white male a lot of my success

270
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:10,350
comes from just chance favoring the connected mind being available to try new

271
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:18,090
things out being just being open to new ideas and accepted them yeah well you

272
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:25,130
and I've talked about it before right in in knowledge work is essentially ideal

273
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:35,750
work and so for me to sort of lock into this is the best idea ever like and I

274
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,710
think you agree with me but I'll just ask what's what's your thought on the

275
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:51,540
term best practice I'm pausing because it's a loaded term on one hand taken

276
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,040
semantically correct as written it's stupid because there is no it's all

277
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:01,460
contextual there's no best practice generally not always but generally when

278
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,460
people use best practice they're not looking for that but not it's it's

279
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:10,760
similar to using literally to say Brent I'm literally on fire right now I'm not

280
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,400
so for best practice it depends on the for a phrase it depends on context it

281
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,120
depends on the context of how it's being used if by best practice do you mean the

282
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,140
thing I absolutely have to do all the time then I don't like it if I best

283
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,080
practice do you mean a thing that generally works most of the time which

284
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,040
is the typical use of that then I don't mind it what was the answer you

285
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:41,330
were fishing for the term by itself without a context is in my view just

286
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:47,790
blatantly offensive the point is it's not used that way in general and you know

287
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:54,870
you're right the well I don't know like the places where I seen it used is in

288
00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:03,710
terms of weaponizing an idea during a negotiation hey this is known to be a

289
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:09,650
best practice for the last 10 years of course I would then argue if this is a

290
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,390
best practice for the last 10 years you're wasting my time yeah it would be

291
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:18,650
easier if we got rid of the term because it yeah it can be abused so I'm not sure

292
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,910
where you're going with that you asked me a question about it but what was the

293
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:28,310
intent behind of that question it was essentially in terms of knowledge work

294
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:36,290
and idea work yeah there is a best known way to move forward today however

295
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,570
knowledge work will continue we will continue to learn new things in this

296
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,930
sort of stay locked into sort of a mindset that the things that I've

297
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:55,050
learned for the last 20 years and I have now mastered this in our space I think is

298
00:25:55,050 --> 00:26:04,810
at best mistaken idea at worst just abject foolish hey I want to change the

299
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:09,290
subject slightly slightly and get your this is something we've talked about

300
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,330
before but I want to frame it a little bit differently so I could almost ask you

301
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,330
a similar question back but I thought I haven't thought about how to put this

302
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:23,730
but I'll put it like this inevitably you know I've written these articles highly

303
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:28,290
opinionated somewhat controversial there is there are a few people who've come

304
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,650
back on both articles and say oh you do you wrote testing but you meant checking

305
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:39,640
which I think is a big load of crap what but whatever you do you but I do see

306
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:46,120
from even those folks and a few others there is among the internet a high like

307
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,870
you and I have both said I'll put it this way the readers are all going Alan

308
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:57,720
get to the point and the point is a lot of testers focus on testing as

309
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:03,480
almost as the end all of what they're doing and you and I have both stated we

310
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,120
don't really care about testing we care about quality yeah our goal is

311
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,120
different it's weather is for and this is I think the crux of it I don't know

312
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,820
where your question is but the crux of it when you say the word testing do you

313
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,660
view it as the ends or the means well you know the answer it's definitely the

314
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,220
means well for you and me it's definitely the means but it's not for a

315
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,960
large portion like is that what what what led people to believe that customers

316
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,440
care about testing because they don't heads up customers don't give one little

317
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,640
bit of their red freckle on their nose about how many tests you run and how

318
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,760
many which tests you ran on this build they don't they don't and matter of fact

319
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,880
the only places where I've ever seen testing by a customer being communicated

320
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,360
it was an expression of lack of quality hey Apple didn't test their shit right

321
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:09,160
it's just the only useful term from a customer in terms of testing turns out in

322
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,200
my mind and this is a hypothesis of generating on the fly is to scapegoat

323
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:21,310
right it's the same shit Deb does no longer have the conversations I'm out of

324
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,470
now at a point I'm like oh my god if I haven't heard it in years but when people

325
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,670
come to me well why wasn't this tested before I'm like is that hypothetical like

326
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:35,750
are you just asking yourself this out loud like what is actually the answer to

327
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:39,430
that question and what are you gonna do to fix it let me interrupt you I'm gonna

328
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:44,070
weave you through some thoughts I've had about this and get your thoughts on how

329
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:49,950
they relate to this topic where we can go back to Weinberg who says

330
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:55,550
quality is value to some person quality doesn't say about testing so what value

331
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:59,430
it brings we've had discussions about that if 10,000 people are using a thing

332
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,950
that has 20 known bugs and only five people are using a thing that has no

333
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:07,630
known bugs which one has higher quality it's the one with more people right you

334
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:11,510
know a long time ago did you ever read quality is free the Philip Crosby book

335
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:18,660
no it's about manufacturing and and and people read it and poopoo it and

336
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:23,180
there are some it's about prevention which you and I both would actually

337
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,580
prefer fast detection over prevention because it's more efficient and we like

338
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,620
to be efficient go INTPs by the way we were gonna talk about personality types

339
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,580
this time we're gonna do it next time instead because we've already used all

340
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,420
this time on this topic I don't want to end it so another thing he said that

341
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,820
I've been thinking about recently I want to plant this on you is this is

342
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,500
a book where he says quality is conformance to requirements I have a

343
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,980
twist on that but first I want to know I'm sure you've heard that definition

344
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,060
before but what do you think about that definition of quality of conformance to

345
00:29:53,060 --> 00:30:04,530
requirements I'll do it this way I'm okay with it under the condition that those

346
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:11,720
requirements don't necessarily have to be communicated my statement is what

347
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,280
every customer wants is actually a solution to their problem yes and that

348
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,360
that's the twist I just got I read that and it didn't it didn't sit well with me

349
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,600
when I read it 15 years ago but it's principle number five I would say

350
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,960
quality is conformance to requirements when the customer defines the

351
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,840
requirements their requirements are defined implicitly yes explicitly yeah

352
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,240
now now you and I are in the same page I mean the problem is this is the

353
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,120
problem with this podcast is eventually we're always on the same page because

354
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:53,280
we yeah reasons yeah exactly it's conformist to the requirements sure but

355
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,880
it's a requirements around what the customer needs not necessarily what they

356
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:03,650
are asking for that's it now would I ever if I were writing a book would I

357
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,810
ever use that statement no because I know there's a lot of people that will

358
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:13,730
take that literally and then go off and do the wrong thing so let me build

359
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:19,050
on my last statement make a statement made by me not by anybody else so based on

360
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:23,930
the Weinberg definition that quality is value to some person that that would be

361
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:30,730
a customer and then my modified Crosby definition that quality is conformance

362
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,970
to the requirements as defined implicitly by the customer I would make

363
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,340
this statement and I want your reaction on it if you don't know who your

364
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,640
customer is and what problem you're solving for them you cannot define what

365
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,200
quality is you don't know what quality is yeah but isn't aren't you just

366
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,880
restating principle 5 I am in a different way okay so it made me think

367
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,280
that this when we talk about quality and testing not being the same thing and

368
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,360
people will say oh of course they aren't but then they talk about how they

369
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,880
improve quality all they talk about is the testing they do and principle 5 says

370
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,040
that we can't do that we need the customer we can't build a quality

371
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,850
product without a customer even if it was quality we won't know it's like it's

372
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,090
like the tree that fell on the forest we can't measure it right right I've been

373
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:25,130
thinking through since you brought it up earlier the the checking versus testing

374
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:31,960
argument there's no argument system yeah no no I get it hold hold back hold

375
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:39,200
back the soapbox ramp for a moment and they hold it off and in and honestly part

376
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,440
of me wants to go and say okay guys let's sit down let's have an objective and

377
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:53,480
real conversation in today's world what is the value of testing that you are

378
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,200
holding up and then trying to drive and improve a specialization and

379
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,800
craftsmanship around because to me from where I sit honestly Alan I kind of think

380
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:15,760
of testing as a specialization very similar to blacksmithing right it's in a

381
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,400
back in a certain time in a certain context it was extremely valuable it

382
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,040
still exists today and if if I had a choice between let's say a pocket knife

383
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:34,140
built by a master craftsman and and one built by a factory in China that were

384
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:38,980
the same price tag obviously I'm gonna pick the master craftsman yes those but

385
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:48,980
if if what I need is something that's going to last my expected a lifetime use

386
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,900
of it I'm probably gonna go towards the the cheaper option which is gonna be

387
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,980
the factory in me and you know what so it's the majority of right it may be

388
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,620
easier just to buy a new one every six months or cheaper right right so I want to

389
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,820
keep on going I know we're getting to our last 10 or 15 minutes here so there

390
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,620
are more pieces to this and this is why again going back to our first topic is

391
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,990
maybe I'll repeat another statement when I read my first book on test software

392
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:25,630
testing I thought I knew a lot then I read another book and I thought now I

393
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:30,820
know a lot then I read a third book and I got confused and realized how little I

394
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,380
knew and the more I've read about software engineering software quality

395
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,500
software testing I realized how much there is I don't know and how much I

396
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,540
need to learn there's is that done in Kruger effect right I knew a little

397
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,580
bit enough to think I knew a lot and then as I knew more I realized I

398
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:49,690
didn't know anything it could be something different yep there's some

399
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,290
other things that feed into this so the question the context of this is so if

400
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:56,970
quality is value to some person or performance requirements and testing does

401
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:04,530
not equal quality how do we build a quality product and then one other flavor

402
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:10,290
is it's been 15 years now since Ed Keys gave that keynote at a Google test

403
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,890
automation conference where he said sufficiently advanced monitoring is

404
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,740
equivalent to testing so there's something in there too and I would say

405
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:25,250
monitoring is testing well I'll I mean I feel safer with what Ed said okay

406
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,930
fair right so because there's with there's a lot of crap monitors out

407
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:37,460
there so if testing is not quality what do you need to do to build a quality

408
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,050
product I can't just write code then test it then ship it you told me Alan

409
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:46,360
that's not quality so what are the steps to build a quality product are

410
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,040
we redoing episode 83 all of a sudden there whatever it was principle 5 like

411
00:35:52,040 --> 00:36:01,560
the you we do principle 5 is prevalent in this theme but right so then no it's

412
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,520
coming together in a different way it's a experiment there's two things you have

413
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,240
to know to determine if you have a quality product number one what the

414
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,600
hell problem it actually solves right there's a hypothesis hypothesized

415
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,640
problem but it's a lot of the times the problem it actually solves is actually

416
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,600
not the one that you intended right and that that goes to your early example

417
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,360
from Stephen Johnson I actually think of his air conditioner story what

418
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,820
problem does it solve then once you're firm on what problem it solves to what

419
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:50,660
degree it actually does so you have to have a you have to have a technique to

420
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,020
evaluate quality you have to have some sort of technique where you are

421
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:00,740
continuously evaluating those two spaces simultaneously and you cannot do that

422
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:09,730
without here I'll use double quote customer data I'll call it that right

423
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:15,450
and here I because I don't want to get into the the semantic quagmire around

424
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,290
the term customer but I think the majority of our listeners probably

425
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,530
understand where I'm coming from well our listeners do and sometimes are

426
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:25,290
preaching to the choir but it's good to think about I like to think about it

427
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,580
this way because I this massive I've noticed because I'm getting you know I

428
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,220
get lots of Twitter DMS and LinkedIn messages and comments on my post because

429
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:41,380
I've been talking about things that make people feel uncomfortable but the

430
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:47,100
point is for everyone who thinks I'm a quack and who I've made feel uncomfortable

431
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:52,180
there are at least as many people that that think well again I'm not

432
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,780
describing this new panacea we're describing what we're seeing if you

433
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,420
disagree with it you disagreeing what's happening in reality so the

434
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:07,420
feedback I've gotten is more I would classify it more sort of name-calling hey

435
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,780
you're disrespecting the discipline that you grew up in and honestly I don't know

436
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,860
I don't I don't have a whole lot of empathy for that and I don't care about

437
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,540
the feedback right I'm trying to figure out how to I don't say educate but I

438
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:28,140
want to justify what we're seeing and put it into perspective so let's do

439
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,060
a quick thought if we have five minutes left just do a quick experiment I have

440
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,100
some fingernail clippers you can't see him friend can see him barely again yeah

441
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:41,780
on my desk I'm uses inspiration I am I have a customer hypothesis a problem

442
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,050
statement I don't believe I don't believe people in a across around the

443
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:52,770
world are able to to solve their nail clipping problems efficiently enough I am

444
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:57,490
going to launch fingernail clippers calm it's gonna be great I have a

445
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:02,010
great designer and time goes by and we have the site as we've tested

446
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,890
extensively the shopping cart and and orders and shipping it's all set it's

447
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:13,530
good to go we've done a hard launch with lots of marketing big marketing

448
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,850
budget we want to be the premier place to get fingernail clippers on the

449
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,410
internet we tested the crap out of it so on one hand I'm thinking it's high

450
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,810
quality because we can't find any bugs we ran a hundred thousand tests and our

451
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:35,410
my little website is live and then very little happens we're not getting orders

452
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:42,820
or getting very few orders what happened obviously ours is our site is failing

453
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:47,020
you could say it has quality issues because it's not providing value to any

454
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:51,460
people or very very few people what did we do wrong how do I fix it how do I

455
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:56,860
do who Brent I've hired you to help me get out of my quag Mars reminds me like

456
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,180
Elizabeth Hendrickson talks a lot about she was hired to fix quality problems

457
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,100
and they were never with the test team so anyway help me fix it what do I do

458
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:14,700
it did this one this one is I would take the role that I know venture

459
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,140
capitalists do and I would just simply say okay Alan who did your market

460
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,820
analysis like what made you believe this was a problem that needed to be

461
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:30,700
solved and if you came back and said you know one day I had inspiration and I was

462
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:38,020
staring at my shiny black nail clippers on my desk and and I moved mountains to

463
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:44,140
make this website happen then the solution is easy is okay who's your

464
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:48,100
target customer all right so go on let's say I did market analysis and I

465
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,540
assumed I had a million customers any one time across the US just pretend so then

466
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:57,940
where do you go so you look at that you basically look at that data and it's

467
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:03,580
rock-solid and you're thinking wow well you should be doing better now what do

468
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,570
we do wrong did we not test it well enough no testing has nothing to do with

469
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:15,010
this one so I'm leading the witness right no no it's like the solution

470
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:22,500
therein is the problem here is why did you ship it right given that the data that

471
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:27,020
you mentioned why did you invest in it why did you ship it right it's a clear

472
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:33,060
thing that you showing it is that it is it is not providing an interesting enough

473
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:41,300
solution to a problem humans have and the fix would be Alan to send you out to

474
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:47,460
physically talk to not your marketing team you to talk to the customers and

475
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:53,820
find out why and you didn't want I mean you're exactly right I was leading you a

476
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,740
little bit deeper into it you absolutely need to make sure you're solving a

477
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:03,060
relevant problem you're really trying to do your hypothesizing you're developing a

478
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,460
hypothesis to determine if you're actually going to provide value for some

479
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:14,000
person you could because tests of omission might occur so what often we do

480
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,280
as you know may have been a while since work on a commerce site but there's the

481
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,440
whole acquisition funnel people have to know about the site they have to come

482
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,840
to this site they have to put stuff into their cart then they have to check

483
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,120
out I'm just making this up on the fly so it's not great but if you're

484
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:33,040
actually so there's do you have an audience and maybe we're getting 10,000

485
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,640
visitors a day and that seems obvious like you know well then why aren't we

486
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,960
getting more sales we can go one more step down the acquisition funnel and I

487
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,640
think you'd be better suited than writing a whole big automated test suite

488
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,920
of course you want to test the happy path to make sure people can put stuff

489
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,720
in their cart and enter credit carding and get it checked out and get added to

490
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,840
a shipping queue but monitoring it every stage of your of your funnel every

491
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,520
decision point they can make from this is where you can do your experiments

492
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,080
and your A.B. testing and your monitoring sorry experiments and A.B.

493
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,560
testing are the same thing but you want to look at every decision point from when

494
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,560
they enter the site to where do they find because they have to go through a

495
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,800
half a dozen decisions or more until they check out and they put money in your

496
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:21,160
in your bank account to see where they may be failing where they may be

497
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:27,040
falling off maybe anyone with a maybe you have a bad regex weirdness and

498
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,800
anybody with a two digit two digits for the first part of their IP address can't

499
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,600
check out or something stupid like that you maybe you discover that there but

500
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,760
there could be all kinds of things that go wrong where monitoring is and focusing

501
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,000
on customer value and that acquisition funnel is the right thing to do user

502
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:50,560
journey funnels I like that name I like that name of user journey funnel

503
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:58,360
is that a real thing can I look that up it user journey user funnels there I've

504
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:02,520
heard user journey and I call it the acquisition funnel but a user funnel or

505
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,960
journey funnels so there's there there's acquisition funnels there's there are

506
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,760
retention funnels or their churn churn they call funnels but they're really

507
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,960
anti funnels because you're trying to prevent people getting to the bottom of

508
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:22,200
those funnels I thought at the bottom they check out and make money not with a

509
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:28,040
churn funnel a churn funnel right it depends on yeah okay fine whatever or

510
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:34,040
for example support a support thing you would you would look at sort of key

511
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,440
sequences and you're trying to get them to not go to the next level right it's

512
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,760
I frame it normally as an anti funnel because I think it's clear but yeah if

513
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,120
the top of your funnel is has a higher rate and let's say you know your

514
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,080
favorite host of deities were the ones responsible for the testing like their

515
00:44:54,080 --> 00:45:00,960
codes bug-free then you you still have you have something worse you have you

516
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:06,760
have a problem solution mismatch some place in your system that you need to go

517
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,360
fine I think the meta point before we close on this is you have to go and

518
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,200
go back to what you said earlier focus on the problem you're solving for the

519
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,960
customer and then determine what you need to do in order to know if you're

520
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,500
solving that problem correctly right right testing again I'm not saying don't

521
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,860
do testing testing is great for regressions mitigating risks there's

522
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,780
lots of reasons for it please please please please please don't think of it

523
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:39,900
as the end goal of your quality efforts it actually just agreed and sorry I'm

524
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,660
gonna go back to one last thing I just thought of it a perfect example for your

525
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,540
scenario where you could have a situation bug-free and a high attraction

526
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:52,540
rate okay when you sign up people for a trial ask them for a credit card number

527
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,910
right that just pisses people off asking them for a credit card number for a

528
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,950
free trial oh I could do fingernail subscriptions fingernail clipper

529
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,550
subscriptions yeah I get the credit card yeah no I know but this is again

530
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:11,030
why you will get much higher quality if you get to that culture of experimentation

531
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,350
and hypothesis around what you're delivering to see if it's providing if

532
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:19,110
it's solving the problem you intended to solve the fact that you ran 10,000

533
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,990
testament mean you well there was the Eric Ries quote if you show me a product

534
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,860
that's bug-free I'll show you a product that shipped three months too late yeah

535
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:33,180
I don't know if it's three months but it certainly should play so yeah that

536
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,380
all comes into play there too so I want to bring all that together into that

537
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:43,020
conversation we are out of time but this was fun yeah we will come back in a

538
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,220
couple weeks and talk about personality types a little bit more but that'll be

539
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:52,470
fun and was there anything else I was gonna say see ya okay then see ya

540
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:57,380
Brent says see ya bye bye everybody
