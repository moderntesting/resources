1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
for any testers listening. People who are change agents are always going to have a job,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,760
right? But they might just have to be open to what they do exactly.

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,460
Welcome to A.B. Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,540
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,940
agile, and anything else that comes to mind. Now, on with the show.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,960
Hey, everybody. Howdy.

7
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
Guess what? It's not just me and Brent again. Someone came with us.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,860
It's me. Hey, me. Welcome to the podcast.

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:48,930
At least I pre-warned my guests. Oh, my God.

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,770
Oh, that I'm obnoxious? Is that what you're pre-warned about?

11
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,570
What are you pre-warned? I don't even want to know what's going on here.

12
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,250
Yeah, that's all right. Go for it.

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,690
I can tell you what's really funny is because I've realized that I

14
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,930
start every podcast saying, Hey, everyone. And then, like, we're coming back from break

15
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,450
and I have a meeting with my whole team. I go, Hey, everyone. And there are a few of the three

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,130
in my org. And they go, that sounds familiar. I go, I got to change my opening line.

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:30,370
Oh, Joe, amazing me. I just got through half of the introduction to your latest webinar,

18
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:38,450
which I'm sure we'll plug shortly. Oh, yeah. And the host said literally exactly the same thing.

19
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:45,570
Yeah, Joel, you know, he just said he says, Alan, say hi. And then awkward silence.

20
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,690
And then he says again, Alan, say hi. And then Alan comes in and goes, Oh, hello, everyone.

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,120
And then Joel goes off and says, that sounds awfully like your podcast.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,320
This happens a lot. So you actually observed my postmodern talk.

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,400
I am 30 seconds into it.

24
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:16,240
Okay. So let me, this is segueable into why we have this mystery man, Henry, on our podcast.

25
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,960
And Henry, I'll let Henry introduce, Henry, Henry, you're new. Hey, just like Burton,

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,800
Henry in the talk. So postmodern, of course, there's no modern testing isn't modern. It's

27
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,240
not about testing. So there's no comparison to be made between modern and postmodern testing,

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,280
as there is with modern and postmodern art. It's not a rejection of the principles that

29
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,880
took us to modern art to become something even more different for human entertainment.

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,240
Modern testing, of course, was simply our reaction or our way to describe the thing that

31
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,920
wasn't the traditional testing, the air quote, traditional, the test last, big test teams,

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,960
testing quality in testers, owning all of the testing, that kind of stuff.

33
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,320
In this talk, I wanted to talk about like the fact that Brent and I did not invent modern

34
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,000
testing. We just talked about things we were seeing that were already going on.

35
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,520
And what's happened in the years since we began talk about modern testing. So,

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,600
you know, I remember, I don't remember exactly the date, but many, many years ago,

37
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:29,970
I started talking about the roles that I had had on quality coach. And it was sort of a, you know,

38
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:36,290
almost a placeholder role of like, what do I call it when I'm helping a team or somebody on my team

39
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,090
is helping a team do better testing, but doing very little to no testing themselves. And what's

40
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,690
kind of blown me away is this rise of the quality coach and all of the people who have

41
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:51,010
quality coach in their profiles on LinkedIn and Twitter and all the people, you know,

42
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:55,570
doing quality coaching, you know, Ann Marie Chard has a blog about it, Kim Engel, both which

43
00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:00,370
probably have on the show someday. But we put out a call a couple episodes ago. Hey,

44
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,930
if you're a quality coach, you should come be on the, because I don't do it anymore. And

45
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,290
Brent's never done it. Come beyond the podcast and tell us more about what quality coaches do

46
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:17,410
and can do. And Henry picked up the phone, literally a landline he's had since 1943

47
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,450
and plugged it into the wall. No, he, he pinged me on Slack, like a, like a human being real,

48
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,330
real, you know, for the 21st century, people don't make phone calls anymore.

49
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,530
But anyway, uh, Henry's going to talk about with us about quality coaching today, including a talk

50
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:36,370
he's given recently on project he's done at Microsoft. And, uh, I'm just going to shut up

51
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,370
and let Henry introduce himself, give a little context and talk a little bit about test. I don't

52
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,410
know, Henry talk for a while. I will. Thanks. First off, welcome, Henry. Welcome. I'm happy to

53
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,170
have you here. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. So, um, so my name is Henry Golding and, uh,

54
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,730
I did indeed answer that call, although I don't call myself a quality coach, but I think what I

55
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:07,790
do aligns with what you were talking about. I know this is, I know there are no tangents on this show,

56
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:13,470
so I'll try and keep it on topic. Um, but, uh, so yeah, I consider myself a developer.

57
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,590
I've never considered myself a tester, although I do listen to your podcast. Um, and, uh, I, I,

58
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,550
I'm a game developer, a game play developer specifically. I started out, um, and I was

59
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,630
working at a company, um, and it was clear that that company was about to go bankrupt

60
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:36,830
and I needed a new job quite fast. And I thought, well, here's this Estet thing that I haven't heard

61
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:42,910
of. Um, that's a six month contract at rare, which is a Microsoft subsidiary game studio in the UK.

62
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,710
So I thought, well, how bad could that be? I'll do that for six months. Um, and so I did it and

63
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:55,790
I found that it was actually, um, quite for me, quite a nice combination of, um, helping an audience

64
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,750
that I care about, ie developers, uh, do better at the work they were doing. Um, and I ended up doing

65
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:08,340
it for quite a while. Um, and I can, I can talk more about, um, the journey that we went on there,

66
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,460
which is kind of interesting cause we, you know, we went from, like, I was hired to

67
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:18,980
integrate a like over the network automation driver system and write tests in C sharp for things.

68
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,700
Um, and I fairly quickly decided that that was like a dumb thing to do. Um,

69
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:32,480
and was trying to, well, I fairly quickly decided it was a dumb thing to do to write tests for other

70
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:38,080
people's code. Um, so I was trying to kind of figure out how can we help the developers like

71
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,320
write tests. Um, and the talk that I alluded to is a talk that I did at GDC, uh, the game

72
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,850
developers conference, um, last year now, cause it's 2022, um, in which I talk in a lot more

73
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,730
detail about how all that happened. Um, but in the talk, I talk about a mistake that I made,

74
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,050
when I tried to, um, like I wrote a really nice automation framework that was ever so decoupled

75
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,690
from the game and it talked to the game over the network and I hooked it up with spec flow

76
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:12,210
on the front end. So you could write like Gherkin style tests. And I was like, this is great.

77
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,650
Everyone will write tests. And no one did, uh, except one manual tester who it turned out

78
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,850
was actually a programmer. And so we hired him as a programmer. Um, so then we had another big

79
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:30,420
project come up, uh, see if thieves, uh, you may have heard of it and it was very important to us

80
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,020
that we were able to release it on a regular basis. So we were aiming for continuous delivery. Um,

81
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,500
and we, we had a goal which we met of shipping it every week. Um, so we started out shipping a

82
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,300
black screen, um, to the Xbox preview program, um, and then kind of went from there. Um, and so on

83
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,860
that I, I was at this point running the team that was like helping out with the sort of test framework

84
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,940
side of things. Uh, and we, we basically worked with the team to put a test framework that was

85
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,140
embedded in the game. Long story short, I learned some lessons, wrote framework that worked for

86
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,740
developers. They didn't have to come out of their environment to write tests. They just wrote tests

87
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,540
in the environment they were in. Actually, I was listening to your episode where you talk about,

88
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,860
um, test cafe that kind of struck struck me that there were some similarities in there,

89
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,220
in terms of embedding the test code into the product, um, for ease of authoring. Um, and then

90
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,940
yeah, that's, that's probably a long ramble. You guys may have thoughts already.

91
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,700
I, I, I do have one thing. I'm sure Brent wants to jump on this too, but I jumped in first. So

92
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,980
this idea of shipping, you know, shipping every week and the first thing you ship is a black

93
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:46,460
screen. I am so frustrated by how bastardized the term MVP has been used as I love that. It's

94
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,500
fantastic. It's, it gives you value. It lets you learn something from your customers. And Brent,

95
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,620
I know loves this as well. So I'm stealing all of his thunder. No, no, yeah, we also have a

96
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:02,620
certification process to go through. So one of the, one of the goals of shipping every week

97
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,220
was that like no one else was doing that. And so we were like, well, we better start doing it.

98
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,260
So they get used to like receiving so many certification requests from us.

99
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,580
And then they eventually decided that they give us an exception.

100
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,180
Actually, yeah. Uh, right. You keep hitting the wall until the wall breaks and the river flows

101
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:32,140
again, right? Um, yeah, there's, there's a lot of things on, on that. So did you struggle

102
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:40,620
to get certified to ship a black screen? Right. I'm looking at, see what it wasn't to paying

103
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,700
customers, you know, it was just to the preview program. But still, but still that's, that's the

104
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:50,740
example. People try and try and put too much into what they think needs to be their first release.

105
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,300
And what you want to do is, is ship, deliver customer value often. And when you start with

106
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,900
a black screen, it doesn't crash at least you have nothing to do, but improve on that. But you're

107
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:10,450
actually practicing the art of getting that through all the hoops and ladders that needs to go through

108
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:17,010
to get done. So you've, and I imagine that got easier and easier until the certification

109
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,210
folks said this, you know, until they even made it even easier. Yeah. But as a studio,

110
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,010
we were very into continuous delivery and that mantra of if it's painful, do it more often.

111
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,600
So that kind of drove a lot of thinking. So what happened the first time you

112
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,640
shipped something through that mantra and you clearly shipped a bug?

113
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,180
You know, I'm just, I'm going to be honest to say, I don't remember. It's quite a while ago.

114
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,260
Yeah. And then actually my focus on that project was more on the, like, how do we,

115
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,340
well, see, you, you may or may not know that the games industry tends to lag behind the rest

116
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,980
of the software industry in terms of adoption of technical practices, but very bleeding edge

117
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,780
in some respects, but kind of culturally as a bit of a lag. And so, you know, it's very rare to find

118
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,500
a gameplay programmer who has written tests or knows how to write tests or, you know,

119
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,860
doesn't expect a manual person, a manual processor to test their work for them.

120
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:26,770
So that was kind of like the main thrust of my work on that project. And we kind of ended up

121
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:32,530
with this formula, which I've since applied on, on Minecraft, where I work now, which is kind of,

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,080
I guess, you know, I assume that people want to do good quality work. You know, no one gets out of

123
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,560
bed in the morning saying, can't wait to write bugs and crash everything. You know, and, but

124
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
so there's some reason about the system that they're in that is inhibiting that.

125
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:54,220
So by giving them tools that fit in their workflow and are easy to use frictionless,

126
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:01,980
as well as a bunch of education, you know, lots of training, coaching, pairing, and mod programming,

127
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,420
actually. Well, I didn't know about mod programming at the time. It was more recently adopted. And then

128
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,860
kind of the support, kind of the organizational support to spend time doing that stuff. So that's

129
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:19,820
kind of like the sort of three prong attack that has seen some success. Yeah, I think the thing,

130
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,020
one thing from my past to underscore there is just make it so easy to use that it's,

131
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,700
it's just dumb not to. And I've done that before with,

132
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:39,490
hey, Frank, do you remember the test harness on Windows CE called Tux? Yes. So I ended up,

133
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,290
as I always end up owning, no matter what company or team I go to, I end up owning all the tools.

134
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,010
And so Tux was on my team, but we just wrote, in fact, I think I wrote it.

135
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,160
Maybe someone fixed it for me because if I did, it would have sucked. But

136
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,160
a little wrappers, like I can't remember what the command line was, but it would create

137
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,480
the entire skeleton, you know, based on the code that was in that and put it in the right

138
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,960
directory and basically do everything, but actually code the test for you. So all the,

139
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,760
all that stuff was taken care of that made it easier for people to write tests. And then I'm

140
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,960
thinking analysis tools. People would be too lazy. They wouldn't run them locally and they couldn't.

141
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,120
So we just make it not only make it easy to run, but make them part of the build.

142
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,840
Same thing like getting code coverage data, just make it so easy to use. They'd be much

143
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,960
more likely to do it on their own desktop. Reducing friction certainly is an important

144
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,120
aspect to like here. That's the right word. I am thinking, I'm thinking back to, to my

145
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,360
Perseus days. Perseus is a fantastic little test harness last probably maintained in,

146
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,320
I mean, maybe recently, I don't know, but invented by someone we all know, the man named

147
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,910
Brad Jensen. Yeah. Somewhere. Oh, you can't see it right there is the patent for it right there.

148
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:58,830
Oh, by the way, I'm speaking of paths, by the way, I was going to ask based on what you're

149
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:05,870
doing. Are you doing any, are you doing any remote, remote testing of performance graphics

150
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:14,210
in your testing? Is that for me or Brad? I think that's either one of you. I will confidently say

151
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:23,100
no. Okay. Because if you are, I have a patent on that shit. Nice. Which is me highlighting the

152
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,300
uselessness of patents. But anyway, go on to a more meaningful conversation. Yeah. No,

153
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:35,790
I was thinking through. So reducing the friction is, is absolutely important, but it's, you, you,

154
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:45,360
you need to, to make it easy for them to construct it. You need to make it easy for them to run it.

155
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:53,120
You need to make it easy for them to get the results back. That's all important,

156
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:01,700
but insufficient to get them to use it from my experience. Right. And I think,

157
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:11,860
so my story with Perseus, which I've blogged about it led a different direction. It's probably

158
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:20,420
because I was 20 years away from even hearing the term quality culture, let alone implementing it.

159
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:31,090
But in my story, it increased intellectual laziness. It just became a place where testers added more

160
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:39,250
and more and more tests and, and devs actually stopped testing because they're like, Oh yeah,

161
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:47,010
the whole Perseus infrastructure is fantastic. I can just barf code, then submit it to the system,

162
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:53,490
go get a coffee, come back and then do stuff. In other words, you admitting you built a big fat,

163
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:04,300
ugly monster. I did. And, and yeah, well, I wrote that blog. You probably read it years ago. It's

164
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:11,220
problematic. However, what I'm wondering, cause the thing I did learn when I went to the Bing team

165
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:22,370
that fixed it is number one, CICD is fantastic. You get things fast out to the public so that

166
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:30,050
you can get the feedback. Of course, if you're not wiring up feedback, I just have to, you know,

167
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:40,450
head slap and ask WTF, right? The, so reduce small batches, get it out fast and have a good

168
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:46,750
system where you can get the feedback. Number two, get rid of the safety net. Cause getting

169
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:53,390
rid of the safety net then puts the, puts sufficient accountability while reducing friction

170
00:16:53,390 --> 00:17:01,630
in the risk of, cause the other thing is developers are scared, right? They, they, I've learned that

171
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:07,070
the main reason why they get tensed and blame testers as, you know, as we've talked on the

172
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:13,230
podcast before, like in the traditional world, the testers, number one service they provide is

173
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:21,230
scapegoating. The, the reason why devs get all hot to trot on that is because they're afraid.

174
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,190
They're absolutely afraid, but if you do smaller batches and get it out there,

175
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:34,800
the risk goes down way, way lower. So I'm interested, Henry, tying back to you.

176
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,720
Are you finding agreement on that front? Like are there still, so your title is architect and

177
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:52,400
previously software engineer. Have you found a way to sort of shift that accountability or did you find

178
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,840
shifting the accountability even important? Do you find developers, did you, did you come up with a

179
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,400
magic equation that, that made developers love writing test cases? It's a good question.

180
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:11,920
It's a good question. I mean, one thing that was on my mind is when we were talking a second ago is,

181
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,200
so when I was working at rare, we had a tech director there who was, who was very behind the program.

182
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,600
And he had this mantra of it should be easier to write a test than not to write a test.

183
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,070
And I was like, Oh, this is great. You know, I sure. Okay. But like surely always it will be

184
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,630
not easier not to write the test, right? Cause you don't have to do it. It wasn't until like

185
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,110
a few years later after we had kind of done it, that I realized that that is a, it is a real thing.

186
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,910
Right? Like when, when the culture has changed such that like, if you don't write a test,

187
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,310
then you're going to introduce bugs and break the bill and the lights are going to go red and

188
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,830
the lungs will go off and people will be like, Hey, why'd you break the bill? And you'd be like,

189
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,630
Oh, I'm embarrassed. You know, but there's like cultural pressure and it's actually easier to

190
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,670
sort of like follow what everyone else does. But getting there is, is a real challenge,

191
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:05,230
of course. So like on, on CFTs, we, we were starting from scratch. So we had, we had

192
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,750
considerable advantages in being able to like, you know, build the team out of people who were on

193
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:17,150
board and that kind of thing. For Minecraft is a much bigger team and we didn't have that advantage.

194
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,670
It's already, you know, a decade old. It's among the list. And, you know, we had a lot of quality

195
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:27,950
problems as you would expect, right? Like it was pretty much impossible to change anything without

196
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:34,430
breaking something. And we have a lot of backwards, like back impact issues and partner content that

197
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:41,630
we mustn't break. So there's considerable challenges and considerable pain for, I don't know if I'll

198
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:49,630
say developers, but considerable pain for the organization in shipping bugs to players and

199
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:56,770
heavy reliance on manual tests, as is common in our industry. As to exactly how it happened, I,

200
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:04,770
I'm not entirely sure. We applied the same kind of formula. Well, I guess some, some brief history

201
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:10,610
about how I ended up there. So one way that Alan and I know each other is that Alan hired me onto

202
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:17,890
the team's team. And that's how I left before he even started one day. It was gone by the time

203
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:24,210
I got there. He knew I was coming as that's why he had to clear that out. Yeah, I ran away. Sorry.

204
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,770
Yeah, definitely. Which is, which is fair and reasonable. I understand. I know. Anyway, so I

205
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:37,490
ended up on the team's team because I was like, you know, I had done this and I kind of, my approach

206
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,010
is to try and work myself out of a job, right? I think if you're a quality coach, your goal should

207
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,450
be not to have a job because like if someone, if you, why would a team need a quality coach on a

208
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:50,690
continuous basis, right? That would mean you're not doing your job. Yeah. And I, and just to

209
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,010
interrupt, I think, and that's something I've done a lot in my career. I've done it at Unity

210
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:59,970
twice where I've worked myself out of a job. Unfortunately, a lot of people in the industry

211
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,760
hold on to their traditional test role because it ensures they have a job if they do it right,

212
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,200
because they can put themselves in a position to be that dependency. But as I think through it,

213
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,960
I think all the quality cultures, I'm sure there are exceptions, but all of the quality coaches

214
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,480
that I can think of work as consultants. They do jump into a team, do the work, and then work

215
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,760
themselves out of a job and move on. But just wanted to add that. But anyway, go on, Henry.

216
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,120
Yeah. And so that had happened on CFPs. I was like, well, you know, the culture is there,

217
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,200
the processes are there. They don't really need me. Like the developers are earning this process,

218
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,120
right? So I think like you're, as a quality coach, you're successful if, you know, you're

219
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,480
not needed and the team is now earning that process. And if you go away, then they'll keep

220
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,160
that process because they see value in it. They understand it. And so I joined the team as a

221
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:58,110
programmer, back as a gameplay programmer. And then I didn't enjoy the lack of autonomy. I got used to

222
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:03,230
the autonomy that came from kind of running a team and trying to have a goal to solve. And I didn't

223
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:10,110
really appreciate going back to like being told, develop this feature, monkey. So then I was like,

224
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:15,870
you know, I know I'll go to Alan's team and learn how the real pros do it.

225
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,630
Through twists and turns, I ended up working on the thing that didn't really work for me. I ended

226
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:29,310
up kind of working on like open source compliance and build stuff. I was like, what am I doing?

227
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:33,790
I knew people on the Minecraft team. I joined the Minecraft team as a gameplay developer.

228
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,830
And while I as a gameplay developer, I was trying to write tests and they had a test framework.

229
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,830
And I was like, okay, you know, no one is more highly motivated than me to write tests for my

230
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:53,630
work here. Right. But I couldn't make it work. The friction was too high. There were terrible

231
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:59,230
systems that when they had like created these systems on the build and infrastructure side

232
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,870
that treated tests as hostile entities and quarantined them and put them through a gauntlet.

233
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:09,790
And I wrote a test and I didn't get feedback for two weeks that actually had never passed on iOS.

234
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,430
And there was no way for me to find that out before I submitted it. So I was like, well,

235
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,670
this obviously isn't working. And yet, like you say, they were kind of like, we have

236
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,990
quality problems. We want tests. We want developers to write tests. But they were like, we just don't

237
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,310
understand why developers aren't writing tests. They have the frameworks. So I was like, well,

238
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,750
hey, you have the frameworks, but they don't work. Will you let me take a look at that?

239
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,950
And they said yes. And so then I started a team that did the same thing that I did at REN.

240
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,190
Because that's kind of the long roundabout way of how I ended up doing that work there

241
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,870
to try and answer Brent's question about how do you get the developers on board.

242
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:52,980
And then I don't know, I guess I feel like you have to be very pragmatic about it. Like I've seen,

243
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,980
you know, colleagues come in and try and make the same kind of cultural change.

244
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,660
And sometimes they'll come in and they'll be like, you know, I have this idea of how you're going to

245
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:05,380
do it. You know, like you're going to write C sharp tests. Oh, and you know, oh, you won't write

246
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:11,060
those. I'm going to hire a set to write them for you. And that was a giant failure. You know, or

247
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:15,940
like, you know what, like high level tests, total waste of time. Only unit tests are going

248
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,460
to work for you. What's that? Your architecture doesn't support them. Well, you should change

249
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,100
your architecture entirely. So like, I mean, you know, then they'll spend like years fighting

250
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,300
with the senior engineering leadership kind of trying to say, you know, as a prerequisite to

251
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,700
writing any tests, you have to completely rearchitecture your system, which of course

252
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,660
doesn't go down very well. And so but that's kind of common, I think, especially with people

253
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:45,840
like from outside the industry coming in anyway. So I guess what I'm getting to is that I feel

254
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,800
like the answer is maybe just having empathy for the developer, kind of like I was saying,

255
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,680
right, like they want to do a good job, you know, but there's no one who's like, sitting there

256
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:03,120
trying to break stuff. Right. And I'll quote from my GDC talk, I think I said, in the context of

257
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,880
developers, the ones who need to write the tests, but when given the right tool and training,

258
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:15,490
we're actually really good at it. Yes. And that is wait, wait, no, no, no, no. I mean, that's

259
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:22,850
heresy. Because so so Alan will best teach you this, like there's this thing called the developer

260
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:30,770
mindset. And now now Brent's using the sarcasm thing. How cool. Because there are people in the

261
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:37,330
industry that aren't on this call that believe that developers are not capable of doing testing

262
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:43,090
because they lack the mindset to do it. And I have I have course have learned as Henry has, and

263
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:49,250
maybe Brian has that that's a bunch of B.S. I have. I've run a dev team without testers.

264
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:57,300
Good for you. Yeah, it's yeah, they can write tests, but often it's just it's often permission

265
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,620
or they've been a lot of developers have been told for so long that they that they're unable

266
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,420
to write tests because they have the wrong mindset that often all you have to do is tell

267
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,570
them it's okay. And they may not be perfect at first, you'll get better, which, you know,

268
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,970
hopefully they figure that on their own. But in the coaching aspect, a lot of it is empathy.

269
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:23,170
A lot of coaching is empathy. And while you were talking, I'm thinking of all the people I've

270
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:29,490
interacted with throughout the years, many of them at Microsoft who were frustrated because they

271
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:35,090
had a great idea to do something. And just like you described, I said, I wrote a framework for you,

272
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:43,820
why don't you use it? Something's wrong with you. You you obviously don't care about quality. No,

273
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:48,540
I don't know how to use it. It's not easy. It's not intuitive. I don't have the coaching. I need

274
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:55,820
to do it. Please the build it and they will come mentality, I think is especially prevalent

275
00:26:55,820 --> 00:27:01,100
from testers writing tools. I think it looks like standard agility applies as well. Right?

276
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,380
Like so you when you when you roll out a test framework, then you want to put something out

277
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,780
there and you want to see what happens who uses it, why they're not using it, talk to them,

278
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,140
try something else and just iterate until you get to the point where it works for them.

279
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:19,100
And I showed this in my talk, but, you know, we kind of tracked basically for reasons coverage

280
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,220
is hard to collect for us. Not that I would recommend coverage as a metric, obviously,

281
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,940
but I like to think it's informative. Coverage is a wonderful tool and a horrible metric.

282
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,540
Indeed, indeed. And a wonderful tool for people who are trying to like,

283
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:36,220
get a development team to adopt testing. And so, but I just fell back to like number of tests.

284
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:44,300
We actually we introduced a framework that was I feel like there's probably a proper name for it,

285
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,180
like a proper testing name for it. I doubt that we've invented it. But it's basically like

286
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,100
imagine if your architecture was such that you couldn't write unit tests without

287
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,580
extensive changes, but you wanted to write unit tests. So you kind of, you know,

288
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,300
you spin up the game and all the dependencies, and then you like take the little piece that

289
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,500
you care about and you kind of like write what looks like a unit test, even though there's all

290
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,900
sorts of stuff going on in the background. So that I've been calling it like a middle ground test

291
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:17,900
or whatever. But that was the bridge they needed, because it gave them something that

292
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:23,660
worked in their workflow. It's like, okay, now I don't have to wait for the specific example

293
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:29,420
would be I want to test a component. But in order to instantiate a component, I need an actor. To

294
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:32,620
instantiate an actor, I need a level. To instantiate a level, I need the whole game.

295
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,820
And so it's like this incredible this chain of dependencies is very hard to break. So what we do

296
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,500
is we spin up a level. And we say, okay, you're going to write a single one shot function that

297
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,300
looks like a unit test. You can spawn an actor in it if you want. But you're going to like

298
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:54,380
take the component and poke a couple of functions on it. And just that kind of unblocked then that

299
00:28:54,380 --> 00:29:01,980
sort of latent desire to do unit like testing. And actually what we now see is that our actual

300
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,100
unit tests are starting to grow at a faster rate than those tests. So initially, there wasn't much

301
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:13,180
adoption. And then we suddenly get this uptick, which was like we've been, you know, I think it's

302
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,900
about sort of two or three months or so where we were kind of iterating very closely with the team

303
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:23,580
figuring out like what would work for them. And then there's this moment where they suddenly have

304
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,380
what they need. And then it just explodes. And then that kind of gets them addicted to testing,

305
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,180
test-insected. And then they start realizing, oh, you know what? If I did a little bit of

306
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,380
refactoring, I could make this an actual unit test. And so then they start writing,

307
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,860
they start doing that and they're writing unit tests. Lastly, these make theory of what we see.

308
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,270
I feel like I'm kind of off topic. I'm not sure.

309
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:48,270
No, no, there is no such thing as off topic on the A B testing podcast. Don't be

310
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:55,150
Yeah, I'm currently trying to find a name for your thing. I'm thinking, I'm thinking

311
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,310
pseudo mock maybe. Yeah.

312
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,750
Ultimately, I don't really care what the name is, you know, like, as long as we can, you know,

313
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,870
use it as a tool to move people in the right direction.

314
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,390
Hanks, Hanks special environment.

315
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,470
Oh, you know, it's, it's, it's, of course, Brent's special sauce.

316
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,420
Uh, yeah, let's move it on to the next question.

317
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:32,940
Let's just do with that. Winding back. So what you did is you, you treated test culture shift.

318
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,450
And I, here's something that I think is very interesting, right? As, as you were talking,

319
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:43,650
every time you need, need to make a major change, I've come to learn that you need to look at three

320
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:50,290
separate things, the people, the process and the technology. Far too often people

321
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,930
just think of it as a technology solution.

322
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,850
We just need the right tool and then we're done.

323
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,490
Right. And, and Hey, I built the tool, but why is no one using it? It's because

324
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,050
you're requiring people to use it and you haven't invented the correct

325
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:12,050
friction free process to make it easy for them to do it. Now, what I, what I hear from Henry's story

326
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:21,730
is what they did is they viewed quality coaching or, or the change of the culture as a product.

327
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:29,470
And they, they sort of a process and BP, right? They viewed it as a product

328
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:37,230
and they viewed it as a sign that there was an error in either their design, um,

329
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:43,710
or in their process, if they weren't getting adopted. I think that's fantastic. I, I,

330
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,310
I don't know that I've ever mentioned it. I may just be projecting in, in this conversation, but

331
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:57,870
whenever I roll out something new, I try, what I'm looking for is how do I get people to

332
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:04,270
love this? Not how do I get people to use it? How do I get people to love it? And if I only

333
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:12,450
get 50% the way there, guess what? I'm getting people to use it. Well, I used to say it rare, but,

334
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:20,060
it's like 98% of people problem, uh, this kind of thing. And then I realized pretty recently

335
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,940
that I was actually wrong. It's actually a hundred percent of your problem.

336
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:30,420
That's a, that's a Weinberg quote, um, you know, paraphrased in, in software, eventually it's

337
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:35,200
always a people problem. And as a tangent, just because something I've been sharing with my team

338
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,800
recently is, you know, I think one thing we've done pretty poorly during the pandemic, we as an

339
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,000
industry is learning how to work asynchronously and have, and get work done without the need for

340
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,600
a meeting to discuss stuff. But then I also realized that I'm noticing this a lot in managers

341
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,800
and leads in my organization who often have to solve people problems and not technology problems.

342
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:04,080
So I think there's a people problem and those people problems as an aside, I have, I am noticing

343
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,560
have been getting tougher and tougher over the last almost two years now.

344
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:17,520
Stupid pandemic. Yeah. I mean, I'll, I'll, this is, this is a tangent, but, um,

345
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,000
that's what we're famous for. Well, indeed. Yeah. I'm so glad to be here and contribute to the,

346
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,360
the proud tradition of tangents on the show. Uh, but yet more programming is something that we

347
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,360
have found super effective, um, for all of those pandemic woes and it's not asynchronous.

348
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,680
It's very synchronous. Um, but you can do it remotely quite effectively. Um, and I, yeah,

349
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,640
I'm, I'm encouraging it as much as I can, because I think especially for early in career folks,

350
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,640
it's just really hard in the, in the work from home environment, because you don't get that

351
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,080
coaching that you would get if you were sitting next to someone, you know, you could just turn

352
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,400
around and ask. Um, whereas when you, when you marble ensemble on a problem together, you know,

353
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,840
that all comes in and it's, it's supercharged. So, you know, like we started doing it.

354
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,280
We just started experimenting, uh, with an hour here and there. Um, and we're at the point where

355
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:18,050
my team is, is it has decided that they are going to, um, I think like one, one week a month,

356
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:24,690
they, they do an investments week, um, where they mob as a whole team on something that helps us,

357
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,450
you know, get better. So like the last thing they did was they put a piece of the test framework

358
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,650
under test under, under unit tests, which I was also going to say another big mistake. I think a lot of,

359
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,690
um, people who are in that kind of quality coach or test framework writing role make

360
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:45,570
is not testing their work. Right. So like every single framework that I've seen for the most part,

361
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,090
you know, I'll be like, oh, where are the tests? And they're like, oh, well, we don't have tests.

362
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:55,090
Where are the test framework? I'm like, what are you doing? You know, like it's so when I,

363
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:58,050
when I took that S that role, I was like, Oh, I guess I didn't know anything about testing.

364
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,690
Actually that's how I came across the podcast. Cause I was like, well,

365
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,210
I guess I better read this book. How they, how they test software at Microsoft.

366
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:11,170
Cause that's relevant. Uh, that's time you'll never get back.

367
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,930
Well, that's a really good book. That's how I learned how to be an S that

368
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,810
and write good bug reports. It actually was what I was hired for. Right. Um,

369
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:27,890
to, to be an S debt, even though I didn't ever really do it. Um, cause I thought it was done.

370
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:38,850
That was a great, that's great. Uh, yeah. So what advice do you have for someone who wants to become

371
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:45,680
an S debt? Um, become like you're a programmer program things. If you're interested in test stuff,

372
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,240
like help people write tests, write tests for your own work. Um, you know, learn to teach

373
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,320
yourself. You could just said don't, but, um, I was actually gonna ask, uh, the question I was going

374
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,920
to ask for you said that and changed it was what advice would you have for someone who wants to

375
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:09,820
do more test coaching or become a test coach? Um, I guess I would be curious why, um,

376
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:16,610
like what, what's the motivation because you know, it's, it's kind of a weird role, right?

377
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:21,650
Like we were saying, you have to be willing to work yourself out of a job. Um, so for me,

378
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:28,530
the games entry is, is well known for, for crunch, um, where we work in St hours. And, you know,

379
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,690
so a big part of my motivation is I don't want people to have to experience that. Right. And so,

380
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:37,490
so I kind of empathize a lot with like my customer as the, as the developers on our team.

381
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:44,850
Um, so that's a lot of like my personal motivation, but I guess if like, for example,

382
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,210
I, depending, I don't know what parts people tend to have, but like if you were a tester,

383
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:55,410
um, and you're like, Oh, I want to become a quality coach. Um, I don't know. I think increasingly it's

384
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,770
going to be tough to do it without being a programmer, you know, like all the, all the

385
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:03,490
good stuff is in the programming side, right? Uh, if you, if you can't dig into the code,

386
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:08,610
uh, and dig into the technical practices of how that code is created, then I don't know how you

387
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:15,890
can be effective longterm. Um, so yeah, I know what I did when I took the Sestet role was I was

388
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:21,650
like, well, I know nothing about this. I had a really bad experience with TDD at, um, college.

389
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,090
I had this class where they made us try it and I was like, this was dumb and terrible.

390
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:30,930
I had a bad experience. I didn't like the person that I was pairing with. Uh, so I didn't do it

391
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,090
again, but though I made an effort to teach myself, um, and it's hard, right? That's why

392
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,610
I don't recommend people to just like, just say, Hey team, you should start doing TDD,

393
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,530
right? Because it's hard. It gets worse for it gets better. Uh, it's hard. It takes,

394
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:45,890
it took me like sort of three to six months, I would say, to kind of rocket that from like,

395
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:51,090
just doing it every day. Um, but I think you have to kind of teach yourself those technical practices.

396
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:56,130
So if you're curious yourself about those technical practices and how you can write better

397
00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:02,130
code, how you can write code with zero bugs, um, then that probably makes you a good

398
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:08,210
quality coach. Let me throw out an idea here for discussion. Just thought of this and someone's

399
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,410
going to get mad at me and yell at me about this, which is the best sort of thing to bring

400
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:21,890
up. I wonder if, uh, there really is that big of a difference between a good agile coach,

401
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:27,970
which there are a lot more of and a good quality coach. And if the reason we have quality coaches

402
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:34,290
is because a lot of teams implemented agile, which typically textbook wise would have everybody

403
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:39,890
writing tests and whole team quality is in a lot of agile teams, the way they, the way they

404
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:48,350
adopted air quote agile was to have a air quote agile tester on the team who did all the testing

405
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:54,190
for the team. And I wonder if like those folks eventually, as they, if they again want to work

406
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:58,030
themselves out of a job, they end up teaching the rest of the team to actually own their testing.

407
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:02,430
And that's where quality coach could come from. I just kind of wondering like, what is the

408
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:09,710
difference between like, cause agile is delivering, you know, frequent quality to your customers.

409
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:15,950
What's really the big difference between an agile coach and a quality coach is just a little bit of

410
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:23,630
expertise on testing. No, no. Cause I'm going to add a new coach. Oh God. Because I think,

411
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:34,110
I think, so I was thinking about, about what Henry just said, and I'm, I'm going to invent a new term.

412
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:42,830
It's something that we've used on the cast before. And I think, I think we may be conflating

413
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:51,890
quality coach with code correctness coach. Right. And, and when I, when I think about

414
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:59,330
if you're trying to coach to Henry's point, too, if you're, if you're coaching quality in a more of a

415
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:04,770
traditional means, like, okay, create more test cases and things like that. I think it's going to

416
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:14,370
be hard to coach a team on that. If, if you do not have empathy for their problems, and I think

417
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:24,030
it's going to be hard, much harder to, to have that empathy. If you haven't experienced yourself,

418
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,710
I think the more challenge the code correctness part of that, I'm like, I want to let you finish,

419
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:31,390
but just as a twist on here, like something I know, Brent, you've heard me share before,

420
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,950
but just in Henry, maybe on the podcast, I've said this, but when my old, but now isn't a

421
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:41,150
quality coach role, I had a boss ask me, how's the team doing at testing? And I said, they do

422
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:47,170
all the testing they know how to do, which meant that it was good. They, they had full ownership

423
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:53,970
of testing job done. Not really, because there was a lot of test approaches and ways to think about

424
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:58,770
the, in which the way in which the code may fail, they hadn't thought about, but I did, I mean,

425
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:03,570
code correctness, they always knew how to do that. That's kind of at the beginning where it stopped.

426
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:09,570
So what I did as a quality coach took them, took them from code correctness to quality.

427
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:14,370
I think there's probably, you know, I think there's probably no real difference between

428
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:18,940
a good agile coach and a good quality coach. I feel like there's probably lots of, there's

429
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,820
lots of pitfalls, I think, coming from a like traditional testing background. You know,

430
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:31,940
I have many colleagues who are in that space. I also see a particular, I don't know how to call

431
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:38,580
it, like a, like a trample pitfall where people, people burn out, you know, they get really

432
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,900
frustrated because people aren't doing what they told them to, goddamn it. You know, they're like,

433
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,180
I came in and I told you that TDD was the thing you should do and you didn't do it.

434
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:52,500
And I think that's, that's kind of, that's not going to be effective. But you're not going to be

435
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,380
effective and you're going to burn out and be really mad and upset. So I think it's,

436
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:03,700
it is much more like an agile coach in that you're there to help the team see what they

437
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:08,260
could do better. You know, so if someone on the team is like, oh, you know, I just wish there was

438
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,300
a way we could test this and be like, oh, how, how, how might you go about that? You know,

439
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,620
maybe we could try a bar and kind of give them like, like you were saying, Alan permission.

440
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,780
Yeah. So I think it's quite similar. Yeah. And then, and just to throw out there,

441
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,780
I've done a lot of pairing in my past as well, super helpful. So mobbing definitely,

442
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:30,340
especially if you have some folks with some test experience in that mob can be a great way to

443
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:36,260
coach and teach and, you know, osmosis phi is made up that way. There's, there's a new term

444
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:41,300
for you. Brent osmosis phi that testing knowledge into them. But anyway, I promised to let Brent

445
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,500
finished, but now that we've told him he's wrong and telling me I'm wrong. Go ahead and finish.

446
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:52,820
Brett. I don't think you've, I, I going to assume your arguments underneath my own.

447
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:00,340
If I take it literally like the point of agile, right? The point of agile is

448
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:11,140
essentially to successful or iteratively to adapt. Adaptively. Yeah. Adaptively. Thank you.

449
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:22,660
Adaptively improve the value stream over the cost. Right. So it's an ROI function that you're

450
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:29,860
optimizing. How do we get the most value in the least amount of time? And then put it in that

451
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:37,220
light, right? Then a quality coaches is probably a subset of an agile coach. A quality coach

452
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:48,160
is potentially focused on the numerator of that equation. How do we increase the value?

453
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:54,640
Whereas an agile coach is focusing on value over time. I would say a good agile coach can do both,

454
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,760
but many. No, no, I think, I think an agile coach's responsibility is both.

455
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,560
Absolutely. I think today, probably 90% of them don't do both. The good ones do both.

456
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:11,950
No, I think 90% of them just do scrum or fall. I'm going to barf and record it on the podcast.

457
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,260
Right. He's turn off your camera first. Nope.

458
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:27,740
Yeah. I think, I think that's right on that. The, the one thing though, like going back to your

459
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:35,140
question, right? It's all right. There's two kinds of camps that we've, we've kind of been addressing

460
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:41,780
and a lot of the podcasts has been our target audience as people was traditionally people doing

461
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:50,660
the old, the old world way of testing. And how do we, how do we help them move into the new world

462
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:56,340
and do so in a delighted fashion? Because well, that one and I went into the new world and like,

463
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:03,140
oh my God, why we're jealous of all the new kids starting in the industry at this point in time,

464
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:08,420
because we now look back on it and go all the bullshit we did was just wrong.

465
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:16,050
That's how I've concluded it now, but it does create new problems. A lot of the old tricks,

466
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:22,050
like if we want to do go and recruit a test expert, how do we do that? Do we do that?

467
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:29,630
How do we get code with the right balance of preventative protection,

468
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:36,830
AKA test suites and things like that, with, with leveraging monitoring and leveraging reactivity,

469
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:43,870
or reactive strategies to get, if we did something wrong, get a, a fix out quickly.

470
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:52,130
Right. I, I kind of more of a, I'm kind of a more of a mix on using monitoring

471
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,690
and preventative efforts.

472
00:45:54,690 --> 00:46:03,230
I feel like, you know, if you, you as the team get to decide that, you know, like the thinking about,

473
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:08,130
you know, what, what, what does it all put one? And I agree about having credibility, by the way.

474
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:14,530
I think a reason, something that helped me a lot at, at Rare was I was talking to gameplay programmers

475
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,050
and they had not been used to talking to another gameplay programmer, right? They were used to talking

476
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:23,490
to people coming in from a central test team and being like, oh, and they don't quite talk the same

477
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:28,610
language. And you don't quite have the same credibility to get them to, to trust you that

478
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:33,920
you might know what you're doing. But then like, if you can talk to developer, like that, you'll say

479
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,380
they'll have, they'll want to test something, right? There's a latent desire. You know,

480
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,460
they know that they, that they need to test, that this needs to get tested. And they might be in

481
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:48,100
a mindset of like, well, up until now, I have been able to just throw this over the wall to someone.

482
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:51,140
But once you get rid of that, then they become curious and they're like, well, how, you know,

483
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:54,420
how would I test this? And then as a coach, you can kind of help them answer that question.

484
00:46:54,420 --> 00:47:00,740
Right? So like, they'll be like, you know, I want to test this. What I could do is I could,

485
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:07,140
you know, simulate the controller being pressed forward and then you press A to jump and then

486
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,420
you do this, you know, and it's like, okay, well, but what are you actually trying to test,

487
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,540
and it's like, okay, well, what are you actually trying to test, right? So you can, and you just

488
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,740
keep asking them that until I tell you, you know, I'm trying to, I'm trying to test that if I, you

489
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:25,460
know, that when, when, when I call hit by pickaxe on this block, the block disappears or whatever,

490
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,900
you know, it's like, okay, we'll write that test. So to your point, right, I think

491
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:33,460
that what you're talking about is kind of an implementation detail, right? That the team gets

492
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:40,100
to decide because, you know, I'm into the whole team quality thing and it being everyone's

493
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:46,180
responsibility, which is kind of like a lean thing anyway, right? It's like, we want to look at the

494
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:53,300
whole system and say like, you know, if, if the bottleneck in the system is release or, you know,

495
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:57,940
bugs coming back or whatever, then why is anyone working on anything else, right? Like we should be

496
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:03,380
fixing the bottleneck as a top priority. But very often we, you know, that games entry is renowned

497
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:08,820
for, you know, what to scrum fall or match a hell or whatever. And so you end up with like these,

498
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,100
you know, these little assembly lines going and they distribute all the pieces and bring them back

499
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:20,660
in. I was reminded of a really great talk by Henrik Nyberg called Confessions of a Change Agent.

500
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:27,140
It's on YouTube. That sounds familiar to me. Yeah, it's really, it's really good at talking

501
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:33,060
about like, you know, because a quality coach is a change agent, right? Like you're the kind of

502
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,900
person who is a change agent. You want to make things better. You're not satisfied with the status

503
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,580
quo. You're the kind of person who is frustrated by some process and you write a tool on your lunch

504
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:48,500
break to automate it, you know? Yes. Right. So like, if I was looking for to hire people,

505
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,140
which I might well be actually, I would be looking for people like that,

506
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,100
who have that mentality, if they just want to improve things.

507
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,110
Uh, yeah, actually I was in a conversation. I forgot about the term change agent. I've

508
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:10,420
been called that many times in my career. It's, it's, I am allergic to the word can't. I can't

509
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,860
stand it. When someone tells me I can't do something. You just said the word can't twice.

510
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:22,670
Are you breaking out in hives? Uh, yes, it's a podcast. Uh, yes, absolutely.

511
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,150
Look at Brent. He's blowing up like a balloon. I bet he can't stop.

512
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:36,940
Um, yeah, so much of my career has been, uh, we have this big problem and then I start investigating

513
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:43,340
and people like, Oh, we can't change that. And it's this sort of prevailing. That's the way it's

514
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:49,100
always been though, Brent. That's right. And I just look at them and like, yeah,

515
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:56,780
it's not going to be that way. Give me three weeks. Uh, those things really, particularly when it, when

516
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:03,710
the word can't is in the way of something that is just really harmful. You can just clearly see

517
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:13,040
that this is a bottleneck and, and, or a big wall in the way, the whole team knows it.

518
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:18,320
They all have sticking with the Minecraft paradigm. They all have pickaxes,

519
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:25,200
but they're like, Oh yeah, you know, you need a, you need a diamond axe to, to get through this one.

520
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:39,550
Then go make a goddamn diamond axe. It's, it's, it's, um, change agents are really important

521
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:45,900
because they don't, it's a, it's an attitude, right? It's not, it's not a, it's not a role.

522
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,420
It's not something that you can hire into. It's an attitude. It's, it's no, this is wrong. And I,

523
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,540
it needs to be repaired. They, they, they don't like to hear it's not my problem.

524
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:01,150
Wait, change agents like to hear that. No, they don't like to hear that. Oh,

525
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:07,150
they're not the kind of people who would say that. Um, I would say as well, like, you know,

526
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:11,710
for any testers listening, like people who are change agents are always going to have a job,

527
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:16,030
right? They might just have to be open to what they do exactly. Yeah. And that's,

528
00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:22,430
that's, you know, as a tester, I was a change agent. And I think some of this comes from our,

529
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:29,410
you know, I, I, most personality types have a little bit of horoscope to them, but both Brent and I

530
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:33,650
are INTPs. And I don't know what you are. If you've ever done that, Henry, same. Yeah.

531
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,370
Well, that makes sense. Then, well, there is a pattern there because one of the things about

532
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:46,850
INTPs that I love for my little green book is we abhor inefficiency. So those things just,

533
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,090
things that are inefficient bug us and we want to fix them. Yeah. There was a podcast,

534
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,090
there was an episode and it was, this was eight years ago. This is when I was at rare. So I don't

535
00:51:55,090 --> 00:52:00,130
know when I would have been, it was before you guys had invented modern testing or, or we didn't invent

536
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:07,010
it. We just labeled the thing we saw. But anyway, go on. The label to it. Um, but you, you said

537
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:12,210
something very similar. You said, um, waste burns. Well, maybe it was when we met and we were

538
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:15,810
chatting. I can't remember if it was on the podcast, but I know it really, really resonated

539
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:21,410
for me. I was like, yeah, that's, that's how I feel. It's just like, oh, this is so inefficient.

540
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,140
Yeah. I burned.

541
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:30,300
Especially waste of humans. Time really pisses me off. Oh, that one wasting a human's time.

542
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,740
I am much more mad than if you're just like, you know, some other kind of waste.

543
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:45,020
I actually, my order is now calendar time, human time, uh, then, um, you know, business

544
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:52,860
issues like calendar time. If you think about like CICD, right? The longer we take for calendar,

545
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:58,460
the longer we're going to get the feedback that we need to, in order to improve. Right.

546
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:03,500
This is something that maybe one last thing to talk about in our, our, our weaving path through

547
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:09,740
here. So I am big on making sure cycle times are very, very tiny on the services side of our,

548
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:15,070
or we're pretty successful there. The time from coding up a change to having that customers use

549
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:20,830
is as fast as you'd expect in a company that makes services. We also have a big, uh, at Unity,

550
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:28,830
a big monolithic product, as most people know, and I am tracking and I probably should share too

551
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:34,670
many details in the exact times, but I can now see, um, median P 75 times, et cetera, from the time

552
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:40,670
a check-in is made until it shows up in a customer available build. And it's a nice little

553
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:45,390
start up my, my value stream for that. So, and we'll work on reducing that, but the fact,

554
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:51,600
I'll let you know there, they aren't numbers that I'm happy with. I'll say that it reminds me of how

555
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,720
much work I have to do. Yeah. Well, and I think, you know, it's like, but as a change agent,

556
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,040
you're like, well, obviously we can make this better. Right. Whereas I had a conversation with

557
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:06,320
someone about a, a certain game title, not one that I've worked on, but it was someone on the

558
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:12,030
services team. Um, and they, they said to me, oh yeah, the client is a lost cause. And I was like,

559
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:17,310
I don't accept that. That's as good as it's going to get. It really can't get much better than that.

560
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:24,350
I said, that's a challenge. Challenge accepted. Yeah. Uh, I've, I've been in those shoes. Uh,

561
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:30,830
I may have even said it, but I'm, I was thinking, I'm thinking now of the, uh, the zoom client.

562
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:36,130
Works better. If there are no people working on the client, if there are no humans being

563
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,970
impacted by, by the client being a lost cause then, okay, maybe, but like, well, there are,

564
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:44,210
well, there are dev teams toiling and, uh, you know, in these terrible environments,

565
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:53,570
then I think, you know, if it's a lost cause and it's a critical component that, that cannot be

566
00:54:53,570 --> 00:55:01,540
permitted to be a lost cause. Right. Yeah. That's that's, that's problematic and people are just

567
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:06,180
accepting problematic and that has to change. Yeah. And the thing is like, if you are, if you

568
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,460
take that view of it's the last cause and you're kind of saying, then we're going to continue

569
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,540
testing it the way we've always tested it. But increasingly that's untenable for games.

570
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:19,060
Like we, we, many games are already at the point where it costs more to test them

571
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:27,600
than them is economical. Like we actually get rare, a big, um, uh, a big factor in

572
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,680
why we committed so heavily to canoes delivery was on the previous title,

573
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:37,440
which was fully manually tested. We had wanted to release some DLC. Um, and we had not been able to,

574
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,400
we had to cancel it because it would have cost more to test than we could have earned.

575
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:48,720
That's good. In the context of INTPs and waste burns and talk about, you know, teams as an

576
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,400
example, not because I want to riff on teams today, but I think it is an example of something

577
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,320
I've seen, not just a Microsoft, but other companies in the industry do is to me. And this

578
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,480
is probably, it's probably a paradigm for this. Maybe even in the mythical man month,

579
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,400
or maybe in right now since flow book, but the team's client got progressively worse as

580
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,520
they added more people to it. And I've struck that away from teams and it's not like I rip it on

581
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:22,300
them, but often you'll a software project will be going well. So they'll fund it more and put

582
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,660
more people on it. But I think it's probably mythical man month because eventually it gets

583
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,260
to the point where there's so many people working on it and complexity that it ends up grinding to

584
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:40,380
a halt as far as innovation and quality goes. I think a lot of times higher quality products

585
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:46,460
are worked on by a bare minimum team delivering iteratively and adaptively versus a whole bunch

586
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,780
of people trying to get a big bang for the buck faster. It occurred to me as you were talking

587
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:56,220
through like adding more resources. Sometimes call people.

588
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:04,940
Yeah. Well, sometimes it's machines, sometimes because something else, right? But adding more

589
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:12,380
resources, right? If you think about the switch statement, adding more resources is the default

590
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:22,450
action plan. Sometimes people get in such a bad state that the sky is falling. It has to be fixed

591
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:32,450
by yesterday and everything you come up with is going to extend it much further or be outside

592
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:40,450
of your means. And so, and a lot of the times when you're drowning, it's really difficult to

593
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:47,680
think through very calmly and go, okay, how do I swim? Right? If you haven't learned how to swim,

594
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:56,960
it's like you need, someone has to have their head above the water and guiding the panic to the

595
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:03,840
shore. Now, if the whole organization is in the panic stage, then it often ends up being the

596
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:09,440
case that adding more resources, of course, as you call out potentially thoughtlessly,

597
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,240
because the more resources you add, whether it be human or otherwise, is going to add additional

598
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,840
complexity and runs the risk of actually adding more problems, not solving them.

599
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah. And there's a lesson. Go ahead, Henry.

600
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:28,640
I like the model from the Repennin and Sternum paper, like the one that's called,

601
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,320
no one ever gets credit for fixing problems.

602
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,560
Oh, I remember that one. It's like 20 years old by now.

603
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:37,120
Yeah. But I like it as a model of like, you know, you have a certain amount of resource and

604
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:43,200
you can choose the slider you have is how much am I investing in improvements, improving the system

605
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:49,840
versus how much am I investing in delivering work? And the problem is that you can push the slider

606
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,600
over and invest it all in producing work, but then your system degrades and over time, things

607
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,640
become terrible, but you get that short term boost. Whereas the other way is harder to stomach

608
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:03,280
because you get a short term decrease when you stop producing, when you invest more in improving

609
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:08,000
the system. But then over time you become better. I think that's like the kind of number one,

610
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,240
you know, you go to people and they're like, Oh, I just can't do this. We don't have time.

611
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:15,920
You know, management won't let me, you know, it kind of comes from all that kind of thing.

612
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:16,880
Always management.

613
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,480
So what I like the kind of teams that I've led, they've kind of been,

614
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,680
well, certainly the Minecraft one, it was kind of a skunkworks thing, you know, and I think

615
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,520
you can be quite effective by taking just a couple of people, like two or three people off

616
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:36,000
to the side and saying, Hey, you people help other people get better. It doesn't solve the

617
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,400
whole problem, but it can be effective. Well, a few people whose role is force multiplier

618
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:46,480
or change agent is good to have throughout the org. But I wanted to build off real quickly

619
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,400
before we end here, the thing that Brent said earlier, and I think maybe I've mentioned this

620
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,920
on the podcast, but I, I, something I reiterate to my team, especially as we're looking at

621
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:59,680
our growth for 2022 is I will, and my team knows this now to their

622
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,760
initial frustration, but now understanding is that if your team has a whole bunch of work and can't

623
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,060
keep up, I'm not going to give you head count to help solve that problem. You need to solve that

624
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:16,020
problem first. You need to figure out how to prioritize and get the work done that you can

625
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:20,180
and choose what you can't do. And once you show me as a lead, you know how to run a team that can

626
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:24,580
actually deliver and not be underwater. And then I'll add head count to your team so you can grow

627
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:29,680
and take on more stuff. And it's a hard lesson for people. They're just, I mean, a lot of times

628
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,560
managers will do the opposite. Oh, your team's not keeping up. Okay. We'll give you some more heads.

629
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:38,240
And that was very much, you know, I add that experience at the old place.

630
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:47,150
So actually, I learned this a long time ago, your Reese, and it was through a mentor. And,

631
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:53,230
and I've applied it to multiple things, new, new resources, whether, again, whether it be compute,

632
01:00:53,950 --> 01:01:03,150
people, money, whatever, new resource, way more successful to allocate those to your strengths,

633
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:09,790
not to your weaknesses, right? Much, much very similar to what Alan's saying, like, no, no, no.

634
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:17,630
I have, I have five additional heads I can assign to a project, right? I'm going to assign it to the,

635
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:22,430
to the projects that are showing strength, not the ones showing weakness.

636
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:31,390
Those type of resources are not there to add a safety net. Root out your problem, get back on

637
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:39,870
track on an ROI, show your, establish a strength, whatever that may be in the context, then the

638
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:46,670
veritable candy will start flowing again. And I guess it's kind of, it's sort of related, but

639
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:51,470
it makes me think of when you're trying to change a culture, you're trying to be a change agent,

640
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,750
then you're going to find your allies, you know, you're going to find your bright spots

641
01:01:55,630 --> 01:02:00,350
and help support them more. You're not going to find the people who like disagree with you the

642
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,830
most and try and help them, right? You're going to help the strong people first.

643
01:02:04,830 --> 01:02:08,910
We should probably close for the day, but I want to thank you, Henry, for joining us on the

644
01:02:08,910 --> 01:02:14,110
podcast and sharing your stories and helping me give Brent a bad time. Could it a little bit

645
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:19,390
better there as your feedback, but it's okay. Brent, Brent relieves today relatively unscathed.

646
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:23,150
So any final words from you, Henry, before we go?

647
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,180
No, thanks for having me.

648
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:33,820
Thanks for joining. And as always, you can find out more about us and on moderntesting.org is where

649
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,300
you can go. Also, if you want to join our Slack group at one of the three, I think that's kind of

650
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:44,940
it. So Brent, anything to say? No, thank you. Thank you for joining Henry. And I assume,

651
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:47,900
Alan, you're going to post a link to his latest talk.

652
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,270
I will try and remember. All right, everybody. I'm not Henry.

653
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:54,240
Nor am I.

654
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,240
All right. See you next time.
