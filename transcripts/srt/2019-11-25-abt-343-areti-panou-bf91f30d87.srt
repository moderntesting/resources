00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,510
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,180
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started.

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:29,100
Welcome everybody to the ABT 343 podcast. I'm joined once again by one of the three listeners,

5
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:37,980
Ariti Pannu. Did I say that well? Yes. As you can tell, I've been practicing. Very active

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,500
member of our community. Someone who is, I would maybe even call a fan of modern testing,

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,460
but someone, not just a fan, but someone who's pragmatic and practices some of the principles.

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:56,060
So looking forward to hearing some stories from her today. So welcome, Ariti.

9
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,540
Thank you for the invitation. Thank you for having me.

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,940
These are fun. I'm slowly getting better at these. I'm hoping that over time, these end

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,680
up being maybe even more exciting than Brent and I yelling at each other.

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh, we wouldn't be listening if you were not yelling at each other. If it was a polite formal

13
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,320
conversation, I think we would just skip it.

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Good call. Good call. So as you know, the format for today is I'll ask you three questions

15
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,480
and you'll give me three answers and then three minutes later we're done. No pressure,

16
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,760
say whatever you want. I might ask some clarifying questions and we'll see what happens.

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,320
Are you ready for your questions?

18
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,840
I am ready to rumble.

19
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,760
Okay, let's first we'll turn to politics. No, just kidding. So I already mentioned you

20
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,160
have some good interest in modern testing and some examples. So what are some ways you

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,280
have seen or experienced modern testing in your work?

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:54,840
I would say that I experienced this the other way around. I started listening to the podcast

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,590
about a year ago or 18 months ago and the principles were already there. So I read

24
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,510
them. I thought, these things make sense. They seem to be reasonable things. But I really

25
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:13,470
didn't know if they apply to me or whatever I did. And then as I kept listening to the

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,270
podcast, I realized that I went from a traditional tester into modern tester. That was about

27
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,770
five years ago.

28
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,840
Can you talk more about that transition because it just hasn't happened overnight?

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:35,560
No, no. And I really, really struggled with that. So a bit of history. I'm working at

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,570
SAP. It's a bit software company here in Germany and worldwide. And I started working, I got

31
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,820
hired to work as a tester in a very small product that was doing cloud things, which

32
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,540
were not very common at the time. And I really liked doing the testing. I really

33
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:59,460
liked finding bugs. I really liked blocking bugs. I really liked having this deep

34
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:06,140
knowledge of the product. But as I kept on working there and my role was evolving and

35
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,060
changing, I realized that I didn't have so much time for testing. I was doing other

36
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,780
things. And although my manager appreciated that, my colleagues appreciated that, I hated

37
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,970
that because I wanted to do testing. And it took me a long time to come to terms with

38
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,060
the fact that it's not only testing. And after listening to the podcast and reading

39
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,260
the principle, I said, this is what happened to me. Because to come to terms with the

40
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,250
fact that I'm not only testing, but I'm doing all the other things as well, it took

41
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,850
time. It was not from one day to the other. So what are some of those other things you

42
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:49,280
ended up doing? I think one of the major things is how to have our deployment

43
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,620
pipeline running in a meaningful way. I think that was the first thing that got my

44
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:01,820
attention. They were running all sorts of checks. There were huge jobs running things.

45
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,060
They would break. Nobody would know what it meant that it broke. My first job was to

46
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,480
clean this up. The other thing that I was doing had to do with compliance. And back

47
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,680
then to be compliant as an SAP product, really entitled lots of paperwork,

48
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,520
screenshots, what have you, and to find a way to make that meaningful for our small

49
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,520
product that also took time. And also the developers had objections to something, some

50
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,840
quality things imposed, and how to bring them to the company that also took effort.

51
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:40,300
So the role evolved from testing a feature to looking into the overall quality of

52
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,100
what we're doing and why. There were many things that we did wrong, but I

53
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,500
think overall, it was a pretty good experience.

54
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,380
That's cool to hear. And it just brought up so many thoughts in my mind. Recently, I've

55
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,980
been talking to Brent more and more about how I see DevOps, the DevOps, whether it's a

56
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:03,980
role or a concept or a culture. I think that influences accelerating the achievement of

57
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,940
typical quality a lot. It sounds like you were doing some things that would help

58
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,620
you to accelerate the team. And then also that testing is, and I also have a long

59
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,300
career doing testing, and it is one way to reduce risk and help the team move

60
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,060
faster. But it's not the only way.

61
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:28,650
No, but as I said, that took me a lot of time to realize that I was resistant to the

62
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,020
idea of now I have to do all these other things that annoy me. I didn't want to

63
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:42,360
handle, you know, compliance things. But some of them were useful, not all of

64
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,460
them, maybe not to the degree that we want them to be. But there were some useful

65
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,340
ideas there. And we had to take the best of what we had and do the best for the

66
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,780
quality of our product and then just complain about it or ignore it. These were

67
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,860
hard realizations. But this is also what the team and the product needed.

68
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,140
And I'm just kind of curious, how did you get over that hump? What was the like,

69
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:11,780
you didn't like it? And do you like it now? Or you still prefer to do

70
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,500
mostly testing?

71
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:19,580
And now I understand it. But I think I didn't fully I liked some of the things.

72
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,620
But I think that it helped me that I went on parental leave. And then I

73
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,120
stepped back. And when I looked at it from afar, I saw the value of it. While

74
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,920
I was in it, I cannot really say that they appreciated it that much. But when

75
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,340
I stepped back and I saw what was happening, and then it hit me that it's

76
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,580
the rest of the things. It's not only testing, it's all of the things

77
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,930
together that bring value. But while I was in it, I cannot say that I had

78
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,250
this revelation or but stepping back helped me a lot.

79
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,290
This is actually a really good story to hear because I think when we talk

80
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:00,890
about modern testing, a lot of people have already been on the journey or

81
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,970
they can't imagine the journey or they're in the middle of it. And there

82
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:09,010
are a lot of, you know, a lot of our listeners are career testers, and

83
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,470
there may be quite a few who are in that same boat, they're seeing the

84
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:18,190
role change, and they're not sure if they like it or not. And it just

85
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:22,670
realizing that's okay. And I think the directions you can go from being a

86
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,710
someone who's mostly dedicated or entirely dedicated to testing into a

87
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,750
more broader role. There's quite a few different directions you can go, of

88
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,630
course, I talked about DevOps. But there's also something we talked about

89
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,150
quite a bit with, I believe, principle number seven, and maybe five

90
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,430
to some extent is the role of the quality coach. I know you've done

91
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:49,150
some quality coaching at SAP. Yeah, tell me about tell all of us

92
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,750
about that role and what you liked and didn't like about that and

93
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,070
how that went, what your activities are, those kinds of things.

94
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,070
Yeah, so coming back from Pteranthaleev, I had this time to reflect

95
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,190
of what happened in the last five years. So then there was a newly

96
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,630
built department at the time, called Cloud Quality Coaching. And

97
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,990
the purpose of the department was to go to development teams, the

98
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,590
coaches, we go to development teams for one or two months, and

99
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,230
work with them not only with the quality people, but the whole

100
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,350
team how to improve their quality. Some teams called us

101
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:26,030
that we have a quality problem, and then we would have to go

102
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,070
in and analyze what the problem was. Sometimes there were people

103
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,470
that were doing excellent job and they just wanted some, some

104
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,030
conversation to see if they can do anything better. And my role

105
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,830
in that was mainly to coach people in a quality role, which

106
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,870
they had huge experience in releasing products on premise

107
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,110
or with big cycles. But to come to this fast paced world was

108
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,940
something new to them. And my role was to calm them down to

109
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,130
help them a bit, be helpful for their teams.

110
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,970
The quality therapist role.

111
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,530
The quality therapy, it was kind of a therapist mentoring

112
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,290
sessions, because these were people really experienced with

113
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,370
testing and setting things up and they were good when it came

114
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:17,540
to testing. But it was this transition to the cloud world

115
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,420
that needed a bit of work, let's say, and most of them

116
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,980
were really embracing the change. I can't say that I

117
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,220
found somebody that said, no, this is my turf. Testing is my

118
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,500
thing. And I don't want anybody near it or quality is

119
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,140
my thing. I think they were all or most of them were very

120
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,140
open to the change.

121
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,490
That's good to hear. Because when I think about, I have

122
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,930
stories about people who had expertise, but they had no,

123
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,770
they wanted to keep that expertise close to themselves

124
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,290
because it was job security. And I'm glad that isn't the

125
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,330
case there. So what were some of the, believe it or not,

126
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,570
this is just the second question, I just have sub

127
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,210
questions because it's tangents are part of A B testing. Do

128
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,170
you have a couple of examples of things you helped teams

129
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,060
do? I'm just kind of, I want a little bit more, trying to

130
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,420
understand a little bit more about what this role was. So

131
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,060
what would you, what was an example of something you would

132
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,780
help a team do?

133
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,500
Example that I helped the team to, I said, I was mainly

134
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,620
working with people in the quality role. So one was to

135
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,500
set some kind of boundaries. There were many things that

136
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,860
were requested of them, because in the old world, the

137
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,250
quality person was responsible for everything. To help them

138
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,210
distribute some of the work was one thing I worked with

139
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:38,250
them with. Because until now, it was all their domain, they

140
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,970
were the quality assurance people. But they needed to

141
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,370
delegate some things they needed to help others take the

142
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:46,730
responsibility for some things.

143
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,250
This is perfect timing to talk to you. I don't know if you

144
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,450
listened to the last A B testing podcast yet. But I

145
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:58,330
talked, I talked in there about how I'm discovering that

146
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,970
one of the things I want to get better at is coaching

147
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:05,730
coaches. And really, if you're coaching people who are then

148
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,770
working on delegating other work, you're, you're coaching

149
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,930
coaches too, in that role.

150
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,320
Yes, that was the point that we, as we were a central team,

151
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,640
our quality coaching team was a central team. So we would go

152
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,900
in and leave. But the main idea was when we leave, that

153
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,460
the team was more enabled to take care of quality on their

154
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,300
own. And people in the quality role were still needed in

155
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,980
those teams. But they needed to adapt their role.

156
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,660
I like it. I like it. Did you have I have way back like 15

157
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,940
years ago, maybe 20 years ago at Microsoft, I'm feeling old.

158
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,860
I was doing a lot of talking around the company and

159
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:50,540
organizing meetings of the senior testers. In fact, that's

160
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,620
where Brent and I first started hanging out. And one

161
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,220
of the things I toyed with for a while was if the same idea,

162
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,820
should we have this quality consultant quality coach role?

163
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,620
And would that be a better way to scale the relatively few

164
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,540
number of senior testers we had at Microsoft? It never

165
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,740
happened. But I think maybe the world wasn't ready for it. I

166
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,160
think in today's world, in a more cloud based org, I can

167
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,280
see, I can see good reason, see good reasons why this would

168
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,400
work. And probably some reasons why it wouldn't work.

169
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,320
Some reasons I wouldn't work because you go for for a fixed

170
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,060
amount of time. So what we struggled a bit about is how do

171
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,220
we keep up the work? So we would go in, come out. And then

172
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,970
what happened next? And to keep track of that, we we struggled

173
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,570
a bit there. And as I said, my, my part was to coach this

174
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:50,250
quality transition. But there were other coaches in our team

175
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,650
that focus, let's say on automation, they help the

176
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,210
teams decide a bit better on their strategy, what to

177
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,250
test where, instead of doing Selenium from end to end test,

178
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:03,050
not only about Selenium, just trying to automate something

179
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,210
from end to end with all kinds of scenarios, basically

180
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,130
scripting what they had as manual regression tests. So

181
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,570
there were colleagues that we were helping cut down the

182
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,130
tests and do a more meaningful automated test strategy.

183
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,530
I'm imagining me as a as a quality coach there and I go

184
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:24,770
in and tell teams to get rid of all their Selenium. Maybe

185
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:30,970
not. Yeah, that does. Yeah, that would be problematic. But

186
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,810
there would be maybe some interesting discussion of how

187
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,090
we define integration tests and who is doing tests. And

188
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,180
that's a whole new.

189
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,620
Yeah, I tweet

190
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,380
of worms.

191
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,220
As you know, I know you've listened long enough to know I

192
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,100
have my beefs with not with Selenium the language but

193
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,100
with the overuse of Selenium. Lately, I mentioned this in a

194
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,460
few tweets and I'll probably mention the podcast sometime,

195
00:13:55,460 --> 00:14:00,180
but I'm slowly changing my tune on not writing any, I

196
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,780
think teams still write too much automation at the UI

197
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,500
level for web stuff. But I'm thinking with tools like

198
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,620
Mabel or Autify or Testem, I think the ability to write

199
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,550
reliable cross browser tests is getting easier. Those

200
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:18,190
are tools that use a little bit of ML to try and track

201
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,110
when things are changing versus having to go

202
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,830
up the other selectors.

203
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,590
They reply different question than the ones that let's

204
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,110
say traditionally this end to end test we're replying.

205
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:31,030
Right, right. And I just I still want as few of those

206
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,990
as possible. Just like, you know, when the cone

207
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,110
wrote that pyramid, and we're way off in the tangent,

208
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,190
he said it and everybody ignores this part and I

209
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,550
underline it eight times every time I see it, which

210
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,470
is at the top part of those end to end tests,

211
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,350
write as few of these as possible.

212
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,270
Yeah.

213
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,330
So we've we've hit it. We've hit a sore spot.

214
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:55,610
When I started this testing job, my first task was to

215
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:57,850
automate end to end tests from with QTP.

216
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,020
Oh, I'm so sorry.

217
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,460
Wait, was this in 1997? When did you do this job?

218
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,580
2010.

219
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,300
QTP is still around?

220
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,400
In 2010 it was.

221
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,400
Oh my gosh.

222
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,700
Oh yes. And it was a FlexUI for the fun of it.

223
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,380
And I am not skilled at coding for my life.

224
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,340
Yeah. So after playing with it for a while, I said,

225
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,060
do you have anything else for me to do? Because

226
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,240
this is not going to work. And I was lucky because

227
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,160
the developer in the team wrote a DSL so I could

228
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,200
test on API level.

229
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,880
Oh my gosh.

230
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,840
Yeah, the sound you're about to hear is the sound

231
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,400
of me hitting my head on my desk.

232
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah. But as I said, I was lucky. I started

233
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,760
working in a team with very good developers that

234
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,720
they realized soon enough that this is not going

235
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,160
to work because I had no experience in software

236
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:49,680
development.

237
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,900
Yeah. And I think I think that's a big part of

238
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,060
which means you're coaching the developers in a

239
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,420
way.

240
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:00,490
The developers not so much. No, I will. I think if

241
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:03,410
you have a team where the developers understand

242
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,410
that testing isn't this black hole, they go throw

243
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,490
this up over the wall to immediately being begin

244
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,210
to understand quality a little bit better.

245
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,010
Oh yeah. Okay. When I was working in the

246
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,330
development team, I went back to being a coach

247
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,170
in a central team. No, but yeah, as a tester

248
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,570
quality QA in a development team, you definitely

249
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,410
have to work very close to the developers and

250
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,650
operations and sales and business and you need

251
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,650
to coach them all a bit in certain ways and

252
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:32,250
they coach you.

253
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,170
Yes. One of the things I noticed as I begin

254
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:39,570
spreading the quality culture, quality culture

255
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,770
transition guide that that I wrote and

256
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,170
spreading that around unity was it wasn't just

257
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,690
enough to talk about it with development teams.

258
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,450
I think a quality culture spans teams that

259
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,170
aren't developers of software. I think it does.

260
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,090
Quality culture is part of the way sales

261
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,810
approaches things. It is part of marketing.

262
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,970
Good on you.

263
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,570
Documentation. Yes. Especially document.

264
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,650
Translation. You name it. If you don't align

265
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,170
more or less the teams together, you don't

266
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,930
get very far because you have them different

267
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,690
priorities and different goals, different

268
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,250
timelines.

269
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:18,330
Yes. Interesting. So you did quality coaching

270
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:22,570
for a while, but you have a new upcoming role.

271
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,170
Then I went on parental leave.

272
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,930
Congratulations again.

273
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,810
And I went back and I said, I revised what I'm

274
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,250
doing. And I think it was also a lot having

275
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,570
to do with listening to the podcast. But I

276
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,330
thought, Hmm, how can I really affect quality?

277
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:45,130
And there was a product owner job being

278
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,370
available in the company. I thought, Hmm, why

279
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,730
don't I try this side now? So starting January,

280
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,300
I'm going to be a product owner in some of

281
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:03,580
our internal tools. And interesting. So go on

282
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,370
a little bit. I have many questions. Yeah,

283
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,050
the main tool that I will start with what it

284
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,650
wants to do is we have all these pipelines.

285
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,850
All the company has everybody sets their

286
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,250
pipeline. So the tools team is trying to

287
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,810
make some kind of unification of the

288
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,170
pipelines. You have to be compliant. And

289
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,690
there are some checks that you need to have

290
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,050
in place. So instead of everything trying to

291
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,210
figure out what checks I do, I need to do

292
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,290
what are the thresholds on all of this. We

293
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,490
try to make this standard. So when you start

294
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,850
a new product or any project, so you get

295
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,400
the pipeline for free and what the product

296
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,920
that we're working on will do is store the

297
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,680
data that comes out of these pipelines. One

298
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,480
for compliance. This is the original, the

299
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,680
first goal. And the second one is then to

300
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,160
come up with some questions of what does

301
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,300
this data tell us? So this will start in

302
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:56,780
January.

303
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,330
My first question is, and this is just,

304
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
there's a name for this bias. It's a

305
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,720
it's a recency bias, where because I'm

306
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,120
thinking about something thinking we think

307
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,600
about is there a pattern here when there may

308
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,080
not be, but an internal tool sounds a

309
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,620
little bit, do you think of some overlap

310
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,090
there with an infrastructure team or a

311
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,420
DevOps team? Or am I making that up?

312
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,190
I don't know. I don't understand the

313
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,590
question.

314
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,470
That's probably because I asked it very

315
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,750
poorly. So I recently took over a team

316
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,670
we call our DevOps team, which builds all

317
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,870
of our internal tools, including compliance

318
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,430
tools, things we use in our organization

319
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,270
to help us ship software safely. And

320
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,310
with all the appropriate security tools

321
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,110
and compliance tools running in those

322
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,910
development pipelines could be a different

323
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,390
pipeline, different definition of

324
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,030
pipeline you're talking about. Is there

325
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,990
some similarity there? Or am I reading

326
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,630
too much into that?

327
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,630
I think so. We have a central tool

328
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,510
where if you if you go through all that

329
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,790
this is where you display what you

330
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,180
have done. This is one of the internal

331
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,100
tools. Yes. And the idea is to bring

332
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,580
whatever comes out of this pipelines

333
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,820
directly to that tool, instead of

334
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,260
somebody going and uploading log files

335
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,900
or what have you, that comes out of the

336
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,420
pipeline, the idea is to automate the

337
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,220
whole process. So I guess there is some

338
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,660
kind of overlap is taking care of your

339
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,220
household tools. You need developers to

340
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,220
come up with them, develop them.

341
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,040
As someone with a lot of quality and

342
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,520
testing experience, what are some things

343
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,240
that you think some unique ideas you'll

344
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,880
bring as a product owner to something

345
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,360
like this?

346
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,120
That's a very good question. That's

347
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,920
also what I said in my job interview

348
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,000
said, what will you do as product

349
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,200
owner? I don't know. I've never been a

350
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,410
product owner. I think it was

351
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,890
appreciated, honestly. I think the

352
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,510
quality perspective is, I think it

353
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,110
comes to the principles again, that

354
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,590
the customer is the only one who

355
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,100
knows what is good. And now as a

356
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,660
product owner, I have the chance to go

357
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,820
and speak to these customers and

358
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,020
bring their perspective as much as I

359
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,700
can to the team.

360
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,900
I would say that you will ask, and

361
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,100
not just when you meet with them,

362
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,340
that any product owner is going to

363
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,340
do that. One of the things I see

364
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,500
from testers is they ask better

365
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,380
questions.

366
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,010
Yes. You ask, first of all, why we

367
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:28,770
should do it?

368
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,250
Yes, yes, yes.

369
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,530
Why? Now all these why's that it

370
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,050
has a test or why should we do it?

371
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:36,370
Does it make sense to do this?

372
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,770
What problem does it solve? Or what

373
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,370
what problem do we need to solve?

374
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,340
Exactly. And then you also have

375
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,620
the input directly from your

376
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,580
customers. And then you can bring

377
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,900
that to your team. You can bring

378
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,020
them, I think you can bring them

379
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,220
better data, because you try to

380
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,340
work more on the questions that

381
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,340
you ask the customers. You try to

382
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,940
go a bit deeper than the surface.

383
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,300
Oh, I want this. And I find this

384
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,700
interesting. I don't know if it

385
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
would work out, but I really

386
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,500
find the topic interesting.

387
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,980
And it's a development team

388
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,660
without a quality person inside.

389
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,920
Yeah, you'll help. I think what

390
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,440
you'll end up doing is you'll be

391
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
the product owner and the

392
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,320
quality coach.

393
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,280
I don't think so. I think they

394
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,760
have already the quality culture

395
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
in the team. I think the

396
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,480
Scrammaster is doing lots of

397
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,880
quality work. Okay. They're an

398
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,640
established team.

399
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,720
One of the things I tell my

400
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,360
boss, he asked, how is our team

401
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,880
doing a quality and testing? And

402
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,320
the thing I always say is they

403
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,960
do, they're great. They do all

404
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,200
of the testing they know how to

405
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,660
do. And then my role is to is

406
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,380
to broaden that amount of

407
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,260
knowledge they have about

408
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,100
testing. So they do more.

409
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,100
They're happy to do testing, but

410
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,780
some teams don't know very much

411
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,460
beyond unit or functional level

412
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,900
testing. So what I try and do

413
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,460
and people on my team, the

414
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,540
coaches on my team, try and

415
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,620
help them figure out what some

416
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,700
other things. How else would you

417
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,500
test your APIs, for example,

418
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,740
and come up with some ideas for

419
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,020
increasing the breadth of their

420
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,740
testing coverage?

421
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,160
Yeah, I think it's something

422
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,000
that you said either in the

423
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,560
Slack channel or in one of the

424
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,200
podcasts is what is the worst

425
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,360
thing? It really think it's

426
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,520
what is the worst thing that

427
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,720
can happen and what is the best

428
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,120
thing that can happen. I

429
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,960
really like that. And to

430
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,200
bring that to the team, I

431
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,320
think it's something you can

432
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,240
do either from a quality

433
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,360
perspective or a product

434
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,510
perspective. So I'm looking

435
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,190
forward to it.

436
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,630
I am I'm confident you'll have

437
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,390
fun and you'll do very well.

438
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,870
Particularly excited because I

439
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,870
have I have a particular fondness

440
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,670
for a lot of people like to

441
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,750
work on those customer facing

442
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,910
features. And I've written some

443
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:39,910
of those for customers. I've

444
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,510
written a lot of shipping code.

445
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,590
I enjoy for some reason writing

446
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,150
and working on internal tools a

447
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,550
lot more. And and one of my

448
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,110
favorite questions to always

449
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,070
ask someone would come and

450
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,790
ask me for some very specific

451
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,210
thing. And time and time again,

452
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,290
I would ask them, great, what

453
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,850
would you do when you had

454
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,000
that, which was my way of

455
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,120
asking them what the problem

456
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
they're trying to solve is.

457
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,200
And often there was already

458
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
a way to solve it. And I

459
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,400
think that comes from my

460
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,670
testing background, being able

461
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,470
to ask those questions. So I'm

462
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,630
excited for you. I want to live

463
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,750
a little vicariously through

464
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,590
you. I think it should be very

465
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,430
interesting. I think you're

466
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,270
going to have a good time and

467
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,950
do very well.

468
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,440
Let's see. I'm really excited

469
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,360
now. I wish I could start

470
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:23,720
right now.

471
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,240
I think you'll enjoy some time

472
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:26,760
off first.

473
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,900
I will. I'm going on holidays

474
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,260
tomorrow.

475
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,220
Yes. Yes. I know you told me

476
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:31,980
so. And where are you heading

477
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:32,420
on holiday?

478
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,780
Greece going to visit my

479
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,350
family. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy.

480
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,310
Thank you.

481
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,790
It has been a pleasure talking

482
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,190
with you and hearing a little

483
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,190
bit more about what you do and

484
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,150
a little bit more about modern

485
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,910
testing. Is there anything else

486
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,110
before I forget like Twitter

487
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,310
handles or blogs or anything

488
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,670
else our listeners should know

489
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,030
about you?

490
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,750
Um, yes, I do have a blog,

491
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,150
which is called unremarkable

492
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,950
tester dot com. And then my

493
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,390
Twitter handle is unremarkable

494
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,190
QA. And I guess I will change

495
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,630
my LinkedIn now profile to

496
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,670
unremarkable. P.O.

497
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,980
I really need to somehow

498
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,700
consolidate all of this, but

499
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,340
anything with unremarkable tester

500
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,460
QA, you will find me.

501
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:21,170
Perfect. Wonderful. Well,

502
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,170
thank you again for spending

503
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,050
some time with me today.

504
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,850
Really enlightening. Really

505
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,290
great talking with you. And

506
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,690
thanks again for all of your

507
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,250
support of the podcast and the

508
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,890
Slack channel. Safe travels

509
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,010
and best of luck in your new

510
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,290
role.

511
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,250
Thank you very much. It's been

512
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,410
a pleasure. All right. We'll

513
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,220
see you later. Bye bye.

514
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:39,900
Took about a year to the

515
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,980
Japanese and I could I can

516
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,860
get around the basics and the

517
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,300
same I spent a bunch of time

518
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,380
in France and I can get

519
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,700
around in France. I tried to

520
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,300
learn German and I just

521
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,700
couldn't get it. I couldn't

522
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,620
do it. I had a really hard

523
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,020
time with it. It's the

524
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,420
syntax. It's the way they

525
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,980
structure the language is

526
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,340
and also the pop music is

527
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,060
not so good.

528
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,380
Because I learned English

529
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,620
through songs, recording,

530
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,420
you know, with a cassette

531
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,540
next to the TV and Spanish

532
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,380
the same way. And then I

533
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,180
said, okay, where's the

534
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,580
German pop music? And then

535
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,780
you go like, no, no, no,

536
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,060
no, no, this will not work.

537
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,380
So I've been here for 10

538
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,620
years and and because I'm at

539
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,740
SAP where everybody speaks

540
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,180
English, I'm comfortable

541
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,900
not learning more German.

542
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,660
And now I have to do it in

543
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,940
German. It's really so a

544
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,660
new job in a new

545
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,060
language. Yeah, it's

546
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,820
interesting. I go to our

547
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,900
Montreal office a lot and

548
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:36,700
everyone there speaks

549
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,340
English. But if you work

550
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,220
there full time, they

551
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,820
expect you to learn

552
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:43,640
French. Yeah. They're not

553
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,800
expecting it here. They're

554
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,680
they're quite nice. Well,

555
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:47,760
they say, come on, you've

556
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,680
been here for 10 years.

557
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,920
Everybody in the team is

558
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,930
German. You have to be

559
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,050
able to participate at least

560
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,930
in the meetings in German,

561
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,810
which I can do. But when

562
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,890
it comes to details. Yes.

563
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,810
And even when I was at my

564
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,570
very best in French, it's

565
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,890
very much faded for me. I

566
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,290
I could understand a lot of

567
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:08,730
conversations, but if there

568
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,090
were too many details or

569
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,290
if they're telling a joke

570
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,410
that had, you know, just a

571
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,930
lot of idiomatic

572
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,730
expressions, I had no

573
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,530
idea what was going on.

574
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,570
And also context. If it's

575
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:20,650
about some commercial in

576
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:22,290
the 80s, it's like, okay,

577
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,130
I don't get the reference.

578
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,650
Yes. Yes. Yeah. So yeah.

579
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,970
Now it's in German. I'm

580
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:28,810
gonna let you get going.

581
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,490
It's okay. It's lady.

582
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,210
Have a have a great

583
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:32,610
holiday.

584
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,770
Thank you. I hope I survive.

585
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,130
I'm sick. The kids are sick.

586
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,690
We're traveling tomorrow.

587
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,290
That's the three of us.

588
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,290
They all they all get.

589
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,690
Yeah. Yeah. Good luck.

590
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:43,010
Yeah. Thank you.

591
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,130
I'll have my mom pick us up

592
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,450
from the airport and then

593
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,250
I have to do nothing.

594
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,570
My mom will do everything.

595
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:48,570
I'm a grown up.

596
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,290
You only have to survive

597
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,410
that long. Yeah.

598
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,010
All right.

599
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,290
It's it's only a two hour

600
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:52,890
flight. Okay.

601
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,050
Okay. Thank you very much

602
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,370
again. And thank you.

603
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,290
We'll cross paths again

604
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:56,490
soon.

605
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,090
I hope so. All right.

606
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,530
Bye bye.
