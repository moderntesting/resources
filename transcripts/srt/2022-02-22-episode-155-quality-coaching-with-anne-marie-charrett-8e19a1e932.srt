1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Are you actually asking them these questions when you're hiring engineers about their ability to

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,240
do software testing? Because I think that is where you nip that in the bud.

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,930
Welcome to AVE Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast. Your hosts, Alan and Brent,

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,370
will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership, Agile, and anything else

5
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,530
that comes to mind. Now, on with the show. I never know what to say at the beginning.

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:38,220
Hey, everyone. It's Alan. Don't you have a patented starting? Hey, everyone.

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,380
All right. That aside, we have another guest, a wonderful guest. We have

8
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,050
Annemarie. Annemarie, say hi. Hi. Hello, everyone. Nice to be here.

9
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,530
Well, I don't know about Brent. I'm ecstatic to have you here. This is, I think we're going to have

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,650
a really fun conversation and get to know, I have so many curious questions, which I've

11
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,650
shared with you in advance. Well, in advance by meaning, you know, 30 seconds ago.

12
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,770
And I'm fully, I'm fully prepped, right? If you were a color, what color would,

13
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:16,660
Can I answer that? No. Yeah. And that was for Brent. Teal. Teal. Teal. Teal. Teal's an excellent choice.

14
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:24,180
Teal's an excellent choice. Now, the going back to, so number one, your last name is pronounced

15
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:31,140
Sherritt. Well, it's actually Charritt as in carrot. So, yeah. Yeah. That's a common thing.

16
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:39,700
I like Sherritt better. It sounds more, more inclusive. Oh, like Sherritt. Oh, good. Exactly.

17
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,100
Exactly. Oh my. The first person who's actually come up with that. So, you know,

18
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,540
I'm going with that. I am Sherritt from now on.

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
Oh,

20
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,980
and Alan, you're going to ding me on that. And you started off with what's her color. Oh my God.

21
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:03,060
Okay. No. So I'll just say it's a joy having you on this. I had not, I'll be. So I know Alan and

22
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,380
Anne-Marie have a, have, have crossed paths. We've interacted over the internet together and we

23
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:17,820
figured out that we've met once. Up until, so I knew that I knew nothing about Anne-Marie

24
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:27,980
until a couple of years ago, when Lisa Crispin came on and expressed that Anne-Marie is someone

25
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,540
that the world should be paying attention to. So I have started doing so since then.

26
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,900
Well, that's current very kind, very kind of Lisa as well.

27
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,060
Anne-Marie for the, and I'm going to guess, so here's the, what's the name of the bias? We have,

28
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,220
we have the audience bias. There's a better name for that. Everyone who listens to our podcast

29
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,580
probably already knows who you are, but on the off chance and the people that should know who

30
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,140
you are don't listen to our podcast. So we have a bit of a conundrum, but in the off chance,

31
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,220
we have a new version of our three listeners this time. We're going to get to a lot to get

32
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,700
to know you. Maybe a quick introduction. Like I think you may have noticed Anne-Marie has an

33
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,300
accent to like where you're from, what your role is, what you do, just a little blur, the elevator

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,300
pitch. I'll do my best. It keeps changing. So I totally realize it's not up to date anymore.

35
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:28,780
Yeah. So, Irish born and bred, moved to Australia in the early 90s, which gives you some idea of

36
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:35,980
my amount of experience I have in the industry. Basically came here for a year and much to my

37
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:42,620
mother's disgust, fell in love with an Australian and I've been here ever since. So yeah, but from a

38
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:50,540
software testing quality perspective, really came out of uni as electronic engineer and first job

39
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:57,900
ended up as you do a software tester and just loved it. Just, you know, I was testing protocols

40
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,260
which can be, seem really, really dry to a lot of people, but I was testing protocols for the

41
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,100
European commission and what I found fascinating was, you know, you would get a conformance to a

42
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,620
protocol and then when you connect to the two devices together, they didn't work. So it's like,

43
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,540
this was just fascinating for me and suddenly a whole heap of questions about why and, you know,

44
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:27,180
and I guess ever since then I've just been asking those questions. Why, how come,

45
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:33,660
what's going on? You know, how do I pull this apart? And I really enjoyed it and I keep thinking

46
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,300
about what else I could do in my life and I haven't come up with another answer. I desperately

47
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,260
wanted to think about other things I could do with my career. I keep coming back to software

48
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:48,220
testing and quality because I just really, really enjoy the topic. It's a fascinating topic for me.

49
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,180
Quality coaching is something I guess that is evolved. I'm all about evolution. I'm all about

50
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:02,540
learning and growing and as long as I learn and grow, I'm a happy person and quality coaching for

51
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:10,140
me is a natural evolution of, you know, where the software testing role has come to. When you work

52
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:17,580
in the industry, when you work and you see how people develop software, it makes sense. Like,

53
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,460
you've got to work with the way software is being developed today and the role of quality

54
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:31,420
coach is really just an evolution of that. And how can we think about quality and how can we,

55
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,340
you know, provide support to the teams that are developing quality is just massively important.

56
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:46,060
It's a really challenging role, as you both know. It's, but it's a really interesting role to see if

57
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:53,100
you can actually make that difference without actually being in the mix, so to speak. So

58
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,220
that's where I'm at. I'm at culture at the moment. I recently took a decision to go

59
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,500
and work in the industry. Again, I really enjoy going back and kind of getting into the mix and

60
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,290
working at the co-face. So I'm just doing that at the moment, building a bit of a team there

61
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,770
and really enjoying it actually. It's great. I have a question I want to get to, but now

62
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:23,090
I have more questions. It's fun. So are you a, is your role quality coach or part quality coach

63
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,210
at culture amp? I am. I guess the quality coach of quality coaches, I mean, the official title

64
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,610
is director of quality engineering, but the really, the, the, the actual thing is how,

65
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,610
how can we transition to a quality coach model? Okay. Quality coach quality.

66
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,310
Unity are a customer of culture amp, by the way.

67
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,390
Yay. I know. Yes. Yes. Cause we look at all the stats.

68
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,150
So I just for, uh, and again, this is not a dig on Microsoft as I usually do, but, uh, there comes

69
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:59,390
a point in the size of a company where it's just cheaper to build your own than pay a license for

70
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:06,750
200,000 people. So I for, oh, a quick culture amp is the equivalent Brent of MS poll. Gotcha.

71
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:11,550
Companies our size actually outsourced that to companies that can give us a lot,

72
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,390
make us work a lot better for us. So anyway, very cool. Um, I think there was a time,

73
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,630
you know, I don't know how long you've been listening, but, uh, Brent and I just for context,

74
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,030
uh, we started talking this podcast maybe seven years ago, eight years ago,

75
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,870
almost eight years ago now. And it was really because we were seeing a lot of changes

76
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:37,230
happening in testing. We were seeing teams move to using, and of course, agile has been around

77
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:41,470
a lot longer than eight years teams were moving in directions where they needed fewer testers and

78
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,990
sometimes choosing not to have testers sometimes executing that very well and sometimes very poorly.

79
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,630
And we paid attention to why and what worked. And really, we were just trying to talk about

80
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:58,670
the changes so that the testers listened to our podcast could understand what may be coming their

81
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:04,910
way. And along the way, you know, I moved, well, I guess the first time that maybe I was in any

82
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,110
role, you could call a quality coach, like maybe it was a science project after Xbox where we

83
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,950
didn't have any testers on the team. I didn't think of myself as a quality coach at that time.

84
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:22,190
I just helped developers learn how to test. And then I did it again on another team and

85
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,230
then did it again at unity and thought, wait a minute, this is a thing. And it maybe wasn't

86
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:33,810
until unity, I started at unity, I reread agile testing and all this stuff I thought I had

87
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,570
figured out on my own. I realized that Janet and Lisa had written about several years before.

88
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:44,050
It's kind of like modern testing. It's a given a name to something people, a lot of people

89
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:48,610
were already doing. It's not that modern, not really about testing. It was the same thing

90
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,730
reading that book. And when they talked about, I care about the exact text in my copies right

91
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,090
over there, I won't pull it out. Obviously, I'm not as prepared as I should be. But

92
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:04,530
they talked about the role of the test manager is to run a community, highly paraphrased,

93
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,530
but pretty close community was the word. And that was a big insight for me. And then

94
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:14,770
a lot of what I did for my first team at unity was I came in as a director of QA.

95
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,570
And I had a lot of embedded folks, your typical matrix organization,

96
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:27,410
QA reported to me, but they were embedded in teams. And often, as unfortunately happens in

97
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,730
some agile teams and many of the teams, they're responsible for all the testing on the team,

98
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:37,730
which isn't a great way to do agile testing, as we know on this call. So I ended up coaching

99
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:43,730
in two ways. I coach the testers on how to coach quality on the teams they work with.

100
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:51,810
But I also coach the developers, the dev leads they worked with on how to work with them in a new way.

101
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,690
And eventually, eventually, I moved all of them onto those teams directly, I didn't have a team

102
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,650
anymore. And so I, which, as Brent knows, I've worked myself out of jobs before. And I usually

103
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,770
recover pretty well, I found other things to do. They've always involved quality coaching,

104
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,270
to some extent, now I do a bunch of more stuff as well. So, and somewhere in there,

105
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,630
we started talking about quality coaching on the podcast, it's a thing. But what's interesting is

106
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,470
we talk about it like just sort of abstractly, but then it's not because we mentioned it at all.

107
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:28,750
You know, serendipitously, at the same time, there were quality coaches spinning up all over

108
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,590
the globe, you know, you're not the only one, there's plenty of people doing it, I think you

109
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:38,990
write the most about it. And I will put your blog site into your website into the show notes,

110
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,230
but you've written a lot about different aspects of quality coaching. As far as I know,

111
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:50,110
you've thought more about the role and the needs of quality coaching more than anybody has, you

112
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,790
know, way more than Brent and I have. And maybe there's somebody else out there haven't heard of

113
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,510
yet, but you've done a lot. But you hinted at this before, what I'm curious is some more

114
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:04,110
specifics, like how did you, like, what was that transition like? Was it gradual? Was it all of a

115
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,950
sudden? Was there a eureka moment? How did you go from caring about quality and managing test teams

116
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:16,030
to moving to becoming a quality coach? And like, great question. Yeah, look, yeah. Well, you know,

117
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:20,190
I think, I think this is, you've touched on so many things I want to address here.

118
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,590
The first thing is, it is absolutely an evolution. I don't think, you know, unless you come from a

119
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:34,110
marketing aspect or as in your consulting firm that wants to name something, you come in,

120
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,830
you evolve because you're learning and growing as the organizations are learning and growing

121
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:44,670
and changing and evolving. And you're adapting to what's going on in your local context.

122
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:50,270
You raise your head above the kind of, you know, the fence, and then you suddenly realize that,

123
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:55,310
oh, hang on, this is happening in other places. And then you start kind of going, oh, this is

124
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,230
a thing. This is where we're heading, right? So I think for me, it sort of felt right. I didn't

125
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:08,590
go in when I was working in 2014, I was working with this company, and I didn't go in thinking,

126
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,550
we're going to go and have this quality assistance model, whatever. And at that time, you know,

127
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:19,470
2014, Atlassian, who was just down the road in Sydney, they had started this quality assistance

128
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:26,750
model in 2010 with Andrew Prentice. And to be honest, I hadn't really tweaked anything on that.

129
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:32,030
And it wasn't really like, oh, look, what's Andrew's doing in Atlassian, let me copy that. It was more

130
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:38,750
like, I want to go in, here's an opportunity to go in and really, you know, influence quality

131
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:46,210
within a rapidly growing tech company. And what an opportunity. And I went in, and actually,

132
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:52,210
the first thing I did was put testers into all of the teams. It wasn't necessarily like,

133
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,570
oh, everyone's going to start as quality coaches. But as it evolved, and I'm sure you've, this has

134
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:03,730
happened to you too, as it evolves, you're going, you know what, in the teams that it's really,

135
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,610
really working, the quality coaches are coming, like the testers are coming up to me and going,

136
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,610
I don't know what to do anymore. My team's kind of, you know, really seems to be working without

137
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:23,630
me. What do I do now? And I was like, Gestalt moment. Ah, so this is what Andrew is doing

138
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:30,830
down the road in quality assistance, you know, kaching. And I think that's sort of,

139
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:37,150
personally, that's how it evolved for me. I don't, you know, I had this vision that every tester was

140
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:43,790
a test lead. But now I think, well, that actually is, you know, you know, that's where it evolves.

141
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:49,310
It evolves into a quality coach. And I think the other thing is, is that you start realizing

142
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:55,470
that quality, you happen up the way we deploy software and we deliver means that we can think

143
00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,950
about quality beyond testing, right? And I think there's opportunities now, which maybe we hadn't

144
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,430
before, that we can start thinking about early on, you know, what is it? How do we know if we're

145
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,430
building the right product, you know, and of course, in monitoring. And I know you've done a

146
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:17,870
lot of work in this space, Alan, it's just that monitoring and analytics and feeding that

147
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:27,310
information into your quality strategy, you know, I think these things, you know, liberating yourself

148
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,110
away from focusing only on testing means that you can start thinking about these other problems,

149
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,070
which are really, really important. And you can honestly sometimes argue maybe more important,

150
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:45,740
you know. So I think I think it's a really exciting future. And, you know, I'm all about

151
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,340
having opportunity and growth. As I said, growth is really important for me. So I want to create

152
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:56,460
spaces where quality professionals who are passionate about testing or passionate about

153
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,580
quality can actually see and say, I've got a future, you know, I've got a part to play

154
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:09,180
in how software is delivered. So, you know, that's what drives me. Yeah. So there was one other bit

155
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:15,020
I wanted to address. It'll come back. I'm sure Brent is giddy over there because he loves what

156
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:21,740
you're saying. So I'm going to give him a chance to comment. I love the phrase you just mentioned

157
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:31,490
around liberating from, I'm going to screw it up, but you said liberating from mostly testing

158
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:39,090
or something testing. Right. I will say that is exactly how I felt when I went through the

159
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:48,590
transition, right? The James Whitaker, one of his, so he's very clever with his like one-liner

160
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:56,190
shots that get the point across. And I remember one of the things he said to me over lunch and

161
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:01,470
eventually became a blog post, which is all this testing is getting in the way of quality.

162
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:11,630
And for those of us that have a passion around quality, I'm no longer in a testing role. I'm not

163
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:21,040
in a test coach role, but I run a data science team that's very much concerned about the customer.

164
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,920
And there's no way to separate any sort of analysis around the customer from

165
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,720
the quality of their experience and the quality of them engaging with the products that you build

166
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,880
and support. Yeah, there is a ton I loved in what you were saying there. The one thing that I did

167
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:54,580
write down though, so you mentioned 2010 that I don't remember. I remember, so when Alan was

168
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:03,060
telling his story, like I remember those days very well, right? Alan and like me at Microsoft,

169
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:11,620
we were kind of risk adverse. I had by that time already gone through the transition.

170
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:18,580
I was one of the earlier folks within Microsoft to go through it. And I'm like, oh my God,

171
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:24,980
not only is the grass greener, the water is nice and cozy warm and they have bubbles and unicorns.

172
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:36,530
But I remember Alan going through it and part of it, I saw him kind of evoking on trust and another

173
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:42,610
part on instinct. Like Alan, you were absolutely doing the quality coaching role before you had

174
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:49,410
named it, right? So what Alan had, I would say Alan had realized at that point in time

175
00:17:49,410 --> 00:18:01,020
was how much what we called testing was a bottleneck. And he worked particularly on the team's team.

176
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,580
He had the opportunity to start that effort from the ground and he was like,

177
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,360
now we're going to minimize the amount of actual testing that comes to this. He was doing stuff

178
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,880
that would be the guidance of Accelerate today, I think, even before it happened. But we were

179
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:26,110
climbing up that hill. It was definitely a steep hill climb. Like the things that we were saying,

180
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:32,990
the things that we were doing, the things that we were advising was absolutely contradictory to

181
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,950
the well-known knowledge and key breaking. I think it was difficult within the inertia of

182
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:46,910
Big Core. It was not only that, but we were basically saying, hey, as long as it's not

183
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:57,550
ripping the tourniquet off, transitioning to a world where QA is dedicated testers is what I'll call it.

184
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:03,070
Testing still needs to exist, but the world where dedicated testers is not only smaller,

185
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:09,070
but significantly smaller, not only will not harm the company, we'll probably improve it.

186
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,990
But that was not a popular...

187
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,350
Are you going somewhere, Brett?

188
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:21,840
I'm long-windedly going back to a question to Ann Marie. We had an uphill climb. We learned a bunch

189
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,880
of things around how people are going to push back and what they're afraid of and things like that.

190
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,000
Your 2010 story sounded a little different, that it wasn't a controversial transition.

191
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:48,860
Yeah, so I started in 2014. To me, it was an evolution. I think there's an interesting

192
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:56,780
thing about a lot of this work, which I have observed. One is, if you work with a company

193
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:04,140
that has an entrenched culture of quality, these sorts of things are easy. They just evolve,

194
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,540
because the engineers are passionate. Everyone agrees that testing is important.

195
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,700
It's not a conversation difficult. When I went into the place I was working,

196
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,740
they actually... It was an XP house. Everyone was doing TDD pair programming.

197
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:29,020
The first thing that they would do was think about, how do I test this? You would walk any

198
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,820
morning, you'd walk into the organization, and that was the word on engineers' lips.

199
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:43,020
Now, when you're in that culture and environment, moving to a quality coach model is not that hard,

200
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:48,940
because you've got this culture of engineers already doing that type of work. The challenge

201
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:55,340
is when you go into organizations that have engineers who don't do software testing,

202
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:01,820
who don't necessarily think or understand or have not been coached on how to think about quality and

203
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:07,490
how to build quality in. That's a lot, lot harder, because what you're doing there is,

204
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:13,810
you're, as sort of alluded to, you're training two people there in the team. You're training

205
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:20,530
the QA or the tester to become a quality coach, but you're also educating the team

206
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:27,410
how to think about and how to kind of care about... Not care about, because they do care

207
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:31,410
about quality, but it's just a different form. They have to think about all these other things

208
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,250
that they're not aware of, and they make assumptions about what testing is and,

209
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:46,370
oh, it's just three unit tests per function, and I'm done. Yay, let's ship. You've got to help them

210
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,010
grow and mature in what quality is, and I think that's a completely different ballgame.

211
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,010
And I say this to people as well, because other things that you need to consider is,

212
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:08,050
are you a tech company or are you a large entrenched bank that, where you've had 400

213
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:15,070
testers outsourced in India? Those are completely different challenges to deal with

214
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:23,390
if you want to move to a quality assistance model. So I think, again, it's that sort of,

215
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:30,590
think about what you're trying to achieve. Think about, is the quality coach model right for me?

216
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:38,030
Maybe, just maybe having software testers is the better approach because of all the different

217
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:44,110
things about your belief, the cultural system, the belief system of the organization and things

218
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,750
like that. We don't want to wedge a blueprint. A lot of teams in the early stages of this

219
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,310
randomly followed a blueprint. They said, oh, when we do Agile, we don't need test

220
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,550
testers anymore. You're all fired, which was dumb for obvious reasons. And it's, when we talk about

221
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,550
our principle number seven, all we're saying is that not that we shouldn't have testers.

222
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:08,350
The principle seven says something like, our quality may get so good, we may not need a

223
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,630
dedicated tester anymore. Kind of like your story, like, I don't know what to do anymore.

224
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,910
It's not, it's the other way around. You don't remove the testers to improve quality. Quality

225
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,910
may get so good that you don't need that dedicated tester there, or they can work across

226
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:26,430
multiple teams or they can do other stuff. When I dissolve these QA orgs, I find new jobs for them

227
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,590
because they're, these are very versatile people. Anecdotally aligned, I probably shared

228
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,750
half a dozen times on the podcast already, but in one of my quality coach roles at Unity,

229
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:41,230
VP would ask me, how is, how is, because didn't have a dedicated testers, he'd ask,

230
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,990
how is the team doing a testing? And I would say they do all the testing they know how to do,

231
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,430
which is good. And you know, you too know what I mean by that. They, they,

232
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,990
it's the kind of sentence you wanted. Yeah. You do to push to say, just go away. Everything's fine. Go

233
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:03,070
away. Leave me alone. They know how to do this much testing. I'm holding, I'm holding up my fingers

234
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:10,510
about three inches apart, but I'm working so they know two feet of testing. Yeah, nice.

235
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:18,430
Essentially saying that now it's point of view, the dev team or the teams involved are meeting his

236
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:25,070
expectations. So no one's going to get punished today. They know, they just, there's unconscious

237
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,790
ignorance and how much testing they think they need to do. They just need more training.

238
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:38,750
Yeah. When I do it, I basically say, you know, when, when can we move to this quality assistance

239
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,310
model? I said, when your engineers are ready, this is really not got a lot to do with the

240
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:48,350
quality coaches. This is about the team being ready and how, how do you know the team's ready?

241
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:52,990
Those are the interesting questions you should be asking, not about the QA, whether, you know,

242
00:24:52,990 --> 00:25:00,990
what the QA is doing. I have, I have a relevant question on that topic. So let's say the business,

243
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:08,430
the, the, the business leadership realizes that they need this model, right? And, and there's

244
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:14,190
a lot of benefits to going with this model above sort of the traditional models in the engineering

245
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:23,900
team is not ready. How do, what, what advice do you give for someone that's either a tester now or

246
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:31,660
a blossoming quality coach? Like how can they help to make the engineering team

247
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,860
ready? What are your thoughts? Oh goodness. Like it's always a people problem.

248
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:45,420
It's always a people problem. Yeah. Nope. I know. Yeah. But I think, I think, look, there's, there's,

249
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:52,220
I hate using the word having credibility and trust, you know, because yes, these are things

250
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:59,020
are really, really important, but it also suggests that, you know, the engineer and the team is ready

251
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:05,340
to engage, you know, there's nothing harder than trying to build credibility and trust when you've

252
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:11,100
got a team that's not willing to, to meet you that way. Now these things are relationship things.

253
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:17,100
They're not, you know, you've got to have both ways. So I think, yes, well, credibility and trust

254
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:25,100
is really, really important. For me, the go-to is those CTO, the VPs, and to basically start

255
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:32,220
mandating or making this, this is what we value and this is really important. I think it's really

256
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:38,140
unfair to put all that work on a quality coach to come and change an organization, to change the

257
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:46,620
culture of an organization without having that senior kind of top-down mandate. So I kind of

258
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:53,340
think that's the first place I go to is like, you know, are you prepared to, you know, walk the

259
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:00,780
walk on this and come and say what you need to say when it needs to be said? So I think I ask

260
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:08,140
for that. To me, the engineers, and you kind of alluded this to this, Alan, it's, you know,

261
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:15,100
going to the tech lead. That's the equivalent, right? It's like, who on the team do I need to influence

262
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:21,100
to drive the change? And, you know, sometimes the quality coach can do that if they've got the

263
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:27,180
confidence maturity, but sometimes that's, they're not ready for that. And, you know, that means

264
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:36,380
that you've got to kind of step in a bit and create that space within the team for that person

265
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,340
to come in and start making changes. So that's your role as a senior quality coach or a director

266
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,900
is to do that. And, you know, yeah, I just think you've got to be really careful if you're a

267
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,780
quality analyst or a software tester, maybe you've got five years experience under your belt.

268
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:00,860
It's like, make sure you get the support from that around you to make sure that you're successful

269
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:06,780
and sure that the team is successful. Yeah. I'm going to build on that a little bit. So much of it

270
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,180
in its can't hire quality coach, someone to a quality coach role out of university.

271
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,780
Not just the technical skills, but you need to have some knowledge, but some there's leadership

272
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:23,740
attributes that are needed. And there's this book by Maxwell. What's his first name? It doesn't

273
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:29,420
matter. Five levels of leadership. He talks about if you first you're put in a position of leadership

274
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:35,580
and this is the CTO or the VP, whoever saying we care about quality and Anne Marie, you're going

275
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,580
to help us with this. Now you're in a permission. You have, you're in a position of quality,

276
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:44,540
but the next thing you do, and that gives you a start, but you're still the trust and credibility.

277
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:52,000
The next level of actual has is people have to give you permission to lead them. And you,

278
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,100
that's where the trust and credibility come in. Just, it's just like having those conversations

279
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,420
or are feeling more piloting things or seeing what works, having different ways to do things. And

280
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:09,220
the Weinberg books on becoming a technical leader or secrets of consulting have all kinds of anecdotes

281
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,060
that have helped me get some of those communication aspects across. But, and then the next,

282
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,500
I'm not going to give a book report on the five levels of leadership, but once they have permission

283
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,580
to lead them, then it's about achieving results together with them. And then these things all build

284
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,260
on each other and they, and they're excited about that. But yeah, you do need that permission first.

285
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,180
And that's what your story reminded me of. And by the way, Brad, thanks for kind of jumping ahead

286
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,540
to almost the fourth question in my list, which I gave you before I got to the third question.

287
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:39,540
Well done there. Where'd you get that idea from, dude?

288
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:50,300
It is your questions I view as guidance. No, no, I was just thinking as

289
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,980
Anne-Marie was answering on my last question, I was actually reminded of the way I've done it in the

290
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:05,540
past has helped motivate. And it's very aligned with this. You need, you need, I think you need

291
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:13,300
executive support. Minimum, you need the support that says, Hey, I'm going to, I'm going to do

292
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,940
something. Your engineering team, if you want to do this transition, I'm going to do something.

293
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:24,500
Your engineering team is probably going to, has a potential of freaking out. At best,

294
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:30,960
you need to support me. At worst, you need to be a no op on this topic because you got to,

295
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:43,310
part of it is people fear change. And some folks fear change so much, they're not even worth

296
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:51,070
willing to try. Now it doesn't like you, you going into a test job where you start off and

297
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:59,390
everyone's already doing TDD. I mean, yeah, that's, that sounds wonderful. I never experienced that

298
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:05,550
while I still held a test management position, but I'm like looking back on it now, I'm like,

299
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:12,750
Oh, that would be fantastic. It was. Yeah. But now I'm thinking about in terms of the other question,

300
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:18,430
and I don't know how many companies still have this, right? I think, so first off, I assume it

301
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:24,590
to be true that you would absolutely dispute the statement that devs cannot test their own code.

302
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:25,790
Yeah. Okay.

303
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,910
I'm sorry. I didn't know if you actually wanted me to ask that.

304
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:40,640
No, no, no. I was assuming that. I'm assuming that. Yeah. So in this case, then that role becomes a lot

305
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,680
easier. It's around, it's around in my view. Okay. How do we do the most amount of testing we can

306
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:58,400
to deliver the most amount of quality? And it kind of goes back to my trapeze metaphor, right? It's,

307
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:04,080
it's essentially, Hey, I don't know if you've heard this metaphor and Marie, it's essentially,

308
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,920
in my view, test team kind of acts as that safety net at the bottom of the tramp, the trapeze. And

309
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,320
a lot of the times when we tell the engineering teams that, Hey, test is going away. They respond

310
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,220
literally like, Oh, you're taking my safety net away. Right. And what you see that their behavior

311
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,820
up on the tramp, that the, the trapeze has been sloppy. They fall down all the time.

312
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,860
And yeah, you look at them. Of course I know why you're afraid because now the safety nets,

313
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:44,750
no longer the one accountable to keeping you alive. It's you. Of course, the solution to that

314
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,860
is to train them up so that they're confident, incompetent again at the top of that trap.

315
00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:00,240
That the, what the hell is that thing called? Not the trapeze. The, yeah. The thin wire.

316
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:12,240
Thank you. When, and so yeah, if you, if you, I'll just keep the metaphor alive. Why not?

317
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:22,700
So if you join a circus and, and, uh, your trapeze, uh, artists are already well conditioned and,

318
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,780
you know, the safety net is not a requirement. It's a value add. Yeah. Helping to improve their

319
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:37,580
skills and become better artists on that front is a lot, lot easier. And what I found is that they,

320
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:44,370
it's far more fulfilling. I don't, at least for those individuals, they feel like they are doing

321
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:51,900
more things and I don't know. I'm done talking on that one. All right. I'll just jump in. I think

322
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:57,580
there's a valid points there. Absolutely. Like when you've got engineers who are just like,

323
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:04,300
I just want to, you know, teach me how to test like, okay, you know, that's, that's such an easy,

324
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,820
I have, you know, um, and I think there's always places to improve. So the things that we did

325
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:19,340
in that organization was we ripped away, we ripped apart the poor testing frameworks that existed.

326
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:25,820
So there was a heavy dependency on, um, I can't remember the framework now, but, but it was like

327
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:34,540
these heavy end to end tests that just took forever to run and maintain and fitness.

328
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,500
Oh, I remember that one.

329
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:42,190
And we ripped. I ripped it out. I like, and I, I spoke to the other engine, you know,

330
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,110
the C the engineers and I was like, you did senior, the engineering managers. I'm like,

331
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:51,470
look, I'm really concerned about this framework. There's only, it only does like really 30 to 40%

332
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:56,590
coverage of the system. And everyone's thinking that this is their safety net. What are we going

333
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:02,110
to do about this? So, um, you know, the conclusion that we have was that let's just rip it out

334
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:06,830
because you know, we'll retire it and look like the worst comes to the worst. We can always

335
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,870
restore it. You know, it's all the other world, but psychologically we wanted to remove that

336
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:17,150
safety net. So there's always rooms for improvement and that did create a lot of fear and anxiety

337
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:25,310
for some people. So I think, you know, um, uh, I think that was, um, even in some organizations,

338
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:30,430
you still have to rip parts of, but there's always a bit of a safety net somewhere that you have to

339
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:36,030
kind of challenge and ask questions about, you know, where is the risk in this? And it was great

340
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:41,950
because it led to a conversation about what is risk retiring tests, the concept of, you know,

341
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:46,910
we can actually, you know, there's a retiring date for tests and we don't, you know, are you

342
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,190
thinking about that as part of your estimation that, you know, you're removing tests as well,

343
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:58,350
you know, so it led to some really interesting conversations. Um, going back to the thing about

344
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:03,870
sort of changing, say you don't have an organization or you don't have a team that's like that. Um,

345
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:10,750
I had a great, um, actually a quality, quality coach taught me this, which was, um, the ad car

346
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:17,310
model. So Divya Kaner was someone who was working and she really, um, suggested, you know, this, this

347
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:23,070
change management consulting approach, which is, you know, ad car, which I think is awareness,

348
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:29,010
give people awareness. So you telling people the why, why do we need this change? Why do we need

349
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:33,570
to do so? Why do you need to do software testing? Why do you need to get that? You know, all those

350
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:40,050
sorts of things. And then once you've got that, then you start looking at desire. So how do we

351
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:46,850
actually gain, you know, how do we help people want to do those things? Right. And one is only

352
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:52,210
once you've got those two, then you start looking at knowledge and skill, right? Then you can start

353
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:57,250
building up on what is, you know, what do they need to know? Um, what are the skills they need

354
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:04,050
to acquire? And then the last thing is, um, I think it's R which is repeat, you know, so you just

355
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,970
basically got this thing. You've got to keep going and saying it again and again and repeating

356
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:14,290
that cycle because just going through it once isn't enough. So that was a big, awful, like,

357
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:19,410
moment for me. I was like, Oh, this is great. Cause cause I tend to jump into the kind of

358
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,490
just going straight into the knowledge of the skill that this is what you need to know.

359
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,130
And I forget that I haven't taken people on this journey, which they have not been on

360
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:34,130
themselves. So that was a big way back when I created the, uh, the, the quality culture

361
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:38,690
transition guide exercise, I was given what is a quality culture? I'm going to go define this.

362
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:44,210
I just given a talk on it. And one of the things I took from my talk and built into that was the

363
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,050
add car model. Cause I thought it fit really well into try and get teams to adopt a quality

364
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:53,090
culture that to be aware of what's important, then they have to have, they have to want to do

365
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,170
it. And then they need the knowledge and the skills or ability and the reinforcement.

366
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:03,330
I want to tell two quick stories to build on that and then to segue into another question

367
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:08,770
for you. So, uh, we're talking about developers testing. And one of the things I've discovered

368
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:15,010
is that oftentimes like a developer has been told in a lot of organizations that they can't

369
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:20,370
test as well as testers. And I've of course discovered that not to be true in many cases.

370
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:25,570
So I think in some cases they just need permission to test. And you talked about getting rid of a

371
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:32,930
framework in, I've been in situations time and time again, where by giving the developers

372
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:38,210
ownership over the framework and the tests versus it being a black box somewhere else,

373
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:45,460
they end up doing some really cool innovation on top of that. Plenty of examples, but one I wanted

374
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,740
to, what was the one I wanted to share with, for example, on X-Box, uh, we built the test,

375
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,620
a test system. So it's funny, I'm, I've associated with testing, but I actually haven't done

376
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:03,780
day-to-day testing in a long, long time. I've worked a lot on platforms that enable testing

377
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,860
tested. I've worked a lot on infrastructure and thought a lot about how teams do testing

378
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:13,060
in our test distribution system. We made it so anyone could plug in their X-Box to the system

379
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:19,540
or X-Box is in their office and run their tests there. And people, uh, built stress frameworks

380
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,940
on top of that for test distribution, or they would make their own little mini performance lab

381
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:30,100
outside of the lab. So I've had other places where given developers ownership over the framework,

382
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:37,330
they fixed long standing bugs at the test team or the test infra team had no idea how to fix

383
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:41,490
because it just seemed obvious to them, or in learning how to write tests, they've learned how

384
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:48,130
to be much more, uh, to write much more testable code. Uh, one time I did a little mini one day

385
00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:54,930
bug bug hunt back on teams at the encouragement of our VP. And normally I don't like those things,

386
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,490
but I gave teams some guidelines of kinds of things to look for. I think I gave them

387
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:06,050
Elizabeth Hendrickson's heuristic cheat sheet, and I was blown away over some of the bugs they found.

388
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:11,650
Like they dug in deep and found security bugs that I could not find. And I'm not a great

389
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,850
security tester, but you know, I'm supposed to be the expert here and they're like,

390
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,570
oh my God. So again, I've been blown away. So the question I have for you is,

391
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:25,010
as you've been doing this quality coaching, what's an example of a one or two things that

392
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,050
have surprised you or you think it would be surprising to listeners?

393
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,970
Look, the first one that comes to mind, and I think this is around data, you know,

394
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:43,570
and the constant problem of how do you have, um, test data that you can actually create on the

395
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:51,730
fly or, you know, that doesn't slow down your test automation. I think, um, we were, we were, um,

396
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:57,970
in one organization, we were doing, um, a lot of exploratory testing. So one of the things we were

397
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:03,490
doing was having the testers do exploratory testing, but also encouraging the engineers

398
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:09,440
to think about exploratory testing and, and, and to kind of spread their wings in that area.

399
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,880
And one of them came up with this idea of using the API to create test data. Now this was, you know,

400
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,920
like quite a while ago, this was quite a kind of, you know, whereas it might be quite common now.

401
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,240
I think that sort of concept of actually using the API to actually create the test data that

402
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,480
you need in order to do your testing. Um, because we wanted to get the system to certain states. And

403
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,080
so they just came up with this, this idea of doing that. So that was really, really neat. And then

404
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:46,160
they developed a little interface for the testers at the time. So the testers could just, you know,

405
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,720
jump in and just add sort of lots of data into the system. So that was really neat. Now that's

406
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:57,440
probably the one that comes most to mind. I'm actually interested. I don't know if it's a

407
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:05,680
segue and Alan, you can shoot me down, but so recently we've been having a discussion around

408
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,280
a difference between a quality coach and an agile coach and whether or not those might eventually

409
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,710
merge. So I had this question, somebody asked me about the quality coach and then they said,

410
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:22,830
and I said, well, it's kind of, you know, what is a quality coach? And they were in engineering

411
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:28,990
and I was, I'm saying, well, it's a bit like, you know, having an agile coach in the team. And they

412
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:32,590
said, well, we used to have those and then we got rid of them. So does that mean the coach coach

413
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:38,110
role is retiring too? You know, so I don't know if, uh, I don't know where I'm going with this one,

414
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:44,350
but, um, you know, I just think that, you know, agile coach, I don't know, it's certain parts of

415
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:50,590
the community isn't regarded as a role anymore in organizations. It's like we, we now everyone

416
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:58,750
knows agile. We don't necessarily need an agile coach. Um, my take on that, um, before I go and

417
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:09,550
actually answer the question you asked, she takes right in here, um, is yeah, yeah. Is, um, that,

418
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,630
you know, you need, there's different types of coaching. There's coaching, you know, if you,

419
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,270
you know, do that movie, the mighty docs or whatever it was where they take the worst team

420
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:24,110
ever. And you know, they end up winning the league because, you know, you've had this coach who's

421
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:29,070
instilled belief and confidence and they get to the point where they just, they're so unified

422
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:34,190
that they're actually, you know, they win the tournament. There's that type of coaching,

423
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,190
but there's also, you know, when people are in the premier league and football,

424
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:43,790
they don't stop having coaches. You know, it's just that the coach does a different role. It's

425
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:49,870
a different, it's more of a peer to peer thing. It's more about how we, how can we sustain quality

426
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:56,510
rather than, you know, um, get to a, get to an end state, if that makes sense. And as you know,

427
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:01,310
yourself, quality never never changed, you know, the quality is never, never static. We're always,

428
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:07,710
you know, constantly changing our views about what quality is, what we think quality was five years

429
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:12,670
ago, we're, we're changing our minds about that. I mean, even if you look about quality as, you

430
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,430
know, you can think about service and SaaS problems and that concept of consistently

431
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:26,270
providing support, ongoing support, um, you know, it's much more about a service rather than,

432
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:31,870
you know, something that you just deliver on a floppy disk. So our concepts of what we value

433
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:37,230
in software have changed. And I think for that reason, quality coaches in some form,

434
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,310
maybe they won't be called quality coaches, they'll be called something else, but,

435
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,310
but that role is always going to be there. Um, yeah.

436
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:50,510
If I, if I may piggyback on what you're just saying, I like what you said and you brought up

437
00:44:51,070 --> 00:45:00,110
agile coaches. So years ago, Alan and I did one of our worst podcasts. Uh, we did a podcast slash

438
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:06,260
presentation in the office, live at real estate. Come on. Yeah. Yeah.

439
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:13,540
I'm going to get one. It was an interest. It was absolutely an interesting idea.

440
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,420
The thing is agile because we're experiment. We're adaptive. We're experimenting and learning from our

441
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,420
experience. Absolutely. Yes, we did. And one of the things, what I remember is that's, that was

442
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:34,260
kind of the last time that I consciously remember telling a team to go hire an agile coach. Like

443
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:41,380
it's been a long time since I've advised that because Anne Marie's right. Everyone kind of knows

444
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:49,220
now this quality coach thing, like it's a new concept, but it's ish. I mean, it's been around

445
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:56,900
for a while, but it's now gaining more and more adoption. And it's kind of what the, in my view,

446
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:03,870
what testers have an opportunity to grow into. It's about scaling out. So the way I interpret

447
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:09,470
what Anne Marie just said is around first off, coaches will start off and they're coaching at

448
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:16,510
the tactical level. This is how you think about BVTs. This is how you think about exploratory testing.

449
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:24,510
Now you have to do versus coaching professional adults. So this is why I'm in the, the metaphor

450
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:32,510
that has to be mentioned before go any farther that this is why Ted Lasso is such a great coach

451
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:38,700
for Richmond, F C Brett, Brett's never seen. Yeah. I still have no idea what I'm talking about.

452
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:45,420
Tessa, I'm such a big Ted Lasso fan. I, you know, I just love this. Yeah.

453
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,100
Comment on this topic on coaching until you have watched every episode of Ted Lasso. And that's

454
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,420
my statement, but I'll let you finish anyway, but you can't mention the word coach again until

455
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:05,710
you've watched it. How are you going to get out of that one, Brett? Yeah. So the role that I am

456
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:14,830
banned, the, the, the redacted role starts off tactical. And then I think as it moves forward,

457
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:20,430
as the tactics are, are expected and the tactics are well broadened throughout the teams,

458
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,150
right? It makes sense that the role then becomes more strategic.

459
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:30,110
I don't think NFL coaches for, I mean, in some guards they might, but I don't think NFL coaches

460
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:35,710
are, are, you know, teaching people how to tackle correctly. They, they opera operate on that

461
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:42,430
assumption. Now what they're trying to do is execute higher level strategies and make the strategy

462
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:53,980
of, of, of a high quality. I do think, and I do think that, that well, well defines my career.

463
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,580
I think it defines Alan's career. I think it very much is in alignment with how you described yours.

464
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,620
Yeah. I think, I think it's like, you know, when I think about some of the things that I'm working

465
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:11,980
on, for example, right now, onboarding, like onboarding engineers and how do we know that

466
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:17,740
everyone has the same understanding of what their role is in software testing and do they understand

467
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,940
that software testing is part of their, you know, remit and are they comfortable doing software

468
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:28,140
testing? Do they need additional support? So we're looking at sort of the first three months of

469
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:35,120
having this sort of like Academy type things to make sure that everyone is comfortable and

470
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,200
confident, you know, in doing these activities. So I think, you know, you start thinking about

471
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,760
sort of strategies and plans for the future, you know, to make sure that everything you're, you're

472
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,600
preventing situation, uncomfortable situations occurring. So those are the sorts of things I work

473
00:48:51,600 --> 00:49:00,000
on too. No, it's, and I think it's important, right? If you recognize it, that fear is potentially a big

474
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,520
thing in there, you got to make things feel safer. So I agree with that strategy, at least the way I

475
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:18,130
understand it. Do you ever back off or do you go or do you keep moving forward just finding some new

476
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:28,050
way? I twist it even harder. I don't imagine you do that. You're not crying, I'm not winning.

477
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:40,220
Producer. Does it hurt yet? Yes. Look, that's a really interesting question. I think, yeah, I'm,

478
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:48,130
there's a limit. I tend to give people a lot of space to work things out. I mean, I try good,

479
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:53,090
I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but I try to think about how I like to be,

480
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:58,610
how I like to learn and how I like, I like to be given the space and the time and the autonomy

481
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:03,650
to learn myself. So I tend to think most people want to learn things. It's just that

482
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,650
they don't necessarily either have the skill or the confidence or the time or the permission,

483
00:50:09,650 --> 00:50:14,530
you know, to, to, to feel that they can do that. So I try and tackle those things rather than

484
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:20,530
actually looking at the person themselves and, and sort of forcing them into that situation.

485
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:26,160
I mean, you know, you think about it, it's all about them. Quality is the team responsibility.

486
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,680
So if I go in and sort of take that, that, that account, that, that responsibility away from them,

487
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,440
you kind of, to some degree, are, you're still kind of spoon-feeding them, you know?

488
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,800
Having said that, at some point you do have to kind of, you know, come in there and say no,

489
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:50,060
you know, I'm trying to figure out actually some ways of doing that, which are interesting,

490
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:58,540
but I have an experiment to add on them. Gotcha. No. So I do think, you know, sort of easing them

491
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:05,180
into it, the, the, what is it? Boil the frog or pull the band-aid. Like I think on some of

492
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:10,380
these things, boiling the frog is a more comfortable way of doing it. You'd slowly raise up the heat.

493
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,340
Of course, that metaphor kind of sucks because everyone knows the frog dies at the end.

494
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,260
Wait, the frog dies?

495
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:23,100
That's not really what happens in, yeah, Ellen. Yeah, Ellen, that's what happens.

496
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:26,060
How do you make frog soup without a dead frog?

497
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:31,660
I actually think that's a terrible, terrible metaphor for, for what?

498
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:42,220
No, it absolutely is. Because it's really, we're trying to, in my mind, we're trying to,

499
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:50,060
to bring them to the, the world of unicorn and rainbows and they, they're just afraid of it.

500
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,900
Right. There's a couple of things in that. One is who are you hiring? I mean,

501
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,860
this is one thing I say to the, to the engineering managers, are you talking about software testing

502
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:05,100
in your interviews? Are you actually asking them these questions when you're hiring engineers

503
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:10,380
about their ability to do software testing? Because I think that, that is where you nip that in the

504
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:16,380
bud. Right. I mean, you certainly, you're going to have different groups of people that have,

505
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,380
you know, you're going to have different types of challenges. For example, people who've been there

506
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:27,180
for, you know, 15 years, that's a different type of approach you want to someone who is joining the

507
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:35,180
organization and you want to have two different strategies. So stop, stop the problem right at

508
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:41,100
the start by actually making sure that everyone at least is willing to do software testing. They

509
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,580
might not have the capacity and they might not have the capability, but they're on board with

510
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:51,580
the whole concept. So that's, that's that I think. And then you can help them with that. I think

511
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:56,380
that's part of the quality coaching or the department of, of quality engineering is to

512
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:04,540
provide that support. I think that's on us. I think there's a different strategy

513
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:09,740
for people who have, you know, entrenched and really do not want to do software testing, I think.

514
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:15,820
And they don't see that as part of their role. They don't, they think that's a,

515
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:22,300
I guess, some sort of dint to their ego that they have to do software testing. And it's kind of,

516
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:27,500
you know, and to be fair, the majority of people these days have really shifted. It's kind of

517
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:36,290
like, that's, that's, I see less of that. I see more, I get questions. I have a lean coffee

518
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,490
every month where people come in and they can ask questions about quality within the organization.

519
00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:48,450
And the thing is most engineers are going, what is quality coaching when the organization,

520
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:54,050
I came from all the engineers at all the software testing. So how does this all hang together?

521
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:02,480
Like those are so, you know, like the certainly where in the tech industry and modern tech,

522
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,580
you're getting people who totally accept that this is how we should be doing.

523
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,740
Yeah. The bubble's moving. It's, it's moving and it's good to see.

524
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:22,020
No, and it occurred to me, it occurred to me like, so, and Marie was, was describing sort of the new

525
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:29,060
people in the industry and the old people in the industry. And it occurs to me, non-trivially

526
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:36,420
her solution, which is asked about testing at the interview is actually probably the solution to both.

527
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,100
Or to ask about quality as well, or maybe even instead.

528
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:46,560
That's right. Right. Right. Because, because what happens is as more and more of the,

529
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:51,600
the sort of the, the more comfortable people come in. And I've seen this over and over again,

530
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:58,160
either the old ones just go, Oh, this is a bunch of crap and I'm out of here. I can't stand this.

531
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:04,480
This is below. Well, fine. Problem solved in some regards. See, okay. Now we interviewed a new person

532
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:11,780
over time. What happens is the mix changes, the mix changes. And the, once the org is mostly

533
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,980
people who are comfortable with this, then the, the old guys, and I've seen this over and over

534
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,340
again, they, they, they pick it up and they realize it's not so bad because it's a, it's now more of

535
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:28,720
a peer pressure thing than, than an ego thing. Exactly. I actually learned this from, I don't

536
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,200
know, what's that, who was it? Google. What was it testing in the toilet? Like if you listen to

537
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:41,920
there, if you listen to that, that, that talk, it's about, and that's how they exactly, they

538
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:50,320
targeted the new people coming in, but also they had a different strategy for the, for the people

539
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:54,720
who there had been a long time and they realized exactly what you're saying, Brent, that, that once

540
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:02,320
you get to this kind of percentage, it becomes uncool to, to kind of have that, that, that, you

541
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:09,920
know, it's the hurt mentality, you know, and the culture at that point has shifted. So I think it's

542
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,730
a great way to, to drive change this man. I want to keep on talking for another hour, but I can't

543
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:23,650
because I got, I got to go somewhere, but Emery, it's been awesome having you here. So thank you

544
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:28,210
for your time and for this. I will put a link to your website and a link to your Twitter.

545
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:32,290
Anything else we should point to or anything else you want people to get in contact with you or

546
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:38,510
learn more about your stuff? Yeah, I guess, I guess, you know, at some points we are hiring

547
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:47,070
a culture. I guess my, I am doing my, yeah. And also, I guess I'm really excited about my quality

548
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:53,550
coaching book, which is a new SAS online subscription thing, a model I'm trying, which I'm, I have

549
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:59,390
never, I've been trying to write a book for about 15 years and I came to the conclusion a couple

550
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:05,390
of years ago that, that I was actually trying to push a model that didn't work for me. I love

551
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:12,510
writing. I really enjoy writing. It brings me huge pleasure. And this, this trying to deliver this book

552
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:17,950
was just taking the joy out of that. But I had all these good ideas that I was saving for the book,

553
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:22,830
you know, save it for the book. And because the book was taking so long, then these ideas started

554
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:27,950
becoming redundant because you know how it is, it just changed it so quickly. So I thought,

555
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:34,910
like, bug of this. I'm going to write the book in real time. And so I developed this concept of a,

556
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:39,630
of a quality coaching online book where basically I post something every month

557
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:44,830
and it's a subscription based. So yeah, yeah, really excited how that's moving. And,

558
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:51,630
yeah, come and join it. Subscribe. Every, all three of you listeners do that.

559
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:56,750
All right. Well, thanks again. Absolutely. Thank you. All the best. No, thank you for

560
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:02,910
offering to have me on it. Come back anytime. Hey, I want to talk about this. Just ping us.

561
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:09,390
Oh my gosh. Oh yeah. Absolutely. Okay. There we go. Yes.

562
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:12,670
Brant is once again forgetting that we're a podcast, not a YouTube app,

563
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:18,990
but showing the webpage, but I'll put a link to it. All right, everybody. Thank you again.

564
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:24,670
Thank you again, Anne-Marie. Yeah. Okay. All the best. Yeah. Take care. Have a,

565
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:29,950
have a great evening for you, I guess. All right. See you then. Thank you, Anne-Marie.

566
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:31,230
Bye. Thanks, Brant.
