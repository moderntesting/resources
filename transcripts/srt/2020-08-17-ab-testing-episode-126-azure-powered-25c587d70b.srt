00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,700
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show hey we're back for another

4
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:30,260
episode of I forgot what's this podcast called something Bart Bart

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:39,260
there's a thing ago when I first met Brent and I was sort of the chief of

6
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,300
staff for this test leadership meeting and Brent would show up there and I would

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:48,220
mess with his name just to see if he was paying attention he loved it he was

8
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:58,620
Brett Brent Burt Bobby Sue I don't know yeah it's it is a challenge to come up

9
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,260
with something uniquely insulted or insulting with with my first name well I

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,060
had a colleague in college by the way this is the AB testing podcast and I'm Alan

11
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,380
and he's some name starts with a B I went to college with a trumpet player named

12
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,940
Doug Burt last name B-E-R-G-T and it was so easy to call him his name was Doug

13
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,850
Burt little flippy flop bug dirt he did not like that name I don't think that's

14
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,790
like there's a lot worse names to call someone right apparently Donald is one

15
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,870
of them as an example yes that is a name that is like nobody's gonna be naming

16
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:47,750
their kids Donald anymore that's for sure no or Karen Donald and Karen those

17
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:55,110
names just aren't used anymore yeah yeah the the Karen meme whoo

18
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,390
certainly not in the next six months are we gonna see too many Karen's being born

19
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,590
I think yeah and I think if the Phoenix project takes off like it should no one

20
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,900
will name their kid Brent either because Brent is synonymous with bottleneck which

21
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,500
is weird because you're not but I'm afraid you're going to be overthrown by

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:24,660
the by the power of media again you you're saying I'm not because you mostly

23
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,660
talked to me right I mean if you should talk to my team I don't know that they

24
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,940
would agree with that statement a matter of fact actually that's one of my biggest

25
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,860
my team's grown in size and we got a bunch of new people on here and and

26
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,300
these are like green horns straight out of college and one of the things I am I

27
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,740
have a couple of them that really struggle with decision-making and

28
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,580
they're like oh well I had this really myopic decision can I set up an hour

29
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,660
meeting with you so we can go through it oh no no you can't no you cannot please

30
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,820
send me please send me a message and I'll look at it yeah what was I gonna say

31
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,740
oh a couple things that reminds me of the topic I wanted to talk about today

32
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,300
but there's I need context so we are live-streaming once again and once

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,350
again last-minute apologies I we were not going to live stream this one because we

34
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,230
hit we're going until about 15 minutes ago going to have a guest on the show

35
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,990
and I did not want to subject them to that madness however that changed I

36
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,230
won't give away the guest it's gonna be fantastic but they had to reschedule at

37
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,350
the last minutes just Brent and I and I think we came up with a pretty good

38
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:49,030
agenda on the fly as we usually do I am super excited about the guests but we are

39
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,710
live-streaming and it's last minute the next time we live stream I promise I

40
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:59,110
will try I promise that I will try to get an announcement up in our slack

41
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,900
group which you can join if it's called one of the three dot slack calm there's

42
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,460
an invitation link on the podcast website and probably the easiest way to

43
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,700
get there is to go to modern testing org where you can read the modern

44
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:20,580
testing principles and yeah yeah yeah so all that intro to episode 126 I believe

45
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:28,560
aside my calendar so the corona calendar bump as I call it was just beginning to

46
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,640
subside and then as I mentioned last time on the podcast my org is growing adding

47
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,310
some additional technical program managers not product managers Brent

48
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,790
program managers to my org also I have added so we merged a big parts of two

49
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,390
parts of unity together I have added additional DevOps engineers to my role

50
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,430
essentially doubling the size of that team I have expanded the size of my

51
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,510
documentation team that's about doubled as well and I've added a few other odds

52
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:09,630
and ends to my org in fact longtime listeners of the podcast will know that

53
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:17,910
four or five abt 343 ago I had Melissa Eden on the recording talking about what

54
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:24,030
she's doing at unity I originally hired her to work for me on my team when I was

55
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:30,330
director of QA for services and when I moved away she moved to another dev

56
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,990
director did some really great things and part of this reorg is I get her

57
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,190
back oh the long-term plan is there so Melissa so Melissa works for me again

58
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:43,190
she is already kicking butt super excited so my org is a little bigger and then

59
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:49,550
also because I manage the matrix and my boss came up with a good description for

60
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,550
what I do that I don't think I've shared before but it stuck with me I run the

61
00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:00,790
engineering operating system so if you think of engineering as an OS that it's

62
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,680
like all of the I make all the systems go Brent does not like that no no no no

63
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,920
if you're on the podcast you won't know this but Brent doesn't like that but it

64
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:17,560
but it actually makes sense what do you mean I don't like that you made a face

65
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,640
like I can tell when you're making a face because normally you're like this

66
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,440
level ugly and you were like a new level I go oh Brent taking it taking it

67
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,800
to 11 so because I'll to comment on that in a minute but the point was

68
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,560
because of that and going back to your schedule time with you so many meetings

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,120
my calendar has because people want to go I need to touch me every single new

70
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,240
lead in the org hey I need to know how things work can we have some time

71
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,960
together and I go sigh yes here's some pre-reading because I've already

72
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,960
documented everything you're gonna ask but the introduction and the face time

73
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,440
is good so I am meeting with a lot of people across the org which is good I'm

74
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,720
not complaining too much about it I'm not complaining about the people I love

75
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,120
talking to the people it helps get things done what I'm complaining about is the

76
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,960
45 hours of week 45 hours a week I have in meetings for the next three weeks yeah

77
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:19,660
no tell me about your face it everything you just said said kind of

78
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,260
aligns if you are you know director of the engineering OS you're essentially the

79
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,940
chief cat herder actually yes I'm I'm sometimes I call myself chief nagging

80
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:41,120
officer yeah I like that the CNO I just try and I try and help people make good

81
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,900
yeah it's it's very much a process problem when a lot of those regards it's

82
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,580
it's I actually think cat herder is a great how do you how do you enable the

83
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:59,020
right amount of autonomy because as we know command and control sucks you are

84
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:06,060
you are absolutely in a position to evoke all kinds of evil with respect to command

85
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,000
and control absolutely I actually am one of the few people in the entire org me

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,360
and the people that run our SRE business or SRE operations who actually can carry

87
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,200
a process hammer and I am very careful in where I you find nails and hammer

88
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:30,720
them yeah yeah the thing I the thing I mean the thing I like about you being in

89
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:40,000
that role is is you know the responsibility and you know that if I if

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,180
you could get business converged autonomy down at the root level you're gonna

91
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,980
you're gonna create an environment of awesome however as you call out you can't

92
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,800
be afraid to to use command and control not liberally what's the opposite

93
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,000
carefully I wouldn't call a command and control it's adding just enough process

94
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,680
it's putting up some bumper rails where he needed so teams can stumble towards

95
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:20,680
success right and as long as you are kind of reminds me of a story so back in

96
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,720
the day I was in Boy Scouts and I was trying to get the bicycling merit badge

97
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:33,660
and in the bicycling merit badge you had to do a bunch of really long bicycle

98
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:44,450
trips and the last one was a 50-mile trip my dad joined me on that trip and how

99
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:52,570
he joined me is he followed 10 feet behind me in his car beeping every time I

100
00:09:52,570 --> 00:10:04,130
slowed down if the hill was to did that help help it it was motivational

101
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:11,930
it did not inspire me to ever want to do another 50-mile trip as a as a teenager

102
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:19,410
but I did get to the goal right so there's motivation is a is a careful

103
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:24,890
thing yeah you can use it to get to a goal but how do you get it how do you

104
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:33,030
use it so that the next goal achievement is easier it doesn't scale if

105
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:38,790
the the virtual father has to follow behind in the car for every person

106
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,460
taking a bike trip right I could talk about the New York the whole episode and

107
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,100
we'll we won't we'll only talk about it for half or maybe I'll say five minutes

108
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:56,900
and then I'll expand to 15 one thing is that up until now and we'll have this

109
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:02,220
continually we've had these program managers embedded in the teams and I

110
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,020
have all but one or two of those will actually stay there and help their teams

111
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,540
but they haven't thought about how to scale that across the org so that's

112
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,060
gonna be it'll be interesting to sort of dotted line manage that group so it's

113
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,300
kind of it's a little bit like my old org where I will have some there are

114
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,940
some PM's that will be embedded in the teams they work with which I think is

115
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,150
the right thing for that for sort of a senior level technical glue role but

116
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,070
I think it will also be good to use that group to begin to figure out what are

117
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,470
those bumper rails those lightweight processes we need and what are the

118
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,750
fewest we need to actually be most efficient so I'm looking forward to that

119
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,190
but I will learn more about that as we go one of the PM is reporting to me is

120
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:55,150
very much in the the data he loves data and analysis and knows all the cool

121
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,510
Excel tools reminds me of you Brent a little bit and I gave him all of my

122
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,870
project-level data on delivery rates and he did a bunch of analysis and came

123
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,430
back with this gradient gradient color-coded chart showing me the projects

124
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,350
that were more than two standard deviations away from the norm as far as

125
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:19,750
delivery and I said yep those are our three problem projects so no surprise is

126
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,510
there but instead of anecdotally observation observation based anecdotes it

127
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:31,810
was data-based solution so I think while that one was not insightful I'm

128
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,810
confident that he is going to help find insights in the way we deliver across

129
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:42,880
the org because we're moving now to a stage where you know up until a week or

130
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,800
two ago we have 60 60 ish projects in flight across the organization things that

131
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,800
are actively being worked on that was a little customer value we are rapidly

132
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,280
getting to a stage we're going to have nearly a hundred different projects in

133
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,160
flight across the larger organization that can have customer value those things

134
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,560
ranging from two-week experiments to sometimes three-month projects to deliver

135
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,400
a whole new SDK or functionality to a customer so getting some consistency in

136
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:21,100
how we track those things and how we how we improve based on how we deliver

137
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,220
those things is going to be fun yeah it's gonna be interesting to hear that

138
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:35,340
that journey right I don't know of any team that has tried to take the journey

139
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:46,800
to that scope and has done so without heavily leveraging command and control

140
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:57,550
and in shame of it and that that hopefully is just due to a culture at

141
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:04,340
the company that is now dead yeah that's the opposite of our culture so I would

142
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,580
be very surprised if we got there so the I think the bigger worry from our

143
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,780
leadership is that we don't add enough process to keep things under control but

144
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,460
that we but also that we retain autonomy I'm about to make a decision

145
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,500
one of my few process hammers we have one part of the organization we can make

146
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,450
it here right now on the podcast what are we making your decision oh no I've

147
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,330
made it oh okay I've actually made the decision it's actually one of the few

148
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:44,050
times I'm going to imagine a functional team that split across three team leads

149
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:49,050
so imagine with the team being roughly two pizza size imagine that three of

150
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,050
those teams together actually work on a big part of the project you with me so

151
00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,050
far so imagine three teams of six to eight dead who are all part of a larger

152
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,290
team a larger okay delivering like say they're delivering they're delivering

153
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,130
fruit their project is fruit and there's the banana team lead and the

154
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:13,210
apple team lead and the orange team lead this is horrible metaphor but that's

155
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,550
they're all part of delivering fruit now imagine that they all use completely

156
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,230
different project management tools and completely different project management

157
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:29,890
techniques okay so far not hard to imagine oh well now imagine me coming oh

158
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:36,180
you know what I know I'm gonna piss all of you off at once in the in the sake

159
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:41,940
of a greater good and have you all use the same project management tool so you

160
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,260
can work better with product so you can't we have a better chance of doing

161
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,180
what's going on so I can help you more and it's one that none of you are using

162
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,300
right now so you are gonna feel the pain and I'm gonna help you through the

163
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,150
pain and we just have to do it and they're gonna cry and they're gonna

164
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,750
complain but we're gonna do it anyway and within a month they're gonna be

165
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,270
happy yeah it's I've it reminds me of a similar strategy I've taken before

166
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:13,890
right it's essentially instead of having them fight amongst themselves over

167
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:22,530
who has the greater tool you basically come in you've defined it and now

168
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:30,210
temporarily they are unified as a singular team on hating Alan in his

169
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,210
dictatorial that's exactly and then right once once they align on hating me

170
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:41,210
they'll have a better chance of aligning generally going forward I'm happy to be

171
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,970
the first thing their hatred towards me in this case I'm happy to be if that's

172
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:49,610
the first thing they align on great because that means they can align and

173
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:56,510
they can rally around that a hundred percent on the same page that a hundred

174
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:03,790
percent the the other thing too I mean I've shared this on a podcast right

175
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,870
there is a there is a phrase I rarely use well I don't know if it's rare I

176
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:16,230
probably pull it out of my back pocket now once a quarter and and the phrase is

177
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:23,270
and I think you could imagine all sorts of places to use this but the phrase is

178
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:28,230
hey guys here's one one place where I want to take an opportunity to remind

179
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:37,010
everybody that I work really hard to make this team appear to be a democracy

180
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:46,530
watching Alan Parse I'm gonna pull that one out I like that that that goes from

181
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,050
your back pocket into my back pocket thank you for the love I think it's they

182
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,650
they stop pause wait a minute he works really hard to make it appear but he's

183
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:02,570
implying if you can hear you can you can almost hear the gears like oh right

184
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:10,600
right so every now and again you I find that I have to reassert that ultimately

185
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:17,080
I'm accountable in the way I've decided to to make decisions is to push decisions

186
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:28,050
down as much as possible yeah however and and I do try to work hard to such that

187
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,780
people forget that I have veto power but every now and again I need to pull it out

188
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:38,780
because we're in the weeds it's not a sort of reminder of everybody that that

189
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,340
I'm still the guy in charge I could give a shit about that it's just oh my

190
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,940
god you are so much in the weeds it's gonna take three months for you guys to

191
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:54,020
figure out how to get out of the weeds turns out I have a weed whacker we're

192
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:59,020
going we're going in this direction so it's interesting you brought that up

193
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,740
with whatever you said a moment ago about them being the decision makers as

194
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,920
I've added 15 people to my org I've met with them all individually by now at

195
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,640
least once as well as in some team settings and one of the things that I

196
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
continue to iterate because anytime there's a move like this there's some

197
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,240
thud some fear uncertainty and doubt that comes with it so I reiterate my

198
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,640
style is I and one of the things I've said to everyone is I believe decisions

199
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:37,780
are best made by the person closest to the work so I am rarely if ever probably

200
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,220
never going to jump in and make a decision for you I can help you

201
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:47,500
brainstorm that decision I can help facilitate a discussion around the

202
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,980
decision those things I'm good at but I'm not gonna make those I was talking

203
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:56,060
to one of the new DevOps engineers yesterday and just talking you I'm so

204
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,420
glad you're not a micromanager and I'll work that way it sounds like you're a

205
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,060
lot like my last manager say great I said and I want you to know just for full

206
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:09,790
transparency we may have a discussion sometimes it gets into like a solution

207
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:16,150
or a tool or how something we could do and it is not never going to me telling

208
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,910
you what to do or telling you what decision to make it is purely me getting

209
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:23,310
excited and living vicariously through your work since I don't get to do that

210
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:37,270
anymore that moment where you've you've gone you're what is it the the seventh

211
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:42,910
stage of of grief right where you're no longer in denial you're I have acceptance

212
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:53,750
you're like yep I don't do things anymore but I still have this need okay let me

213
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,430
try to do vicariously yeah that's all I can do at this point given the the

214
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,390
variety of projects of functions of disciplines I'm managing across the team

215
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,670
and by the way for the people in the livecast I changed the view from speaker

216
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:11,670
view to showing both of us at once so you can see when Brent makes faces when I

217
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:18,160
talk but if you prefer the other view let me know should we wait the 20

218
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,400
seconds whatever I'll glance over it chat once in a while there was a really

219
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,280
good comment someone said oh man I missed the first 15 minutes and then before I

220
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,560
could type anything in perzy reminded them that nothing good happens in the

221
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:35,580
first 15 minutes anyway it's it's the Brent and Alan BS show one other thing I

222
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:41,180
was going to mention about the new org to see if I can remember one interesting

223
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,370
thing happened is one of my oh actually this is something worth talking about

224
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,810
because this isn't optimal but I think I'll make it work at least for the

225
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,290
medium term in this merge I have gained a DevOps team and I've gained a

226
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,770
documentation team which means I have two documentation leads with teams and

227
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:07,730
two DevOps teams with leads and some various other ICs right now I have too

228
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,290
many direct reports I want to flatten that a little bit but I've always been

229
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:20,200
hesitant of having two you mean unflattened it right you have too many

230
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,520
direct I want to unflatten it a little bit yes I knew what I meant damn it so

231
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,590
the challenge for me is I want to get past the their org versus our org stuff

232
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:36,910
even though right now functionally I have leads from my old org and leads for

233
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,860
the new org coming in so I do have plans and everyone is on board on

234
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:46,540
learning to on getting a stage where they can learn from each other and begin

235
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:53,060
to share work across them but I need to consciously start to blend them into one

236
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,940
kind of like the Brady Bunch I need to spend time making sure I can blend them

237
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:03,860
into one team and I don't stay into the X org and the Y org over time so

238
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,140
that's something I'm working on but probably something I'll come up that

239
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,300
there's no immediate problem I just always avoided having it's not a great

240
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,540
way to do a merger in this case I think it makes sense for the short term I have

241
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,220
to figure out how to it's top of mind on my challenges as far as bringing the org

242
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,240
together yeah I don't have enough business so it's like the way you've

243
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,710
described it so far so far right unless there's a sort of a red thread that

244
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:35,790
ties everyone together team identity is absolutely gonna be critical and is is

245
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:41,010
the way you've described it's gonna be hard yes and there's another challenge

246
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:45,610
that I'm gonna crowdsource to the three and to you but to the three indirectly

247
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:51,130
through you is I didn't worry about having a team identity when I had my

248
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,050
team of eight DevOps or yeah eight DevOps and three doc writers three or

249
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,900
four doc writers sorry I should know one two three three doc three and a half

250
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:06,430
doc writers ones on loan and a few other random ICs it's I never worried about

251
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:13,430
describing what the identity or role of my team was it's very much in the even

252
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,310
with DevOps is very much still been accelerating the achievable quality and

253
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,190
also I have docs because they have a huge impact on the customer perception

254
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,150
equality and stories there one of the things I want to crowdsource to the team

255
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,630
especially now since I have you know eight people in Docs and 15 or 16

256
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:35,950
people in DevOps and and six other ICs working on various quality and PM

257
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,710
initiatives is what does my team do what should I call my team right now in

258
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,750
Slack it's called Allen team and I don't like that I want to find a name for my

259
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:51,550
team and the best I've come up with so far which is which is the wrong name but

260
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,870
I'm hoping by being by it being so wrong that people will come up with better

261
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:06,300
answers is org name dash glue yeah yeah I'm actually thinking of

262
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,260
yeah I don't have I mean I have a name for you it's not a good name

263
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:19,620
I don't think is gonna fly if you know it we can work through the acronym right

264
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,940
and go if it were over here right the first letter would be Azure so that you

265
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,020
mean yes yes right Azure oh are they oh wait wait wait can I help with this so

266
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:39,230
can the next version of Windows be Azure operating system for business net Azure

267
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:45,940
Azure operating system Azure operate as your OS for business is the new name

268
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:50,660
for Windows you heard it here first announcement yeah so you forgot power

269
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,740
right would need to be the power of your operating system for business as your

270
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:03,740
powered OS for business no power the power of Azure OS for business net got it

271
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:14,480
anyway yeah it's not it's not a functional name but essentially I'm thinking about

272
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:21,260
our friends comment so many years ago and have you put yourself into another

273
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:31,360
position where you run the everything else org have I lost you no no no cuz is

274
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,840
this thing on while true I can actually say that no one sees it that way okay well

275
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,840
that's good that's good but on you know for better or for worse people still see

276
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,520
because of title only and the way I run projects and the engineering operating

277
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,960
system it's Alan's program management org which is not right at all either so my

278
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,490
org is the majority of our org is DevOps our customer for DevOps and for

279
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,610
all the rest of my org except for documentation is to enable our internal

280
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:12,250
teams to kick ass and deliver quickly and safely to customers when I add

281
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:18,210
documentation to the mix and again I fully believe it fits because we've made

282
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,290
so many improvements in the customer perception of quality by improving and

283
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:27,410
adding documentation even in the eight months I've been running that org that

284
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:32,280
it really fits a lot with quality and there are some people that remember that

285
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,440
I have an extensive quality background and so they say oh Alan's quality team

286
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,480
but I really don't really have one of those either but I'm still like what

287
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,060
do you got what do you got how would we and then so I got one versus the

288
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:50,200
remainder yeah the actually yeah the remainder is what I was trying to do I

289
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,140
know but I couldn't page load it the way you just described like first off

290
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:02,030
I'm like you know what injury engineering operating system you know EOS

291
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:08,510
sounds would be kind of cool you run the EOS team right because no one's heard of

292
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:13,030
that before but then it's probably not inclusive enough of everyone in your

293
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:18,790
organization right if your documentation team is their output is is intended to

294
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:23,950
go straight to the customer right not not to both directions we do have some

295
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:29,950
internal docs they work on as well that helps out marketing sales etc but yeah

296
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:37,110
largely to the customer but what about the quality operating system right the

297
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,190
problem is is that acronym is QOS yeah that's already taken and the the Q word

298
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:48,100
what I think they may get it in this org I yeah that would be internal yeah

299
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,860
the Q word I worry a little bit about about pigeonholing I gotta tell you

300
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,660
yesterday on Twitter I thought it was funny someone mentioned and this is fine

301
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:03,380
I wrote this in an article 15 years ago as well but that you shouldn't blame bugs

302
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,420
on testing literally 15 years ago I go dig out the article where I talked about

303
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:11,780
the one that got away article for sticky minds and you know blaming bugs on

304
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,540
testing is does it work it's a whole team thing someone was commenting about

305
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,060
that yet again very adamant about it lots of threads on yes tough this is

306
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,060
ridiculous it's hurtful and yeah I totally agree but what it made me think

307
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:31,090
of wasn't and of course the tangents are here is I actually ask that all the time

308
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:36,020
now why did why did we miss this in testing but I'm not blaming it I'm not

309
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:41,500
blaming anyone I'm trying to get to the root cause of why we let a failure get

310
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,060
to production so what I'm digging in with a team on who developed and tested

311
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:52,500
their own code and I made some comments that said I still say this but you know

312
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,740
I say it's all the time the difference in context is that my the team I'm talking

313
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,380
to is a team that developed the code as well as tested it and people which I

314
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,100
thought was interesting and insightful it talks about how things are changing

315
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:09,420
and boy did I got busy because of my 45 hours of meetings a week and came back

316
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,420
and people were all up in arms like the author's the author the original

317
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:18,820
people like you don't know my context it's like that's great and and it's an

318
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,060
anti-nice guy I know him and I like him but apparently I triggered the hell out

319
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,940
of him and then people jumped on the the whole we were getting rid of testers

320
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,060
thing and I thought oh god I did not mean to trigger this I just wanted to

321
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,940
talk about this is interesting is this thing that I used to be just as adamant

322
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,620
about I have a different view on because the way I run engineering

323
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:47,890
systems now and people just it was a I didn't realize it was a massively

324
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:52,570
triggering tweet for a lot of people and I apologized to everyone I offended I

325
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,970
stand behind my words this stuff works for me it doesn't mean it works for you

326
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:01,490
because I never said that I'll edit that out but just pisses me off anyway

327
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:08,290
what were we talking about yeah I'm ignoring you know I'm trying to find it

328
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:14,770
the Twitter's right the so already proposes I could just be release

329
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:20,780
management but I think that's there's something to that it is there's

330
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:27,260
something around how we release I think release management has some other

331
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:34,340
connotations yeah I don't like the word management in there right it I don't

332
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:41,780
like that right it's essentially it evokes essentially Alan is the the chief

333
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,980
bureaucrat in charge well in a way I am it could be release and engineering

334
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,650
operations speed wagon so you could be a real speed wagon I'm just throwing shit

335
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,780
out there yeah you know you get a good idea Brent right you know a lot of ideas

336
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,460
and throw the bad ones away but a very good idea on a different tangent is the

337
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:11,980
idea of calling the operating system Azure warp speed or AWS for short because

338
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,460
that one's a winner what were you talking about after you were going me I

339
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,980
was making random comments after I was ignoring you I started making random

340
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,780
comments around release management I mean that was like 30 seconds ago though I

341
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:31,940
don't think your memory has gotten that bad no it hasn't Bert the base off of

342
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:38,060
this I mean I like I current I mean it's not entirely inclusive right what you

343
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,740
could do is just throw together a bunch of ideas get your leaders in a room and

344
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:49,060
say hey I want something I want like I wouldn't crowdsource this with me in the

345
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:52,780
three I would crowdsource this yeah that meetings already on the calendar for

346
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,380
next week but I want to try and get some of the and again one of my

347
00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,060
techniques for getting ideas out of people is to give them all of the bad

348
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:04,260
ideas to start with because then they will try and improve on those and

349
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,700
actually get somewhere so I'm what I'm looking for from the three is here are

350
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,060
all the things that won't work perzy asked like how is different from SRE or

351
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,020
site reliability engineering and they are on the tail end for us at least and

352
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,780
I think generally SRE are looking at things after they're deployed and I am

353
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,180
trying to make sure like if I do my job really well SRE's job is easier

354
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,860
because there's fewer incidents and fewer oddities or operational surprises

355
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:37,300
coming their way anyway yeah I definitely have a leads meeting next week to go

356
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:43,820
over this where we'll come to a conclusion and present that to the team

357
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,770
the following week that's my so I put a deadline in place it makes sense anyway

358
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:54,970
do you want to that's my org we'll hear more about that in the Alan talks about

359
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:00,890
unity section of the podcast which will continue but we also oh we're out of

360
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:05,730
time no we got the time go we have a mailbag question which is definitely

361
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:11,860
worth unpacking and talking about can you wait do you know how to read I do you

362
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,660
read the question so I could listen to it again because I ignored you last time

363
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,780
you're at a chimney except for the one part I liked

364
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:34,740
folks this is from who and who I whose name I presume is not Kristoff had us

365
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:41,590
right he's got an accent mark over the s I have no clue what that means in any

366
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:48,350
language let alone his so I apologize for that no that's yeah I think I think

367
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:54,060
that's legit I'm sure it's legit I just don't know what it means in terms of how

368
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,780
I'm supposed to think it's a change or a something like that anyway Kristoff we

369
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,670
apologize but we're gonna go over your question yes hey folks I have a question

370
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,870
about deployments and creating an adaptive culture I hope it's the right

371
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:15,590
place to ask yes it is it absolutely is having pre-read it we have a mobile app

372
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:21,590
and are doing loads of experiments we're also a seasonal business so of course it's

373
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:28,070
essential that we release fast and often currently we do weekly releases

374
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:34,350
regressions take a day multiple teams contribute to that repo and if we release

375
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:42,110
a bug our rollback time is also crap due to review time on stores I assume app

376
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:48,550
stores in that case we have got some automation working on doing less manually

377
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:53,990
but because of how long it takes to restore the previous version we won't be

378
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:59,830
able to be more adaptive and move really fast we moved away from agile

379
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:07,330
testing framework and doing a variation of modern testing it's and seems like not

380
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:12,330
having continuous deployment is holding us back and keeps us working in a

381
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:19,230
predictive manner any tips on what to try out so let me try and paraphrase for

382
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,750
understanding so for clarification it's how do we do the lean things that you

383
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,070
and I preach so much in a mobile app where your release process is limited by

384
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:35,830
the time it takes to get to submit and get feedback and get approved from the

385
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:41,780
the app stores for Apple and Android that that inherently that's a bottleneck

386
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,790
how do you work around that bottleneck in the system yeah I think that's a good

387
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,710
summation I mean there's a couple one thing that I think is an interesting

388
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:57,430
question is or statement rather is we moved away from the agile testing

389
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:03,260
framework and doing a variation of modern testing that let's dive into that

390
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:09,020
first before we go into solution mode so I'd actually like to understand more

391
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:15,180
what that means because I consider you know the the modern testing principles to

392
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,380
be you know maybe an evolution or maybe an adjunct to agile testing it's you know

393
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,860
we care more we I guess the only differences are we have a an emphasis on

394
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,060
data which is not in agile testing is defined by defined by Lisa and Janet

395
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:38,930
and that may be it we may emphasize coaching and consulting a little bit more

396
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,090
but I don't I don't think that much but it's not that much different so maybe

397
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:48,970
it's just more lean than agile because you and I talk about lean so much and so

398
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,730
much of our modern testing principles are stolen many more of those are stolen

399
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:57,130
from the lean startup than they are from the agile testing book but both are

400
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,480
influences no so one of the things that's interesting and we've talked

401
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:11,100
about this in the past when we were forming up modern or MTP right the like

402
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:15,980
they moved away from the agile testing framework and doing a variation of

403
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:24,860
modern testing the implication there is Christoph has a a feeling that that

404
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:33,330
modern testing is a replacement framework right it like implies sort of tactics

405
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:39,170
and steps and you know a criteria by which you can evaluate whether or not you

406
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,970
are successfully deployed modern testing and I have no doubt that right I do

407
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:50,890
think modern testing has gotten to the point where it's absolutely bigger than

408
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:58,290
us and not not controllable by us anymore so I have no doubt that there

409
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:04,730
may be a belief around hey there's a tactical framework and a progression you

410
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,450
can take you know when I think about it you're right data coaching the other one

411
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:16,250
though principle seven right principle seven could easily be interpreted as

412
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:23,140
moving towards unified engineering oh yes there's that one too I forget about

413
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:27,340
that because it just happened so naturally for me yeah I would say if

414
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:36,330
there's anything that's a modern testing framework call is sort of a be

415
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:43,930
hyper cynical hyper that's cynical critical hyper critical on your need for

416
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:52,900
test specialists right you probably don't need them the way you think you do that

417
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:58,100
is to loop back to our previous topic quickly and jump back on this is not

418
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,860
reporting to me but we do have some dedicated QA in my overall new

419
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:08,780
organization and I met with the dev lead in charge of that organization and they

420
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,380
not in so many words asked me if I was going to get rid of their QA team and

421
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:19,060
that answer is basically what I gave them I said there's no my charter is

422
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:23,980
never to get rid of QA my charter is to make sure teams are as efficient as

423
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,260
they can be in delivering quality software to our customers and sometimes

424
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:36,420
maybe frequently or very often in my past sometimes that means QA move into

425
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,660
different roles that help optimize and accelerate the achievement of quality

426
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,860
better so interesting you brought that up because that conversation came up as

427
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:49,570
well this week in my so so what's the real answer the real answer is probably

428
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,170
god I hope they don't listen to this podcast but they do the real answer is I

429
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:59,450
expect at some point that team again I have dissolved so many test teams without

430
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:04,810
laying off a single person I want to be that clear I don't know testers I work

431
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:09,330
to make sure you find a role where you can be most effective in what you're best

432
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,370
at so I imagine that will probably happen with those people in the org

433
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:19,250
they'll move into various DevOps and development and maybe quality consulting

434
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,970
roles yeah that that's I can't imagine that not happening in an org that I'm

435
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,530
in charge of so I know the thing is but you have to disappoint people at a level

436
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,290
they can absorb and I can't it whatever you do a reorg you have to let things

437
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:40,010
keep going more or less as they're going for a little while and then boil

438
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,810
the frog in the direction you want to go in but again going back to principle

439
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:49,090
seven is and we're way off tangent on this on this topic but it isn't that

440
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,370
you get rid of the testers and like this Yahoo article and just taking away

441
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:56,610
the safety net it's you may get to a point where you realize you don't need

442
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:02,150
dedicated testers anymore and I like to try and help teams get there yeah it was

443
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:07,950
interesting because so the reason why I asked that question is as you laid it

444
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:14,550
out I'm like okay let's imagine I'm in Alan shoes and this question came to me

445
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:21,490
and I realized I don't know that I would have been as smooth as you were in terms

446
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:28,280
of responding but I knew the answer almost instantly right it like the way

447
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:35,360
the question was posed the fact that it's a concern says to me there is an

448
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:41,040
extremely high chance that there is now an in-place safety net that needs to

449
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,910
be worked through yeah but but my role requires a high level of emotional

450
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:54,380
quotient and leading people on a journey to get where I want them to go agreed

451
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:01,740
agreed so back to the question back to the question so tips to try out what

452
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:11,220
what's what's your tips so what I would do have done would do is one way to get

453
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,460
around because this this app store turnaround is real especially when when

454
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:22,300
one or more of the app stores sort of have moving goalposts I shouldn't say

455
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:26,820
sort of the goalposts on what it takes to have your app approved and deployed are

456
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:31,860
moving so sometimes almost the identical app that was approved last week cannot

457
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:39,940
get approved this week so the way around that of course is to do have

458
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:45,660
remote configuration and fig fig your flags feature flags in your app so you

459
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:50,860
can take a bug fix or a new feature that you think is correct and you can even

460
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,060
deploy with the feature flag turned on and the app at startup of course it

461
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,460
would require again you're stuck if your app doesn't is an offline app and

462
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,500
doesn't require network access you can't do this but ideally when your app

463
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,580
starts up it can look at a server see what flags should be turned on or off

464
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:15,060
and do its thing and then if you need to roll back all you do is flip a flag on the

465
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,140
server that feature is turned off and you can continue you can you know tweak

466
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,580
it for the next release but you're not breaking anybody in the in the short term

467
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:30,260
you have I think you have likely far more experience with dealing with app

468
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:35,820
stores than I do I have a question for you yeah maybe there's a lingo so

469
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,460
there's two kind of deployment models or update models I see with app stores right

470
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:49,020
there's the one where an app detects the local version of the app detects that

471
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:54,020
there's a bit of update in the app store and redirects you to the app store to do

472
00:44:54,020 --> 00:45:02,220
that update right that process obviously requires you to go through the the app

473
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:10,280
store gauntlet to get an update rolled out right but then there's the other

474
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:16,910
model where I see sort of a an app deploys and it's sort of a Chrome around

475
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:26,540
the app but doing say business logic updates or you know UI changes where the

476
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:36,140
Chrome is is consistent but the app itself updates from within itself yeah yeah

477
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,980
I could see that I don't know how I haven't done that before and that's a

478
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:45,940
great way to do it but it kind of seems the the app store owners want so much

479
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:50,900
control over their apps like a massive amount of control of what gets approved

480
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,740
I can't imagine them approving an app that works like that in the first place

481
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,860
without some wheel greasing somewhere so I actually haven't used that model but

482
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:06,740
it is another great way you could do this and I'm I've seen a lot of apps I

483
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:10,860
don't know how they get those approved and what the agreement is with the app

484
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:14,620
stores where they can do that but that's a that's a really an ingenious idea and

485
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:18,980
I've idea and of course you can download definitely download additional

486
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:26,460
assets or or some updates outside of the app store so I guess my advice is

487
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,420
look into ways you can work around the app store requirements because what you

488
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,460
want to do in the theory of constraints is identify your biggest bottleneck hey

489
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,180
our biggest bottleneck is the turnaround time and submitting to the app store and

490
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:46,020
figure out how we mitigate that that bottleneck and one is feature flags but

491
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:51,940
there may be a deployment option that's actually approvable where you can do some

492
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:56,100
classification at least of updates outside of the app store process which

493
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,580
would be great but you're right as I think about it a lot more apps should

494
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:05,380
do this so and for context you know we don't deliver apps we deliver tools with

495
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:10,420
multiple SDKs people can use to make apps but we have to test that process so

496
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,580
we test it by submitting apps and seeing what Apple and Android's policies are

497
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,860
so we can anticipate those for our customers and give them the right advice

498
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:24,650
and things to do so my experience there is limited from that perspective but I

499
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:30,850
am familiar with at least at least of course a feature flags but anyway

500
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,410
there's got to be a couple ways to mitigate that bottleneck that have been

501
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:38,810
actually tried and proven from an app store perspective look into those like

502
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:45,370
when I read this and I'm actually reading his responses on the three have

503
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:50,250
come in this this question came from the select channel and by the way before you

504
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:53,850
get there the three are awesome because one of the things I look for in a

505
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:58,250
community is self-sustaining and people ask questions all the time and Brent or

506
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:04,470
I not only don't need to answer them but rarely if ever is there a case where

507
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:10,950
the three don't respond better than we could have in the first place so love the

508
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,820
three thank you for being there all three of you go on absolutely love the

509
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:22,660
three that is just a strong self-supporting community like if you're not

510
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,300
on it get on it it is worth your time and then the other thing I wanted to call

511
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:37,630
out I haven't listened to the latest 343 but Danny fought damn that dude is

512
00:48:37,630 --> 00:48:48,200
awesome yeah I am so jealous that he's working through the the the wine bird

513
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:54,360
biography like I mean actually writing the book and all that that's probably

514
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:59,560
not the thing but the fact that he had enough exposure and talking that he's

515
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,280
he's actually capable of doing that like that historical context I'm absolutely

516
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,000
jealous of Danny on that's just fantastic now going back to Chris

517
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,790
offspring like when I look at this like the very first thing I would want to try

518
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:23,910
to balance he calls out like they have a problem with rollbacks he has a CICD

519
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:30,370
right if they don't have CACD because of app store bureaucracy they can still have

520
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:38,820
CI they can have CI and then deliver to to to some version of a master branch

521
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:48,060
that's just ready to to roll out the the thing is is the limitation is okay it

522
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:55,140
rolls out oops we screwed up now he also mentioned it rollbacks are our

523
00:49:55,340 --> 00:50:02,520
painful and so to me this says okay you need to do something to protect master

524
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:12,950
branch you need to do something to make it a bit more preventative model but the

525
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:20,710
inability to just sort of do rollbacks which is why feature flags came to mind

526
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:24,230
right away you need a way to write if you could just that's the fastest way

527
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:27,990
because if there's a problem and simply restarting the app and getting it to

528
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:36,530
reread from the remote config it's fixed rollback is is that fast right it what I

529
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:44,490
would I would look at is how can we make architectural changes to support these

530
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:50,970
capabilities right a config rollback a like what we just talked about a

531
00:50:50,970 --> 00:50:55,770
business logic like in my mind I've already sort of designed if I were

532
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:58,730
building an app like this how would I make it such that I could update it

533
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:02,210
with and a rollback from with it right again we're gonna look at the biggest

534
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:05,290
pain point which right now is the ability to roll back or handle a

535
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:10,730
regression in a timely manner for our customers and brainstorm on what are the

536
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,560
ways we can work around these bottlenecks and it's all the things we

537
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:18,120
just talked about it's like but it needs the team to brainstorm what's

538
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,400
feasible it could be architectural it could be adding a feature flag which is

539
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:26,600
semi architectural and definitely architectural for changing the nature of

540
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,200
the app where the guts of the app are actually separate from the Chrome that

541
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,360
goes through the app store but then there may be other options as well I'm

542
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,440
sure the internet and Stack Overflow and center are full of ideas but the

543
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:42,360
team needs to really brainstorm on how to work around the bottlenecks that are

544
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:49,580
out of there especially when they're out of their control yeah that's you

545
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:55,940
said it correctly I know what I'm doing I don't everyone knows is that on this

546
00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:04,300
podcast Brent is a smart one but I'm the pretty and entertaining one agreed on

547
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:08,820
all points all right I hope that that was a good discussion that I hope

548
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:13,020
continues and I hope and again probably the three answered that better than you

549
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,060
and I did but I did want to call out the transition from agile to modern

550
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,260
testing because that's something we hadn't heard before and worth talking

551
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,660
about then just a sort of and we're not the right people to help brainstorm the

552
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:29,100
solution for this but we're the right people to through our wrong answers for

553
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:33,260
you to realize that brainstorming how to work around those bottlenecks is what

554
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:39,110
should be done the one last thing I'll call out before we sign off is if if

555
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:44,270
we were wrong and and actually app store isn't the primary cause of the

556
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:50,230
bottleneck then then one of the things that I have found is that actually

557
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:56,050
doing a shift to Kanban is really helpful here right because even though

558
00:52:56,050 --> 00:53:04,990
you may not have a CD system Kanban's kind of kid gets that muscle going yeah

559
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:08,310
well Kanban the best thing about Kanban if you use it right it helps you find

560
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:13,550
where the bottlenecks are on your system it does but I'm thinking in in

561
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:20,030
terms of the benefit I gained from it right you essentially if you if you

562
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:25,870
singly release one ticket you don't have the this sort of this the scrub

563
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:30,190
impact where all of the bugs get introduced to the product at 11 p.m.

564
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:38,970
the night before and if you roll out one small batch chunk and everything's on

565
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:44,770
the floor right it should be easy to roll that back then to build on that yeah

566
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:49,890
one thing is that I think because of the bottleneck and deployment the team

567
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:54,890
could very well likely be encouraged to bundle up a bunch of changes so they only

568
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:59,400
have to submit it once to the app store so you're really as a mobile developer

569
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,940
you really got to find a way to work around that stuff all right all right we

570
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,460
got we got meetings to go to man I got a this is Friday's usually my light day

571
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,740
and it is today I only have six hours of meetings but counting this one this one's

572
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,780
fun though this one doesn't count yeah this one doesn't exhaust me like the rest

573
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:19,570
of them do all right hey thanks for you guys turning in as and again and and gals

574
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:24,370
folks y'all once again I promised next time we do a livecast to advertise it

575
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:28,130
in our slack group a little bit more ahead of time so that people can plan

576
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:35,170
around it but thanks for listening yeah I know I know and it's been fun

577
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:39,520
chatting with you burnt I got the name right see you next time

578
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:43,890
bye all right bye bye
