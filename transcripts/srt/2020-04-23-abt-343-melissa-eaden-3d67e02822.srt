1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,510
the AB Testing podcast, three questions about almost anything. ABT 343 is a fun slice of

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,110
what's going on in the world of modern testing. Let's get started.

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:28,070
Time for another ABT 343, and this time we have a fellow Unity employee. It's Melissa

5
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,630
Eden. Hey, Melissa.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,150
Hey, Allen.

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,870
We've already been talking for like 20 minutes, so we're already kind of warmed up. So that's

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,530
all she had for me. Just a hey, Allen.

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,530
What's up?

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,130
All right, great. So a listener of the podcast, right?

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,050
Yes. Yeah, for a long time now.

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,170
This is the podcast, as the intro says, where we talk to one of our listeners, one of our

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,050
three listeners. This is our like, is this like our eighth or ninth third listener?

14
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,050
Yeah.

15
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,210
It's very confusing math.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,210
It's that new math.

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,010
Do you know the story about the three?

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:04,170
The one of three or the yeah, kind of like it's kind of probably worth repeating for people

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,600
maybe starting here is that very early on, like in the first six months, year of our

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,000
podcast, Brent and I used to joke about our three listeners because we are a new podcast.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's how many podcasts new listeners have. But then people would walk up to us and say,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,360
hey, I'm one of the three. Like, oh, cool. And we knew what that meant. And it kind of

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,320
stuck. It didn't help when somewhere in the fifties when Percy created the one of the

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,640
three dot slack dot com. So now it's the official. And then I have stickers that on the back

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,800
of this laptop I'm recording on that you can't see, even though I'm pointing at it, which

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,150
say one of the three. So that's where it comes from. And I've talked enough for one

27
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:49,390
of the one ABT 343. So are you ready to answer three ish questions?

28
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,390
Yeah.

29
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,830
All right. I was thinking of asking an algebra question, but I'm not smart enough to think

30
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:01,230
of one on the fly. So instead I'll ask you about your career. So you've been, and I

31
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:08,860
should know this because I hired you. I know you've been at unity for over a year. How is

32
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,930
it two years yet? No, not quite. It'll be not quite. So you're right in November. Okay.

33
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,690
Year and a half. We'll call it a year and a half. So you've been in a management position

34
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,050
for all of that time. Pretty much. Yeah. What have you learned? What have you learned

35
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:29,170
about being a manager? What would have been some of your big learning point you can cover

36
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,570
whatever you want?

37
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:40,760
Well, one of the things I've had to learn more patience just around like people and coordinating

38
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,400
and understanding and perspective. That's like I always, I thought I was pretty much a patient

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,280
person, but when you start mixing in somebody other than yourself, that you have to actually

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,340
guide and talk with and have conversations on a regular basis and make sure they're

41
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:02,400
doing okay. It's you have to kind of double or triple what you're normally used to because

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,380
they have to process and they have to come back and it's sort of like a very long math

43
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,740
equation. So that's that, that part's been interesting. So patience and then also learning

44
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:21,520
how to do leadership and management without doing command and control to an extent or

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,440
being like a drive by or drive through or kind of like that combination of trying to

46
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,550
balance like how much is too much management or what's just enough or who, how do you

47
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:40,510
interact with people to give them guidance, but and also emphasize what's priority, but

48
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:48,110
not like, you know, micromanage them to death. So it's, it's, it's, it's a balancing act and

49
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,670
not not be completely like hands off either because that, you know, things will happen

50
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,310
and then you'll be like, Oh, how did that get completely off the rails? And then so

51
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,550
it's, it's, it's like all the spinning plates and everything. So some of that,

52
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,190
let's, let's pop the stack there for just a minute. So the leadership and management

53
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,790
thing, I love if you could elaborate on a little bit. So what have you, I mean, you

54
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,990
knew before you took this role that there was a difference between leadership and management.

55
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,230
So what have you learned about that? What have you, what are some of the insights you've

56
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,400
had in learning how to split and balance those two aspects?

57
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,360
For me, they go hand in hand, but like leadership, I feel like is being able to stand up and

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,360
either make a decision and then have, you know, have people actually believe that you

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,160
can follow through with it or they follow through with that decision or, and then management

60
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,080
is actually managing the decision you made, whether it's good or bad, right? So if

61
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:53,120
you decide to do something as a leader, then you pass that down or you, you know, you

62
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:01,800
disseminate or what's the other D word I'm trying to think of? Not defer. It's a Monday.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,320
My brain is saying it's Monday. What is it?

64
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,440
It's okay. I can edit this part. So I'm trying to think it's the, what is that word? It's

65
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,760
the delegate.

66
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:22,440
Thank you. It's a D. Delegate. Yeah. So I mean, we, when you delegate to people to get

67
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,520
something done on a decision that you decided on, like, I feel like leadership is making

68
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,760
the decision. Delegation is the management part. And then also dealing with the result

69
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,640
of that decision is the management part. So there's, there's, cause leaders can make

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,200
a decision and then go off and do other things. But when you're managing, you also have

71
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,360
to deal with the end result of whatever you decided to do. So that's been the...

72
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,080
Well, you have to deal with how that decision impacts people.

73
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,840
Well, yeah, that's probably a lot more concise way of putting it. Impacts people or impacts

74
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,760
the product or impacts even customers to an extent. Like if I say, no, we're not going

75
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:11,800
to ship something and I need this tested and that understood and this fixed and I've

76
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,680
delegated that in a way and other people have taken those on, then I have to, I also

77
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,480
have to understand that I'm also dealing with like, and other people are dealing with the

78
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,640
decision of holding a release for whatever reason, or if the opposite, you know, we

79
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,120
decided to ship something and it's, it makes an impact because there was something else

80
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,600
we didn't catch, then I also have to deal with that decision in a way or try to mitigate

81
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,250
it the next time it comes back up. So a lot of the job is not only, and that's just around

82
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,130
the product. That doesn't even have to, that's not even encompassing having to deal with

83
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,970
decisions being made with, you know, how people are feeling or, you know, if they're

84
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:58,890
sick or if they're not being challenged enough at work and they want to learn more or if

85
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,690
their career development is slow or too fast or any of those like personal decisions

86
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,570
that people have to make, then you have to help them make those decisions as well. Like

87
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:12,370
I don't have to, but I think as a good manager, I point them in the right direction, at least

88
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,130
so that they can make a correct decision, hopefully.

89
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,370
Their success is your responsibility.

90
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:22,570
Yeah. So learning that and learning, you know, I already had inklings that that was

91
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,210
the case, but definitely learning how to do that and how to do it, how to get better

92
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:31,770
at it and recognize when I need to do it. It's like when I need to step in or ask

93
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,650
a question or, you know, double check and just say, hey, is everything okay? Do you need,

94
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,530
is everything good? What can I try to help with? That's been a learning process.

95
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:51,240
I think it came easier as time went on and as I've had more people to be able to help

96
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,200
delegate things across. It's like, because originally it was a three team group. I came

97
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:05,240
in and then one moved to development and then it was two. And then we started hiring people

98
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:13,800
about six months after I got there. So it's been interesting for sure to go from a very small team

99
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,920
and trying to survive like that work and help that person and help myself to a larger team where

100
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:26,560
we could delegate things. And you can actually see things shift and change with the teams when

101
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:33,920
you realize there's enough work for four people that two people were trying to manage. And that's

102
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,120
pretty interesting as well. And there was just a lot of things like technical and personal and

103
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,400
skill-wise. A lot to learn. One thing I like you described very modern test-ish,

104
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,440
testing-ish, MT-ish in your description, which I really like, which pushes back on

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:09:01,040
what one thing I don't like about the context-driven school is that you are describing yourself as a

106
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,120
decision maker whose decisions matter, not someone who just provides information to someone to make

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,840
those decisions. I think that's really important as a leader and a lot about the modern testing

108
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:16,000
principles or about how you lead your teams towards a higher quality culture.

109
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,160
Well, I used to be like that. It was like, I'm giving you the information. You have to make

110
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,360
the decision, right? I think that in some way is a cop-out. And some people would point that out

111
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,840
when I was doing that. I mean, it depends on the system I was working in. But as a lead,

112
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:40,430
as a tester, as someone who is trying to help make a decision, it's not my decision alone.

113
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:44,190
Like, I feel like it's more of a quorum now. Like, if you're running things right,

114
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:50,110
everybody helps make that decision, I think. And whether I'm working with the

115
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:57,310
lead developer or another tester or ops or whatever, we all weigh the decision together.

116
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:01,870
And if my decision is different from theirs, we try to understand why. I think it's more

117
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:07,070
important to understand, come to a conclusion that everybody can agree upon versus saying,

118
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:14,670
oh, here's my decision. Whatever you decide, it's up to you. It feels like...

119
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,770
Yeah, to me too. Full agreement.

120
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,980
So I have a bonus question for you. Sorry to put you on the spot, but I think for context

121
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:29,260
of the last question, this would be good, is can you talk just briefly about... Because your role

122
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,700
has changed since he started at Unity. I think it'd be worth talking about what you're doing now for

123
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,020
your org and what your team is doing. Actually, this is like the third time it's changed. I've been

124
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:44,910
there a year and a half. So I started out as a QA lead. So as a technical lead. And then

125
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:52,090
about six months in, shifted to management because I hired a team. So I was managing about four people.

126
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,450
And that was interesting and trying to get that moving. And then recently I've also shifted

127
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:06,490
to more of a quality coach or quality consultant. So we have a team now called...

128
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:16,880
I did something clever. Quality Elevation. So I just named it.

129
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,360
Oh, a new QE. Awesome.

130
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,840
A QE. And it caught on. I was just playing with a name to give the team a little bit of...

131
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:37,360
Because I wanted to get away from assurance or acceptance or having the QA. So I felt like

132
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,660
hey, what are we actually trying to do? We're trying to elevate quality. We're trying to raise

133
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:49,260
the bar and help the teams raise the bar. So called it the Quality Elevation team.

134
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,760
And Steven liked it. So it stuck. And now we're...

135
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,280
I don't hate it.

136
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:04,940
Good. Yay. But it's the idea of actually helping the teams find ways to

137
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:13,820
measure and perform whatever they decide and whatever we help them understand that they

138
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:20,220
should be targeting. Different quality metrics. Just different process tasks that could help them

139
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,300
understand where their gaps are. So it's a lot of consulting with the leads, consulting with the

140
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:33,180
teams, working with the teams on technical gaps and issues. Anything from automation to tooling

141
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:41,260
that could help them raise their quality. So that includes figuring out what analytics,

142
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:47,870
figuring out what kind of automation they need to put in place. And even documentation. So it's

143
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,590
all of the encompassing things that are kind of out of that functional testing realm

144
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:59,630
that's away from it. The teams are really owning the functional testing. And we're owning

145
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:08,030
how to get them the things they need to actually improve and move faster. So I'm digging it.

146
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,350
It sounds like you're accelerating the achievement of a shippable quality.

147
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:17,070
I am. I'm actually really happy about it. Because I feel like I've come full circle

148
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,910
back around to where I was when I was at ThoughtWorks and what I was doing with ThoughtWorks.

149
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,190
And that mindset of having everybody own quality and then trying to just take it one

150
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:33,710
step further and like, hey, let's introduce this and let's do this. And it's been an interesting

151
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:39,070
journey this last year and a half. And I really am encouraged and excited about where this next

152
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:47,370
phase of my career is going inside of Unity. So super cool. Yeah. So a coaching question for you.

153
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:53,210
Sure. I know that you from your testing experience, you are a great problem solver.

154
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:00,330
Whether it's your team or developers you work with, what are some things or stories or adventures

155
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:07,160
or whatever you've learned in coaching people to solve problems? How do you help? How do you know

156
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,360
when? It's a tough thing because you just want to do it, not delegate it. But when do you...

157
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,060
How do you approach that partnership of solving a problem together?

158
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:28,460
Yeah. I think it is... I've gotten better at delegating. Especially when I know that there's some

159
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,980
technical aspect that would take me a lot longer to ramp up on. If I can explain it well enough,

160
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,780
it's somebody that has more technical expertise in that area can pick it up faster than me.

161
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:43,260
I try to find that person. So that's the problem solver. It's like, I'm going to try to find the

162
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:50,840
person to solve this problem that I know we have. The other thing is just having conversations and

163
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,040
suggesting things. And whether people try them or not, or just planting the seed and they come

164
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:05,400
back around to it, that's okay. And just offering up solutions that could help in the moment.

165
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:12,280
Everything from root cause analysis to retrospectives to, hey, could we treat... What if we tweak the

166
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,400
sprints just a little bit to do something different? And even if they push back and they're like, no,

167
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,080
we're not going to try that right now, sometimes they come back around and they'll try it later.

168
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,520
So even just having a conversation about a problem that might not be solved right then,

169
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:36,800
or a delayed response is good. Trying to enable people to solve the problems themselves is a little

170
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,360
bit harder. It's hard to identify too, because oftentimes you don't know that you've had an

171
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,040
impact or you've had a conversation that's had an impact that somebody solved a problem with.

172
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,360
I think that happens more... I've seen it more on the career side of things when I've talked with

173
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,840
folks about mentoring and career inside the company, and they're having a difficult problem.

174
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,800
They're trying to get developers to do more unit tests, or they're trying to get them to

175
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:09,320
try something that could help. I'll ask them, who's the ally? Who do you have there that

176
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,960
could help you that sees your perspective that could help you demonstrate to the rest of the team,

177
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,000
whether it's pair development or pair testing or whatever? And they're like, oh,

178
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,480
this person can help me. And I was like, okay, well, then set up a time and kind of demonstrate

179
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:32,600
it and get moving on that and work at that problem from that direction. So it's a lot of

180
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:41,680
coaching and talking about... The other thing that comes up is they'll ask me, they're like,

181
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,400
oh, what do I do about this? This is a huge problem. I'm like, well, have you had a

182
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,520
conversation with that person to see if you can solve that problem? And then they'll stop

183
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,960
and it's like, oh, that's a good idea. I should go do that. And then sometimes I hear back,

184
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,520
oh, I had a conversation. This is great. And this is how it turned out.

185
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:03,520
So sometimes it's just suggesting the obvious, which is funny, but true. It's like, hey,

186
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:11,680
did you give your critical feedback? Did we talk about... Did you get a chance to talk about

187
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,080
this in three cues? What can you do to help improve your situation? Whether that's a technical

188
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,850
problem or a personal problem or a process problem. Sometimes it's just like, hey,

189
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,730
what else can we do to help you? Let's come up with brainstorm some stuff.

190
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:36,140
I find that just giving the person space to think through the problem and have somebody

191
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:43,820
like be the rubber ducky really has helped quite a bit. It helps me too. I have a bunch

192
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,500
of people that I do this with. So I feel like I've just sort of also be that person. It's like,

193
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,220
hey, my whole career I've talked with other people. It's like, hey, I'm doing this. Is

194
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,300
this right? Is this wrong? What is this working with? How's this working? And I feel like I've

195
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,500
provided myself to a certain extent to do the same thing. And I see the benefit of that.

196
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,260
I think other people see the benefit of it too.

197
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,450
Yeah, it's tough. I have learned to ask questions like, what have you tried already?

198
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,170
Yeah, that's a good one.

199
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,650
What do you think you need to try next?

200
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:17,770
Yeah.

201
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,490
Those are good cop-outs, but they actually work.

202
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:26,410
They do because it makes them think of like, oh, it's like, have you gone to talk to that person?

203
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,090
It's also sometimes I have no idea. Sometimes I get pulled into solving a problem.

204
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,090
I don't know what's going on. So at least by asking those stalls,

205
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,730
I don't have to go into advice mode right away. And often, I can't tell you how many times I've

206
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:46,490
had employees come explain a problem to me they were having. And then the process of

207
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,450
explaining it to me go, oh, I got it. Nevermind. Bye.

208
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:55,470
I've also done, this one works really well. And I like doing it with developers. They'll come to me

209
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:58,590
and they're like, okay, I need all of this testing. And then I'll stop them and go,

210
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:05,150
what have you tested already? And they're like, oh, I can go do this. And I could go do that.

211
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,790
And I'm like, okay, great. Let's yeah, let's do that. And they'll go off and do it and come

212
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,350
back and be like, oh, I found some other stuff. I'm like, that's awesome. Let's make sure we're

213
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:22,270
tracking. So I feel like that. Yeah. Yeah. What, you know, what have you done already is definitely a

214
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,510
great question. And it does seem like, like turning the question into a question. It's like,

215
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:31,630
you're asking me a question, but I'm going to ask you a question, which is fine.

216
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,230
I think sometimes we just need somebody to help us jog our brains.

217
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,790
Yeah. Yeah. Just give you new things to think about. There's like the really good,

218
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,950
like a really good swimming coach. I'm not a swimmer, so I'm going to make something up here.

219
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,390
Might say, might ask questions like, do you feel like your hands are in the right position?

220
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,950
Like you don't want to change too much at once. Just give them the one question to

221
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,210
think about for the next lap. Right. Like how did that feel?

222
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:04,010
Those are, so those are like in sports coaching, a good coach just ask questions about what's going

223
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,690
on to try and get someone to think about what's happening. I think it's very applicable to use

224
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:13,050
things like that in managing knowledge workers as well.

225
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:20,730
So trick from my therapist, and she's done this several times. She's a somatic therapist.

226
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,170
So it's not only about like what you're saying, but what you're feeling at the time that you're

227
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,450
saying something. So I'll be talking about something and she'll stop me and ask me like

228
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,770
where I'm feeling that. Like how does that feel to say that? Like what is the feeling

229
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,570
that's coming up? So I think it's a very similar thing. Maybe that's a little bit deeper

230
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:44,810
into it, but the idea that you're kind of thinking about the different connections between

231
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,770
the words and the actions, right? Or the words and the feelings and trying to understand how

232
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:57,050
those two actually fit together. But we can do that as managers. I think when you have the developer

233
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,450
come to you say, Hey, I found some bugs, right? I found some issues. That's just great. But you

234
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,130
could also ask at that point, it's like, how do you feel about that? They go, it's kind of fun.

235
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,090
And just acknowledging that is a pretty powerful management or leadership tool as well.

236
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,730
Yeah, definitely. That's not something I've done yet, but I think that I

237
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,210
am writing that down right now.

238
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:29,530
I'm here to help. So one thing the listeners don't know is that Melissa and I chat every other

239
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:35,530
week anyway. I hired her at Unity and I'm happy to hear of her continued success. So

240
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:43,040
we check in and make sure things are going well. So one last question, one thing I never tell

241
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,320
someone I'm hiring into a management position. It's one of the things all managers have to learn

242
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,880
at some point and it's nothing short. And the re maybe the reason I don't describe it is not

243
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:02,080
bait and switch. It's because you just can't know what to expect. So with that lead in for any

244
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,960
aspirational managers out there, this one thing I want you to dig into and share some stories on

245
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:14,640
for awhile. And that is as a manager, you manage people and sometimes you need to hire people. So

246
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,080
I would like to hear Melissa's adventures and hiring because I'm sure there are some good bits of

247
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:27,920
information and or stories that we may need to change the names to protect the guilty,

248
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:32,800
but we'll see what happens. So what's it like? It's always, I don't know how I could prepare you for

249
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:39,680
it. So I'll just say that. So that's my attempt at an apology. But tell me about what you've learned

250
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,840
hiring and recruiting and that part of the manager's role.

251
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:52,240
I've learned you need to be really engaged with the recruiter.

252
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,320
Like and early on you said patient. So maybe that comes up here again too.

253
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,560
All right. I'm going to shut up now. Definitely. Definitely patients.

254
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,830
As a manager, one of the first things you need to learn how to do is really engage with a recruiter

255
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:15,020
and that's a process like learning them, having them learn you, setting expectations.

256
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,780
That's probably the hardest. And I've been through a couple of recruiters now

257
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,180
and everybody's different. It's like every person you hire is different. So

258
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,750
one of the things that some recruiters are really good at making sure that you have a diverse pool.

259
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,990
Some of them are very focused on the technical aspects of what you're looking for. So then you

260
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:44,160
have to remind them that you want a diverse pool. There's also, you could have a really

261
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:53,450
diverse pool, really technically sound folks that are interviewing and then your salary ranges

262
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:58,490
are out of place with the folks that you have in your pool. Like there's all of these aspects

263
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,850
that I didn't really think about when I came in and was like, Oh, I'm going to hire some people.

264
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:09,450
I'm going to hire the best people I can hire. Well, I have to hire the best talent I can find

265
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:16,170
and the most objective way for the money I have available. And I think I didn't entirely

266
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:26,410
understand that equation until I was forced into it and then realize that sometimes you have to,

267
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,820
this really good candidate over here is really expensive and this other really good candidate

268
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,540
is not asking for enough. And it's like, how do you balance all that on top of a

269
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,780
trying to make sure that you're not throwing the baby out with the bathwater when it kind of comes

270
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:58,300
with different aspects of hiring for women or hiring men or hiring people of color and making

271
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,740
sure that everybody has a fair shake and developing a rubric and standardizing how people

272
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:11,080
are interviewed. And because I was the team manager that had to hire the most people, I got to

273
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,040
develop all of that as a first time manager for our office because we didn't have it.

274
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:23,320
It's one of those things, Ash Coleman actually asked her, Tess Bash Brighton, like, what should

275
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,200
I do to make sure I'm hiring the right folks and making sure I'm doing it objectively. And she was

276
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,200
like, you need a rubric. And then I was like, well, how the hell do I do that? And then a very

277
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:42,360
nice chap that I'm totally forgetting his name sent me a copy of his rubric under penalty.

278
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,960
It's probably a good thing that I don't remember his name, so I'm not going to divulge. He was like,

279
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,880
please don't tell anybody I shared this with you. I was like, okay. But he gave me...

280
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,600
I'm glad I do not have to edit a name out of the podcast.

281
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:59,000
But he knows who he is. Hopefully he listens. But he's really cool. He sent an example to me

282
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:05,580
and I took that example and then created our own template. And then everybody in our group

283
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,420
adopted that. And it's really helped, I think, to change it from sort of this gut feeling about

284
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,860
a candidate to something a little bit more objective. It's still objective because everybody

285
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,860
interviews differently. They will ask the same questions, but there's still that individual

286
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:30,940
perspective on it. So yeah. And then developing a way to measure technical talent in a way that I

287
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,300
thought actually fit the role that people were trying to take on versus some really esoteric

288
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,340
coding test that really didn't fit what we were doing at Unity. So there was that aspect of it,

289
00:26:43,340 --> 00:27:00,270
too. And I think the end result was I got four really qualified people. And I'm very happy with

290
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:07,950
the team that is no longer going to be my team because I'm developing a new team. But those people

291
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:14,590
are very talented and they're doing really exceptionally well. And that, I think,

292
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:21,870
if I point to one success I've had this year was doing that. And I feel like I did the right

293
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:30,750
things and I hired the right people. And I don't know that I would have been as successful if I

294
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:37,070
wasn't very brazen about asking all the questions and staying on top of the recruitment. It's like,

295
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,710
hey, do I have all the resumes? Did I look at everything? Why do we have more men in this pool

296
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:51,070
than women? What is your exclusion? How are you filtering these things? And I probably annoyed

297
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,710
the crap out of a lot of people, but I just asked a lot of questions and just kept at it.

298
00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:04,460
Because I wanted to make sure we hired the right people for the job and hired the right talent

299
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,460
and got talented people in the door that had skill sets and potential for growth and potential

300
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:21,260
to teach people things and really understood what it would be to be on a team and to also have that

301
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:27,580
independence and the drive to learn for themselves but also be willing to work in a cooperative. Which

302
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:32,380
I think is really hard. I think there are some aspects about software development that are still

303
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,780
hanging around that you have to be this hero developer or hero tester. And I really tried

304
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:42,460
very hard to hire people to squash that. Like, hey, I need you to work independently, but I also

305
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:49,660
need you to actually cooperate with people too and work in a team. And then I'm pretty confident

306
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:57,260
that the people I've hired are good at doing both. So that's more than anything. I'm really

307
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:05,390
happy. Yeah, that's great. I often speak of the need to train recruiters and often what happens

308
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,750
is you just get them where you want them. They move on to some other role and you go, no, I have

309
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:17,390
to start over again. No. So we just filled the final two openings on my new team. So both of

310
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:22,110
those people are starting on Monday. So that would be very nice. And then I don't have to

311
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:26,830
talk to recruiting because I'm not planning on doing any more hiring at all in 2020. And

312
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:32,990
I feel pretty good about retention across the team. So I think I'm done because it takes a lot

313
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,830
of time, right? Oh, yeah. Like from, I think that's the other really frustrating thing is a lead time

314
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,030
can be anywhere from three to six months to hire somebody. I think other people definitely

315
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,990
underestimate how long it takes because then you have to go through a hire, like recruiting.

316
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,470
So people send resumes all the time, but then they have to go through and kind of manage all of

317
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,830
that. And then you have to work with a recruiter and then they have to have a phone screen. Then

318
00:29:56,830 --> 00:30:04,270
you have to have a phone screen. And then there's the different technical thing aspects of it. And

319
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:11,950
then onsite interviews. And then if you're interviewing three to five people per job

320
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:20,350
opening, which should be the minimum, it shouldn't just be like a one shot thing. Then

321
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,480
yeah, that all takes a lot of time and people get really frustrated if it goes too fast or it goes

322
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,360
too slow. And it's like, I get it. Sometimes I get frustrated about that too. And I understand

323
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,200
when it's not easy on either side of that fence, like being the person that's in that hiring

324
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,280
process or being the person that's trying to hire somebody because you want, you just want to do the

325
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:50,800
right thing. And sometimes the process does not make it easy to do the right thing. Yep. Yeah.

326
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,130
Yep. Fully agree. Well, although we talk all the time, or at least frequently,

327
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:05,610
it's been great having you on ABT 343. I will post links to your blog and to Twitter.

328
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:10,090
Anything else I should know about on the internet you'd like people to have a link to?

329
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:18,970
No. Twitter's good. And the blog is still going. I need to put up a, it's been an adventure. I think

330
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:24,410
the last time I posted was December. So I need to update my manager year one to manager year two

331
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:30,410
or something. Oh yeah. You have an update due. Yes, I have an update too. And of course, I

332
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:36,330
gave up on blogging, but I sort of fell in love with the five links every Friday thing. So I do

333
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:42,410
that. And sometimes I find some good ones in there. Uh, so yeah, that's my thing. It's not really

334
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:48,890
blogging. It's more of re what's that called re blogging. It's really, I'm just taking five

335
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,890
things I could have tweeted and putting them into a blog post at the end of the week. Yeah,

336
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:57,690
but it still works. I retweet that tweet all the time. And I, and I look over those blogs,

337
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:03,050
I don't read all of them, but I do, I do look them over. So it's, it's worth it. I think, um,

338
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:06,730
it's one of the things I like to do with my Twitter quite a bit, uh, especially on the technical

339
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:12,650
side is, you know, somebody blogs something or posts at it. Oh, I'm a, I'm a retweet person for

340
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:18,650
sure. Cause I think it's cool. Yeah. All right. Well tag me on Twitter and she'll retweet your

341
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:24,330
tag coverage of reach, reach. All right. Well, thank you. And we'll see you soon.
