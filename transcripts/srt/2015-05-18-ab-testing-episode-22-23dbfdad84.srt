1
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,440
I'm Alan. I'm Brent. I let Brent sit down barely before starting today, but we're back for episode

2
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,420
20-20-20-20. I used to know how to do it in

3
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,240
zwei one

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,240
wait ein zwei

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,190
Yeah, no, I've forgotten how to say it. Okay, the the multilingual version of A-B testing will not be releasing this week

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,110
We're on episode 22. I forgot for a moment, but now I remember and good to see you Brent

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,550
Good to be seen by you Alan

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,540
So we get shall we get going? Yes. Hey, I read some I got some mail this week

9
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,620
And I'm just gonna read the first sentence of it. I want to see what you think

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,240
I like reading mail to Brent dearest at no, we're sorry wrong one wrong one

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,120
The mail says with agile becoming more and more popular

12
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,260
It seems like everyone is running iterative development these days

13
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:15,160
It goes on from there. Is that it? No, it goes on from there. So but that one opening sentence

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,580
Kind of pushed my buttons in a way that probably isn't obvious to a lot of people

15
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,300
No, it's obvious to me it is but you are not a lot of people are you? No, you're not a lot of people

16
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,220
So what by body weight? I'm at least two ah

17
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,460
Shush

18
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:36,380
Shush shush what caught your ear there are mr. J

19
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:42,770
There are oh to do you have a doctorate not yet. I can't call you. Dr. J

20
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,390
You'll just be mr. B

21
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,940
So what was it that pushed to what what kind were actually two things that bothered me about that sentence

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,980
It was a short sentence. Please tell me that read the sentence again. Oh damn it. I mean, okay sure

23
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:04,740
All right with agile becoming more and more popular. It seems like everyone is running

24
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,330
Iterative development these days. Yes, the two things that bothered me is

25
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,910
this idea of

26
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,780
You should go with agile because it's more popular. Ah, yeah and

27
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,740
This idea that agile and iterative are the same thing

28
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,780
Yeah, the second one really it's funny

29
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,020
You mentioned both of those because the second one is what caught my my ear initially and said not of I cry foul

30
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,620
And we'll go into that in a minute, but it's interesting

31
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,660
I just polished up my keynote for Star Canada a

32
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,060
Couple days ago yesterday day before and we lose your submission. Oh the submission was a while back

33
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,940
this is a slide deck, but one of the things that

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,830
Kind of came to me as I was putting this stuff together is in the takeaway is you don't make changes like this because they're popular

35
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,210
Or because you know, they're interesting you have to have a reason why although it just for many many reasons talking about leadership

36
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,290
But yeah, really important agile is popular. Let's do agile. It's a really

37
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,290
Stupid thing to do and a great way to screw up agile and a great way to make crummy software. It's

38
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,530
So I actually just before here Alan

39
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,770
I I did another coaching session and so I have a variant of agile that I teach people

40
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,230
It's a two-hour training session and literally I finished another session an hour ago

41
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,030
Okay, the very first slide I spend 15 minutes discussing. What is agile and

42
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,960
These people who

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:43,620
Push it forward as a popularity thing helps to encourage it to becoming a fad and it makes it a lot

44
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,320
Freaking harder for me to get these people to understand that it is not a religious

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,120
Doc a dogma. It's not a fad. It's actually the scientific method in action and

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,800
And it is makes it so much harder to open

47
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,020
Minds when you already have a prevailing belief number one that it's a fad or number two

48
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,800
You have dumbasses in this company who read the first chapter of the scrum book and look at the first paragraph of the other

49
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,400
Agile manifesto and then come back and tell me it's about

50
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,960
Iterations well, it's funny

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,400
We're gonna we're gonna go way off from the weeds and come back and get on this

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,560
That's a very important point

53
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
But while you were talking I was thinking in doing some research for my talk

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,840
I came across this a couple articles sort of bashing agile, but for different reasons and some good reasons

55
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,160
I'm not but one started off very interesting

56
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,060
Interestingly said that my team's doing agile. I think it's effin stupid

57
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,460
But I want you guys to help me out. It's not an as some agile forum

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,980
Then he goes as I understand agile. It's this and he described scrum

59
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Yeah, which I thought was interesting

60
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,020
Which you know again scrum is not agile

61
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,900
well

62
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,420
Implementing scrum and you know accurately is it is a way of implementing agile

63
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,540
There is a way of implementing scrum that is completely non agile. Absolutely. Yeah, exactly

64
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,140
the just because you did did

65
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,860
70% of scrum

66
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:26,380
Doesn't mean you're agile. Yeah, and the other thing I thought while you were talking was I

67
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,460
Would bet nine out of ten agile coaches are people that whether they're called agile coach whether they help their team with agile

68
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,340
not I would say nine of ten agile advocates wish there was a new word for it because the agile ward has been so screwed up and

69
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,420
bastardized well there

70
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,800
We we have got to have already talked about this

71
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,480
No, I don't know. I don't know that

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:59,880
Let's let's what the point I wanted to get to and the point I promise I in the strategy actually we could go back from

73
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
year one

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,080
Shut up, shut up. Yes. So yes, there is and I'm thinking through like the very first thing

75
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,890
the first slide

76
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,970
No, second slide first slides the goal slide second slide is what is agile?

77
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:23,420
Because I before I go and they talked about everything else. I want to get these guys out of their head that

78
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,980
Agile is iteration or agile is scrum or agile is some other thing that it's not

79
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,420
Okay

80
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:38,100
You're I really wanted to have like a big bang on what agile was I'm gonna let you give your get to the you

81
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
What is agile you have agile?

82
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,490
Well, um, can I has agile put in the macat sure

83
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,390
Not one with the cat meme. I've got actually real work to do

84
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,230
I don't I don't have the time to spin like you do trolling for anyway

85
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
Moving on

86
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,170
The first thing I do actually when I do these presentations I now have a I learned of a game called the penny game and

87
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,960
It's it's basically I put a simulation

88
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,560
Of the team through three different phases of how to improve their throughput and the first thing is I set them up at teams

89
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,260
I actually give them ten coins of different denominations and I

90
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,100
And usually I have multiple teams today. I had three teams competing against each other

91
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,990
Ten coins of multiple denominations and they put them in a cup. The first thing is that they have to

92
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:46,070
The output is every person on the team has to have recorded the result of a coin flip

93
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,060
But they have to execute that coin flip in denomination order

94
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:59,770
So quarters before dimes times before nickels blah blah blah. Okay. Now the first path I bike. Okay, it goes in the cup

95
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:05,510
First person has to flip all coins and record it put the coins back in the cup and then pass it to the next person

96
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:11,440
And you do that through the team. I call that waterfall mood. All right, okay, and it is

97
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,430
the

98
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,980
I've now done this several times and every time I go through the first phase

99
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:23,040
I will tell you I have done this like ten times and I I personally hate phase one

100
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,600
Today the fastest team got got through there were only four people got through it all in three minutes, but it felt like 15

101
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,220
It was just like oh this thing is dragging on

102
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,910
Then I

103
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,590
Modify it and I tell them

104
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:43,030
Okay. Now what you're gonna do is one coin at a time you flip a coin

105
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,830
You can then pass the coin to the next person and they can go through the chain teaching them flow like a combo flow

106
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,430
Okay, okay. Everybody does the quarter. Everybody does the dime. All right

107
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,670
First person starts he flips his coin records it. He can now pass the coin to the next person

108
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,060
They can flip and and now people are

109
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,840
Parallelizing and it goes a much faster and usually that takes about a minute and then the third phase what I do is I say

110
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,520
Okay. Now teams we're gonna give you one minute to discuss your strategy and then we're gonna do it same way last time

111
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,230
That I only care about these two outcomes

112
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,730
That coins are done in order first and everyone has a result recorded and

113
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
that third phase

114
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,930
everybody improved

115
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,490
another

116
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,970
20% off of their prior time now the three minutes went down to a minute

117
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,210
Like it cut it in a third and then there was another 20% off of that minute

118
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,730
and

119
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,890
that last phase is is intended to introduce them to

120
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,010
how you can prove things if you work as a team work together towards the goal versus

121
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,930
What we talk about all this time the the

122
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,890
groups of specialists

123
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,370
conveniently classified under the name team

124
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,290
Drives me nuts

125
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,980
the

126
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,820
That should be what I call phase two now specialists specialists under flow

127
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,500
now the next thing I do is I said

128
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:21,450
agile and

129
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,900
learning

130
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
go hand-in-hand and

131
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,260
agile is the ability to

132
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,760
adapt to

133
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,480
Adapt quickly to changing phenomenon

134
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,700
That's one of the things iterations doesn't do right? We've talked about it here before

135
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,180
I

136
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:47,260
Know we've talked about it because I called him out and then he talked to it was Steve Rowe and he talked about it

137
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,060
At our next lunch. He once told me

138
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,980
Windows is agile. We do iterations

139
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,490
right and and

140
00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:01,220
It's and that was an important insight because with his and my conversation allowed me to understand

141
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:07,400
What is actually wrong with the word that there's power in well, I think two things happen one is there's this blind

142
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Ignorance or belief that iterations

143
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,960
Equals agile but some people I know believe

144
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,720
definition of the word iteration has included well you you reflect and adapt at the end and

145
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,060
So it's they're still wrong. Yeah, but the point I like to bring up is I worked on I just got mail my

146
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,080
Invited me this September to the win 95 team reunion. They're having 120 year union. Okay, that's my first project at Microsoft

147
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,080
It was mine, too

148
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
Uh-huh

149
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,920
Would you work on it when 95 I was on the at work fax team a little Oh a little stupid come something. Yeah

150
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,120
Something nobody used I worked on networking

151
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:54,040
I made sure you could connect to network networks. So that is relevant today as your fax machine

152
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,350
Yeah

153
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,390
Anyway, we were we were on iterations

154
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,710
We had three-month milestones and sure we knew the work that was planned for each milestone, you know a year in advance

155
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,710
But there were iterations. Yeah

156
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,310
well, and the thing is

157
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,040
like

158
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,760
Kanban, which is in my view significantly more agile than scrum is I

159
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,700
agree

160
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,260
There's not an iteration in there. I know

161
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
It's a continuous flow

162
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,230
now

163
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,830
when everyone thinks of iterations like that they

164
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,740
Think of every sort of PR material you'll you have ever seen on agile, right?

165
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,060
I'm currently visualizing in my head Reese's build measure learn loop

166
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,660
Okay

167
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:47,380
Mm-hmm, and and I think what's happening to these people are just looking at this thing not reading the words not processing and just going

168
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:50,060
Oh, it's a circle must be iterations

169
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,520
Right and they're missing. Yeah, like learn

170
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,840
One of the ways I tell the story I'm not going to mention the team today

171
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:06,600
But I've seen situations where it's both basically build measure build measure build measure build measure

172
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
Right. That's a loop too it is but it's not agile

173
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,600
not adaptive and

174
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,960
What you're talking I thought of and hopefully even though we haven't actually directly getting kind of the point between iteration and being adaptive and adaptive

175
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,240
and learning and

176
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,480
Elizabeth Hendrickson's litmus test for agile and I'm gonna probably

177
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,560
Badly paraphrase this but I'll get close is something very close to

178
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,400
Agile is delivering frequent customer value at a sustainable pace

179
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:44,340
It's it's and nothing in there quite that but very close get close enough to know that that and I like it because that doesn't

180
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,700
imply iterations it implies delivering value and

181
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:54,570
Imply a sustainable pace, but the important thing that gets missed

182
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,440
it from her side

183
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,440
Isn't in her sentence, right?

184
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,730
That what you're gonna say it's implied. Okay, because what she says is delivering customer value

185
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,050
Not delivering code to customer. Ah

186
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,770
Yeah

187
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,090
Let's take a moment to ponder that how many teams you bet on the delivered value

188
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:20,490
Versus delivering features that may or may not be used how many teams have I been on? Yeah, I could think some I've been up most

189
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,590
of

190
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,550
Matter of fact

191
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,600
It's made a it's made me it

192
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,730
It's made me it

193
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,930
It's it's been a brand of mine

194
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,230
Because of that

195
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,830
People call me out and want me to come in and work on their team

196
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,070
because I they view me as having a customer focus and

197
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,760
And

198
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
There was a

199
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,820
buddy of mine that now works outside of Microsoft and he was describing a story where like I

200
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:03,400
wish you had been here to do this because this the project if you had managed it it would have been much faster much sooner and

201
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:12,520
People would be happier. Right? It's um, I mentioned this on the podcast before what the the variant then shut up

202
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:19,040
People can go back and listen to all the podcasts. They're not gonna okay fine finish you just finish you just did the stats for that

203
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,120
One of the key things that I have added to the variant of agile that I teach now is

204
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,960
After it's released most most scrum boards. It goes check in done

205
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,450
Okay, not mine. It's it's checked in and

206
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,010
Then it's released

207
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,490
Then it's validated by the customer

208
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:48,880
Then it's done. I'm not gonna call it done until I've proven that the requirement assumptions

209
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,160
Of why we built this code are proven true

210
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,920
We built this code because we intended it to add some value to somebody before we really progress further on the plan

211
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,720
Or maybe not before I'm not gonna necessarily block

212
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,240
But I want to get that out get that validation done

213
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Because if that's gonna negatively impact the rest of my plan, I want to know now

214
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,000
Yeah, I like that a lot. I've worked with orgs where the

215
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,170
Getting that feature done

216
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,310
Was the ultimate goal?

217
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:30,930
Done and checked in and and not much beyond there. There was with it's done

218
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,290
And I know I'm gonna have to fix a bunch of bugs and make it work and add some fit and finish

219
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,810
But for now it's done and for me, it's not even close. I

220
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,610
have a

221
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:48,400
Litmus tests I use quite often and it sort of discusses

222
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,320
Three common software development paradigms that I see a lot

223
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,680
first and foremost

224
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,720
waterfall

225
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,300
What you see is that they're trying to constantly ask the question is the plan on track

226
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,610
It that's it all we care about. Did you get this thing done by this date?

227
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:18,680
I wouldn't even necessarily I agree with that and that's the iterative model

228
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,240
Yes, the only the only part I would question on that is

229
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,530
another thing pushing my buttons is waterfall and

230
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:33,290
Agile are not necessarily opposites and very few teams actually do true waterfall

231
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
But which is as it should be

232
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,520
Okay, but I but I get the point I get the point

233
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Alan and I talks about this a lot

234
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,160
That particular topic right the thing is is

235
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:57,160
Waterfall true waterfall was written in this this white paper. I know Alan remembers the other yep

236
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,720
But no one actually executes it so so no in the paper

237
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:07,960
He's not a little dangerous and prone to error no, but waterfall today is whatever the serial

238
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,280
Fazed gated sure crap that people used to and it's gonna be very similar

239
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:21,120
Scrum in 10 years is not gonna be what Schwab wrote. It's what the society has turned it into. Okay, sure

240
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,770
But waterfall is the plan on track

241
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,790
Agile is

242
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,950
Focused on is the plan correct?

243
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,690
That the important thing there, of course

244
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,510
For I haven't had to deal with this a long time

245
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,470
But when I first started dealing with this people were saying Oh Agile is just about doing whatever you want no plan

246
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:49,510
no, it's about having a plan but not but building the plan in as lightweight as

247
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:57,110
Possible and a high ROI plan and building in that learning which is really important like we're going planning to we're gonna do this

248
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,830
And then we're going to learn and adjust and constantly

249
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,270
Evaluating that the plan is still correct and if it's not shift are we doing the right thing or are we building software?

250
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,190
That's wonderfully functional that nobody will use and there's a third one

251
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,860
which I

252
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:19,160
Call Jedi and this is the teams. It's an acronym JDI God

253
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,630
These are those teams that ask the question plan

254
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:29,040
Just do it

255
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,840
We don't need no plan for those in the software industry the the typical word

256
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,370
Is cowboy?

257
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,050
Jedi teams and cowboy they're one of the same. They don't need a plan

258
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,130
Not only the PM's all

259
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,100
Potential the next Steve Jobs, so is the dev team

260
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:58,220
We're always right. We don't need a plan. We're smart. We'll get it done. I have never met a cowboy dev team

261
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,420
that

262
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,300
Wasn't chock-full of five-star devs just asked them

263
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,230
Of course

264
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,810
the

265
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,320
Yeah, do we cover both of those popular? I don't know. I don't know where you're going with that. Oh

266
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,040
so the main thing I wanted to cover was

267
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,140
iterative and adaptive and with that and to me agile is adaptive that learning part is

268
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,380
Absolutely critical and just being iterative has nothing to do with agile

269
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:39,300
Well again, I hear that the groans from the audience that haven't heard this through the time machine through the internet already

270
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,180
Yes, just because you iterate doesn't mean you're agile

271
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:49,980
I've been on many very non agile opposite agile products that were iterative and you don't have to iterate to be agile

272
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,580
Yeah, that's exactly and that's the main point I wanted to make I think that main point is can you adapt and learn?

273
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:59,580
you do have to be iterative to be waterfall and scrum and

274
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,000
You don't have to be agile to be waterfall and scrum

275
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,780
All right, and apologies if you're listening to this and I made fun of your email, but it did lead to a good topic

276
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:19,060
So I know you meant well, so you can actually be agile in the traditional waterfall method as well

277
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,660
That's much harder to learn when you have phase delivery

278
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,220
But if you think about the example I said on the penny game, right?

279
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,360
So the problem is is that each individual?

280
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,040
Completed their all their work before they got it done if they broke it into the smaller pieces

281
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,240
Wait, they turn it into a food. You just said they completed their work before they got it done

282
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,200
I'm sorry each individual so I had teams of four and then no to answer your question

283
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,360
I didn't hear what I said. Yeah teams of four and let's say those teams are four were

284
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I don't know make something up a

285
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,340
Design guy a PM guy a dev guy and a tester guy

286
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:04,440
Right what we see nowadays is you have design complete

287
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,720
spec complete dev complete test complete and

288
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,280
All of this work gets chunked as full completeness in order to get to done a simple fix

289
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,180
Cut that crap out do one small item

290
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,300
Design gets it done hands it off to PM

291
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,940
he works on that while the design guy starts working on his next thing and

292
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:34,180
Shift it through and if you do that you can turn turned waterfall into something significantly more agile and perhaps even

293
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:40,150
Agile that's what you described is very close to Kanban. It's exactly combo

294
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,890
Except even then like so did you just say Kanban is waterfall?

295
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:53,570
No, you can you got you can waterfall with but by letting I'm just trying to shove words in your mouth piss you off

296
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,730
But the other thing to also keep in mind

297
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:03,160
Based on the context that we're talking here, right? You can do Kanban and not be agile. Oh, yeah

298
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:10,180
I can see that right you can just constantly flow if you're not evaluating that if if what you're doing is correct or valuable

299
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:17,100
This is again why Elizabeth's thing is so so important and it's so easy to gloss over

300
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:23,100
Yes, I agree and I was gonna say something else clever and important, but I forgot what it was

301
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,950
So we're gonna go on to item two, which I don't know what it is. Why don't you kick it off Brent? Okay

302
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,650
If you think about it in terms of power and words

303
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:42,910
Like here's here's another phenomenon that I've noticed we've talked about in the past. So we've talked about

304
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,630
me joining the data science team

305
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,250
And we've also talked about

306
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:55,730
Data science as a buzzword. I think most listeners remember the high school

307
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,220
sex metaphor

308
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,500
But the thing that's interesting is even the people with the title

309
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,140
Aren't really trying to improve themselves

310
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,620
What you're seeing is a lot of people spinning up

311
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:15,300
Reporting only teams and saying oh well, I built a report that's data science. Yeah

312
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
It's an insight

313
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,940
no

314
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,220
They ever share with you my last manager one of the metrics one of the KPIs he wanted to judge me under

315
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,860
was TTI

316
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,790
Time to insight and I said wow

317
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,810
That's a fantastic one. I can

318
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:41,910
Completely understand what you're trying to say because he wanted me to help shorten the velocity of insight production

319
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:47,990
But I just need one thing he's like after hearing me being so positive of his feedback

320
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:50,780
He's like, yeah, what?

321
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,130
What's an insight? How do I measure it? How do I know if it occurred?

322
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,060
The

323
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:03,460
When when you get that little tingly feeling in the back of your neck, that's an insight. I'm

324
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
One of the things that's happening right now

325
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,020
there's there's a

326
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:13,370
So people are just producing reports and it's sort of the build it and they will come

327
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:19,280
Hope and then what they're discovering not very adaptive. It's not

328
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,000
Hey for those of you who are in this space, I'm gonna share with you a very critical

329
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,140
KPI that I've developed

330
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:36,500
That I suggest that you use if you're in this world where you're essentially doing report production and not necessarily doing

331
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:39,900
Analysis and helping to try to shorten insight

332
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:46,820
Value or insight production and tie together relationships between key variables if you're just doing reports

333
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
instrument your reports and

334
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:58,410
measure one thing and that is the number of people who are using your report the day after

335
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,130
The key executive review or whatever the hell you built the report for

336
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,700
Alright, because the fact that because they found it useful it would be your metric there, right?

337
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,860
If you finding yourself building reports that are only used the day before

338
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,740
Essentially for slide where then you're not really

339
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,930
Providing value. These are reports that a PM you need to figure out a way to

340
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:31,370
Those things done. Let me let me one up you or go a different angle here

341
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,690
I think the build it and they will come thing drives me crazy. I work with orgs that are

342
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:43,690
They love this they want to build the thing that's for everyone, but they don't unveil it until it's not ready yet

343
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,530
We got to do more here and my approach is if I'm if you ask me say hey Alan

344
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,570
Can you do a report for me that shows the food bars the fish bats?

345
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,370
But a bit of that I don't go yeah, and I'm gonna draw it on the whiteboard for you

346
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,690
You watch look something like this and you know, no, I'm gonna erase some stuff and I go like yeah something like that

347
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,250
It'd be good. That okay. I got feedback from my customer

348
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:09,490
I take a little picture with my phone then I go to the web browser and it gets them Excel and I mock it up

349
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,850
I don't even use real data

350
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:17,010
I make a picture of it and I and it's and maybe it's it's pulling like mock data from a database something very simple

351
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,010
I put it in a web page and I go hey brand is what we talked about. He's gonna check it out

352
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:26,490
He goes. Oh the fizzle puzzle doesn't I rather have that be more important and a little feedback from him

353
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,450
And maybe some of his peers look at it, too

354
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,850
I start spreading it out and they go yeah, it's pretty I think I could use it like this

355
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,930
And the fizzle boss could the food die to the flu die

356
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,930
So we get that happening and then actually get some pull in some real data

357
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,010
I know there's a lot of normalization they want to have down the road

358
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,730
But I want to make sure we get all the pieces in there

359
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:49,790
So it isn't until we've gone that far that actually I'm not looking for I don't care about insights yet

360
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:57,010
I care about usefulness. I think the insights will come once that becomes useful. I do one before you go too much further

361
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:07,230
I do one thing different. I do everything you just did but I do one thing first I

362
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:16,020
Ask what are you gonna do when you have this report? I do that's what I asked. I do two things I say

363
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:23,580
Who do you expect to use this report and what actions do you expect them to take upon?

364
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,260
Viewing the data. Yeah, I do those things too, but I got so excited about starting off

365
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,540
With the with the implementation being something stupid simple

366
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,360
That's you can do in five minutes figure out if you're on the right track or your understanding is correct

367
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,980
But yes, and there's the the Jim Moore question. Let's say you had this then what do you do with it?

368
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,280
That's a great. Let's say you have this this is the report. Yeah

369
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,680
Very question. I almost always ask I

370
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,760
Say almost sometimes I forget but rarely I always ask for something if any significance

371
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,040
So what are we gonna do when we have this so I get some idea of the user case

372
00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:03,480
Anyway, I'm going to it's gonna be very simple until I don't need to start adding things that I think are clever and interesting

373
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,960
and and pretty stuff until I

374
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:13,160
Actually think it's going to be useful for a large part of the audience that was designed for and I can iterate through that and learn

375
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:21,030
Very very quickly. Yep. I'm undergoing that right now with a with a project that I just picked up

376
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,830
I just hate to go build it and they will come approaches cuz they happen so often

377
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,910
The the the initial approach so

378
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,830
One of my peers has fallen ill he's he's better again

379
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:35,310
but he had been designing this thing and

380
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:42,060
Basically what he had been doing is getting the requirements from from p.m. And when then I went I saw this

381
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I'm like first question. I saw the design from RPM and I said who's the customer of this?

382
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,000
What decisions are they trying to make off of this data?

383
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,600
And what actions are you gonna take based off of those decisions? And then I came back a day later with a new design

384
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,420
optimized

385
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,500
for

386
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:07,020
That decision-making process I said hey look if this is what you're trying to do with the data

387
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
I can simplify that for you

388
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,980
It's frustrating to me on the on the report side

389
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:18,740
Because what we see is a lot of PM's still doing this this requirement driven model. Mmm

390
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,500
I have this awesome intuition and I'm awesome and I'm just gonna write up a document with the

391
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:27,580
Requirements and send it to you and then you implement it and I'm like look dude

392
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,700
I'm a data science team not a dev team you try that crap someplace else

393
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,220
Okay

394
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:41,290
In data science. I want to know what your decisions are and I'll happy to help you iterate towards them the

395
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,510
The problem is even the PM

396
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,950
Doesn't know what the decisions they're trying to do. They're not identifying the goal

397
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:54,820
This is why that key PI I was mentioning is really critical

398
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:02,100
Yeah, it can be shown up in in in this executive review and it essentially ends up being a bunch of vanity metrics

399
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:08,140
But if you want to drive real value, you want to drive real change you want to accelerate the business

400
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
you need to

401
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,690
Make sure people are

402
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:22,320
Acting on what you're doing and you need to make sure you're providing the right action ability into your design

403
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,120
This is a why I think actually agile and data science are critical that they go hand to hand

404
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,900
But the topic I wanted to talk about is the next thing

405
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,470
That's happening is as these teams are building all these reports and not measuring that no one's using them

406
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:47,980
They're they're beginning to understand the maintenance costs of keeping all these reports that no one uses online

407
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:54,350
Because what they did is they followed your model for for building a prototype

408
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:03,640
Except they call it the product and I see I see a lot of these folks that may not have a lot of expertise in

409
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,000
Data science yet, but they came from friggin dev and they suddenly just forgot oop

410
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:14,530
Like okay, you got the prototype now we need to harden this and we need to operationalize it

411
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:17,210
So why are you trying to?

412
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,370
Create a lot of the projects I have

413
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,930
Literally have thousands of input streams and instead of trying to manage this like in an async model

414
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:35,370
They pull all these input streams together and they wait for all of them to coalesce and all the data has to be there

415
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,650
And then they're gonna aggregate it up and such that if one fails

416
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:46,390
No report that week if if and of course because you have so many data streams

417
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,930
one fails every day and

418
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,690
Just befuddled that they're forgetting this the how to design

419
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,600
The second thing is I'm finding that

420
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
again the power in words

421
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,770
Data science being a buzzword. That's absolutely a buzzword and something

422
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:13,570
If it means nothing if the current Microsoft culture continues to persist it'll eventually mean something

423
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,370
That's entirely opposite of how the rest of the world uses it

424
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,170
Right am sorry world

425
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,100
Sorry in advance

426
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,540
It's our fault

427
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
We view it as innovation

428
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
but things like

429
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
normalizing your data

430
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,020
Doing data conformance

431
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,380
These are concepts that are key to data engineering to be able to light up data science and

432
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,140
And people are just skipping over these things

433
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,920
In I had a I had a long discussion yesterday

434
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:52,930
Where I had to sit down and explain to them

435
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,420
Normalization does not mean everybody uses the same schema now

436
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,460
Alan I don't know that you if you have my data engineering skills

437
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:08,900
But I do not in this case trust me it doesn't and if ever that word comes up in database you call

438
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,820
Unky Brent and I'll help you. Thank you, Brent. What's the database?

439
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:18,080
It is a it is any file that contains data

440
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
Sure is

441
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,940
All right

442
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:30,520
We're doing a bunch of ranting today. I was gonna say something very cynical about data science and about what you're talking about

443
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,960
But I'm feeling good. I want to move on and

444
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,640
Let's jump right into vanity metrics, but we're not gonna talk about vanity metrics, but Brent wanted

445
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
I sent Brent some mail this week. I

446
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,520
Finally for the first time ever went to look up the downloads for our podcasts and

447
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,680
Gave Brent the numbers, but am I wonderful provider lost all of my downloads stats for 2014 and 2013

448
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,330
So we only have 2015

449
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,330
Brent

450
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,090
Seem to think there was some insights there

451
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:05,490
I thought the numbers are kind of small they the variance isn't that big

452
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:10,010
They sort of taper off and in orders that make sense to me

453
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:13,230
But wait the order makes sense to you. I

454
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,330
Yes, it does the order of the counts the order well

455
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:23,090
Let's talk about what you think is an insight and I'll explain to you why I think it is

456
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,240
It is within the realm of normalcy

457
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:33,750
Okay, that's that's not like a good way to do this sure. All right. So what what was something that you thought was

458
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,830
What popped out as you as well? That's interesting there

459
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:44,270
There were two things that I found interesting and and I will say the first one I would I would agree with you

460
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,140
When we're talking about statistically interesting we're talking about

461
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,580
the degree to which

462
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,300
Random chance

463
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,300
Also explains the behavior

464
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,570
Yes, or that would I guess be?

465
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:09,780
Statistically non-interesting right right and there are methods to to sort of show

466
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,460
how much random chance could explain this relationship that's being observed versus a

467
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,580
relationship being there and you're right in terms of

468
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,280
The numbers are are relatively small

469
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,520
I think the highest number in the list you gave me was 400

470
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,280
No, if you look at partial streams plus full downloads the top one was probably closer to 600. Okay, I

471
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,120
Didn't even look at the partials. I just looked at the the full list. I actually interpreted as a subset

472
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,160
I didn't understand that it was

473
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,400
Yeah, it's weird. We're the way those are tracked. Yeah

474
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,240
So that data that that Alan had was it showed

475
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,800
how many people did a full download and then apparently in

476
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:04,400
Addition to those how many started listening and then stopped and then what he was saying is that some total was somewhere around 600

477
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,140
Now the first thing that I noticed we had just finished episode 21

478
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:13,860
Mm-hmm and episode 16 and 17 were in the were in the top, right?

479
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,520
Right, they've been out longer more chance for download

480
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,160
Sure completely great

481
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,350
the

482
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,530
And it could also have just been

483
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,760
statistical chance

484
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,600
but one of the things that I did wanted to do is see if there was a correlation between

485
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,440
Say links there could be other in additional information

486
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,640
It could be random chances as you describe, but it could also be additional relationships that we're not paying attention to

487
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,880
For example, how many people are linking to episode 16?

488
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,950
What did Alan write in this blurb is is is search engines?

489
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:59,490
Capturing that blurb and it's redirecting traffic there. Yeah, I have none of that data you do

490
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,190
I I don't have a I haven't looked at any of that data

491
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:07,990
the but the the one pattern that I found the most interesting and

492
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,900
And again that one because the numbers are so tight and they're small. There's a very good chance. It's just random chance

493
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,980
That's that's that's my gut

494
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
But what I have observed

495
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:24,490
Particularly with blogs

496
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,140
Although you did the aggregation for the last month

497
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:32,830
The sum total for the last this is no, this is the total since January 1st. Yeah

498
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:35,940
the one thing that I did notice though is

499
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,370
episodes one two three and four

500
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:43,040
were relatively high in the list and

501
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,740
episode five was the bottom one and

502
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:55,470
That shows me we have a lot of brand new listeners that haven't got all the way to episode five yet maybe

503
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,230
Or they listen to the first four and said I've had enough of this crap, right?

504
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:08,070
Or hey, let me skip the current events or whatever, but I do think that that is an interesting pattern

505
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:11,190
it's not what I would have expected looking at the data and

506
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:16,390
the the difference between number four and number five was

507
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,350
Five or six times higher

508
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:22,350
episode four and episode one. Mm-hmm. Right so

509
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:29,960
Something is going on there. The is there or is it just random? I don't think it's random

510
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:36,830
The other data that I have is is both you and I link to the podcast from our blog sites

511
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,560
Yeah, and I do look at my blog stats and I know

512
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:46,080
Introduce the the blog I wrote introducing a B testing is

513
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,840
Consistently one of the higher items in my list. So I actually think people are finding

514
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,840
Episode one via search engine off of our blog and going and starting

515
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:02,290
listening in episode one there's an

516
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:10,430
Then get to four or some of those folks sort of get to episode four and then they

517
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:17,150
Go off and do their regularly scheduled day and then they forget to circle back to a B testing maybe maybe so let me

518
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:21,070
Give you some quick data here on the fly and then we'll go on from here. So that's a hypothesis

519
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:25,670
So let me give you a little bit of this. So in January our top downloads were for episodes

520
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:32,670
16 14 15 pretty spread out one shows up somewhere down around number seven and nothing interesting there

521
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,550
But February gets a little more interesting if I remember maybe it was March

522
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:44,550
February is interesting in that our top episode 17 came out that month then three one two and four follow it in order

523
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:52,860
So there are this tells me we have maybe new listeners showing up. Yeah, I don't know that would be my hypothesis. Where's five?

524
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,490
Five five is five is far down there

525
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:01,110
I think maybe those I don't know why I'll check episode five over time

526
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,410
See what happened or what we talked about the made episode five so bad when I look at March

527
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:11,330
It's 18 19 and then two shows up and then 17 11 4 so that one not as much

528
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,490
One farther down the list and then real quick look at April and May and then we'll

529
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,450
Wrap up here. So in April it was 2019

530
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,540
three two and one and then in May

531
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,160
To cap it off here

532
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,320
It was 21 and one two and three show up wait on the line

533
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,440
That kind of tells me my my insight my hypothesis from that that again an athlete

534
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:51,580
March April we got some new listeners who started listening and that's and that's why those those earlier episodes started popping up on the downloads

535
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,850
March was our one-year anniversary. I don't remember I did

536
00:41:57,370 --> 00:42:00,450
I did a blog post in January

537
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:07,430
All right, you know what I think we just contributed to a lot of partial downloads as people stop streaming our episode right now

538
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,600
Anyway, I

539
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,260
Want to see more of this data because I think I think

540
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:24,490
We can help to defend the the honor of data science against what will this will be that we won't return to this for a while

541
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,630
Don't worry those who are scared away, but we'll

542
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,590
We'll come back to this once we have some more

543
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,650
Data and see how we'll see what it means. You're gonna give me the data. I wish I could export it to Excel

544
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:43,230
The weasel. All right. All right. I'll give you your own special password that I will use with my keystroke logger

545
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:45,950
Okay

546
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:51,790
All right, I'm not Brent I am all right. See you later. Bye guys. Thank you
