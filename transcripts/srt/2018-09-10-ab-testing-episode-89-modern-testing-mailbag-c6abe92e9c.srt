1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,440
Hey everybody, I'm Alan.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,940
I'm Brent.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,360
And we're back for another episode of AAB Testing.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,680
Episode 89, ready to go.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,600
We are ready to go.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,840
AAB Testing is your podcast for all kinds

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,760
of fun conversation between Alan on A and Brent.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
He's the B, among many other things.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,260
We talk about software development,

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,000
software testing, software engineering,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
organizational change.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,280
Did I say agile already?

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
I really need to write this down.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,280
All kinds of fun stuff.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,440
Thank you for listening.

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,920
We shifted our schedule for a week, off by weeks,

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,680
or a week late on this one.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,600
But that's cool.

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,410
Life happens, stuff happens, holidays happen.

20
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,290
But I think we're ready to go.

21
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,530
Actually, before we dive in, what's been up, Brent?

22
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,930
Anything new and exciting?

23
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:58,780
How's Azure?

24
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,150
Azure's great.

25
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,270
My corporate slave drivers have dictated

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,730
that is the correct answer.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,770
Awesome to hear.

28
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,600
Awesome to hear.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,440
Yeah, it's an exciting time and place to be.

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,440
Always good to have a little bit of excitement in your life

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,090
once in a while.

32
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:23,970
Yeah, outages.

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,530
So there was a recent outage that's gotten a lot of press.

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,290
That's what I'm indirectly teasing you about.

35
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:30,610
It's cool.

36
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,250
You don't have to talk about it.

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,450
Yeah, I cannot talk about it.

38
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,970
One thing I was going to ask you is,

39
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,010
it's September now.

40
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,570
Have all your employees survived,

41
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,210
and you survived a Microsoft review season?

42
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,650
We have, yes.

43
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:48,250
You can put it behind you at slacking time at Microsoft,

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,810
other than dealing with outages.

45
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,650
And you guys can worry about ramping up that workload back

46
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,970
in April or May for next year.

47
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:55,970
That's always good to know.

48
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,170
Right, it's now nine months of coasting.

49
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:03,250
So none on my team, unfortunately.

50
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:08,530
One of the things that we've successfully done.

51
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,890
So my team's specialization is in customer analytics.

52
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,410
And we spent the last six months diving into customer support

53
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,370
problems.

54
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,890
And it has garnered a lot of viral visibility,

55
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,860
the good kind of visibility, not the bullshit kind

56
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,330
that you see PMs do.

57
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,810
So we're in high demand.

58
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,580
And unfortunately, my team is still really itty bitty.

59
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,810
I do have two positions opening.

60
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,570
Not applying.

61
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,010
Actually, I'm not qualified.

62
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,970
And not applying.

63
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,810
Oh, I would change the job description

64
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,610
to hire you as an employee, Alex.

65
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,610
Just for the week of morale boost, that would bring me.

66
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:07,140
No, so I don't think if there's anyone who's

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,180
interested in a data science position,

68
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,020
I am looking for experienced folks.

69
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,170
I'm not certain where our listeners are on that one.

70
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:23,090
I think we mostly cater to the testing crowd, not

71
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,210
the data science crowd.

72
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,130
Oh, oh.

73
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,770
Speaking of things I can't talk about,

74
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,890
but I can talk about about.

75
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,450
Gotcha.

76
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,290
Following.

77
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,690
I'm not sure if this person is a member of the three on Slack.

78
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,610
I'm pretty sure they are not.

79
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,980
But did hire a podcast listener.

80
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,460
Did you?

81
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,540
For her position in Austin.

82
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,820
I'll make a big announcement.

83
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,740
Oh, you got your.

84
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,940
Yeah, got.

85
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,580
Yeah, I'm very, very excited.

86
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,860
Do I know the person?

87
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,700
Maybe through Twitter.

88
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
I'm not sure.

89
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,180
Anyway, very excited.

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,660
More information on that later, once it becomes,

91
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,220
I mean, stuff's been signed, but I never

92
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,210
talk about hires before.

93
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,250
I guess that's common courtesy across the industry, right?

94
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,460
When I was hired at Unity, they knew

95
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,740
I was going there for a while,

96
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,060
but they waited to make it, to tell people

97
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,740
that I was going there before.

98
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:25,220
No, so you don't know what this person has announced

99
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,220
that they're asking.

100
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,620
Right, right, it's their call to make.

101
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,500
But I can say that someone who has listened to the podcast

102
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,860
has accepted a position on my team at Unity,

103
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,340
and I couldn't be more excited.

104
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,860
This is somebody not only will make their development team

105
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,860
better, but I think will make me better as well.

106
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,820
So it's super exciting.

107
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,990
Super.

108
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,190
Sometimes crap just works out, and you get really

109
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,270
excited about it.

110
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,030
I don't remember, yeah, this is probably

111
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,140
one of the most exciting hires I've made.

112
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,100
For as far as like, what's going to happen?

113
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,980
It's going to be great.

114
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,780
Oh my god.

115
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,180
Cool.

116
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,020
So that happened.

117
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,860
That's cool.

118
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,620
Are they already in Texas?

119
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Yes.

120
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,540
Oh.

121
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,220
Yes, yes.

122
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
I'll leave it at that.

123
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,280
No, that's not enough for me to guess.

124
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,680
Although it might be later.

125
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,360
All right.

126
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,920
There was something else I was going to share today, but.

127
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,640
You got the P.

128
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,320
Oh, a couple things, two things.

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
One thing, PNSQC conference is coming up,

130
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,760
Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference in Oregon,

131
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,080
as it's properly pronounced, in Portland,

132
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
coming up beginning of October.

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,440
Pretty reasonably priced conference.

134
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
It's a lot of value there.

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,760
Again, highly recommended.

136
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,680
Also the last conference I'm planning on doing for some

137
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,070
time.

138
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,350
I have nothing else on the radar.

139
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,870
I'll probably continue to do some webinars once in a while.

140
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,350
Speaking of webinars, I did a webinar a few months ago

141
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,090
with Aaron Kinsburger.

142
00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:00,930
But also from Aaron just finished editing and writing

143
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,890
compilation for a book called Continuous Testing for DevOps

144
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,850
Professionals.

145
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,290
And I believe some of the three have contributed

146
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,590
chapters to this book.

147
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,110
Cool.

148
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,310
So that book is coming out.

149
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,510
I'm pretty excited about it.

150
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,150
More information as it's out.

151
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,870
But there's a launch coming up in conjunction

152
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,710
with the conference.

153
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,150
If I had my crap together, I could give you all the details.

154
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,510
But keep an eye out for it.

155
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,030
Very cool.

156
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,470
I'm super excited about that book.

157
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,990
I had the opportunity to review it all.

158
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,630
I read about 75% of it.

159
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,150
And it's all pretty good stuff.

160
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,550
He gathered together some good writing, some great ideas.

161
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,460
I'm pretty happy.

162
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,100
So yeah, and that's pretty much it for me on the conference.

163
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,620
Do you know?

164
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,100
How much does it align with MT?

165
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,380
I think it aligns quite a bit with modern testing.

166
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,780
I think the main difference, it's something to talk about.

167
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,460
Maybe in a future episode is there's

168
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:59,140
a lot of really good things like Accelerate, the DevOps book.

169
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,220
This book aligns a lot with modern testing.

170
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,380
This book, I would say, the difference is it assumes that

171
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,980
there's, which is fine, I guess,

172
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,900
it assumes there's a testing and quality specialist

173
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,330
on the team to drive a lot of these things.

174
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,730
Not all, but a lot of these things where we think we don't,

175
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,890
you know our stance.

176
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,250
I do.

177
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,770
That's OK as a transitionary.

178
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,490
That's probably the right thing.

179
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,930
It may be the right thing long term for in some cases.

180
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,290
I'll leave an exception there.

181
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,370
Let's start using differentiating language.

182
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,740
Is it a test specialist or is it a testing coach?

183
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,260
The way I read it, because I read everything

184
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,220
through an MT lens now.

185
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,900
I could see a lot of things as ideas for test coaches

186
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
as well.

187
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,940
It wasn't written that way, but I can read it that way

188
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,260
pretty easily.

189
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:04,400
Yeah, did you see the Ministry of Testing post I sent you?

190
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah, I did.

191
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,200
And actually that person, if I actually had internet

192
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,920
in Microsoft, because they don't share their internet

193
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,760
without filling out a form, I could bring up that person

194
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,100
actually pinged me on Twitter a while back.

195
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,900
God, we are so freaking unprepared.

196
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,060
We didn't even write up the Kanban board today.

197
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,380
No, that's your job.

198
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,860
That is from Robert Meany.

199
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,500
It was Robert Meany's thing, right?

200
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,060
Right.

201
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,820
So Robert Meany, there was a whole Twitter thing

202
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,380
where he was pinging me.

203
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,100
And he actually said, if you're interested in hearing

204
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,740
about my experiences as a test coach,

205
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,740
I did a talk at Test Bash Dublin recently.

206
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,420
You should check out.

207
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,100
There's a link.

208
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,300
And I don't have a pro dojo account,

209
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,500
so I haven't watched it yet.

210
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,460
Yeah, why don't we have pro dojo accounts?

211
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,580
I think we need, someone needs to sponsor pro dojo accounts

212
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,580
for A-B testing.

213
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,700
Absolutely.

214
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,220
Like Ministry of Testing, guys, what up?

215
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,340
Yeah, Test Bash is the official conference of A-B testing.

216
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,660
We should probably bring, this is going to be eventually

217
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,780
a mailbag episode, but for now an all tangent episode.

218
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,380
One thing, I think we brought it up on the channel

219
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,860
or in a private discussion with you is,

220
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,060
I'll just throw this out here.

221
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,260
This could be 2019.

222
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,220
It could be 2020.

223
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,820
It could be 2021.

224
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,190
But there should be a Test Bash Seattle.

225
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,930
Oh, I figured there were one or two places you were going to go.

226
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:38,570
Well, that's one place.

227
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,290
But no, it gets better.

228
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,170
Test Bash Seattle.

229
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:40,930
It gets better.

230
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,370
The MT conference or the MT book.

231
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,370
I wasn't certain which one you were talking about.

232
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,970
Why don't you shut up and let me talk.

233
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,290
Test Bash is usually Thursday.

234
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,570
It's a Friday conference.

235
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,530
Now I can't remember.

236
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,290
But usually, yeah, I think it's a Friday conference.

237
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,690
But there's always a day after thing.

238
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,970
And when I was in Brighton, there

239
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:08,970
was an unconference on Saturday where 30, 40 people?

240
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,850
30 people showed up.

241
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,890
And we just unconference, like open space whiteboard thing.

242
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,890
Right at Nia's, people vote with their feet.

243
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,170
And you set it up as you get there.

244
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,970
But that was fun.

245
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,930
I liked those.

246
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,450
Nothing wrong with those.

247
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,010
But when you and I host Test Bash in Seattle,

248
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,050
the following day is modern testing conference.

249
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,090
Can it be a modern testing unconference?

250
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,250
Yes, absolutely.

251
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,290
I do love open space style.

252
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,490
We should merge the two.

253
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,660
You're right.

254
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,260
So anyway, because we're doing that,

255
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,540
we should get our sponsored pro accounts.

256
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,940
Anyway, back on task.

257
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,180
I don't disagree.

258
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,620
But I actually think, yeah, I mean, I think.

259
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,620
Maybe there aren't really.

260
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,300
I think we've already satisfied that criteria.

261
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,660
All right.

262
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,940
But anyway, so Robert Meany will just

263
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,820
do a free hawking for Ministry of Testing.

264
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:14,610
Robert Meany is doing a meet up in Ireland, apparently,

265
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:18,470
talking about the name of his talk

266
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,430
is from tester to test coach, a voyage into the unknown.

267
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,150
And I saw this, and I'm like, that is fantastic.

268
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,390
I don't know if that's MT inspired.

269
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,390
I'm guessing it is.

270
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,270
But it's certainly MT aligned.

271
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,350
It's MT aligned for sure.

272
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,150
And I think it's more aligned than inspired.

273
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,430
I think he, there's a whole long string of tweets

274
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,190
I won't get into.

275
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,270
But yeah, he gets it.

276
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,750
He gets it.

277
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,390
Brandt, look at you and I.

278
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,620
We're not the most original thinkers in the world.

279
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,380
Where do ideas come from?

280
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,060
Other ideas coming together.

281
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,540
But the thing is, it would be dumb of us

282
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,380
to think that very similar, highly aligned ideas wouldn't

283
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,540
develop separately in other places from us.

284
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,500
And that's what we found out as we've

285
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,580
been talking about modern testing in public.

286
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,020
People go, oh, great, we do that.

287
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,050
That's a name for what we do.

288
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,330
And that's great to hear.

289
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,650
I don't know.

290
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,010
I mean, jeez, we've been talking about MT for,

291
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:24,050
I don't even know how long, but since at least 60,

292
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,810
episode 60, is that a year?

293
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,050
I don't know.

294
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:31,840
And we've stated all along, we're not inventing anything new.

295
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,160
True.

296
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,400
The only thing new, I guess, would be,

297
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,560
we think these seven principles are the key guideposts.

298
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,480
Yes.

299
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,880
And interestingly, if I remember right,

300
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
I think the evolution was, I thought

301
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,360
we should have principles.

302
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,960
And I made some crummy principles.

303
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,080
So we iterated, and we iterated, et cetera,

304
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,120
and telecubic that we have, which I really like.

305
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,060
But what's interesting is that, I think I mentioned this

306
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,900
before, is that the modern testing principles actually

307
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,980
align really well with the three ways of DevOps.

308
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,770
A lot of our stuff, we're not,

309
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,980
we're dealing with the world as it is.

310
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,420
I would say one of the most important things about MT

311
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,100
is the rejection of traditional test methods

312
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,140
in today's world.

313
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,540
Yes, yes.

314
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,820
The old ways don't work anymore.

315
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,500
What got you here is not gonna get you there.

316
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,700
No, what got you there is gonna get you unemployed.

317
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,540
Yes.

318
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,450
Yes.

319
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,570
All right, shall we, anything else

320
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,770
before we begin the show proper?

321
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,170
No, let's dance.

322
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,280
So we have questions, questions, questions

323
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,080
from our listeners, and do you wanna go

324
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,260
in the order I printed these out?

325
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,300
No.

326
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,180
Okay, so I printed some out some questions

327
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,060
I've received in my email, as well as from Slack.

328
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,460
If you've had a question that you've given us

329
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,220
that we don't get to today, please follow up

330
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,580
because we're horrible at organizing these things.

331
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,100
We need to get better.

332
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,940
Why?

333
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,410
Which question do you wanna start with?

334
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,960
I'll go ahead and read it.

335
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,080
I stumbled across your podcast through

336
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,720
the Ministry of Testing newsletter.

337
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,440
Just finished listening to this episode.

338
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,160
Not certain which episode.

339
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,770
That's a couple ago.

340
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,650
What you described resonates with my experience

341
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,610
as a tester where I work.

342
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,650
I joined the company as a testing specialist six years ago,

343
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:42,330
primarily focused on process improvement

344
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,450
and where required manual testing,

345
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:47,810
progressively less over the years.

346
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,170
Sadly, the terms I am leaving under

347
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,170
are just as you described.

348
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,700
There's no longer a need for me.

349
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,940
Quality has been baked into the process well enough.

350
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,300
Fortunately, I've managed to find a role

351
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,020
with another company as a senior test engineer.

352
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,820
I was wondering if you could elaborate

353
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,580
on where you see individuals like myself

354
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,280
gravitating towards.

355
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,980
Do we need to consider a career change?

356
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,220
Is management the only way forward?

357
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,030
Is job hopping every few years all that's left?

358
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,790
Curious to hear your thoughts.

359
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,310
Yeah, it's a great question.

360
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,470
This is from Rajiv Makhani.

361
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,750
This is about episode 88.

362
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,510
So thanks Rajiv for sending me a-

363
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,830
Oh, literally last episode.

364
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,670
Yeah.

365
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,510
Well, yeah.

366
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,350
Yeah.

367
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,170
Great questions.

368
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,750
You were able to read the question.

369
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:38,670
I'm gonna let you start.

370
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,980
There's a lot of, is the role of a modern tester

371
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,680
just to be a coach to help one by one

372
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,580
help every team in the world get there?

373
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:53,420
On this one, I forget what we said in 88,

374
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,520
but I don't think I'm gonna say anything that contradicts.

375
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,520
In my view, one of the main reasons why we are doing MT

376
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,010
is exactly that.

377
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,010
We think everyone in test needs to begin the process

378
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,770
of considering a career change.

379
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,550
There are multiple options here.

380
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,000
Career management is not the only way forward.

381
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
To be clear, I'm gonna interrupt.

382
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,680
I would, because it's not necessarily a career change,

383
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,320
but it might be a career shift.

384
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,580
I don't think it's a revolution.

385
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,720
I do think it's more of a evolution.

386
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,920
So let me talk about what, let's say I was

387
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,480
at a much smaller company and I was doing what I do

388
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,680
as an individual contributor.

389
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,260
Okay, how much smaller?

390
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,660
Like five, six people?

391
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,700
No, let's say I'm comfortable doing this with 50 to 100.

392
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,220
Okay, so I am helping this team accelerate

393
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,820
the leadership quality.

394
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,740
I'm helping them build that quality culture.

395
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,220
I kind of dive in on hands-on stuff.

396
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,980
So as they build this quality culture,

397
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,900
there are things I've gravitated toward in my career.

398
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,540
I do a lot of work with CI, a lot of static analysis,

399
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,820
a lot of work with Gates, a lot of work with

400
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,420
not as much as you, but with data.

401
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,620
Those are gonna be my specialties.

402
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,160
None of those things are testing.

403
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,460
I'm there to help coach the team

404
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,060
towards testing and quality.

405
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,420
But I would assume that, and I've also done dev work

406
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,460
and shipped code on almost every project

407
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,380
I've worked on at Microsoft as a tester.

408
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,680
So for me, and again, I'm going to follow,

409
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,520
I'm just going to do more, if the quality culture is there

410
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,080
and I don't need to do any more testing

411
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,760
or test frameworks, because everybody else

412
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,880
is taking care of that.

413
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,440
I would naturally, this is just me,

414
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,450
fall towards the other things I am good at

415
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,450
that provide value to the product.

416
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,170
And of course, I'm there to look,

417
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,770
when things shift off the rails,

418
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,050
I'm still around to maybe ask the right questions

419
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,810
in a retrospective or make sure as new employees come on,

420
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,490
they have the right mentoring and coaching,

421
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,770
or make sure that that culture is not lost.

422
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:11,440
But I think all testers who are,

423
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,360
my guess is that all testers who are leading teams

424
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,720
towards modern testing have a bunch of other skills

425
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
that they can begin to leverage more

426
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,440
as they begin to do less testing.

427
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Or adapting their skills towards a new mechanism.

428
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,080
We talked about one poll survey,

429
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,080
I don't know, about a year ago,

430
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,080
that noticed that there was a shift in QA teams

431
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,880
away from more dev-focused KPIs towards business-focused KPIs.

432
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,830
The way I take this on in a mentoring relationship

433
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,590
is I walk people through, like look,

434
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,590
these are the strengths that a testing specialist

435
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,750
brings to the table.

436
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,750
And I almost never bring in the word testing.

437
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:18,600
That's an activity, but they have customer empathy

438
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,360
that is absolutely a strength,

439
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:25,360
which is still valuable in different roles.

440
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Those that are fond of automation

441
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,760
or shrinking time on that front.

442
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,640
DevOps is a very suitable and growing role.

443
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Which is weird because DevOps is a culture, but anyway.

444
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,600
It is a culture.

445
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,560
So it's quality, it's all right.

446
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,600
But it is very common for teams when they realize

447
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,840
that they need that organization to hire in folks

448
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,320
to bootstrap.

449
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,840
The first thing you do when you need to incorporate

450
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,360
this muscle is you hire in people who will do it for you

451
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,280
and then you make the shift towards.

452
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,840
Just like with testing.

453
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,000
Just like with data.

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,840
For sure.

455
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,760
On the other hand, there could be,

456
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,800
I could see a future where development teams,

457
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,120
organizations, companies,

458
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
whether they call it modern testing or not,

459
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,400
see a need to be able to develop a quality culture.

460
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,600
Like how do we build that?

461
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,120
And then there's people that they hire to come in

462
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,600
for one to three years and help them build that.

463
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,960
So it could be, there is, I think for some people,

464
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,310
it's a job hopping role.

465
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,150
There is.

466
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,150
It's harder right now because what you have is skills

467
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,910
that will help a company do something

468
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,760
they probably don't know they need.

469
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,560
Yeah, and I think actually just traditional testing,

470
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,600
I think there's still a lot of years left

471
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,680
where job hopping will succeed in that,

472
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,260
but I think it's gonna shrink.

473
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,620
My best advice is not even mine.

474
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,340
I don't remember my source,

475
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,460
but there was a study that came out

476
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,020
that basically detailed something

477
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,980
Alan actually proselytizes quite often.

478
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,260
I have never proselytized in public.

479
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,500
That is unfair for you to say.

480
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,260
Is this considered public?

481
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,600
Sure. Okay.

482
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,430
Wait, what does proselytize mean?

483
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,270
Preach.

484
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,990
Okay, yeah, I do that all the time.

485
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,950
I should have just used preach in the first place.

486
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,230
Yeah, why use a long word when a short one will do?

487
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,230
You know, if I hear one more person use the word utilize,

488
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,870
where they are supposed to use use,

489
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,350
it's not even the synonym.

490
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,190
I'm gonna blow up.

491
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,590
It is absolutely synonym, lookupsynonym.com.

492
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,320
Should I utilize synonyms.com?

493
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,160
If you'd like.

494
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,000
Oh God.

495
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,960
Okay, back on track.

496
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,240
You use short words.

497
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,040
So what the study showed is in particular

498
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,630
in the software industry,

499
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:22,070
that there is rapid change occurring

500
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,790
in terms of the skill sets.

501
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,660
Five years from now,

502
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,100
I think the standard developer is gonna have

503
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,860
to have basic data science training

504
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,460
because it's gonna be a key part of their job.

505
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,920
Yeah.

506
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,920
What is a key differentiator is constant relearning.

507
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,040
In the software industry,

508
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,000
that I think above anything else

509
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,160
is going to be critical if you wanna build a career.

510
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,040
Absolutely, and we've said that before

511
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,480
talking about other things.

512
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,840
Like what I'm hiring,

513
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,040
I want ability to learn over random coding trivia.

514
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,880
Always.

515
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,560
Because the language you use today

516
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,880
is probably gonna be,

517
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,480
less it's JavaScript unfortunately,

518
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,300
is probably gonna be a relic in five years.

519
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,260
So I think I've shared with this,

520
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,510
with you before.

521
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,830
I treat my team like a startup.

522
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,500
I run it like a fake startup.

523
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,340
All right, I'm constantly thinking through

524
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,020
the scenario of if me and this team

525
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,380
were an actual startup,

526
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,800
would my customers pay for an extended contract?

527
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,160
Right, how do I constantly get that business?

528
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:46,380
Now, I am now in one of the giant tech companies.

529
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,950
So those consequences aren't necessarily

530
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,950
something that I need to be concerned with.

531
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,630
But in my particular world,

532
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:04,900
credibility, there are other commodities

533
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,340
that I can use to track how successful my team is doing.

534
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,900
And one of the things I have to think about

535
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,620
is the skill sets of my team.

536
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,940
And are there opportunities that I cannot take on

537
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,250
because I lack those skills?

538
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,770
One thing that has happened to me lately,

539
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,290
thankfully none of my team listened to this podcast,

540
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,090
but one of the things that has happened to me lately.

541
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,050
Unfortunately, for better or for worse,

542
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,530
much of my team listened to this podcast.

543
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,570
Well, one of the things that I've been thinking through

544
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:37,720
is for example, I have some folks on my team

545
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
that aren't there yet in terms of data science.

546
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,600
And I'm thinking through,

547
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,720
I probably have two years or so

548
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,930
where I need to aggressively train those folks up

549
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,330
or else it's going to actually be better for my business

550
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,570
to let them go and hire new people

551
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,170
because there will be new people

552
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,170
who already have that training.

553
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,890
So I want to balance being a people coach

554
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,290
as well as a business leader.

555
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,050
And when it comes to job hopping,

556
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,090
I think actually I'm not alone

557
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,570
in terms of how do I evaluate these things.

558
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:19,250
If I went back to a peer dev position,

559
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,970
I would not hire a test specialist.

560
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,410
Now, part of that is because I'm sufficient

561
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,890
as the testing coach on that team.

562
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:34,290
But it's not hard to bring in people

563
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,810
on new or retrained folks towards this culture.

564
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,440
I just wouldn't do it.

565
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,000
It's too expensive.

566
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,960
We have a couple of milestones on the Slack channel.

567
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,160
First and foremost in the last month,

568
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,920
we've had people join the Slack channel

569
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,480
that the one of the three listeners,

570
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,920
but they aren't actually listeners.

571
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,440
I still don't quite know what to do with that.

572
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,720
But you may have seen it.

573
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,280
So we have a peer dev who joined.

574
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,120
I saw.

575
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,000
Right, and one of the issues he had.

576
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,080
Because modern testing isn't about testing.

577
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,120
It's not, well.

578
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,440
Right, not directly.

579
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,320
Anyway, go on.

580
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,800
Yeah, so there is a rising concern

581
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,480
around traditional test methods being a bottleneck.

582
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,280
And in his particular case,

583
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,480
he couldn't get a security patch out

584
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,960
because tests couldn't test it in time.

585
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,150
And a security patch is something you gotta get out.

586
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,630
And so he's going through,

587
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:49,030
okay, how do I scale this activity?

588
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,530
I think more and more and more that is on the way.

589
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,890
If you're fond of the test traditional method,

590
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,410
yep, I do think you're in for a good bit

591
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:05,570
of job hopping.

592
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,090
But there are, you don't have to take that choice.

593
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,050
Right, what I would suggest,

594
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,530
and I normally do this in a one-on-one situation,

595
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,530
is introspect, think about what are your strengths.

596
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,930
See if you can find sort of a technical career coach

597
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,090
that can help you, guide you towards,

598
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,370
hey, maybe you should think about the DevOps path.

599
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,770
Maybe you should think about.

600
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,770
One thing I should mention, interesting,

601
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:40,130
is one of my former leads, quality leads,

602
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:43,690
on our ads team where we no longer have QA,

603
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,030
is now a DevOps lead.

604
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,030
Nice.

605
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,210
And what I've told him is, it's kind of the same thing.

606
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,050
Same goal, same goal, work yourself out of a job.

607
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,570
There's some work to do there,

608
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,610
you gotta build the culture.

609
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,890
But I think it's a great place for him to be.

610
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,130
Because he can drive the quality culture

611
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,170
from there as well.

612
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:08,200
No, and actually, I actually think that those folks

613
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,560
who work to just make the culture part of muscle memory,

614
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,400
succeeding in that develops, my hypothesis is,

615
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,520
succeeding in that develops within you

616
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,000
a certain set of strengths and skills

617
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,840
that make you immensely valuable.

618
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,080
It might be another episode or two

619
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,600
to decompose what those are.

620
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,440
Yeah.

621
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,680
But I've seen it over and over and over

622
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,220
and over and over again.

623
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,140
Sure.

624
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,740
Okay, if there's probably more questions about that,

625
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,460
they can come up for a future episode.

626
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,700
But let's do another one.

627
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,260
Answer another question.

628
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,140
Or talk about stuff for a while

629
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,900
in a way that in no way answers the actual question.

630
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
It depends how you wanna interpret it.

631
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,420
Which one do you wanna do now?

632
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,410
Was there ever an episode talking about

633
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,570
what reference skills are needed

634
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,170
for a combined engineering team,

635
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,240
which I will now state,

636
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,880
we don't want combined engineering teams,

637
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,440
we want unified engineering teams.

638
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,840
All right, and this was from Percy on the Slack channel.

639
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,680
Was it?

640
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,500
Yep.

641
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,780
Okay.

642
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,120
And I asked him to clarify and he said,

643
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,920
programming skills or testing skills or ops skills,

644
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,860
what's the bar?

645
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,960
Is there a must have

646
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,360
and it can be taught learned section.

647
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,800
And data science.

648
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,300
Like what are the skills the team needs

649
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,540
to be unified engineering?

650
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,300
So I don't think we had an episode talking about it.

651
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,060
We did not, which is why I left the question here

652
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,180
for us to talk about.

653
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,140
I did do.

654
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,340
We're not gonna do a whole episode,

655
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,060
we're gonna do the next one to 30 minutes.

656
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,700
I did do a blog on that.

657
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,320
I don't think it answers it though.

658
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,720
And yeah, the answer in a nutshell

659
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,780
is exactly from my experience,

660
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,770
you should flesh it out.

661
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,210
From my experience,

662
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,270
it is programming, testing and ops skills.

663
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,390
I think largely, yeah.

664
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,470
You are making a jigsaw puzzle or soup.

665
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,090
Yeah, so the one mistake I've seen people do

666
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,820
when they shift to this though,

667
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,820
is they re-interview testers

668
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:32,210
to make sure that they are coders

669
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,850
at the same level of dev.

670
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:36,910
Yeah.

671
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,070
And I think that's a mistake.

672
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,790
I think it, no, to me it's infuriating when that happens.

673
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:47,490
So the, what I propose is when you do this

674
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:53,230
is what you wanna do is you wanna have a balanced team.

675
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,130
So when you do a unified team,

676
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:57,650
you're going to retrain that team.

677
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,410
So this is another challenge.

678
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,410
It's because every time I go do an Agile coaching session

679
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,460
to a dev team,

680
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,110
can you guess what the number one question is?

681
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,900
Do we have to do Agile?

682
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,830
No, it's-

683
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:17,670
Who does the testing?

684
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:18,510
I don't know.

685
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,590
No, it's I'm a specialist in UI.

686
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,550
So are you saying that I might have to work

687
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,470
on database code?

688
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,290
Really?

689
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,820
Yeah.

690
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,660
And I go-

691
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,100
How are these people employed in 2018?

692
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,700
You know, I tried to understand.

693
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,020
I would never have guessed that

694
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,290
cause I didn't know people like that still breathe.

695
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,730
Oh, it's everywhere.

696
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,010
Everyone is a special snowflake.

697
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,630
I'm not.

698
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,310
I am an unspecial muddy piece of slushy snow

699
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,670
that people have stepped on.

700
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,440
Yeah, one might argue that you are a special snowflake

701
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,640
because you're not a special snowflake.

702
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,280
That makes you special.

703
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,810
Snowflake.

704
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:05,560
Anyway.

705
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,800
My sense on this one,

706
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:13,550
or my guidance on this one is what you wanna do

707
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,470
is you wanna get the right skills on the team as a balance.

708
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,710
Even if it means you have four dev specialists

709
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,580
and four test specialists, okay?

710
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,380
As a team, it's balanced.

711
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,540
Then what you need to do is spend the next six months

712
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,020
forcing cross-pollination of knowledge.

713
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,360
Actually, yeah, it's not a bad idea.

714
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,440
Setting the examples I've done in the past,

715
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,560
and this is one thing I did blog about,

716
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,840
is so first and foremost,

717
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,960
I am fond of in this new team

718
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,110
putting the test manager as the one in charge,

719
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,540
not the dev manager.

720
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,020
The test manager, from my experience,

721
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,320
is far more likely to understand

722
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,940
how to execute that cross-pollination.

723
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,090
And I do think that's far more valuable in the long term.

724
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:15,050
The next thing, so what I've done in the past, for example,

725
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:20,590
is I've offered up when we do these unified engineering,

726
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:25,900
things I've done before is, all right,

727
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,530
you guys can pick the two or three testers

728
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,610
that come to your team.

729
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,930
And you can pick whoever they want.

730
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,490
And of course, they always pick the top two to three.

731
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,250
But here's the criteria.

732
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,410
You have six months, and in that six months,

733
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,470
your job is to turn them into a dev,

734
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:45,350
which means they need to be working on features,

735
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,070
they need to be doing bug fixes, okay?

736
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,060
Their job is to teach the rest of your dev

737
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,980
how to get this test stuff done.

738
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,820
And at the end of that six months,

739
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,180
we are expecting that there is no difference

740
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,820
between any of these teams except for that,

741
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,880
which is where experience makes a difference, right?

742
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,580
In terms of who does what activity, there's no difference.

743
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:18,240
And then generally, I do a threat on that dev team.

744
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,620
By the way, for the testers coming to your team,

745
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:27,570
if they are not able to fulfill this bar,

746
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,590
we're gonna take them from you

747
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,490
and put them on a different team,

748
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,990
and you will still be accountable

749
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,470
for all the testing activity.

750
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,960
This assumes you're starting from a place

751
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,020
where you have separate dev and test teams.

752
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,540
Separate teams and merging.

753
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,980
I think, probably, I'm wondering if the,

754
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,040
at this point, the majority of our teams

755
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,040
are not necessarily combined engineering,

756
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,780
but a lot of teams are set up in something

757
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,580
resembling an agile testing model

758
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,100
where they have a test specialist on the team,

759
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,260
but they're like, they're managed by somebody else,

760
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,140
it's a matrix organization.

761
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,660
But the difference is, I think,

762
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,980
is a lot of people I talk to, that tester,

763
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,680
even though this was not the intent

764
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,680
of describing an agile tester as Lisa and Janet did,

765
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,880
that tester ends up doing all the testing.

766
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,120
I think Percy's situation is he's still

767
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,820
in the multi-discipline world.

768
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,320
I just wanted to cross the bridge here

769
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,640
for a few of our other listeners

770
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,320
who are in a different world.

771
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,980
Yeah, there's ways, there are ways that I've seen

772
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,200
ripping the band-aid succeed.

773
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,320
No, I haven't.

774
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,480
Not with this change.

775
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,270
This is a tourniquet change.

776
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,770
Again, so there are ways where I've seen it succeed.

777
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:41,530
The better way is boiling the frog.

778
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,890
For example, ripping the band-aid,

779
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:50,020
I've seen it succeed if you put the test guy in charge.

780
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,320
Because they get it.

781
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,160
Whereas the dev guy is trying to go,

782
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,480
how do I manage these useless tester guys?

783
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,070
And they do wacky things like hold a coding bar.

784
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,830
I think the first thing you have to do

785
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,890
to make this work, whether or not you boil the frog

786
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:12,410
or rip the band-aid, is you have to realize

787
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,550
that in order to succeed, you have to create a culture

788
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,770
of knowledge across pollination.

789
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:22,910
And the specialist culture can be rampant

790
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,150
across both disciplines.

791
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,390
Anything you wanna add to this?

792
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,470
No, I think it's a good start

793
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,070
if Percy has more questions.

794
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,070
I guess the answer to the question was no,

795
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,910
there was never an episode on this.

796
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,410
So everything else is just lovely elaboration.

797
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,250
Right.

798
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:37,130
Let's do another.

799
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,680
Okay, you can pick it.

800
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,040
Tony G. when I was in New York asked this question.

801
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,160
I said we get it on a mailbag eventually,

802
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,020
and today's the day.

803
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,590
Alan had a quick question regarding gathering data

804
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,000
and being data obsessed.

805
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,640
During the design phase,

806
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,420
designers usually conduct mini user interviews

807
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,600
and gather multiple data points.

808
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,070
And as a tester, I try to be involved.

809
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,550
This has not been explicitly mentioned

810
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:06,250
in the podcasts or the Slack channels.

811
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:07,290
From what I have gathered,

812
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,490
the focus on data gathering has been largely

813
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:12,290
once the item has been released into production.

814
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:15,210
But I wonder how that compares to user data gathered

815
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,230
during the design phase.

816
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,330
It is evident that the design phase data

817
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,290
is not actual data usage as in logs,

818
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:24,430
but it is useful data for a feedback loop

819
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,210
as nothing has been built yet.

820
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,610
Just wondering if it's worth comparing this to

821
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,530
in regards to value of also being something

822
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,310
that adds to the definition of being data obsessed.

823
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,990
My answer to him in mail was,

824
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:39,070
short answer, yeah, data is valuable.

825
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:41,430
With a caveat that those designer customer meetings

826
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:45,230
often turn up what the customer wants versus needs.

827
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,230
And it's in an area where our critical thinking

828
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:49,150
and questioning skills can help.

829
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:50,990
But it can get some, in other words,

830
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,590
it can get some discussion started,

831
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,830
but I'm not sure if it's how someone

832
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:58,870
who does data for a career would view that.

833
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:01,860
So, first and foremost,

834
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,880
I'm thinking through, have we ever talked about it?

835
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,400
And then, I don't recall.

836
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,400
And I will tell you that I won't necessarily go to it.

837
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,320
Because as a data scientist, that type of data

838
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,280
is well known to be of very poor quality.

839
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Particularly for the reasons that Alan talks about.

840
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,480
It's very well known phenomenon

841
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,820
that if you ask survey data,

842
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,820
or if you ask one on one questions,

843
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:39,660
humans are wired to subconsciously or consciously

844
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,760
sort of give the answer that the person wants to hear.

845
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,320
And then recently we had a Twitter discussion

846
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,320
where one of the listeners had reread the lean startup

847
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,420
and noticed, did you see this?

848
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,260
Yeah, yeah.

849
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,140
And noticed, hey, there is a great alignment

850
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,050
between the lean startup and modern testing.

851
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,010
Well, there's another alignment.

852
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,570
The number of times we've mentioned

853
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,890
lean startup in this podcast.

854
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,170
Yeah, right, so.

855
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,970
I think I have quoted lean startup

856
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:18,130
in probably every presentation

857
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,080
I've given in the last five years.

858
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,040
Yeah, it's, you know what, if there is like a,

859
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,910
if there was a way to say,

860
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,470
like look, you don't have to listen to us babble,

861
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,790
just read the damn book.

862
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,350
That's a big story.

863
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,590
I think it's the same question.

864
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,950
Like musicians get like asked, you know,

865
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,790
like if you're, you join a band

866
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,230
or you join a rock band and everyone in your band

867
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,710
listens to Led Zeppelin 20 hours a day,

868
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,050
your band's probably gonna sound

869
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,570
a little bit like Led Zeppelin.

870
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:51,350
Right, it's gonna be on the influences list for sure.

871
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,910
Lean startup is on our influences list.

872
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,390
So if you wind it back, so is this data useful?

873
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:58,980
Yes.

874
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,890
Is it everything you need?

875
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:02,730
No.

876
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,530
Right.

877
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,730
I think Tony knows that much,

878
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,050
but how, if you are data obsessed,

879
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,050
is that data important to you?

880
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,720
So from a data scientist, no.

881
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,560
Right.

882
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,510
From an Agilist, you bet.

883
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,730
Well put.

884
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:22,530
You really can't do anything with this data

885
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,730
from a data science point of view.

886
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,100
What you can do though is once you have both,

887
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,700
from an Agilist point of view,

888
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,140
one of the things, and even in NMT,

889
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,960
where we talk about lean thinking,

890
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,620
and one of the key things in lean thinking is,

891
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,400
in this context is look,

892
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,160
no matter how big your engineering team is,

893
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,440
it's a limited resource.

894
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,680
And it is a damn crime if you spend engineering hours

895
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,700
on something that doesn't add value.

896
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,610
The way I kind of look at these design phase discussions

897
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:06,830
is preliminary hypothesis generation.

898
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,950
Right, so you have these designers that go out

899
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,550
and they talk to users and they're developing hypotheses.

900
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,990
From a data science point of view,

901
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:16,070
I'm like hey, a list of hypotheses

902
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,310
that are already thought out for me, that's fantastic.

903
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:23,030
That shrinks at least a day and a half of my time.

904
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:25,310
But what we then would want to do,

905
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,670
or what I would want to do is have,

906
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,670
take those hypotheses, throw together a very quick prototype,

907
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,590
an MVP as it were, get it out there,

908
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,570
get it instrumented, and then see,

909
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:44,510
all right, what does usage say about these hypotheses?

910
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,390
And then do what's known as a pivot or persevere event

911
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:52,070
and say hey, do we have actual data

912
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,710
that aligns with the initial hypotheses

913
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,670
that warrants further investment

914
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,380
or should we change the direction we're going?

915
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,880
Yeah, so I think that data does have its use.

916
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,420
It is, designers unfortunately,

917
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,940
their job is to pull together designs.

918
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:14,020
So they don't have access to usage data

919
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:18,220
because they're trying to design something

920
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,820
that doesn't exist.

921
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,900
But one thing that is good,

922
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:24,540
and we haven't praised just the value

923
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:28,730
of getting that early feedback from focus groups

924
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:30,690
or customers to get an idea

925
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,490
if you're heading in the right direction.

926
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:33,770
He's already talking about it, he has,

927
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,490
but I think that's really important.

928
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,210
You and I have both seen many products

929
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,890
of the what I call field of dream software development,

930
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,470
build it and they will come.

931
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:47,270
Yeah, the one thing around dealing with designers

932
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,470
is along those lines.

933
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,430
Right, a lot of these guys are very good at their craft.

934
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,610
But again, a lot of the designers

935
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,090
and a lot of program management,

936
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:05,550
they're inflicted with Steve Jobs syndrome.

937
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,870
And the key thing on this one is yeah,

938
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:11,990
that is useful, but it's gonna be really useful

939
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,710
when we get the prototypes run together

940
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,990
and can validate your hypotheses.

941
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,830
Yes.

942
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:18,950
The thing that I think is critical in this case

943
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,390
is to communicate what they've learned

944
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,430
and reframe it as hypotheses

945
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,630
if they aren't doing that already.

946
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,230
That's the real challenge is a lot of these guys,

947
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,070
they've been in the industry forever.

948
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:36,810
And my trigger is at this point in time,

949
00:43:36,810 --> 00:43:40,450
anytime I have any conversation with anybody

950
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:42,410
and they're defending the point of view

951
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:46,410
with the phrase, I have been doing this for n years,

952
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:48,930
sadly at this point in time,

953
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:52,250
that is an almost immediate bit flip in my head.

954
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:54,210
Yep, fully agree.

955
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:59,360
Yeah, it is, there is no one that's perfect.

956
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,320
Well, to me, it's to loop this back

957
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,820
into something else we talked about,

958
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,900
that ability to constantly learn and understand

959
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,140
that you have to constantly learn new things.

960
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,860
You realize the number of years you've been doing it

961
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,980
doesn't matter because what you're doing

962
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,520
has to be new all the time.

963
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,560
Another thing we've talked about,

964
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,940
like we reject the notion that predictive software

965
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:31,040
lifecycle models are good in today's world.

966
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:31,880
Correct.

967
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,000
We want adaptive.

968
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,840
Yes, yes.

969
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,160
And that starts at the beginning, even with the designers.

970
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,920
Right, and there was a big thing,

971
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,800
Satya was hot about this a few years ago,

972
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,720
but it's been around a lot,

973
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,360
the fixed mindset versus the growth mindset.

974
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,680
And we should all have the growth mindset.

975
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,360
You absolutely have to have a growth mindset

976
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,320
to be in modern testing.

977
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:56,320
You know, I like growth mindset and I like growth hacking,

978
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:59,190
but it's becoming buzzword.

979
00:44:59,190 --> 00:45:02,350
Yep, it's becoming, it's there.

980
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,670
That ship is docked and boarded.

981
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,370
I'm already working through, okay,

982
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:13,090
how do I come up with this and then

983
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:14,650
to explain the same concept?

984
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:20,930
The buzzword, once a phrase gets the buzzword set as,

985
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:26,380
you lose people attention on the message.

986
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,500
Let's talk about shift right or not.

987
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,260
I'll just throw that into the buzzword.

988
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,100
No, we had a listener accuse us of,

989
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,940
did you see this?

990
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,100
We had a listener accuse that accelerate

991
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,660
the achievement of shipable quality

992
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,420
is likely on its way to buzzword set as.

993
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,220
It's too long and verbi to do that

994
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,380
and no one has shrunk it yet.

995
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,060
Right, it's not there yet.

996
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,060
Lots more I could throw in to talk about,

997
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:55,020
but I think we're out of time.

998
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,460
We should probably wrap it up for today.

999
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,900
Thanks everyone if you've listened this far.

1000
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,820
Hopefully you found something helpful in here.

1001
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,260
Thank you, Perji, Perji.

1002
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,780
Thank you, Perji, Tony and Rajiv for your questions today.

1003
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,380
If we didn't get to yours today,

1004
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,380
we'll try and do it next time.

1005
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,220
Please re-ping us if needed.

1006
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,740
Always appreciated.

1007
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:16,060
I am once again still Alan.

1008
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,260
And I'm Britt.

1009
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,380
Or not Alan, have everyone with that.

1010
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,200
Okay.
