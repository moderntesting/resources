00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,460
Welcome to AB testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,860
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:24,930
Hey everyone, it's Alan and Brent, and this is AB testing.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,690
Of course, do you know that by now?

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:32,130
Because by the time you hear this, I've put the intro on top of this.

8
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,130
Anyway, 128.

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,140
Is that right?

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,260
Just say yes.

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,860
Yes.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,020
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

13
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,700
We were going to have a guest today, but I think I messed that up.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,990
I was talking with it was the same guest we were going to have like three or four weeks ago.

15
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:56,310
And we had an email conversation where we said today, but then I never I don't think I ever said that calendar request follow up.

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,750
So yeah.

17
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,740
And yeah, well, I think I'm going to take.

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,500
100% of the blame there.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:17,420
There's there's another potential issue there as well, because the last time we had to reschedule because they the guests asked for nine o'clock.

20
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,260
They did. They did.

21
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,460
But I did confirm eight.

22
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,420
Their their daughter was sick.

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Child was sick.

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:31,220
Anyway, we'll try again or they may pop up at any time, in which case we'll change subjects, which isn't out of the ordinary anyway.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,580
No, quite. Yeah.

26
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,470
Good to go on that one.

27
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,390
What's new with you?

28
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,540
New with me.

29
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,780
Oh, well, my son officially.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,660
My second son now officially attends your alma mater.

31
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,340
Country Western you.

32
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:09,290
So it's it's interesting because of the covid times and he is in a well, relatively new relationship.

33
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,490
And his girlfriend is now a senior.

34
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,010
So he met her when he was a senior.

35
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,760
And because of covid and the couple just can't be separated.

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,280
Here is an interesting thing.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:34,790
So the the girls parents basically have moved my son into their home and he.

38
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,590
So it's weird.

39
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:45,110
So I had the whole the whole reality of some sort of moving out for college.

40
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:54,910
But none of the drama, because it's sort of a stealth move out like he hasn't he hasn't slept in his own bed.

41
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,830
In months.

42
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,230
And these are the days of our lives.

43
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,750
Yeah, right. But I in in one regard.

44
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:18,810
So my son during during grades, essentially six through twelve, you know, there's a there's this old saying that hard work pays off over time.

45
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:21,800
But procrastination pays off now.

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:28,390
He he lived that up until meeting her.

47
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:36,750
She actually is already getting offers from Ivy League schools throughout the the world.

48
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:46,230
She's strong in academics and she is at least within Washington state, a champion swimmer.

49
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,630
She's actually teaching him, you know, what to do.

50
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,910
And he's got a new perspective.

51
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,070
He sort of woke up and was like, wait a minute.

52
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,710
College after college.

53
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:03,110
It's like me. So I better get my shit together.

54
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:07,670
And yeah, anyway, we'll see what happens.

55
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,470
My oldest started college.

56
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,150
He's doing the Running Start program.

57
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,830
So he's actually a junior in high school.

58
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,870
He's going to finish high school and take full time college classes at the same time.

59
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,470
I am completely supportive of that.

60
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,350
My oldest didn't do that.

61
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,070
I kind of wish he had.

62
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:36,630
He did graduate with just he had he had six AP passes under his belt when he went off the college.

63
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,200
Which shows not really good for anything.

64
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,780
Oh, dude, that when I when I did it, they weren't good for much.

65
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:53,340
And that that took off almost a semester and a half of G off off of his plate.

66
00:04:53,340 --> 00:05:01,260
Yeah. So when I went, the credits counted, but my major required so many credits.

67
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,380
I didn't need extra credits.

68
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,180
The credits count of it.

69
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,580
They didn't count towards any of my requirements.

70
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,980
So they were pretty much just some here.

71
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,500
Here's some free credits.

72
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,380
Yay. Oh, so my youngest.

73
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,700
He he's doing the computer science program at, again, your alma mater.

74
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:29,860
He passed the AP exam and that allowed him to get credit for and skip

75
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:37,580
CS, whatever the first CS, the class is the CS 101 equivalent.

76
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,510
So he's in CS 102 now.

77
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,590
I mean, I don't even know if the numbers are right.

78
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,070
All right. All right.

79
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,750
Go kids. Yeah.

80
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,990
Yeah. So back on.

81
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:57,350
So what I have one thing I want to share with the three, which is actually two things.

82
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,270
Exciting news to share with the three.

83
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,830
One, we could talk about a little bit.

84
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,710
One, I would just make the announcement.

85
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,430
We can't talk about it.

86
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:12,790
But after that, we had a great request to walk through how you and I started

87
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:19,780
in this industry and where we and how that got us to modern testing.

88
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,180
So we'll do that in a moment.

89
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,500
But the one announcement I'm not going to talk about just all just for reasons

90
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,220
is Unity, as of this morning, is now a publicly traded stock.

91
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,500
We have entered the IPO game.

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,640
So that's exciting.

93
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:47,800
And then something happened to me at Unity a few weeks ago that has not happened to me

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:54,420
since 2008 or so.

95
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,530
Do you know what that is, Brent?

96
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,170
Two thousand.

97
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,650
I think 2008 was the last time this ever happened to me.

98
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,630
Got a guess.

99
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,750
You got a good review.

100
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,970
Well, no, I mean, I've had good reviews, but you're on the right track.

101
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,450
I got a promotion.

102
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:16,210
Oh, nice.

103
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,370
So I am now a oh, and two things happen with this.

104
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,010
One is are you a VP of something?

105
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,010
I'm one. I'm one level below a VP.

106
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:29,330
I'm a senior director, but also my boss looked at what I was doing.

107
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,610
And because I had this program management name in my title and he said, that's stupid.

108
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,010
You're now a senior director of engineering.

109
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,500
So I'm a I'm a real boy now.

110
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,660
Nice. You're in.

111
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,420
You're an SD.

112
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,900
Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,940
So that's pretty cool.

114
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,140
I'm excited.

115
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,260
Lots of you know, my org is much bigger now.

116
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,420
We talked about this last time.

117
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,200
I'm not going to go back into it again, but the promotion was in process long

118
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,720
before I took on that org.

119
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,160
It's just recognition for making our stuff go.

120
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,320
And now I just have to make it go better for multiple reasons.

121
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,450
One, the promotion, but to the previous subject.

122
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,050
So yeah, IPO. Yeah.

123
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,290
And I'm trying to find it on the Web.

124
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,330
So what's the ticker?

125
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,350
You. You.

126
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,630
One letter. You.

127
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,470
Wow. I'm surprised.

128
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,790
I mean, that's cool.

129
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,950
It's a surprise.

130
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,630
You haven't been taken.

131
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,510
It is pretty cool.

132
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,910
So yeah, it's at a static price right now.

133
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,550
It's in the price discovery phase.

134
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,030
That's probably all I should say about it.

135
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,690
It should start trading actually shortly.

136
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,530
OK, so anyway, let's get on to the main topic.

137
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,440
And as we all know, the show is about me.

138
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,120
But today I'm going to step aside and let you start.

139
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,920
So as I mentioned before, the question is we had one of the three

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,620
on one of the three dot slack dot com say that they would enjoy a history lesson.

141
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,380
It sort of evolved into we should do an episode or two

142
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,980
talking about how we first independently

143
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,100
and then together came to a similar belief system around modern testing

144
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,740
because we both started purely in the testing world.

145
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,040
And then we took different paths to get to this

146
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,680
violent alignment we have around modern testing.

147
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,140
And it'd be good to talk about that.

148
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,420
So let's start with you and we'll do this is like the

149
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,940
I love the comic book origin stories are so good.

150
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,020
I used to love them.

151
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,100
So let's go back to you in 19.

152
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,760
Wait, we want to go back to to to 19 something.

153
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,120
Hey, you know, we can we can breeze through it.

154
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,840
But I want to do is you started like did you have a tech job before Microsoft?

155
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,000
Or is you start here on it, start there out of college?

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,280
Started out of college.

157
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,640
OK, so you came into an STE job.

158
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,480
You are a software test engineer.

159
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,320
Oh, so yeah, you don't have to walk through.

160
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,360
Well, on my first day and then on my second day.

161
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,760
But let's walk through like giving the brief recap up to the point

162
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,000
where you realize that, you know, we need to change this old way

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,720
where there are any turning points or triggers along the way.

164
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,720
So let's just start at the beginning and I will interject.

165
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,280
But talk about your origins as a software tester

166
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,160
sometime in the mid 1990s at Microsoft.

167
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,500
So it feels like we should have like

168
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,460
way back sound effects.

169
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
I'll help you.

170
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,140
Yeah.

171
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,700
They're negative.

172
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,780
Yeah, thank you.

173
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,220
So way back in the day.

174
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,900
So I graduated college in 1993,

175
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,540
December 1993 as a double major in math, science and computer science.

176
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,980
And I had started college as a math major.

177
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,830
They required multiple different programming courses in there.

178
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:27,690
And it wasn't too long where I realized, oh my God,

179
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,690
I way love the CS stuff

180
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,730
more than the math stuff.

181
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,850
And I bolted on the double major.

182
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,430
And God, maybe a year after that, it was still so I double majored.

183
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,030
It ended up taking me five years to get my undergrad.

184
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:55,550
So about a year after I bolted it on,

185
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,470
I was in love with Microsoft.

186
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,070
And so I spent the last two years of my career

187
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,070
with a single focus on I'm going to Microsoft.

188
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,290
I think I've shared, I know I've shared on my employment here,

189
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,010
even though I had an interview

190
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,930
and all of that was somewhat accidental.

191
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,930
Microsoft wasn't the polished process engine it is today.

192
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,970
And I discovered on my first day of employment here

193
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:47,440
that it was for a intern position and not a full time position,

194
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
which is what I thought.

195
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,080
Like the offer letter didn't indicate.

196
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,480
I wish I still had that.

197
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
Yeah, I should have saved mine to mine.

198
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,880
Mine had me show up to orientation on the wrong day.

199
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,740
So just say, yeah, remember, at some point,

200
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,860
we have to get to the turning point.

201
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,260
So you're going to have to speed up this part of the story.

202
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,650
Back then, I was just trying to think through.

203
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,210
So I had

204
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,070
I not only knew I was going to go to Microsoft,

205
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,750
but I knew I was going to be a developer at Microsoft.

206
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:35,920
And I'm trying to recall how how so my intern position was in a test role.

207
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,590
And I think I got seduced by

208
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,630
by either the hiring manager or the recruiter.

209
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,470
On the story that we used to tell way back in the day around an S debt.

210
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,940
Oh, no, no, no, you're you're a developer.

211
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,940
You're just in the the the test discipline.

212
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,970
Right. You recall that because I think you were

213
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,330
you actually once led the charge on keeping that story alive.

214
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,370
Maybe maybe I didn't know any better.

215
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,610
But we can talk about that in my origin story because I didn't do that.

216
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,770
I didn't know any better.

217
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,330
Like hindsight, 2020, I can look back at it and go, yeah, I don't

218
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:30,530
I don't even remember what the story was, but I could tell you it was bullshit.

219
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,660
Anyway, fast forward.

220
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,020
So immediately after that.

221
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,860
So I found out that I was in an internship.

222
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,900
Not only that, that the internship had a had a a deadline of three months.

223
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,200
And I'm like, whoa, OK, so I just moved up

224
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,960
me and my fiance for a job that's three months.

225
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,400
Oh, my God. How do I springboard this into something useful?

226
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,820
So I don't want to spend all my time on this one, but it was essentially

227
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,800
we got that to be

228
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:17,070
moved to six months and at the end of the six months.

229
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,870
I went through a whole bunch of interviews.

230
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,110
Turned out I had failed them all.

231
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,950
Funny, funny story.

232
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,630
I'll say funny story.

233
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:37,270
Found out later on that it was it had been because my hiring manager

234
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,060
had actually blackballed me.

235
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,500
It's good to know.

236
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,540
I just want to remind everyone that the asinine politics of Microsoft

237
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,780
have been around since the mid 90s. Continue.

238
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,660
Oh, yeah. So and before.

239
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,630
But yeah, and this guy is no longer at the company,

240
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,790
although I will say he survived a very long time.

241
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,190
Now, the question is, obviously, why did he blackball me?

242
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,910
Well, it was because my office mate

243
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,420
was an attractive female

244
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,660
and he was a pig

245
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,820
and on multiple occasions said things, did things with me as a witness.

246
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,260
And he needed me to protect his career.

247
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,220
He needed me to be gone from the company anyway.

248
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,540
No, not anyway.

249
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,180
I. Yeah, go for it.

250
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:43,130
How in the world did this person survive?

251
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,050
For me, I mean, as they survive, I I.

252
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
God, I hate people like that.

253
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,040
I really, really hate them.

254
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,600
Really, really.

255
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,040
I just want to put that in there and you can go on and I do as well.

256
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,490
And we can dox him later.

257
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,770
I do as well.

258
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:06,770
And I will say that when it comes to issues

259
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,970
like sexual harassment or any sort of what do they call it?

260
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:18,690
Any sort of discrimination policy violation,

261
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,010
Microsoft is much better now and

262
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,410
I don't know if it's perfect yet, but one of the things that they do

263
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,210
on any of these things is they hire an independent outside counsel.

264
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,610
Whereas back in those days, HR would handle it internally.

265
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,370
And I am positive.

266
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,130
That is the reason why he was able to survive at the company.

267
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:45,810
There's a myth in software, it's especially true at that time,

268
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,890
and actually for many years at Microsoft that people go, I'm going to go to HR

269
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:55,400
about this HR are there to protect the company, not the individual.

270
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,760
And it was especially prevalent there.

271
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,360
And I'm glad that they're doing that now because that's that's fair.

272
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,800
But I guess it just sickens me.

273
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,200
I had a friend who went through similar stuff eventually.

274
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,990
Eventually, her boss left Microsoft with fully vested options

275
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,350
to spend more time with this family.

276
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,590
That was always the joke.

277
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,630
People were execs or senior people were fired.

278
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,470
They were leaving to spend more time with their family.

279
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,590
And everyone, everyone knew what that meant.

280
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,830
It's changed now.

281
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,310
Execs don't spend more time with their family.

282
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,430
And it's it's.

283
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:37,630
Do they now pursue other interests?

284
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:43,390
Uh, they I saw that after they they're working on special projects.

285
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,510
But which is outside the company.

286
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:53,570
Oh, no, no, no. So so, yeah, special projects is where you put the person

287
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:56,570
who you who you can't haven't fired yet,

288
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,930
but you need to get them away from their team.

289
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,620
Right. OK, so anyway, tangent to when when they leave.

290
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,260
I mean, you can't even the silence is deafening when they leave.

291
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,180
We're like, what? That's old news, right?

292
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,820
I get it. OK.

293
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,620
So anyway, you have eventually started at Microsoft.

294
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,100
You're into your blackball.

295
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,740
Let's get you hired and then actually work towards the point

296
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:30,300
where you begin recognizing that testing isn't the schnitzel anymore.

297
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,980
A buddy of mine at that time

298
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,140
hooked me up with a contract gig

299
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,820
and some friends he had over in the exchange.

300
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,740
Turned out blackballing didn't work so well

301
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,100
through the contact or the contract recruiting channels.

302
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,900
So I ended up being a contractor on a test team.

303
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,820
And at that point in time,

304
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,060
I was happy with anything.

305
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,860
And it turned out I got lucky and got on a very sweet team.

306
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,740
With a very strong set of managers.

307
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:18,420
I was a IC for less than one year at the company.

308
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,670
My my new management staff saw my potential, saw my hunger,

309
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,110
saw that I was good at problem solving and

310
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,860
like I even remember having conversation like yesterday with my manager

311
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,940
that he's like, yeah, just as a heads up, within the next nine months,

312
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,780
you're probably going to be a lead on this team.

313
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,420
Yeah, we did. We did make people leads very way too early

314
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,820
in their career at that time.

315
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,060
Well, for me, hindsight, 2020, I think he made a this

316
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,780
this same manager I'm thinking of is is still to date

317
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,220
the best manager I've ever had.

318
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:07,060
And he saw he saw something in me

319
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,740
and he was able to sort of carve it out.

320
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,700
Right. If you think about the Michelangelo metaphor. Right.

321
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,390
And I remember because every job I had ever had,

322
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,630
I've been moved into management, but I had viewed those as jobs.

323
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,590
And this is the first time where I'm like, oh, my God,

324
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,590
I've actually freaked out when he told me that.

325
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,110
And then I spent the next next nine months sort of watching

326
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,190
every manager that I respected in what they did

327
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,030
because in prior examples, I got promoted to management.

328
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,550
But because I hadn't yet learned the distinction between management

329
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:52,350
and leadership, once I got there, I sucked.

330
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,300
But because I had a strong work ethic,

331
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,440
like I ended up doing all of the work myself

332
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,120
just so that my quote unquote team looked good.

333
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,880
And I'm like, oh, my God, this is my career.

334
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,800
If he does that to me, I'm going to tank my entire career.

335
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,020
But I learned leadership very quickly anyway.

336
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,260
OK, so you're leading testers doing their testing grunt work.

337
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,740
I'm leading testers

338
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,460
just a year or two after that, I became a middle manager.

339
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,920
And, you know, this is all the world where it was on prem products, etc.

340
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,240
So there's that, etc, etc.

341
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,160
OK, God, that was probably ten, 15 years of that.

342
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,230
OK, and then somewhere, I think it was around 2002. OK.

343
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,950
We're finally into the proper century.

344
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,990
Awesome. Go on. Yep.

345
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:55,220
2002, this horrible, horrible, evil, evil thing

346
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,540
started creeping into Microsoft.

347
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,410
And that was this this bullshit, agile stuff.

348
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,020
Right. Where where people were coming in and talking about.

349
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,410
Oh, no, we're not going to document anything.

350
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,600
We're just go ahead.

351
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,240
Yeah, you say I remember that.

352
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,000
And it wasn't even that many people.

353
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,040
There were like a few people here and there going, yeah, we should do this.

354
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,560
And and Microsoft doing their typical not invented here would say, well,

355
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,920
that won't work here. That's that's interesting.

356
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
But that's for other companies.

357
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,490
Yeah. But then there were some teams.

358
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,790
So back in those days, so somewhere in here, right,

359
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:53,180
we did a transition from the PUM model to the the functional model.

360
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,900
And this is moving from this is the editor oversight.

361
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:02,980
The PUM model is the product unit manager where every part of the business,

362
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,620
even even multiple parts of a single business would have a PUM, a product

363
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:12,180
unit manager who would manage the full team working on that across all disciplines.

364
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,140
We moved to a more siloed approach

365
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,180
called extreme siloism, where you had a huge test discipline,

366
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,860
a huge dev discipline, a huge program management discipline.

367
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:31,500
Working for high level people reporting to the like a general manager

368
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,700
or a VP running the business.

369
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,730
And this went on for quite a while.

370
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,530
All right. Back to you, Brent.

371
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:43,810
Yeah, the the PUM model kind of optimized for knowledge sharing around the product,

372
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,850
whereas the functional model optimized for knowledge sharing within a discipline.

373
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:53,730
It was interesting because I happened to be on the team

374
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,850
where the functional model was piloted.

375
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,370
For most of the folks in that team,

376
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:08,160
that we viewed this model as abjectly failed,

377
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,400
but the executive whose idea it was,

378
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,800
you know, that the data will be tortured until it agrees with us.

379
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:27,940
That stupid idea got pushed through all of Microsoft anyway.

380
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,020
So at the same time, Agile was starting to creep in.

381
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,220
And back in those days, you would go to a particular team,

382
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,900
a particular culture, and you could discover very quickly which discipline ruled.

383
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,360
You would find that some teams had a primarily a PM culture

384
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,780
that essentially, if you think about Animal Farm,

385
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,020
one of my favorite quotes from Animal Farm is,

386
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,740
all animals are equal, but the pigs are a little more equal than everybody else.

387
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,780
In this world, like a PM culture,

388
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,780
they would have more votes or a dev culture.

389
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,060
There was never a team I experienced

390
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,860
where tests really controlled the culture.

391
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,780
Exchange got close.

392
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,220
Exchange got close, but it ended up being

393
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,580
more around the people, not the discipline.

394
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,460
So let me add one counterpoint to that, because there was one time in my career,

395
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,660
in my career at Microsoft where that was different.

396
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,300
And that was on the shit show known as Windows Millennium.

397
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:49,900
And I remember we put someone who had no idea what they were doing

398
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,340
in charge of the development team from because just for context,

399
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,540
Windows 98 was going to be the last version of consumer Windows ever shipped.

400
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:05,230
And once Windows XP, I think it was no Windows 2000 was delayed.

401
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,180
Marketing came back and some other teams came back and said

402
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,900
we had another version of Windows, remembering at that time,

403
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,940
Windows, this is pre like Internet download,

404
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,940
the Windows was the main ship vehicle for a lot of smaller applications,

405
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,820
everything from Internet hearts to some other diagnostic tools built by other teams.

406
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,820
So they quickly pulled together a team to work on Windows Millennium.

407
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:33,260
And it was very clear from our GM who led our triad, as it was called,

408
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,820
what my role was going to be.

409
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,620
And the role made sense to be on the dev team.

410
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,580
So I went and chatted with this person.

411
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,700
They were going to make the dev director for this product.

412
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:48,380
And he was such a total dweeb and had no idea

413
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,380
that I went and did the same exact job for the test director.

414
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,380
In that case, if the dev team might have had the power,

415
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,700
they were more equal than the rest.

416
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,190
But for me, it was like the thing I tell people when I recruit them to Unity,

417
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,110
I tell them it's easy to do good work here.

418
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,150
It was easier for me to do good work and do the same work better on that team

419
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,670
than it was working for the dev director.

420
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:19,030
So slight, slight, slight twist to your story, but still more or less holds true.

421
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,950
But it reminded me, I wouldn't remember to add it in my story.

422
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,190
So I wanted to add it now back to you, Brent.

423
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:27,110
So the casual stuff was coming in.

424
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,230
One of the things that I remember early on,

425
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,070
because I had a bunch of mentees at that time.

426
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:39,560
And again, they would come from teams where the dev leadership,

427
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,720
number one, controlled the org or, you know, mostly controlled the org

428
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,280
or the product direction, the strategy.

429
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,050
That's what I mean by controlled the org.

430
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:58,180
And they had learned about this,

431
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,620
this new fad called Agile.

432
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:08,860
And one of the things that started happening is they were rolling this out,

433
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:13,390
even in the world where we were in on-prem products, right?

434
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,190
The term CICD hadn't been invented, right?

435
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,390
There was no continuous delivery whatsoever.

436
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,590
But there was a lot of things that were considered overhead

437
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:28,430
that really appealed with dev.

438
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,070
And since they were controlled, they just made it happen.

439
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,590
And so I would have a lot of mentees coming to me and saying,

440
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:41,530
wait a minute, my dev team is saying that they're going to be agile.

441
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,370
So I'm not going to get any sort of documentation

442
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,810
for which to build my test plan.

443
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,900
Now, back in those days,

444
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,740
you did not F with the test plan, right?

445
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,060
That because, as you well know,

446
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:03,980
one of the biggest, most important value propositions

447
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:08,900
that the test team provided that the test team

448
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,020
hated being one of their more important services

449
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,020
was scapegoating at product release.

450
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,740
Right. And so if a dev

451
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,660
was going to not give me documentation,

452
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,130
right, certainly that's going to be optimizing for scapegoating.

453
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,730
And how do I avoid that?

454
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,730
Because I hate that aspect of it, like the question of

455
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,650
why was this not tested before?

456
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,080
So very much at that time hated this idea of agile,

457
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,680
hated it because it essentially victimized the test discipline,

458
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,310
which at that point in time, I was quite proud of.

459
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:57,110
Then I went to a team that Alan and I both worked on,

460
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,310
although never at the same time.

461
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,270
I think we overlapped by like a day, maybe a week.

462
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:11,820
And his and my experience of that team is very different.

463
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,700
Well, you left at the sort of the end of a

464
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,780
end of a thing, and I joined at the very beginning of the next thing.

465
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,460
So you had the previous experience and I tell people

466
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,540
and we can name drop here my two years on Xbox One

467
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,940
were the best five years of my career.

468
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,740
It was such a horribly.

469
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,260
I mean, I had fun working on it.

470
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,900
And I'll talk about this next time when we talk about

471
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:43,330
sort of how I came to these beliefs, but horribly, horribly, horribly run product.

472
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:48,050
People running the show there had just didn't have a clue what they were doing.

473
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:54,080
It's it's a miracle that Xbox One came together as well as it did.

474
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,720
And I will actually take a chunk of the credit for that, but not that much.

475
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,640
But anyway, go on, Brett.

476
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,380
Well, so I won't speak to what happened when I left.

477
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:14,140
I hold out hope that that the leadership at that point in time

478
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,460
did a solid job on cleaning the house.

479
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,080
But I will absolutely say that was an organization run by Dev.

480
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,200
And in this case, controlled by Dev.

481
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
And I almost literally mean it that way.

482
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,060
I don't think that that's the case anymore, thank goodness.

483
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:44,450
But they had they had bastardized agile and

484
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,770
used it to justify cowboy.

485
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:56,160
Essentially, we get to do what we want when we want because that's agile.

486
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,840
And in particular, like the the principle around scrum

487
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,100
that you don't hear talking about so much anymore,

488
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,560
but the principle around scrum around management

489
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,950
being not only useless overhead,

490
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,010
but a negative value proposition to the scrum process. Right.

491
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,090
So we as an individual dev team, we get to do what we want

492
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,490
and not even management can tell us otherwise.

493
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,980
And somehow that organization made that stick

494
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,230
and it put tests in a really bad place.

495
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,380
Testing, it was still our job to find the bugs before release.

496
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,210
But the way things were set up, it was pretty much guaranteed

497
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,930
that that wasn't going to happen.

498
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:01,660
And so that that caused me to

499
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:05,780
the documentation was an initial threat.

500
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:13,070
Right. As I said, I'm like, oh, God, OK, how are we going to do anything

501
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,950
if we don't get solid documentation from our development team?

502
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,250
But what even but this particular experience

503
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:27,590
said, whoa, agile is enabling

504
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:34,530
enabling teams to to be completely

505
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:39,250
disorganized, completely dysfunctional, in my humble opinion, that time.

506
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,730
Yeah, at that time.

507
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,290
And because this is still true today where teams take

508
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:47,190
organization teams, people

509
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,830
Brent's like the only person in all of the podcasting world

510
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,590
who will eat his breakfast while podcasting.

511
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,430
I'm hungry, dude. Sorry.

512
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,970
So people read selective parts

513
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,250
and make their own interpretations that actually internalizing and thinking

514
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,290
of it as a system.

515
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,730
So we've all seen these. Oh, agile means no documentation.

516
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,090
We're not saying that.

517
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,010
We're saying that the developers Brent was working with at the time

518
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,130
were taking the parts of agile they felt like for fun.

519
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,130
And and they were rationalized and justifying.

520
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,970
Yeah, justifying poor behavior because air quote, it's agile.

521
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:33,570
So then you left that team and went somewhere magical.

522
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,360
Well, actually, further.

523
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,520
So what I did is

524
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:51,040
by that time, there was enough information on the web to to do a search

525
00:35:51,860 --> 00:36:01,490
and realize that that the that there are a large number of teams and companies

526
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:11,110
that were not converting agile into cowboy and succeeding.

527
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:14,230
Right. Things like accelerate in those studies.

528
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,350
They were far.

529
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,970
I mean, they probably weren't even a glimmer in the Kohl's eye at that point in time.

530
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,150
But it wasn't it didn't take much effort to realize

531
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:32,530
that a lot of companies were were really succeeding with this.

532
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,970
And one of the things that I looked at it, I'm like, OK,

533
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,170
so my understanding of agile has got to be wrong

534
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,560
because no company would stay in business if agile meant

535
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,580
what this group is doing.

536
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:54,100
And so that caused me to to to understand it

537
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,940
far more deeply.

538
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,100
This is also the time where I went and got

539
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,060
I did a whole bunch of reading.

540
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:11,180
I did a whole bunch of I hadn't gotten done the safe thing yet.

541
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,460
But then I realized and started deploying it within my own team.

542
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,660
And I realized, OK, I understand a bit of why agile works.

543
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,580
And at the same time, I was done.

544
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
I was done with that org.

545
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,940
I needed to move on.

546
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,500
So I moved to Bing.

547
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,020
And whenever I make a decision.

548
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:34,340
Hold on. Just people know Bing is a search engine just because they may not know that.

549
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,760
All right. Go on.

550
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,400
Thank you for that public service announcement.

551
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,440
Bing powered by Azure, which is actually true.

552
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,560
But all right. Go on. It is actually true.

553
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:57,540
The so I went to to Bing and I took finally after who knows how many years

554
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:04,580
I finally did achieve my initial goal of working at Microsoft as a developer.

555
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,490
Join Bing on a data team.

556
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:14,050
Well, actually, most teams in Bing eventually end up being a data team.

557
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,860
And because they were a service organization,

558
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,940
agile was a necessity.

559
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,300
And so I joined a team that was actually hunger, hungry to

560
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,940
to to do agile. Bing was actually where

561
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,760
the the combined engineering model, as it was described, started.

562
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,520
So I happened it had already been in flight about a month when I joined.

563
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,930
I am fast forwarding.

564
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,060
I deployed an agile paradigm.

565
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,500
I did not have a test team per se.

566
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,780
I as as I think I've shared on the podcast multiple times,

567
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:09,540
a good portion of my developers at that time were former testers.

568
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:13,620
And we started going through and shipping products

569
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,820
and thinking of it as an end to end system.

570
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:20,570
OK, what do we have to do to minimize maintenance costs?

571
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,570
What do we have to do to get this product out?

572
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,090
And once we finally shifted over to Kanban,

573
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:33,430
that sealed the deal for me, because it made me realize that

574
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:38,110
what one of the things that that test did

575
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:45,390
is the minimize risk of of a negative customer impact.

576
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,270
Well, and to be clear, I mean, we had a discipline do that,

577
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,430
but I was just that's a line I give all the time.

578
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,670
That is the purpose of testing, regardless of who does it.

579
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,750
We just had special people dedicated to that.

580
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,030
Right. And so during that whole experience, I was

581
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,400
I was constantly thinking, OK, number one, you know,

582
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,680
because we're trying to shift to combine engineering,

583
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,000
I really don't have a choice.

584
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,440
However, I do have test talent underneath me.

585
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
And I could I could just say, all right, you know what?

586
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,160
Yeah, you're a developer, but you're going to develop test automation.

587
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,400
I could have done it. I did.

588
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,160
And I'm glad I didn't because what I actually found

589
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,760
is that the testers underneath me

590
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,920
did a better job at shipping production code.

591
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:42,860
Same. And the biggest problem with them, though, is is

592
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:46,180
and it's not and I'm sure you've encountered this.

593
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:53,460
Back in the day, one of the prevailing problems with S debts

594
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:58,850
was sort of a self-esteem issue around their coding ability

595
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:02,870
where the low. But I'm just a tester.

596
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,150
I can't write production code.

597
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,070
And I wouldn't say that was widespread.

598
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,550
And we'll talk about this because I I wrote code that shipped in

599
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:19,610
I nearly are all of every product I ever worked on as a tester.

600
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,140
No. So I wasn't afraid.

601
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,180
I just didn't I just didn't like doing it that much.

602
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,220
But anyway, I think that I could see that. But you go on.

603
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:32,420
Yeah. So I didn't I didn't suffer from this either.

604
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,500
There was this view that I saw quite often from from testers

605
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:45,700
that essentially production code and magic are not too far apart.

606
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,120
Right. It's a view I see today with with data science.

607
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,760
I am where I spend a good amount of time, particularly with PM

608
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,930
orgs, I spent a good amount of time trying to demystify data science.

609
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:07,370
I did have a a long argument with a guy from sales

610
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,700
just a few months ago where he was just absolutely convinced

611
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:20,060
that AI was already solving every problem he ever had ever.

612
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,020
You were doing agile on this team, getting the hang of it.

613
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,820
And how did that lead you?

614
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:31,260
Like that was still 15 years ago.

615
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,700
So what led you down the path of that?

616
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,740
Wasn't that like 2000?

617
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,810
Oh, it was not. No, sorry. I'm off by a decade.

618
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,450
That was like seven years ago.

619
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,130
Yeah, I think it's seven eight. It's creeping up on a decade.

620
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:49,490
Yeah. And then we started the podcast, which in hindsight

621
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:51,490
has always been about modern testing.

622
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:55,690
Maybe it's almost about five and a half, six and a half years ago.

623
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,210
Shoot. So right around that time we began the podcast.

624
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:04,770
So what led you from that point towards things

625
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,370
that are more modern testing ish?

626
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,700
As I as I went through it, I kept on asking myself,

627
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,300
when would I hire a specialist?

628
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:20,380
When would I hire a specialist?

629
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,340
How would a specialist improve

630
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,220
the business KPIs for what I'm doing?

631
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,620
Every time I actually had a positive answer to that,

632
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:36,490
oh, I would do this because of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

633
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:42,220
I found that it was quite easy to come up with

634
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,260
what I needed to do immediately to adapt within my organization

635
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,270
to then eliminate that.

636
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,270
You follow?

637
00:43:52,270 --> 00:43:57,470
Where essentially, as I kept on doing this and realizing that,

638
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,590
number one, the biggest, most important event in my life

639
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,820
was on that particular topic,

640
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:12,950
was the day so we had we had already shifted to Kanban

641
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:20,180
and my someone on my team shipped a bad change

642
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:26,530
and our service was on the floor, just on the floor,

643
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:34,850
realizing that we knew it near instantly that it was on the floor

644
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,220
and that because it was a single change,

645
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,620
because the Kanban model doesn't batch all these things

646
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,860
into a big chunk,

647
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:52,160
it took us five minutes to back out that change to revert it.

648
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,260
And I compare that to my prior life

649
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,340
where it would have been a month test pass beforehand

650
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,220
and still had the risk that that change would have gone out

651
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,820
and dropped the service on the floor.

652
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,100
So as you know, a lot of modern testing is stolen,

653
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,220
probably more borrowed, sorry, borrowed, not stolen,

654
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:17,820
borrowed from lean than agile and Kanban, a lean concept.

655
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,860
And of course, lean and agile aren't separate things,

656
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:22,780
they're overlapping, complimentary things,

657
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:25,860
but lean startup, obviously a big influence

658
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,220
on what we ended up with.

659
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,460
So just really quick, and we can,

660
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,770
we'll get to a point where our stories begin to merge

661
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,130
with the modern testing principles,

662
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:42,220
but what led you to think, well, let me ask it this way.

663
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,300
My observation is that you discovered agile,

664
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,140
figured out how to make it work,

665
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,980
and then in fairly short time,

666
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,460
sort of shifted to more of lean approaches.

667
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,540
How did that happen?

668
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,710
Is that a correct observation and how did that happen?

669
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:07,630
Oh, it's essentially our second scrum-based sprint.

670
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:09,510
We completely screwed the pooch.

671
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,870
We would do scrum iterations every two weeks.

672
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:24,590
And our very second sprint with me as the new team lead,

673
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:31,590
we worked very hard, completely refactored our entire system.

674
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:37,990
And everyone had a belief that they understood

675
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:42,070
the interface contract between the components.

676
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:48,110
And hindsight 2020, it became clear that everyone's belief

677
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,550
was 80% correct, but the other 20% was enough

678
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,300
to make each integration point fail.

679
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:04,380
And we ended up spending three months to undo and repair

680
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:10,190
the damage we had done in a single two week sprint.

681
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:13,750
Because we had done such a huge refactor,

682
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:17,470
reversion was not possible or sensical.

683
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,630
You missed something in there.

684
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:21,190
And as we've discussed before, it's very easy.

685
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:23,830
That's why I shifted to lean.

686
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:27,110
Yeah, it's very easy in what do you call it?

687
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:32,140
Scrum, it's the default for team shifting there

688
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,820
without any discipline is scrum or fall.

689
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,460
Yeah, anyway, so just to close,

690
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,980
because we're at time now,

691
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,980
but that was really the eye opening moment for me

692
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:52,020
is when it comes to the idea of modern testing,

693
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:59,420
was that there were faster ways to get the feedback

694
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:08,300
back to my developers that they had just written a bug

695
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,220
than a test specialist team.

696
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,060
Yeah.

697
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,180
And this then got tested,

698
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,140
because as you know, I then left Bing

699
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:24,340
and on two different occasions,

700
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,860
I was part of the leadership team

701
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:31,610
helping that organization shift to unified engineering.

702
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:34,370
And I saw these things,

703
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:37,250
these same sort of phenomenon repeating.

704
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:39,950
Damn, right?

705
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:43,190
What came out of modern testing,

706
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,710
or what is now modern testing is sort of a culmination

707
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:51,580
of the focus and the perspective

708
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,430
as well as the experience.

709
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:58,830
Like when testers come to me and they're like,

710
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:00,390
well, why am I blah, blah, blah?

711
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:02,150
No one loves me, blah, blah, blah.

712
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,710
And I just look at them and I go, oh, well,

713
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,790
it's because you don't actually understand your customer

714
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,950
or your business.

715
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:12,870
Go fix that.

716
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:15,230
So let me recap this in the more close.

717
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:19,790
So you started off with the interesting start as a tester,

718
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,790
grew into a lead, watched Scrum done poorly,

719
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:30,410
moved on to a team that was a lot closer to Agile,

720
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:34,290
did that, shifted towards lean,

721
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:39,260
and that eventually grew into what came as modern testing.

722
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,100
So-

723
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,260
And well, to add to that, in the entire time,

724
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:48,790
reevaluating when should I bring in

725
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,670
my last decades experience into this

726
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,950
to improve forward progress?

727
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,270
Yeah, and that's what we've talked about a lot

728
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,110
on the podcast up to now.

729
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:01,390
So next time I'll tell my similar story.

730
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,210
It'd be interesting.

731
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:04,510
And then we'll try and remember the time

732
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:08,030
when we crossed paths, I know pretty much when it was,

733
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:13,030
it was we first crossed paths in around 2007.

734
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:21,820
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

735
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:24,900
I think that's, I think that's, no, no, no, no, no, no,

736
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,700
maybe we'll figure that out next time.

737
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,020
We'll figure that out next time, right?

738
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,720
I think I'm right.

739
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:30,880
Hold on.

740
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,720
Oh, Jesus Christ.

741
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:32,600
You're not right.

742
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,740
I think maybe.

743
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:36,780
I was.

744
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,090
Life with Brent.

745
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:42,690
This is gonna be the worst ending to a podcast ever.

746
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,330
Oh, you know what?

747
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:46,480
What?

748
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,320
You are right.

749
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,720
No, nevermind.

750
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,280
It's the best ending ever.

751
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,950
Can you repeat that last line one more time?

752
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:54,950
Well, there's two things.

753
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:56,470
No, no, no, that's not what you said.

754
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,840
You said you are right.

755
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,580
So you are right.

756
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:02,820
Number one.

757
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,780
And number two, I am still right.

758
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,780
And number two, my LinkedIn resume is F'd up.

759
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,820
That has nothing to do with me.

760
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,720
No, so that happened when I was the TM of Media Center.

761
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,920
And I know that was 2007 to 2009.

762
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,920
My entire recollection of what years things are.

763
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:28,920
I think what product,

764
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,980
what was I doing in my career at that time?

765
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,900
So I remembered, I remember where I was.

766
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,740
I knew what it was.

767
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,620
Okay, we're gonna hit the other side

768
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,180
of the modern testing origin story next time,

769
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,620
including a little bit of,

770
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,660
and again, because I'm right.

771
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,340
Even though I'm chronologically older,

772
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,980
I'm more mentally acute

773
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,780
than old, old forgetful head over there.

774
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,620
True.

775
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,460
Say it again.

776
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,760
You are right.

777
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,300
You are right.

778
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,140
There we go.

779
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:58,660
All right, I'm still Alan.

780
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,140
And I'm not.

781
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:03,540
And we'll try this whole thing again in reverse next time.
