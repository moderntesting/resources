00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,640
Welcome to AV testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,340
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,580
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,380
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,040
Hello everyone.

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,360
Welcome to the AV testing podcast.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm Alan.

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,800
He's Brent and this is episode 200 and something.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,300
That correct?

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,340
What do you think?

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,840
17.

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,380
We are once again, so prepared.

13
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,860
I want to know your name too.

14
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,020
And we are the name episode 217 and it is, it's Brent.

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:39,340
Yeah.

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,560
There we go.

17
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,380
All right.

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,420
Well, here we are again.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,020
We've been, uh, you know, doing our thing, which we've done forever,

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,700
which really has no point.

21
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,220
It's just two guys sitting around drinking beer, virtual beer,

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,580
because I don't have a beer in front of me.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,740
And we're talking about software leadership, whatever comes to mind.

24
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,360
And sometimes it's, um, video games, streaming television, but Brent,

25
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:58,940
how you been, man?

26
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,280
What's up?

27
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:01,790
Oh, doing all right.

28
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,510
Let me show you something that I can't wait.

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,070
Just recently.

30
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,470
I'm just saying it's a clock.

31
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,590
It's a ceiling vent.

32
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,270
It's, oh, it's this 25 year crystal thing.

33
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,090
That's my 25 year right next to my 30 year.

34
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,050
Oh, mother of God.

35
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,550
Yeah.

36
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,590
When did I start at Microsoft?

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,210
So I started, I would be coming up on year 30 if I was there, but I'm not there.

38
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,290
You're not.

39
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,930
That's true.

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,210
I have gone on to different things since then and learned a lot, which if you're

41
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,450
a long time listener, you will know because we've been doing this podcast for 150 years.

42
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,290
I wasn't even born yet when we started this podcast.

43
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,000
No.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,600
And then I came like what, 10 years after that.

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,320
Yeah, somewhere.

46
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:50,920
Yeah.

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,400
Yeah.

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:51,920
All right.

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,840
Well, congratulations.

50
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,440
Thank you.

51
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,120
Can you get a huge cash prize of that?

52
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,360
Or they still give you like 30 shares of stock with that?

53
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,450
No, you only get stock with the 10.

54
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,250
That's it.

55
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:02,850
That's it.

56
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,650
I can't remember.

57
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,610
I forgotten all the awards.

58
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:07,890
Um, five.

59
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,480
Do you still use head track 10, 15?

60
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,880
Shut up.

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Shut up.

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,120
Do you still use head tracks?

63
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,760
Um, has it been changed?

64
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,240
Same thing that existed 30 years ago.

65
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Uh, here, I'll try it out right now.

66
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,960
You don't have to try it right now.

67
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,200
No, it makes for great podcast material.

68
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,760
No, it doesn't.

69
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,720
What I found is when I refer to HR systems, I still find myself saying head tracks

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,840
once in a while and, uh, yeah, head tracks is this old.

71
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,920
Yeah, it's still running.

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:43,640
All right.

73
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,040
Good for that.

74
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,200
Hasn't been migrated to the cloud.

75
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,960
It's still like running internal.

76
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,000
Of course it is.

77
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,400
Um, yeah, of course it is.

78
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,280
All right.

79
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,320
That's fun.

80
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,650
Well, here we are.

81
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,450
We're back again.

82
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,530
Um, any, I don't think I have anything exciting to tell yet.

83
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,970
Maybe later in the podcast.

84
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,410
Uh, we'll do the pre-roll filler in the middle.

85
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,740
So did you have anything before we got into our first topic for the day?

86
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,800
I may, I have a couple of things that are not nearly as interesting.

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,880
Tell us, tell us, tell us, uh, just three days ago, I turned double nickel.

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,200
All right.

89
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,320
And that's old.

90
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,560
It is.

91
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,740
And it, but it also means, um, Oh, I don't know what

92
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,420
the color of the work, but I hit tenure or whatever that magic thing is.

93
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:36,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,780
You can, you can, you can leave and you get to keep your invested options,

95
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,500
which is really cool.

96
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,620
I did not stay that long either.

97
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,060
I blew it.

98
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,300
I'm my financial planning.

99
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,090
Um, actually my, my, my mental health surpassed my financial planning.

100
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,650
I will be much better off if I stayed, but I probably also be dead.

101
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:59,290
So, you know, and then the other thing on, on just totally like, um, just slight

102
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,010
proof that I don't entirely lack of life.

103
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,010
Oh, it's going to be huge.

104
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,570
It's for me, it's major.

105
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,000
Um, I think we're waiting.

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:22,070
So myself, my daughter and one of her better friends on, um, Slurpee day

107
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:28,970
seven 11 will be seeing, uh, some yacht rock band.

108
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,610
I know it is.

109
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,880
MCR and violent films.

110
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,960
Oh, cool.

111
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,920
MCR for those who aren't total geezers.

112
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,400
Uh, no, actually it's the total geezers.

113
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,280
I don't know what MCR is my chemical romance.

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,360
I, I, that's a good, I knew what you're talking about.

115
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,720
And it'll be like my first concert.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,920
My, it'll be her, my daughter's first concert ever.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,640
It'll be my first concert.

118
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,400
Last time we went to a concert was before kids.

119
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,440
Oh my God.

120
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,160
Yeah.

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,520
Yeah.

122
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,880
Um, I go fairly often.

123
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,280
Um, not super often, but I love live shows.

124
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,680
I'm going to see a band you never heard of the kids.

125
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,720
No, I'm going to see the Linda Linda's next week, week after next at the showbox.

126
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,520
I do know one of my favorite bands because you mentioned it as one of your

127
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,000
favorite bands, like three or four.

128
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, very cool.

129
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,080
They're, they're fun.

130
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Just garage punk ish pop punkish.

131
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,280
I don't know.

132
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,600
Okay, cool.

133
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,600
Anything so nice.

134
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,400
Nice to be out of a life.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
Um, cool.

136
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,320
Anything else?

137
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,960
No, I went to New York last week.

138
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,400
That was fun.

139
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,040
Didn't do anything exciting.

140
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:37,520
All right.

141
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
Let's let's talk about your topic.

142
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:40,720
Okay.

143
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,680
Here we go.

144
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,440
So is it a mailbag from Brent?

145
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,840
Should I play the mailbag sound?

146
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,970
If you're going to answer it entirely.

147
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:49,610
Sure.

148
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,650
Let's talk about, cause you brought it up.

149
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,770
So in our pure, 100% professional planning, Brent said, I think I have something to

150
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,570
talk about and he said, do you have an answer to this thing?

151
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,890
I said, no, but I'll talk about it.

152
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,570
He said, cool.

153
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,250
It's on the show.

154
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,570
You liar.

155
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,730
You told me you had an answer to it.

156
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:08,610
The answer is trying.

157
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,890
Oh my God.

158
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,570
You're just like every PM I work with vaporware vaporware.

159
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,890
You're like, Oh, how dare you?

160
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,850
If you, if we were still at the same room, fighting words, I'd be throwing

161
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,130
markers and erasers at you.

162
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,130
All right.

163
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:37,740
Um, one of the challenges that, that I am currently facing.

164
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:38,760
Okay.

165
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:47,160
And this has to do with it's a downstream impact of COVID.

166
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:56,250
So there's a lot of these things, but, um, before COVID, right.

167
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:06,720
Hardly any remote work being done after COVID, um, like my company realized,

168
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,280
Oh, wait a minute.

169
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:16,240
If we allow hybrid, we could save a butt load on, on leases.

170
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:17,920
Right.

171
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,280
Move.

172
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,080
Yep.

173
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:29,090
The, however, what is there is a wacky combination of hybrid

174
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:39,030
so, uh, most of my team, I would say, so I managed a team of, of, uh, 10 now.

175
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,270
So 10 plus me is 11.

176
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:42,830
Thank you.

177
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,570
And four of them are remote.

178
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,080
Okay.

179
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:57,210
And all in my four remote people, they're in, they're in the US, but all of them

180
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,600
are in different states, like multiple hours apart.

181
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:12,330
And one of the things that's, that's, that's happening is the benefits, the,

182
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,010
the energy around people working together.

183
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:26,390
Um, I'm just not seeing it like I did prior to COVID.

184
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,230
Right.

185
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:36,160
And so now we have, it's very difficult to, Oh, and it's not just teamwork.

186
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,440
Cause the, you've, you've seen my, my presentation of how I walk people through

187
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:53,020
agile and, and what this has a tendency of doing is creating strong collaborative

188
00:08:53,020 --> 00:09:00,970
connections that begin to extend beyond the professional, like they, they

189
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,810
start creating friends now.

190
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,000
Excuse me.

191
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:13,110
So, okay, dude, I don't edit anymore.

192
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,950
So just, just, you have, you have to be good at this 217 episodes, actually

193
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,190
216 for you because we skipped you on one, but come on, man.

194
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:20,550
Let's go.

195
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:20,870
Yeah.

196
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,430
Okay.

197
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:21,790
Sorry.

198
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:28,910
I muted so I could cough my, um, lungs out the gap.

199
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:36,040
Now from management, the teamwork obviously has positive goals

200
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
cause the teams that collaborate together get more productive.

201
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,320
Okay.

202
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:41,800
Sure.

203
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:50,560
But the thing that I had really well prior to COVID, um, and I don't know

204
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,960
why it's taking me so long to realize, yeah, it's not coming back unless I take

205
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:02,420
action, um, the teamwork was a huge source of employee engagement.

206
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,060
Yeah.

207
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:03,940
Right.

208
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,340
And it reminded me, I was sharing this, uh, with a mentee just yesterday.

209
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,290
And I paused and I'm like, Oh, I have a topic for my podcast this week.

210
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:23,100
Anyway, um, Gallup did a poll years ago around employee engagement.

211
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:33,440
And one of the things that they found was a, just a massive predictor of.

212
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,310
Do you have high engagement at your, in your business or your work?

213
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:40,750
Right.

214
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,910
And it was just simply this, do you have a best friend at work?

215
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,090
That question answering yes is a high predictor.

216
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,330
That's interesting because I've spent a lot of time looking at the Gallup data.

217
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,850
And I did not see that one.

218
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,690
Um, most of the research shows that the biggest predictors or

219
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,970
engagement are three things.

220
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,450
Does your manager care about you?

221
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,290
Do you know why your job's important?

222
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,450
Are you getting feedback?

223
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,810
Actionable feedback.

224
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,890
Those, those things are drivers.

225
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,130
If you, if you nail those things, you have engaged people and the engagement

226
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:19,090
is measured more directly by things like, would you recommend this as a great place

227
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,960
to work, but I haven't heard the best friend one yet because, um,

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,040
well, actually, so I'm, um, I don't know how long ago that study was.

229
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:36,620
Um, cause it was, I saw a long list of, they would ask, I think 12 or 20 questions.

230
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,460
I don't remember, but does your manager care about you?

231
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,780
I think it's very similar to that best friend thing.

232
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:45,620
Okay.

233
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:45,980
Sure.

234
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,660
Right.

235
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,260
You want, you want to feel like you're taking care of it.

236
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,940
It goes, it plays with a hierarchy of needs.

237
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,300
Sure.

238
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:53,940
Sure.

239
00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:01,010
Um, and my folks that are remote, right.

240
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:08,240
That really, the manager cares about you is really the closest I can get to helping

241
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,640
those employees answered.

242
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,200
Do you have a best friend at work?

243
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,520
So let me, I want to start to answer this because it's a common thing.

244
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:21,080
And even before COVID, my team was in seven, seven different countries all over

245
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,520
the place.

246
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:28,000
So I thought about this a lot and it, uh, it's really up to you.

247
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,000
This is on the manager because you have to create an environment where

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,560
collaboration can happen.

249
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,360
And there's a bunch of things you can do for this.

250
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:42,070
It takes like, I would say 90% of the managers in tech, okay, maybe 80 are

251
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,150
just fricking lazy.

252
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,670
They don't do enough to take care of their employees and drive that

253
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,950
engagement we were just talking about.

254
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,520
Uh, so with remote workers or workers not in the same office, as a lot of

255
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,100
companies have, it takes a lot of effort from the manager because one, you

256
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,940
need to create opportunities for collaboration.

257
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,540
So what if, you know, entropy would say that in a, or where everyone's

258
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,540
remote people, people would tend to work siloed.

259
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,380
I bet those is a good chance that those four people who work completely

260
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:19,260
remote tend to get siloed into areas of expertise, um, air areas of things

261
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,660
they do by the things they're really good at.

262
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,220
So they just do autonomously and independently far away.

263
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,900
Now, as you know, bottlenecks are bad.

264
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,300
You know, your specialization is a career limiting factor.

265
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,780
But also career growth stagnates because those folks, if they're just

266
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,700
doing their thing and they're doing it in a little, little teeny silo,

267
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,660
their career growth stagnates too.

268
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,700
It's a, and that is also your responsibility as a manager.

269
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,700
So, uh, a couple of things you need to do, and these aren't answers here,

270
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,740
but I think it's a new world and we need managers who can constantly

271
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,580
experiment in trying to solve this stuff.

272
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,660
So part of it is collaboration.

273
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,180
So I know in your rituals, you're getting them involved in, you know, the teams.

274
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,140
I'm sorry, Microsoft, you have to use teams.

275
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,060
Uh, but I'm, there's teams calls are on, they're working on stuff together,

276
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,820
but, and I know you encourage pairing and, you know, pairing these folks

277
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,140
different, you know, get them to know other people through pairing.

278
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:22,770
Um, one thing that I did, I kind of fell off my radar and the current job,

279
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,970
I did at unity a lot, especially during the pandemic was I wanted to recreate,

280
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,490
um, like you're talking about friends and the problem with being on teams all the

281
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,130
time with every meeting is on teams and not in person is all you ever talk about

282
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,570
as work, nothing else.

283
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:42,370
And with as many meetings as people have on their calendar, the last thing you

284
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,410
want to do is let's put a meeting on the calendar where we shoot the shit.

285
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,270
I tried to do like a Friday brain break meeting, uh, at the current job.

286
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,830
Did you ever get that to work ever?

287
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,630
What?

288
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,950
That that, so we've done that.

289
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,510
Like, no, no, let me, let me finish.

290
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,950
Let me finish.

291
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,150
So I tried like a Friday brain break here.

292
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,030
Let's let's let's have everybody get here and we'll play games for a half hour,

293
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,150
45 minutes on Friday.

294
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,950
People like, no, I don't, I have too much to do.

295
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,910
I don't have the time to socialize.

296
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,020
So you're in meetings.

297
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,500
People over talk about work.

298
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,500
They never get a chance to know each other.

299
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,820
They don't find their common interests without common interests.

300
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:22,140
They don't discover people they're friendly with, let alone friends or

301
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,740
best friends.

302
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,260
So a couple of things.

303
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,790
The easiest one is, and you probably do this when you're having one of your

304
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,790
ritual meetings, take not, not even five, two minutes, ask people with it

305
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,190
another weekend, find out who cooked.

306
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,190
What's the weirdest food you ate this weekend?

307
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:38,990
What's the most, what's the weirdest food you've ever eaten?

308
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,990
Just ask them questions like that.

309
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,190
Get them talking a little bit and then get onto the work.

310
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,390
But more importantly, because people, sometimes people are awkward there.

311
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:48,390
They just go, I just want to go over my status branch.

312
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,430
Don't make me be weird.

313
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,070
I'm introverted.

314
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,350
The thing I did at Unity that was super effective in my brain at least,

315
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,950
was I started a question of the day channel.

316
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,430
It was in Slack because we were a superior company to Microsoft.

317
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,590
You can use Teams as well.

318
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,470
And I just made this public question of the day channel and every day I would

319
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,310
ask a question and the question could be something who is your favorite

320
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,550
manager ever, or it could be what's the weirdest food you've ever eaten?

321
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,070
Or what video games are you playing right now?

322
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,710
Or I like a huge video game.

323
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,910
Or I like a huge long list.

324
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,710
I just, it was easy to come up with them.

325
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,670
I asked a new one every day.

326
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,870
I invited my team to the channel to start, but by the time I left there

327
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,950
about four or 500 people in this channel with, you know, a hundred

328
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:39,550
people actively answering every day and people, a bunch of lurkers watching.

329
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,870
So what that created was the water cooler, the kitchen, the coffee machine.

330
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,590
So instead of it, it was async, which was nice.

331
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,310
It generated a way for people to learn about each other, which was nice.

332
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,150
And it didn't add to their schedule.

333
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,990
They could look at it.

334
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,790
And we had, again, where I'm across every time zone in this team.

335
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,270
I had everybody all the way from Singapore to Helsinki.

336
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,510
So it let people answer at a time that was convenient to them.

337
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,350
And then people would connect.

338
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,110
There'd be discussions.

339
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,470
Oh, Hey, I love that movie too.

340
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,630
And people would connect and get to know each other.

341
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,510
And then when they had to work together, it was a lot easier for them

342
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:20,310
to develop trust to work with each other because they already knew

343
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,590
a little bit about each other.

344
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,070
It, it like any community.

345
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,390
And you know, Brett, I did this because I'm a community builder.

346
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,070
Like any community, it took a lot of nurturing and prompting.

347
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,590
Like I would ask people on my team, Hey, go answer this question.

348
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:35,510
So we get a couple of answers in here and you have to really cultivate.

349
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,430
But it was self-sustaining when I left.

350
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,310
I don't know if it still exists today, but a year after I left that

351
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,470
question of the day channel still existed.

352
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,830
And it's a great way to get people talking.

353
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,590
Who asks, did you ever hand that off?

354
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,030
I did.

355
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,630
I actually looked for volunteers sometimes for vacations or whatever, but it took me

356
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:57,030
a grand total of six minutes a week to come up and ask, come up with and

357
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,070
ask the questions every day.

358
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,670
So I just did it.

359
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,150
I had a little reminder every morning to post a question.

360
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,830
I forgot maybe once or twice the whole time, but it was pretty easy to do.

361
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,510
It was part of my routine, but it was one way to get people to learn from

362
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,390
about each other, because you have to find with remote teams, you have to foster

363
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:17,470
ways for them to connect where they're not just talking about work.

364
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,350
And then leverage that to find ways for them to work together.

365
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,790
You can't let your remote employees just do a thing in a silo.

366
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,750
You got to get them working with each other.

367
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,310
I want you two to go work on this.

368
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,950
I want you to review this or whatever.

369
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,990
Again, part of the manager's job is to sort of guide people to

370
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,940
orchestrate the team, not just give them work, but orchestrate and say,

371
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,100
this will work better if you two work together on this or this thing

372
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,620
that you're doing, Frank, maybe Sally should do that.

373
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,540
So you can work on this thing that Greg is doing.

374
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,460
And you just have to do a lot more of that.

375
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:57,740
To me, it requires a lot more deliberate management in order to get this to work.

376
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,940
And I know you can do it.

377
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,640
And I just worry, what I worry about not talking to you because you'll try

378
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,960
all this stuff and you'll figure out what works, what really bugs me about

379
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,840
remote teams is that so many managers are just managing the work.

380
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,440
They're not managing the people.

381
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,400
And I think managing the people takes 10 times more effort on remote teams.

382
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,480
And we're going towards the end of tech here.

383
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,280
We are a bunch of folks are managed in a way where they have no career growth,

384
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,590
no, no friends at work.

385
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,870
Engagement will drop to the ground and they'll just go work

386
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:34,950
at Starbucks or whatever.

387
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,280
I don't think Starbucks is a bad place.

388
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,240
No, I don't think so either.

389
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,120
I just, I just, I just threw it out.

390
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,320
Sorry.

391
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:43,960
Yeah.

392
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,280
If I offended anyone from Starbucks, I'm very, very sorry.

393
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:53,940
Well, both of our animals are yelling at each other.

394
00:19:58,290 --> 00:19:58,610
Yeah.

395
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:01,690
They're both doing their own versions of whining.

396
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,210
You know, that's my soapbox on that.

397
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,050
It's not, there's no blueprint for this.

398
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:18,270
No, I don't know the, the, the thing that you just mentioned, uh, which I find

399
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,300
fascinating, right?

400
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:28,800
It's essentially now you can do the same thing, but instead of just allowing random

401
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,720
chance when everyone was working in the same building, you didn't have to do it

402
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,440
deliberately because random chance, right?

403
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,880
But there's no way for random chance to kick in.

404
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,400
So you have to create environments where that can happen.

405
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,840
Now, if you go back to where, um, we're good ideas come from the,

406
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,400
the Steven Johnson book, he talks about the fact that when coffee house has

407
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:55,480
became prevalent in the whatever center that was, sorry, my history, innovation

408
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,880
accelerated cause people got together and talked, uh, we need to create

409
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,520
virtual coffee houses environment.

410
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,240
People can just talk about things where ideas can, you know, ideas

411
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,120
come from other ideas.

412
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,480
You need to create as a manager, you got to create environments where people can

413
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,840
bounce ideas of each other in a safe way.

414
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,720
And then the good ideas can come out of that.

415
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,120
If you're not doing that, just those ideas, we stay there.

416
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,480
We're going to go back to the middle ages of tech.

417
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:26,630
Uh, and I think there's still very much a risk of that, unfortunately.

418
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,010
Right.

419
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:34,560
The, the, um, where movements are going in tech right now.

420
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,120
We'll see what happens, but, uh, we've, we have talked about this before drink.

421
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,100
Um, I think it is entirely possible.

422
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,780
Just like, like what caused us to start this podcast, right?

423
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,420
The, the, the collapse of the test discipline.

424
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:54,700
Right.

425
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,340
Um, and now the collapse of the dev discipline next up.

426
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,460
Well, I don't even like it's tech.

427
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,580
Like if, if dev goes, what do we need PM for?

428
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,980
Well, I want to tell you, I want to go back to our prediction

429
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,300
episode year before last.

430
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,980
So 16 months ago, when I said the key skill for the future is the

431
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,100
is going to be the ability to read and evaluate code.

432
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,300
And I think that is becoming more and more true as the engine start

433
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,460
generating more and more code for us, which is better and better.

434
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,020
In fact, you remember, and we've had both had interviews where we had

435
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,580
to write code at a whiteboard.

436
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,340
I think that's a stupid question now.

437
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:40,610
That question is absolutely idiotic now because AI Gen AI can create that for me.

438
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,650
I want, but Brent, but for you, would it be what's wrong with this

439
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,890
design or find the book?

440
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:46,970
I'm getting there.

441
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:47,650
I'm getting there.

442
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:55,500
What if I gave you a page of code virtually or remote and I asked you first question,

443
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,700
what does this code do?

444
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,920
And you should be, no matter how bad it's written, anybody has

445
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,800
to be able to figure that out.

446
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,600
So what problems, as long as it's not one of those lead code, no, you know what I

447
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:09,880
mean.

448
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,760
Yeah, I know.

449
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,800
I know what you mean.

450
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,000
You generate the right thing.

451
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,800
It's like, well, you don't ask somebody again.

452
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,480
It's the stupid of all the chess moves on a chess table wants to figure out the

453
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,160
ones where the night could visit the most squares in 14 moves, you know, blow me.

454
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,600
No, but give somebody some code that makes sense.

455
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,920
Make sure that you should, again, it could be different, different levels.

456
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,560
She built to explain what it does.

457
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,240
And you ask, uh, what problems could exist?

458
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,460
And again, Gen AI code may have problems, input, validation, et cetera, et cetera.

459
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,380
You can call those things out and you can say, how would you improve this code?

460
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,180
And one of the things, you know, in the accept accept accept world of AI generated

461
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:55,420
code, uh, I want people to take the code and then where it's confusing, it could be

462
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,300
a comment, it could be, I'm actually going to change the way this works.

463
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,460
And I think it'll work better like this, but you can like, I think the program or

464
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,180
the future can take that Gen AI code, understand what it does, even though they

465
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,980
just asked what it did, tweak it as needed, make it more readable, both for

466
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,780
humans and Gen AI, and then, then check in that code to solve customer problems.

467
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,220
But the ability to generate algorithms from scratch, who the hell cares about that anymore?

468
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,860
That's stupid.

469
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,340
That was so 1997.

470
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:34,470
Now, uh, I'm actually, um, this is something I have been thinking about.

471
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,810
And that is all right.

472
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,950
It's, it's interesting that we've moved to Gen AI and I, and I don't want

473
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,790
to go off topic because I've kind of.

474
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,280
No, I don't know how we got here, but we are here and, but let's just,

475
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,000
let's just, we'll go back.

476
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:52,720
Yeah.

477
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,900
The, um, small language models, right?

478
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,700
The, these are very context sensitive language models.

479
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,760
And so I'm, I'm thinking through, okay, if I had a new API, okay.

480
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,760
And the API that did all kinds of cool magic stuff, right?

481
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:22,080
How could I build a code generator through that?

482
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,790
And I'm like, big, there's lots of interesting things you could do with that.

483
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,550
Um, Oh my God.

484
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,830
I love that we have animal sounds in our podcast.

485
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,670
Yeah.

486
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,790
I'm going to get this chickens.

487
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,670
This one's annoying me and is about to get kicked up.

488
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,950
One moment.

489
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:41,630
Kicking.

490
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,840
Show me.

491
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,880
No, no, no.

492
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,360
And the cat is gone.

493
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,210
Testing the boundaries of Alan's no edit policy.

494
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,130
I know.

495
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,170
And what's going to happen with the cats, my cats use my daughter's cats.

496
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,890
I don't, I hate cats.

497
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:07,610
I don't want one on my own.

498
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,370
You used to kind of beat on the door with their paws to come back in.

499
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:11,410
So we'll see if that happens later.

500
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:14,930
She'll start howling and I'm just going to ignore her.

501
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:15,570
Okay.

502
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,330
Yeah.

503
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:17,210
Okay.

504
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,080
Are we done with that?

505
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,520
So I want to back up to, uh, the short answer is for your problem is as a

506
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,200
manager, as a leader, deliberate, you need to create, you need to work your

507
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,280
butt off to create as many opportunities for collaboration and for learning

508
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,080
about each other without adding more calendar, a more meeting time people's

509
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,600
calendars, because as you know, calendar time is the only thing that is totally

510
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,840
finite, uh, you can't create more of it and people are going to get more done.

511
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:52,240
If they're, if their meetings are, are minimal to get their work done, but you

512
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,960
have to create some opportunities and you can do some things like, um, again,

513
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,440
this puts meetings on the counters.

514
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,280
You can do things like a donut chat where you randomly pair people on your

515
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,680
team, just to talk to each other about stuff.

516
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,960
But I find three minutes at the beginning of a meeting, see how things are going.

517
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,080
Uh, and then if you ever get everyone together, you can go a little bit deeper

518
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,200
and find out a little bit more about where they're from, where they live,

519
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,640
et cetera, I just met with my directs in New York last week.

520
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,690
And we spent some time at the beginning, like, what was your family like?

521
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,570
Where'd you grow up?

522
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,010
Blah, blah, blah, just to get a little bit more information about each other,

523
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:25,530
to begin to build trust right out of Pat Lincione, but you need to generate

524
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,690
those opportunities, people learn from each other and then give them

525
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,130
collaboration opportunities, make them work together, make them hang

526
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,010
out virtually with each other.

527
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,010
There's of course, there's all kinds of games you can do online, but people

528
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:41,690
generally fade away from those because they just take more time.

529
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:45,410
They could be working or, or watching Netflix.

530
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,130
They could become competitive, right?

531
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:55,210
The right, what you want them to be doing is talking to each other.

532
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:56,570
Yes.

533
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,210
And then if you ever get them together, which you should, and actually

534
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,570
another way to accelerate that is same way as I took my team together

535
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:06,570
to New York last week is get us to hang out a little bit because that

536
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,690
accelerates everything out throughout the rest of the year.

537
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,970
We spend a couple of days together, getting to know each other, much

538
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,050
easier to work together, understand how to help each other throughout

539
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,010
the entire rest of the year.

540
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,170
So the other thing I would suggest is get your team together.

541
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,120
I'm not sure what travel budgets are like in this, this world, but

542
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,000
it can just find, but again, if most of your team is in Redmond, just

543
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,560
flying four people out and unfortunately they have to come to Redmond,

544
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,960
but you can just hang out for a couple of days, send them back.

545
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,320
It's relatively cheap.

546
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,720
Whatever that cost is, you know, $10,000, which is a lot of money.

547
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,120
I'm making up a random round number, but you will get that back in

548
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,960
productivity throughout the rest of the year, guarantee it.

549
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:52,990
Yeah, I'm not certain how I can sell that to the, you remember like safe limits?

550
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:53,950
I do.

551
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,310
I do.

552
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:59,150
But my argument is if you're going to have remote teams, you need to invest in travel.

553
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:04,470
Current job, I might've blown my entire travel budget for the year by doing

554
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,750
this little mini offsite, but it's worth it.

555
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:08,890
It's worth it.

556
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,570
So get the team together.

557
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,840
Okay.

558
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,440
All right, man.

559
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,800
I think that was like for me, the absolute, I mean, you

560
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,200
could have just, we could have just summed it up in five minutes.

561
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,560
It's like, you have to be deliberate.

562
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,520
I'm like, Oh, obviously.

563
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,080
And I can't help.

564
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,080
I can't give a short answer.

565
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,200
So I get the long answer instead.

566
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,000
Sure.

567
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,680
Makes sense.

568
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,360
Makes sense.

569
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:29,760
All right.

570
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,240
It's too much work to do a short answer.

571
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,440
I got another thing to talk about.

572
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,480
And nice.

573
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,880
This is something we will talk about again, the next podcast and the one after

574
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,540
that, and if there's one after that.

575
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,780
Okay.

576
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,110
So, and, and Brent gives me the okay, something we've talked about a little

577
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,950
bit before offline.

578
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,390
So, um, today's Friday.

579
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:58,470
I gave you this, I gave notice at my job on Monday that I am leaving.

580
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,250
And how did that go?

581
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,130
It went fine.

582
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,290
Um, again, it, and I can be transparent here.

583
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,130
Hasn't been the best fit for me.

584
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,340
They haven't really needed what I, they haven't needed my superpowers very much.

585
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,620
We've talked about this before.

586
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,900
Uh, it's been interesting.

587
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,580
I've learned a lot that people are great.

588
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,660
I've actually really liked it, but it's been hard for me to do what

589
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,700
I'm best at, but that's not why I'm leaving.

590
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:23,800
Not why I'm leaving.

591
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,160
Why are you leaving now?

592
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,840
Don't make it silly.

593
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:33,720
So, um, for ever since when I was a child, as you all know, I like to go on my long

594
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,800
hikes, I get therapy from the woods.

595
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:45,190
Uh, I have an opportunity, meaning I have a permit to, uh, hike the Pacific

596
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,670
Crest Trail and walk from Mexico to Canada.

597
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,870
So I am going to do that.

598
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:52,580
Okay.

599
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:59,180
I didn't realize, so listeners, I've been aware of this, um, for a while.

600
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,030
Um, but I didn't realize a permit was necessary.

601
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,990
Who did you get the permit from?

602
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,310
From the Pacific Coast Trail association.

603
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:11,980
Okay.

604
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,300
And that, that spans all countries.

605
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:15,780
Dude.

606
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,540
No, I'm in the, you know, California, Oregon and Washington.

607
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:26,740
Those are all, you said Mexico from the Mexican border to the Canadian border.

608
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,220
Okay.

609
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,500
I will stick my arm into Mexico and then walk north.

610
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:33,940
And then about four and a half months later, I will stick my arm into

611
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,500
Canada and then I will go home.

612
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:42,640
Well, that's when, yeah, I'm going to walk home more or less.

613
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,840
Um, the way it works is there's, there's no road at the border there at

614
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,600
the Canadian borders, you have to walk to the border.

615
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,040
There's a little monument there.

616
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,920
You kind of tag that, stick your arm into Canada.

617
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,640
There's no fence.

618
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,600
You can walk right in if you want, but, uh, and then you turn around and you

619
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,200
walk back 30 miles to, um, the closest road where you hope to hitchhike to a

620
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,680
small town where you can get a bus or another hitchhike to a larger town.

621
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,400
So you can get back home.

622
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,290
Oh, you know what?

623
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:11,130
That's, that's a, that's a problem for later, not a problem for now.

624
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,290
So something I want to do for a long time.

625
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,010
I've been mulling it over for a while.

626
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,450
I think it makes sense for me to take this break now.

627
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,250
So it means you're doing this by yourself.

628
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:20,930
Yeah.

629
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:24,690
I mean, there'll be a couple hundred other hikers doing the trail, several hundred,

630
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,450
but I'm not going with anyone.

631
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,010
And there's a reason for that is, uh, there's a thing they say in long distance

632
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,170
hiking is hike your own hike.

633
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,240
And some days I may want to go 10 miles, sit on a rock and

634
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,840
stare at the sunset for six hours.

635
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,380
Some days I may, you know what, I feel good.

636
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,420
I'm going to walk 30 miles.

637
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,640
I don't, you know, I like, I have hiked other people and I do

638
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,680
like it for a short term, but I really want to go at my own rate.

639
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,600
And not have to worry about someone else.

640
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,800
I just, so yeah, I'm going to walk.

641
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,480
Um, there'll be other people there I'll talk with, but, uh, yeah.

642
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,680
So what was I going to say?

643
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,000
Something I want to do for a long time.

644
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,920
Um, this is a good time for me to do it.

645
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,120
I do need a break from my job.

646
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,960
And so I'm going to take a four and a half month mental health break where

647
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
I just kind of walk every day.

648
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
I'll be professionally homeless.

649
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,120
I'll be living out of a tent every night.

650
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,920
Just that tent moves, uh, 15 to 20 or 25 miles down the trail every day.

651
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,200
So what I was saying was that means two things.

652
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,640
One is that, that what I just said, I'm homeless for five and a half

653
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,120
months while I'm paying mortgage here.

654
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:42,790
Um, and then I'll be back in mid-September, which means

655
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,720
you'll be back in mid-September.

656
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,720
I got to find a job in October.

657
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,200
Okay.

658
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,800
And I don't know what that is.

659
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,040
I'm of course open to coming back to NBC.

660
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,480
I may or may not.

661
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,960
I think it's, it depends on a lot of things I have.

662
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,640
I told a few close friends, right?

663
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,440
I wouldn't come work here.

664
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,200
I wouldn't make any, like I would not make any plans at all.

665
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:11,600
I'm not.

666
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,640
I wouldn't even think about thinking about making plans.

667
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,560
So I talked to him.

668
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,840
I believe the world's going to change.

669
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,480
Yes.

670
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,560
By the time I finished Donald Trump may have cut down all the

671
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,240
forests I'm walking through, but someone told me, it's like, yeah, I

672
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
worried about leaving a job in this economy.

673
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,600
I was talking to a friend of mine about this.

674
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,960
I said, dude, if you can walk 2,600 miles, you can find a job in this

675
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,140
economy and they're right.

676
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,120
And again, I don't need to look, I like being a VP.

677
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,040
I like being, you know, leading strategy for an organization.

678
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,440
I like executive coaching, which things I've done in this role in the past.

679
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,080
There's a lot of things I like about these, you know, senior

680
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:02,020
management, uh, software roles, but in America where healthcare is a

681
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,530
privilege and not a right, you know, I may do something totally

682
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:11,430
different, uh, if it has good health insurance, but we'll see.

683
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,270
And I'll figure that out in October.

684
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:19,160
I, I, it makes zero sense for me to think about it before them.

685
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,360
Now I could do all this.

686
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:24,040
I could break my leg on the third day and then, uh, everything continues

687
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,760
on and on and on.

688
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,880
Uh, I don't think that's going to happen.

689
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,880
Uh, but no, if you break, if I break my leg, I'm going to take some

690
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,160
fricking duct tape, wrap it around, real tight and keep going.

691
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,020
That'll make a good story.

692
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,420
I mean, what else are you going to do?

693
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,210
Like you have like the locator safety stuff.

694
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:45,810
Yeah.

695
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,090
Yeah.

696
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,370
So if you break your leg, they'll, they'll be able to find what,

697
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,090
what bears swallowed you.

698
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,570
This, this don't, the black bears don't need anything.

699
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,370
I have a little device that tracks where I am.

700
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,970
It's in satellite messages is great.

701
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,330
And you have like solar chargers.

702
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:05,080
No, I bring dude.

703
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,560
I just have a normal lightweight, like battery pack charger.

704
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,240
And then, um, you pass through towns every like three to seven days and

705
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,800
you recharge that and you're good to go.

706
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,200
I have something.

707
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,000
Let me, I hope it's relevant to our conversation.

708
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,160
So this is brand new.

709
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,360
So I haven't let my team, by the time this podcast comes out, folks at work will

710
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,560
know enough people know that it's not that big of a deal and nothing's going to

711
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,400
change, but, uh, I thought I'd just throw it out there for the listeners.

712
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,480
Cause we're, what that means for the podcast.

713
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,640
A third thing it means is that we're going to take a break from the

714
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,440
podcast for a while while I'm doing my thing and we will not do the podcast.

715
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,720
While I'm gone, I have the podcast recording equipment and the ability to

716
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,160
upload.

717
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,480
So Brent's not going to do it without me.

718
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,800
Uh, one of these, not the next one, maybe the one after that and possibly

719
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,040
the one after that will be the last AB testing podcast for a while.

720
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:58,420
All right.

721
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,820
What are you showing me, Brent, for our podcast audience?

722
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:01,980
Okay.

723
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,280
First off, actually, let me hold on.

724
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,120
Oh God.

725
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,880
Here he goes again.

726
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,000
He's going to go get the cat.

727
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:16,150
And this is great podcast material where Brent grabs stuff to show.

728
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,830
I'm sure.

729
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,230
Yeah.

730
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,630
Yay.

731
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,110
Podcast material.

732
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:22,030
I'll describe until now.

733
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,870
Uh, so I've had this for years.

734
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:24,670
Okay.

735
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,160
Goal zero by Sherpa.

736
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:28,530
Okay.

737
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:35,030
It's a, it's a battery pack comes with attachments like this one.

738
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,790
Okay.

739
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:36,870
A light.

740
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:38,210
Okay.

741
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:42,090
But the cool thing about it is this.

742
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh, solar.

743
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,200
That's solar dude.

744
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,840
That stuff is so heavy.

745
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,390
I'm not, I mean, you were going to say something like that, but you, you

746
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,750
pinned this onto the back of your, your, I assume you're going to have a

747
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,670
how much is that way?

748
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,720
Uh, it weighs at least a pound.

749
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,240
At least too much.

750
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,840
Do you know how, guess how much do my pack plus my tent sleeping bag, first aid

751
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,120
kit, um, everything, guess how much my pack weighs without food or water on it?

752
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,600
Like fully loaded.

753
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,970
Uh, you have a sleeping bag.

754
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:20,490
Yeah.

755
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,050
Do you have a sleeping pad?

756
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:29,010
I have a sleeping bag, a pad, a tent, uh, a puffy jacket, uh, uh, um, fleece

757
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:35,850
hoodie, uh, some long underwear to sleep in first aid, electronics, including,

758
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,210
you know, a couple of these, these battery chargers, um, phone.

759
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,050
I'm going to go with seven.

760
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:44,920
Okay.

761
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,960
No more than that, but 11.

762
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,100
Okay.

763
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,620
It's not very heavy.

764
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,980
A pound is huge at that level.

765
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,840
I don't want to carry an extra pound for charging.

766
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,080
So not going to happen, but I'm keeping it pretty light.

767
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,240
Um, but that's not much.

768
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,320
If you pick up like a 10 pound weight, you know, that's pretty much.

769
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,600
Well, we'll talk.

770
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,040
Well, and then it's the weight of the pack as well.

771
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,040
You're bringing like baby powder or petroleum jelly.

772
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,680
For what?

773
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Uh, the chafing you're going to have.

774
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,560
Let it bleed.

775
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,280
Let it bleed.

776
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,040
It'll, it'll scab up.

777
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,440
You'll be fine.

778
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Callous baby.

779
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,920
Callous.

780
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,160
Yeah.

781
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:28,520
The last, last week Alan went twice as slow because he had to walk bowlegged.

782
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,640
I've done enough hundred mile hikes that I feel pretty confident about.

783
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,640
That it's just doing 26 of those back to back.

784
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,440
Oh yeah.

785
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,080
And well, if you put it that way, it's yeah, it's nothing.

786
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:39,640
Yes.

787
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:39,920
Sure.

788
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,360
Nothing.

789
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,000
Absolutely nothing.

790
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,240
So, um, yeah, so, uh, for our next few podcasts, if you're on our Slack

791
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:51,720
group, um, at what you can go to modern testing.org and join that Slack group.

792
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,960
Uh, happy to take questions about the hike.

793
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,360
Happy to take questions about the break.

794
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,600
Happy to take questions about, uh, what's next in October.

795
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,720
I won't know those answers and I will probably.

796
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:05,430
A couple folks have asked how I'm going to document this.

797
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:10,590
So, uh, I already made a Google sheet because I can have an offline one and

798
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,390
Excel is kind of a big fat pig.

799
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:17,710
Uh, I'm going to keep pretty good data on my mileage elevation, a lot of things.

800
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,990
So they can, so I can geek out on the data when I get back.

801
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,820
Um, I'm thinking, but that's not what the people want, Alan.

802
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,700
What do they want?

803
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,140
They want to be able to, to, to track your progress.

804
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:31,420
Yeah.

805
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,340
So I think I may do like, like some people do like 15 to 20 minute videos

806
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,420
for every day of the hike.

807
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,820
And those people are far more ambitious than I am.

808
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,580
I'm thinking like one YouTube short for every day of the hike.

809
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,260
Uh, sure.

810
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,080
Or I don't know.

811
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,280
I would be interested in you doing like a location share in

812
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,360
some sort of public thing.

813
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,720
You know what?

814
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,040
I can do that because I have four of my little, uh, satellite tracking

815
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,080
device I showed you, you can see where I am at any point and I can share that link

816
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,760
out to, and I'll share that in our slack groups.

817
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,000
If our slack group, you can go there.

818
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,760
You will know where I am at any point.

819
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,680
You can watch me trickle north.

820
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,900
That would be fun.

821
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:13,780
Yeah.

822
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,720
We can do that.

823
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,880
Cause I don't think I'm the kind of person who would try and stalk or anything.

824
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,920
Like, um, so like if you knew exactly where I was, you can come find me,

825
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,040
which is weird, but I don't think our listeners are those people.

826
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
So I'm good.

827
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,680
Please don't come stalk me and track me now without warning me.

828
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,280
Cause that'd be weird.

829
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,760
But yeah, you can watch me trickle.

830
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,050
Yeah.

831
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,530
I don't know how they warn you.

832
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,020
So I guess that means like, please don't come stock out.

833
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:42,860
Yeah.

834
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,300
I'm going to go code of honor here.

835
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,340
Please don't come stalk me.

836
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,540
Yeah.

837
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:47,180
There you go.

838
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,460
Okay.

839
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:48,980
All right.

840
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:53,180
So I think that's probably a good place to hang it up for the day because I

841
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,540
don't have any other topics to talk about.

842
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,820
No, me neither.

843
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:56,820
Okay.

844
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,820
Once again, this is episode four 17 of the E B testing podcast.

845
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,780
It is two 17.

846
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,420
Oh, did I say four 17?

847
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,180
You did.

848
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,620
Well today's, let's say it's pie day.

849
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:09,950
It is Friday.
