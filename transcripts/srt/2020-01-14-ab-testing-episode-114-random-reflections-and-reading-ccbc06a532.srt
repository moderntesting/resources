00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:13,460
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,580
Leadership agile and anything else that comes to mind now on with the show

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,130
All right, that was we might leave that in the podcast. I feel good

4
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,850
Happy new year Brent. Happy new year. It is what year is it?

5
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:38,130
2020 Alan I'm gonna reach across the table

6
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,140
And I will kill you until you're dead

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,370
Hey public service announcement PSA. I don't know if you have

8
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,930
Seen this it's all over everything but in in the year

9
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,290
2020 yes, if you are dating anything official

10
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,520
It is advised

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,070
For you to

12
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,550
Spell out the entire year

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,100
Okay, you have not heard this

14
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,860
No

15
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,820
But I always spell out the whole year because I know people are dumb and we'll get confused or computers are dumb again

16
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,060
And the reason why please tell me why is because it is 2020. Yes, it if you just write 20

17
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,820
someone can play

18
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,820
18 18 or

19
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,060
49 or

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,460
Which could have

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,500
Depending on what you're dating could have negative consequences

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:45,800
To the date or date or date or the guy writing so is this only on dating apps?

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,480
like or everywhere like

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,080
like like plenty of fish

25
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,490
Tinder tinder, that's the one I was trying to load

26
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:02,730
No, so the the feedback is was was specifically first on checks or or contracts

27
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:10,050
You're who writes checks chronologically. I'm older than you but come on. It's 2020 stop writing checks. I

28
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,120
Wasn't my feedback. That's how I'm passing it on. I am the middleman

29
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,610
Yeah, anyway public service announcement for 2020 that don't write just 20

30
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,570
Okay, great. This is an educational podcast. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night

31
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:30,330
so either I'm going to have some wonderful rants or

32
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,250
I'm gonna have to edit everything I say because it will not make any sense

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,570
Let me see our first

34
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,770
Who was your how was your holiday who was your holiday my holiday was Brad Pitt how was your holiday?

35
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,010
We'll see my holiday was

36
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Honestly fantastic it

37
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,280
The only problem with it. It was probably

38
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,720
three four months too short the

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,800
But my son from college came to visit. I learned a fantastic strategy

40
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,580
He's now

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,140
21 so it was kind of cool to be sitting

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,380
drinking with your oldest kid

43
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,150
but a new strategy was

44
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,670
When he came here, he didn't have an available car. So he had to hang out with his poor parents and

45
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,350
turns out

46
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,610
We did a lot of things that we as a family hadn't done in a long time

47
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,750
We had one day where we just went through our game closet and went board game after board game after board game

48
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,430
That sounds fun. It was fun. I

49
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,750
my

50
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,740
Family is now firmly

51
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,180
Readdicted to Katan. Oh we played that's the one game we played over break over the was it. We put Katan. Yeah, I

52
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,270
Won. Okay, that's it. I'm a winner

53
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,880
and the sea

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:08,640
So I now am out of single-digit children my daughter her birthday's on New Year's Eve

55
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
so she turned 10 and

56
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,760
I now have only one

57
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,920
minor aged

58
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,880
children

59
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,760
My my middle son turned 18 last night. God. Oh God God

60
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
Help us all. Yes

61
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,500
You I didn't I didn't do much it I just kind of hung out which was great

62
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,260
It was great to sleep in and not have meetings with Europe

63
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,060
I like my meetings with Europe, but it was good to take a break for a little bit

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,100
I have a whole crap ton of travel coming up. I'm leaving end of the month like

65
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,880
The week of delivery comp. Sorry Lisa. Sorry Abby. I'll be in

66
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,620
London for

67
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,460
Nine days I come back for like three days and I go to California for a week

68
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,740
And then I come back for a week or two and then I go skiing and whistler vacation

69
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,740
And then I come back for a couple weeks and then I go to Helsinki for a week

70
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,180
And then I come back and I try and keep it all together

71
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,180
Yeah, I may need to apologize to Lisa as well

72
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,140
I have to look at what the schedule is for that delivery comp because I think it's aligned with the three-day weekend

73
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,580
It is you. Oh does Microsoft get that day off? Yeah, okay

74
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,500
Yeah

75
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,520
One thing one difference in unity as I couldn't go whole podcast not talking about it a lot more like regular days off

76
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,660
But I can't imagine I have to look because I can't imagine that they scheduled the whole conference

77
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,020
Overlapping with that weekend. I think it's during the week. No, it's during the week. It's Monday Tuesday

78
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,820
When's I think it's I can't remember now. Okay

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,050
anyway, I'm not yet prepared to apologize to Lisa but

80
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,420
Definitely won't be available that Monday. All right, shall we try doing a podcast? No

81
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,380
113 you know at some point in time we should just give up. Yeah, remember you've only done 112. Oh

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,200
That's true

83
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:12,520
So maybe if I get to the next one, okay, you have proposed a topic that is very interesting

84
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,480
Can you please kick it off and let me know how I can help you?

85
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Be successful in sharing this topic and your wonderful insights with our listeners

86
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Yeah, you can start by

87
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,220
Lowering the expectation bar a great deal

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
So I

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:38,380
Discovered something last week you did and I

90
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:48,470
Found it surprising and I have this could go anywhere from here. Hold on to your seats folks

91
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,590
Yeah, let me

92
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,350
Before I announce what is in your my hands

93
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,660
Again, this could go anywhere from here

94
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,880
Let me let me read a conclusion paragraph

95
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,790
Very

96
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,830
Quickly, this is a large paper written by

97
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:18,000
someone that I think every one of our listeners knows at least by name

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
conclusions

99
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:27,240
Many members of the testing communities current vision of testing looks a lot like what I learned in school in the

100
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,200
1970s

101
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,720
For example, take a look at the ISE B practitioner syllabus

102
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,630
British community

103
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,060
Yeah citation the 1960s and 1970s were a different time

104
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,050
Programming was linear programs were shorter much shorter. Yeah, they were

105
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,520
1970s

106
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,340
But I remember when the time makes Sinclair with a total of 8k of memory came out

107
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:05,100
Development was often done by outside companies and even if programming was done in-house testing if it was done with any formality

108
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,720
Was often formed out ideas that worked well for that context don't necessarily stretch well to other contexts

109
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,900
Amen bros

110
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:22,720
Professional software development has become much more varied XP and test driven development offer a different vision of the relationship

111
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,180
between testers and programmers

112
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,460
Even more traditional projects demand better user interfaces better usability not just pretty screens

113
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,140
with better quarter in better quarter it

114
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:42,100
Coordination among the staff the larger programs make prioritization

115
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:52,200
Automation more even more urgent and component based development which allows programmers to sew together large products much more quickly

116
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,820
puts it this

117
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,120
proportionate burden on testing with the parrot

118
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:05,340
Dime demand her dramatic. Thank you changes in development. We need shifts in testing as well

119
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,420
This paper doesn't spell out all the important shifts, but it does open

120
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,340
Many of the established ideas up for consideration

121
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,740
The tone of this paper has been sharply critical of the traditional ideas

122
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,950
Please understand that I'm writing sharply to make a point

123
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,670
Most of these ideas apply perfectly well in some contexts

124
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,950
What I'm doing here is challenging you to think about the the context you are in

125
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:41,630
Set aside pre-existing assumptions and think through what craft and culture of testing will actually work best where you are

126
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,630
or

127
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,630
Where you want to become?

128
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,550
now

129
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,670
Alan knows who wrote this

130
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,660
Have you seen this before I?

131
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:00,100
Well, I mean not before last week, okay, I'll tell you what I think I remember when this paper was published

132
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:08,100
But based on the author and my experience both reading and interacting with the author of this I dismissed it without reading it

133
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,930
knowing the author and hearing the conclusions

134
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,410
Your thoughts initial thought well, I've your emotional. I've changed my opinion

135
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,330
I have such a sour experience with this person that

136
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:28,600
That it was hard to read and get past it, but but now that I've skimmed it and you've read

137
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,280
The conclusion to me. I do need to try and change my opinions

138
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,320
I'm not even sure what this person is doing today. I haven't heard from them in years

139
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:43,080
But this paper is paper is to be clear is from what year right 2004

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
2004

141
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,720
16 years ago

142
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,200
Dispose a lot of myths definitely saw things like modern testing on the horizon

143
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,960
Definitely was able to see XP for what it was

144
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,760
For how it is an agile techniques agile approaches for how they can improve software quality

145
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,360
whereas some contemporary peers of this author have

146
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
made fun of and

147
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,760
Dismissed a lot of things from agile

148
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,200
I think I this is a paraphrase but I've even heard one of his peers

149
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,320
I'll give you the name in a minute

150
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,240
So don't give this away like the surprise of course our three listeners already have read they gave us the paper

151
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,960
So they've heard it. So this is all BS. No, I found the paper. Oh you didn't yeah

152
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,800
I'm the one who posted on select. Okay. Well, they've all they've all read it now

153
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,700
So this is all I can't remember the comment now something like like agile hates testing or something stupid like that

154
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Anyway, my opinion has changed

155
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,300
Good paper interesting

156
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,940
It's hard for me as I read it and skim through it while you're talking

157
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,180
to imagine this author writing this paper, so

158
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,780
Do you want to give it away? Do you have more stuff?

159
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,820
What were your reactions when you read it before you talk about the author more succinctly? I was

160
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
pleasantly shocked

161
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:10,440
And on two fronts number one so my interaction with this with with this author

162
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,830
Has always been indirect right you and I are both

163
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,800
good friends with a

164
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,720
person who used to be a direct co-worker and

165
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,730
This guy's first book and I've talked about it on the podcast

166
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,720
I

167
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,040
Back when I was a traditional test test manager, I

168
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,360
Bought hordes of these books. See there's the difference between you and I even when I first read this book probably in

169
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:54,160
1999 I thought it was dated and and didn't make and was irrelevant then so I first read the book

170
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,680
95 96, okay, and I was

171
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,080
First moved into test management

172
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,110
798

173
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:12,340
You didn't hear the punchline. No the way I use this book is with new hires. I gave them two weeks

174
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,050
to read the book and

175
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,450
because

176
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,610
Testing still wasn't taught in school still really not today

177
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,530
And I what I wanted to do as we all agree testing is a

178
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,410
Critical thinking process. So what I wanted them to do is I wanted to first read the book and in two weeks

179
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,570
our 101

180
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:41,090
They're going to walk me through know what they picked up from it. Okay, and

181
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:49,100
When they did that I would give them a new assignment and I would say great now what I want you to do is

182
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,300
Read the book again

183
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,540
They would look at me like are you an ass?

184
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:02,690
Read the book again, and I want you to come back and tell me every place this book is wrong. So I used

185
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,320
testing computer software by Kim Caner to test

186
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,910
the book testing computer software

187
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,190
by Kim Caner

188
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:20,230
Because that book came out in 88 it did so in the 16 years

189
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,750
Since writing that book he even went back and the original edition of the book said

190
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,830
Purpose of testing is to find bugs who back and changed that in a later edition

191
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,270
No

192
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,970
He said even worse a test that does not find a bug is a waste of time literal

193
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,190
Edition he did change in later. She did change that but this is

194
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:46,230
He rebuts most of the points in the book in this paper

195
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,440
Uh, yeah, he calls out a lot of statements that he made that have been made about testing as

196
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,590
myths

197
00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:03,430
He's got a long list of things that we've been still talking about like you and I have said over and over again

198
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,750
Modern testing is not very much about

199
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,630
Testing and is most definitely not modern

200
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:15,270
Right. This paper was written in 2004 and I see even before we were talking about modern testing even before we

201
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,190
Even before we had a part before we met time. Yeah

202
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,320
Like I didn't know there was a person named Alan Page in 2004

203
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,080
Right how your life has changed since then yes, I find this paper

204
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,840
Fascinating that he even has so I'm thinking we go through I

205
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,320
Just want to just comment further on this one of the the three

206
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,340
Were I may had made a comment around. Oh my god. I see a ton of

207
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,380
Modern testing stuff in here. All right is the primary reason of testifying bugs

208
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,880
No

209
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,360
Right, but then he lists out is it define

210
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,040
defects or maximize bug count or block

211
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,880
Premature product releases help managers ship. This is listed in the paper as things

212
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,710
that

213
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,750
Are typical reasons

214
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:24,290
but not primary

215
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:33,070
Maximize technical or minimize technical support costs the next section is something you want to say there

216
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,550
No

217
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,590
Make it make a point man. I'm trying to I know is the main reason

218
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,310
To test to prove the program works correctly

219
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,280
No, right. I find this paper

220
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,830
shocking as I mentioned because it's

221
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,080
Because of where it came from in how old it is

222
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,300
It is very interesting. So I'm gonna I'll give a few comments

223
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,300
But I think it's probably worthwhile to share my chem keener interaction story. Okay

224
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
Because despite the fact I like this paper

225
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,740
The way he read we had a we had an email interchange once and it was very interesting

226
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,260
This was probably around the time this paper was

227
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,020
Actually probably exactly around the time this paper was written. So it makes it interesting. It was the time when all

228
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,480
Bach talked about James Bach was

229
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,560
Exploratory testing and how is this special thing if you could do exploratory testing you were a special person

230
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,440
Which is actually called out in this paper says it's not just something experts can do. It's critical thinking

231
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
I forget the exact words. Yes, you're used

232
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,680
Anyway, it was it was

233
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,160
Bach was going off all the time about how special it was

234
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,120
so I wrote a blog post something about testing and

235
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,840
I said something to the effect of this could be the exact quote and our teams do exploratory testing and then in parentheses

236
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,160
As I do can I even use that term that way anymore?

237
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,540
Can I even use that term anymore without crediting people or something like that?

238
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,780
Just some just you know a little a little passive-aggressive blurb not

239
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,740
Shouldn't really cause offense

240
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,200
Kim caner emailed me and

241
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,700
Said I don't know. I don't know you or what I've ever done to anger you mr. Weasel

242
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,020
but I find this completely disrespectful and

243
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,180
Blah blah blah and just kind of went off on me and I I swear to God

244
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:41,040
It was the only phrase was am I allowed to use that word that phrase and he was pissed off

245
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,440
No end, but I think I understand why

246
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,190
this was

247
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:50,190
when did

248
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,650
Whitaker's tours book come out much later was it later? Yes

249
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,530
Are you sure positive because he and I talked about that book on the soccer field we used to

250
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,100
Place kick the ball around once a week for about an hour and just kind of BS. Okay for it and that

251
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,360
was in

252
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,360
God, you know what as I look back

253
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,320
No, it was later. It wasn't I was in I was

254
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,310
The director in engineering excellence, which I didn't start till 2007

255
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,580
So I think Whitaker's tours book came out in 2008 or 2009, right?

256
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,760
But you remember the name of that book exploratory testing? Yes

257
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,160
But it wasn't out yet. It wasn't even vinegar hadn't even thought of it yet

258
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:39,200
Yeah, so the thing I know from talking with Whitaker at that point in time. Oh

259
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,510
Oh

260
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:48,950
Did he piss off a whole bunch of people? I know he's publishing it under that title. He did that book just to piss off people

261
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:55,350
That was his thing. So anyway, can't it would so it was such an overreaction and

262
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:01,830
Then later to have our good friend James tell us all kinds of stories about cam

263
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,390
It soured my view of him

264
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:11,470
But this probably came out and I don't know if I saw when it came out, but it was definitely after

265
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,710
his

266
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,950
odd

267
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:23,230
Email rant to me. I might have that email somewhere. But so if you if you and I were

268
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,660
far more

269
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:33,900
Sensitive, I guess that's the best word I can think of if you and I were far more sensitive. I'm very sensitive and

270
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,730
someone

271
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,730
released a set of

272
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,380
Waterfall traditional testing principles under the name of modern testing

273
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:54,350
We would probably get pissed to you know what though the good the good news is we wouldn't have to because our community

274
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,350
Would go to bat for us because they're awesome

275
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,480
right, right, but if

276
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,440
If we didn't do something then the community may lose

277
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,800
Confidence right we had to lead by example on some of the I don't know. Honestly, I don't think I would

278
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,480
Chalk it. I mean I'm talking up is stupid. I think the thing is is that we're not

279
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
sensitive

280
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:26,930
And I obviously haven't spent enough time inside of your head but in my own

281
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,640
Right. I think a

282
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,860
better idea than modern testing should win

283
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:41,600
Yes, my whole goal is to continue and push forward

284
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
objective

285
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,280
Communication on the topic. I don't care if people disagree

286
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,970
Not not there's a lot of people particularly in a Twitter verse

287
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:00,690
That are very interested in amping the drama level on modern testing

288
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:07,930
To 13 and you're like we wanted to be one must win. This is sort of a Highlander and I'm like, yeah

289
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,630
You know what? There was somebody you probably remember this there was somebody this is

290
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:21,830
Six months ago, maybe longer. Yep someone like tagged Bach it said I'd love to hear your thoughts on the modern testing principles

291
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,670
yeah, and

292
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,090
and of course, I just replied and said to all including James because James and I have a

293
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,790
Is much as we disagree we have sort of a Twitter truce. Yeah, I was gonna say it's a it's an unwritten truce

294
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,690
We have we have sort of a truce going on. Someone just wanted anyway

295
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,670
I replied and said they're not that modern than on about testing, but you're welcome to take a look

296
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,690
I'm still pissed off about the automation paper. Anyway, go on

297
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,650
Yeah, that's one where you were misquoted if I recall correctly. Well, I was misattributed

298
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,350
Yeah

299
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,540
What we see in this paper are a lot of statements around what testers

300
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,690
maybe traditionally were thought of doing and then

301
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:08,210
Underneath that paragraphs and paragraphs talking about how this really isn't true

302
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,290
Anymore especially or how it really isn't true. Well, so not entirely but you can see

303
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,850
You can see the formation

304
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,950
of

305
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,070
even from from someone who I would say

306
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,910
I would honestly say was a contributor to

307
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:34,110
Maybe not the Bible but several chapters of the Bible of traditional testing. So for example here

308
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,230
under a section called testers and programmers have

309
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,550
conflicting interests blah blah blah blah blah words then he says

310
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,390
over the longer term

311
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:53,020
A better approach is often to refuse to play a test group can stick to and publicize its role as the

312
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,140
as the

313
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,820
as the

314
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,980
technical information provider

315
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,300
Right something

316
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:07,180
Well, we're back to that information testing is information provider, which I don't write but this is dated 2004

317
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,620
I get it. I get it, right?

318
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,940
I don't know where he would be on that topic today and it's something that obviously you and I don't agree with

319
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:19,610
Should test group work independently of the programmers

320
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,000
No

321
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,220
How many it's interesting because in this section

322
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:35,300
The way I would interpret the first part of it is he's like maybe but then he closes the whole thing

323
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,220
Being heavily supportive of TDD I

324
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,860
Saw I'm gonna tangent off here because

325
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,480
We could look at how little

326
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,230
The test world has progressed since then in some ways

327
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:56,590
And we've talked about at least I've talked about looking at where testing is on a cost of innovation curve

328
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,930
There are probably things more modern than modern testing out there in the early adopters

329
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:05,030
Modern testing is some more out towards the front end of that

330
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,950
there's still people doing the old Microsoft thing of lots of s debts testing the crap out of the code and

331
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:15,150
There are still people who the independent test team doesn't connect to devs

332
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:20,310
they write bug reports against requirements and there's a whole bunch of the industry back there and

333
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,430
There are people trying to cross the chasm but doing it in odd ways

334
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,150
I saw a Twitter conversation. I think it was Twitter around

335
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,590
Should testers learn TDD and there are a lot of people are going absolutely

336
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,110
it's the best way for testers to write unit tests and

337
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:44,830
What what why why are the testers writing unit tests? So tangent reversal to come back to the paper

338
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,580
what I like and

339
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,500
What sets cam apart from his peers is he's non dismissive of new approaches

340
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,980
of software development

341
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,900
What I like is he's Lee looked at XP and looked at some things from agile and said, you know applied

342
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,260
Proper critical thinking and figured out how those could benefit testing and software quality, which is fantastic

343
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,340
Whereas some of his contemporaries

344
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,010
Have dismissed those things

345
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:20,850
So I give him full props for that for actually learning and growing and not digging his heels in on

346
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,010
the things that are

347
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,930
more relevant to him and I wonder if

348
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:34,280
You know, this was maybe some of the basis of the I can't remember when the bok and caner fallout happened

349
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,920
But it might have been around here. I don't know it doesn't matter. I could have been for completely different reasons

350
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,350
Go on what other things would like to highlight from this paper

351
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,140
I'm gonna need now remember to put a link to this paper

352
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,380
Damn show notes and I will most likely forget

353
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:00,980
Luckily, it's already in the selection or you can use your favorite search engine to look for it. What's it called?

354
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:08,540
Now the best way to do it the ongoing revolution in software testing. There we go. No link needed. I

355
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,100
Think there's a lot of interesting quotes in here. For example, the one I just highlighted

356
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:24,020
Remarkably many testers still push the traditional waterfall method. I don't understand why

357
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,420
Right they in a big part of this to me

358
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,420
Just quite honestly

359
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,460
Number one. I do not understand

360
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:41,780
how this paper has escaped my notice until literally just a few weeks ago and

361
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,380
Although when this paper came out

362
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,100
2004

363
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:59,090
No, I think I was in Bing by that time. Yeah, I'm trying to judge which when this paper came out

364
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:06,340
Which side of the the agile fence I was on I was no that was early. I was still in Windows CE

365
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,980
I joined

366
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,980
engineering excellence in 2005 no, yes

367
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:17,420
2005 I did a little 10-year recap at the end of the year blog post and I realized that 10 years ago

368
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,420
I was still in engineering excellence

369
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Holy crap times have changed

370
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,720
Don't want to go back to your statement because it reminds me

371
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,920
I'm gonna reiterate a rant that I've done before on this podcast is I

372
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,640
Don't understand there are testers that not only they may not say they embrace waterfall

373
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,300
But they love being isolated from development

374
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:47,940
They sit and they write their freakin selenium tests all day long and they feel like that's doing a good thing for the product

375
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,800
Holy crap, that's wrong. Anyway, go on. Here's another section. I enjoy

376
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,790
It's somewhat relevant

377
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:05,290
James Buck and I have been working with exploratory testing throughout our careers. I coined the phrase in 1984

378
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,770
published it in

379
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:15,450
His book with a strong recommendation that testers should run exploratory tests in every cycle of testing since then

380
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,650
I've come to realize that in practice

381
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,770
Good tests explore all the or good testers explore all of the time

382
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,930
more more more more more words

383
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:34,710
Be willing to change what you do to follow up what you're seeing as a test is the mark of a thoughtful

384
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:40,120
Tester and the thing I think is the most important

385
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,800
thing and I think this paper shows that cam was was

386
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
living by that mantra is

387
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:55,970
You have to be willing to learn have to be willing to a be thoughtful and evaluate the best way to go

388
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:02,650
to be from a and show a willingness to change and I think that's a

389
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,370
Also an underlying I don't want to take this and blow it up too big

390
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,650
But I think it's an important theme even in modern testing

391
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,490
the the whole point of of this is

392
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,170
is

393
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,490
times

394
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,730
change

395
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:25,330
value propositions change skill sets get automated hell I

396
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,530
Don't know if I've yet set it on the podcast

397
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:33,010
But I've already at a point where I truly believe

398
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:37,050
that we're at the beginning of the end of the of

399
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:41,910
the the the fad portion of data science

400
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:46,790
Where we get a big large book of people coming in

401
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,590
And everyone's trying to ramp up

402
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,900
my son

403
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,420
just finished an initial part of

404
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,620
Going through and applying to schools and he's keenly interested in

405
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,940
Pursuing data science. Can you guess why?

406
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:09,760
well

407
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,360
Probably not because his dad does data science, but there are lots of jobs for data scientists

408
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:21,220
No, it's actually you had that a hundred percent backwards. Oh

409
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:28,580
100% he wants to do what dad does because dad looks fun what he wants what he wants to do

410
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,740
It's even less thoughtless than that. It's what he wants is

411
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,260
To maintain his center to living and he knows

412
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,980
That if he gets a job with the same title as dad

413
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,580
He doesn't even know what the damn job is. Okay. Oh, yes. No dad makes coin

414
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:51,470
Yeah, maybe he knows where we're an upper middle-class family and

415
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:58,170
He he knows that that amount of money is enough to he's also very

416
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,550
analytically aligned

417
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:06,590
So he's very he's a very matic hit but I sat down with him. I'm like, you know what? I don't think you should do that

418
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,880
I think actually

419
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,400
computer science is a much better way to go and

420
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,080
and

421
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:22,080
Look for a school that will offer a minimum of a minor or at least a computer science curriculum is a data science one

422
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,160
Yesterday I had a mentee

423
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,680
Another mentee one of my employees

424
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,860
He came in

425
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,660
He has his PhD in operations research

426
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,300
and one of the

427
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,940
Things he brought up. He's only been here five months and he's

428
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,460
He realized that in this environment

429
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:52,460
He's not as autonomous as he'd like and that's because he doesn't have the coding background and he said hey as a PhD

430
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,540
I've already looked up at UW and I realize

431
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,500
I could get in

432
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,490
for a

433
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:03,810
Master's program in

434
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:09,450
Computer science with very little friction. He's already got his PhD. They're not gonna ask him for GMAT or GRE

435
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:12,510
or any of that crap and

436
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:18,950
He and I looked at the curriculum in the master's program at UW

437
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,260
I would say a good 40% are

438
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,500
Not only data science classes

439
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,240
but

440
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,680
specific ones

441
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,030
All right. They have a whole course on NLP

442
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:43,340
Which is not something you would tradition are do it traditionally see from a computer science course. No, that's interesting. Yeah

443
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,320
So I think actually the next set of developers

444
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,980
Coming out of college five years from now

445
00:33:55,020 --> 00:34:01,580
They're gonna be the dominant workforce good and they're gonna be excellent at modern testing principle number five six

446
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,420
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Hey, so there's one point

447
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,660
And just to show how this is

448
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:11,540
2004 just to show how relevant this is there's a section on

449
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,180
The statement is we can measure the individual effectiveness

450
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,500
Effectiveness of testers by counting how many bugs they enter which is interesting because he

451
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:27,500
He gives a example. We've probably given on this podcast before there's two testers one finds a hundred bugs one finds ten bugs

452
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,420
Which one is better? It says whoa, whoa slow down there

453
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,740
What if the person that finds ten bugs is working with developers to?

454
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:38,820
Make sure they're writing more testable code and finding and things as to get reported

455
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:45,540
Which is a statement we've made for probably since the second episode of this podcast. What's interesting is here we are

456
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,620
16 years later and

457
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,460
Ministry of tests had a post two weeks ago where they asked how do you measure?

458
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,380
How do you measure how well your test teams doing and someone I thought it was a troll but they were serious

459
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,160
Or maybe they were a really good troll. I can't remember now

460
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,600
Said well if I have two testers, I it should be like sales

461
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,160
I keep the one that finds the most bugs and show the other one the door and

462
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,640
luckily there were

463
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,330
there were and

464
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,330
way more people

465
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:24,250
Disagreeing with this person in this conversation then we're going. Yeah, that's the way it should be so we're kind of past that but

466
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,260
It's weird that those things come up and I bet

467
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,380
I

468
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,860
Bet there are teams where bug counts are bug quotas are the thing

469
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:40,260
I had a bug quota when I started at Microsoft 1995. I've told this story before I was expected to find ten bugs a week and

470
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:47,270
What I would do then the behavior that drove was I found I found always like 14 every week

471
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,810
Because I like to overachieve a little but some weeks I'd find 20

472
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:56,230
But I keep those extra six in my back pocket for the next week because I didn't know if my well was gonna dry up

473
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,670
You get what you measure, right?

474
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,830
Yeah, never a good idea, but oh my god does that bring back man

475
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:11,420
I was making 20 bucks an hour man. I was loving life. I did exactly the same strategy you did

476
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,460
except

477
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,380
Whatever their min bar goal. I made sure I always doubled it on a weekly basis and

478
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,990
Man, did they get bugs?

479
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:32,790
Right, I would one of the great ways for me to fulfill my quota is go look for grammar mistakes in the help documentation

480
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,850
Yeah, oh, yeah, you're missing a comma

481
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,190
You need a comma. I'm like, oh my god

482
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:45,990
Let's bring this forward to 2020 in the conversation I had last week with a non Microsoft non-unity employee. We're talking about

483
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,670
Metrics is what do you measure and I mentioned the accelerator metrics and the question was I forget it was a word

484
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,430
I haven't probably heard since I read Caner's book maybe before

485
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,950
He asked what's your defect?

486
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,790
Insertion rate or something creation rate defect creation rate you posted this later

487
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:10,190
I did because and I and my answer was I can create a bug in Jira and under five minutes. What do you mean?

488
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,470
Because you know how many bugs come in? I was like, oh, I don't know because we don't

489
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,150
We don't really track bugs

490
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,600
We just fix them as they happen. We have one we except for one exception

491
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,640
We have a slow trickle of bugs that comes in through our enterprise support

492
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,720
We have for our organization that we enter usually their SDK things and usually only a half dozen working out at once

493
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,360
And they're usually done within two weeks

494
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,840
So but that's it. So I don't know how to count

495
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:43,210
defect creation rate

496
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:46,790
But the fact that that was suggested made me think oh my god

497
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:52,270
This is still counting bugs as a metric is still a thing people care about

498
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,310
I don't honor even understand the

499
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,950
For quality even even in a lot of like you and I talked about it

500
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:07,510
I don't know recently and I even remember it was on the podcast. We it was a conversation around incident rate. I

501
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,250
and my board

502
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:14,490
Using Kanban, right? I I call bugs forms. I don't have a bug database

503
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:20,930
Right the the naming of the way they asked you what's your bug creation rate? Right in like

504
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,530
How fast do your devs create bugs?

505
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:31,370
Right, which is I believe where it's coming from not how fast do people file bugs and

506
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,800
The way I think of it now particularly with a Kanban system is I go, okay

507
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,500
What is my what's the rate of my inbound queue?

508
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:50,420
And am I burning that down am I making it harder to to?

509
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:57,700
Construct customer impacting issues that we call them swarm tickets in my team

510
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:04,940
Yep, I've I've I have seen your concept of Kanban boards know what the swarm swim lane is for. Yes

511
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:10,360
We hate that board. We hate that lane because it's the only thing that interrupts us

512
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,520
As it should as it should and so that puts a focus on

513
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,360
reducing the interruptions

514
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,360
It's interesting

515
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,390
That person's question if he had asked me I would have used it to shift it from the traditional

516
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,240
bullshit

517
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,240
Way of thinking to oh, I think you mean this and I probably would have even played dumb

518
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
In just

519
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,120
Conversation was around I was brainstorming outsource like here are the things I

520
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,720
Here's what I measure

521
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
accelerate metrics some of the

522
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,600
Server health metrics who thinks I watch and care about so what else to think I should do it this came up

523
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,920
And then they just started telling me a bunch of things. I should do not things I should measure which was weird

524
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,280
Anyway, but you know, that's common. It's kind of it's depressingly common actually

525
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,680
Yeah, I asked for one thing got another anyway in talking about this this paper will recommend and read

526
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,920
We should do our next book report or at least worth half a podcast and talking about is

527
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:23,440
Did you read the latest state of DevOps report? This is the one put together by Nicole Forsgren and gang

528
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,580
It's based on a large amount of survey and some interpretation

529
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,800
One of the interpretations they know I've read one. I don't know if it's the latest when it come out months ago

530
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Two months ago, no probably not two months ago three months ago not that long ago

531
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,460
But anyway, I'll send you a link and I'll remember to put one in the damn show notes. I'm gonna suck

532
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:46,960
One of the things that was interesting is I use those a lot and I'm preparing

533
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,640
I'm at this presentation I put together and I'm presenting the accelerate metrics because I know they've been studied and I can use those

534
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,900
too I

535
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,540
Can use the research to make add some validity to the numbers

536
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:07,620
But you need you want to bootstrap with something that's credible and then you'll you'll add you and I have other flavored ad but anyway

537
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,100
One thing they've done in that paper Nicole and I don't I think she did most to work on it is

538
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:18,580
Sort of maturity modeled although Nicole hates maturity models. Maybe even more than I do

539
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,540
the metrics like the accelerate metrics like where you should be on things and

540
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,780
There's good news and bad news and I'll forget the number so I won't quote them is

541
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,980
My team my organization is at the elite level in everything

542
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,420
We're not good enough

543
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,420
that those

544
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,380
The elite level is very lenient

545
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:46,510
the one the one I thought would be close on is the

546
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,950
failure rate so I looked at

547
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:57,750
incidents or issues that happen in production per deployment and it says one to five percent and I look and we're

548
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,190
Way under one percent. So which I think is still a lot

549
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:08,510
If you're at one percent one of every hundred deployments causes something bad to happen. That's horrible

550
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,440
No, so therein lies an opportunity

551
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,660
We can have a whole podcast about I just I was just thinking about that because it's this

552
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,220
segue into

553
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,500
2014

554
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,180
2019 set of DevOps so 20 sorry 2004 to the 2019 state of DevOps

555
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:32,420
So the first thing I want to I want to say regarding this paper is in some regard to caner paper the caner paper

556
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,470
it's

557
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,590
depressing and

558
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:44,870
Because because it's been 16 years and so much of the industry is still every paper is still

559
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,820
relevant

560
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,780
Well, no this paper can be shipped to people and they would go

561
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,940
It would still have the same argument, you know, what do you know how?

562
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,240
Do you know what do you mean? We shouldn't have a bug tracking system with by the way, he says no

563
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,520
So a couple years ago every year on 4th of July

564
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,600
For the US listeners at the Independence Day holiday everyone else. It's our opinion stay holiday

565
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,400
NPR our National Public Radio published it they tweet the Declaration of Independence

566
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,270
Okay, and

567
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,780
Not as much anymore because they caught themselves but the first year this happened a bunch of

568
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:38,260
Trump supporters were going off on Twitter because I thought this whole thing was just they didn't realize the question independence

569
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,220
I thought it was all jet NPR making jabs at the president. Okay, so I

570
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,940
Wonder if I were to take select quotes from this and tweet them

571
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:55,150
How many people would disagree and tell me I was full of shit I'm asking you this now because that's what I'm doing this weekend

572
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,720
Before this podcast

573
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:05,840
I am going to take some choice quotes from this and I'm going to troll the internet and see what happens the challenge here

574
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,120
Is that thing I really would want to see

575
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:15,200
There is a challenge and you can finish that the challenge is all the people that hate me for all my shit and going against

576
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,400
Your exploratory testing and oh my god. There is nothing better in life. They're writing selenium tests all day

577
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,400
They've already stopped following and or blocked me already, but I'll see who's left because there's always somebody

578
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,680
Oh like the person when I said when ministry testing tweeted testing is dot dot dot and I wrote

579
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:38,560
accelerating the achievement simple quality and so reply back testing does nothing to accelerate the team and

580
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,440
Fun happened from there, so we'll see what happens

581
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,040
Yeah, I'm actually yeah, what is Eric talk with you off the podcast

582
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,720
Cuz this is a lot of fun that you

583
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:01,000
Fun possibilities based on what you just said but going back to going back to Nicole thing and I and I this will be my

584
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,600
final thought on this one or on this

585
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:09,860
Like the state of DevOps and and the

586
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:19,170
The KPI that you're thinking of rolling out and how you're gonna do that, right? You mentioned by her standard

587
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,030
You're in the the

588
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:23,110
elite class, so great

589
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:27,030
Unfortunately as you called out

590
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,390
That means

591
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:34,470
You may not necessarily be able to

592
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,470
to leverage much from the coal

593
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:41,310
to move into the

594
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:48,430
Super elite I can define my own levels the metrics that are in accelerate are still highly valid

595
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:53,070
I still want to use them. I just have higher standards than the elite level know what I'm saying actually

596
00:45:54,070 --> 00:46:02,070
Because you're you're now going into something that she hasn't documented. I think there's an opportunity there to create a collaboration

597
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:04,310
connection

598
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,230
with

599
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,260
Nicole I hope so

600
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:14,700
Alright, and actually I lied because there's one thing as I was looking at you and realizing where you work

601
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:22,100
There's something that I do also gonna be it could be because of my unity hoodie. I'm wearing my admin. Are you aware of?

602
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:30,470
The communication the the recent controversy with the communications workers union

603
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:38,120
No, I am NOT. Okay. I'm not aware of the recent controversies with the communications something union

604
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,200
in

605
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,320
California

606
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,550
They are working to unionize

607
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,430
Game developers. Oh, I have heard about this the game testers

608
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:54,170
game developers game developers

609
00:46:54,610 --> 00:47:02,130
Interesting and I haven't heard about this. There's always some because of the way the game companies treat testers game QA

610
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,090
frequently I hear rumblings of

611
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:10,430
Testers game testers wanting to unionize but I had heard about developers anyway continue

612
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:16,890
I think it might be something worth discussing between the two of us on this because one of the things I realized is

613
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:27,190
Knowledge work is becoming a bigger and bigger thing. Yes, like a lot of the the blue-collar work is being automated away

614
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
and

615
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:40,240
I'm actually it's not the prediction episode, but I'm actually thinking there is a non-trivial chance that in

616
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,880
next 10 years

617
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,920
That could that could unionize. Oh well

618
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:53,700
Long as ever hits me. I'll retire if you ever have you ever worked in Union. I have I have also

619
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:02,160
The experience was not good. Yeah, I worked in Union. I think it would be a horrible thing long term for

620
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:10,920
The people in the society quite honestly. Yeah, but I think in the short term it might much like labor unions did in the short term

621
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:15,900
I think it might be a good thing

622
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,540
So here's one of the things that unions do

623
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:27,570
If nothing else if the unionized and this stuck and then we got rid of the union. I'd be for unionization

624
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,490
gets read of

625
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,990
This hyper competitive heroism bullshit a buddy of mine works at Salesforce

626
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:42,430
Everyone knows what their bonus is gonna be and it there's there's no

627
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,030
There's no

628
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:52,000
Behavior at Salesforce where you're trying to look I don't have to be good. I just have to be better than Alan

629
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:58,830
Because that relative stack system the the hyper competitiveness is

630
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:06,750
Very much a Microsoft thing. I think I mean that's my experience my experience at Microsoft is

631
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,600
man, when you get to may

632
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,560
People are sucking up and putting others down and trying to make themselves look good for

633
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:24,010
At the risk and pain to customers at the risk and pain to each other at the risk and pain of mental health

634
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:30,330
It is it's horrid. Did you read Whitaker's why I left Microsoft again, I

635
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:33,170
Know I didn't

636
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:39,750
Nutshell he says that culture is changing. It's the right direction not going fast enough

637
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:43,370
I'm gonna go someplace else. Oh, that's what I said when I left. Yeah

638
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,810
screw him

639
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,490
the

640
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,620
In all of that's true

641
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,400
but

642
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:59,200
What it was frustrated him further is he he knew why it wasn't going fast enough and that is because

643
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,560
All of the hippos at the company that have been here. Oh, you know what?

644
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:10,380
Maybe I did see that that that's all absolutely true. If you look at you know Windows, which is

645
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,920
Even though maybe it's getting better now that it's part of Azure, which is still weird, but that whole

646
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,360
It is whole it's just a just a old

647
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,620
It's a it's a frat Club for 50 year olds as the leadership of Windows

648
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,830
Yeah, and it's interesting. I'm trying to come up with a way to classify this

649
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:34,110
Because I am in the 50 year old Club and

650
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,670
next

651
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,360
maybe

652
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,680
episode

653
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,930
116

654
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:46,210
On February 6th, it's my 25th here

655
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:52,010
But yet I share no kinship with these folks these folks that have have

656
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,960
decided that

657
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,120
There is no reason to change right unless it's forced upon me

658
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,120
absolutely and

659
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,480
There were in the and we can go on a little bit here

660
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,840
But well what a tangent in the the 90s and the early 2000s. There was still so much turnover people

661
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,320
Weren't staying at Microsoft a long time, but some were in there

662
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:21,320
people start takes staying at Microsoft longer and longer and they stopped learning and

663
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,920
ten years ago

664
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:30,600
James and a friend of ours were at lunch and James takes credit for this but it was actually Dan who first said this he

665
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:37,280
Said everybody at a certain level and above should have to go out and every two years

666
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,960
they have to get a job offer from another company in order to keep their job here make sure they're staying relevant and

667
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,560
There is a reason they're staying here some of those

668
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:52,960
Partner level folks and many of those partner level folks and many of our executives the reason they're staying at Microsoft because they cannot

669
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:01,340
Get an equal paying job or an equal prestige job anywhere else in the industry because they're irrelevant to every other company besides Microsoft

670
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,720
well, that's part of it. The other thing too is

671
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,520
Microsoft has put into place for a long time strategies to retain

672
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,080
Those type of folks. Yeah, but maybe that's the wrong thing

673
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:21,840
But it's fine to retain them if they continue to learn and grow but you can look at them and I'll I'll call out names

674
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,080
Michael Fortin the stagnant of their like talk about someone stuck in

675
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,040
1990 and being totally happy with it. There's an example. I

676
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:35,720
Have not I don't know if he's still around anymore. He is. I'm Irish and his boss is same thing

677
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,840
Terry's not yeah, I know. I know. Yeah, God

678
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:47,640
I have you can't imagine and just the pain of being in a meeting like with Terry Meyers in there and just going

679
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,240
Oh my god, you're running this ship. Oh

680
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:57,320
Anyway, names dropped doesn't matter. I left three years ago almost exactly. I had an interaction. So

681
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,080
you mentioned Windows is is

682
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:04,040
part of Azure they are and

683
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:10,200
As you know because you were still here when they formed it I believe

684
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:17,640
Windows response to the removal of tests

685
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,460
was to put them all into a

686
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:23,620
an organization they called quality and then

687
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:30,620
Take what seemingly a random 50% of those same folks and change their title

688
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:37,460
You know, yeah, you get a title developer evens you get a title data scientist. Yep. Just rotate draw straws

689
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:43,660
I was there for that and and oh and by the way, this is gonna happen and we're gonna give you no direction

690
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,220
Go figure it out on your own. Yeah bad bad bad idea

691
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,180
the

692
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,700
However, even worse. It's a bad idea

693
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,900
Executed poorly poorly. However

694
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,500
That was many years ago

695
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:05,060
It was but was about six years ago. Yes, and five years

696
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,570
they have hired in

697
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,930
for example, there is a

698
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,330
one of those data science teams

699
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:18,460
They hired in a partner level data scientist manager

700
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,220
Who

701
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,380
Now has been at the company for a year

702
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,860
But before that he was at HP and he and I is funny

703
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:32,100
He and I went had coffee and he's like bring can I just talk to you?

704
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:40,240
He's German and Germans like to be blunt. I mean he's from Germany and he's like, can I just have a straight conversation?

705
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,440
I'm like sure, of course

706
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,230
and he's like

707
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:46,270
WTF

708
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:51,080
This company and I'm like dude, you're in the middle of Windows. It's not this company

709
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,120
Yeah, and that's one thing to be clear on my my rant is dedicated there

710
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:03,680
I do talk about there are some bright spots. There's bright spots, but but still a struggle to rewind it

711
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,920
It's just it's tough because it's tough to

712
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:14,000
Everyone's focused on getting promoted people are more focused on getting promoted than probably anything that benefits the customer

713
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,400
I remember that you remember the lesson of the the monkeys experiment. Yes, sometimes people are doing things

714
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,480
because that's how it's always been done and they don't know it a

715
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:28,760
Great example that same team. So I have

716
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,280
AI actually running in production and

717
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:39,750
Customers its customer-facing it's something I shipped about six months ago

718
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:46,440
They have a similar technology this this this one team I'm thinking of and I said, okay

719
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,680
Let's meet and let's run your model against my data and see which one's better

720
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,640
I still hosted if yours is better. I'll ship it. We started this about three months ago

721
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,850
They haven't finished writing the proposal

722
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:05,430
Document so that they could get the approval

723
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:12,700
to do a four-hour freaking experiment to see if they have something better and I'm like

724
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:25,050
Yes, so one one final final final thing that I really have to go fair enough is

725
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,570
Another thing we could potentially talk about in the future

726
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:31,650
But I'll bring it up shortly now is you know 15 years ago 10 years ago

727
00:56:32,290 --> 00:56:37,850
At some point I was working a lot with 10 years ago with not cheating. I got the pun who you know, you know not

728
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:40,610
she I do and always did research on

729
00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:49,450
Really relevant stuff and he's good with statistics really really fantastic human and there was some talk last week because someone wrote a bot at Microsoft

730
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:52,410
It's one of Microsoft wrote a bot based on his research to

731
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,850
Walk code and predict defects and one of the things they found

732
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:59,010
I had the highest correlation or the highest recall was

733
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:04,370
Organizational structure and the internet went. Oh my god. This is so cool

734
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:09,910
But the thing I would like to point out with that research and I think you'll head nod here is

735
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,490
at

736
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:17,030
Microsoft that makes complete sense because organizational structure and

737
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:24,030
Who you report to and what org you report to is something people often look at before they'll even talk to you

738
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:29,290
So of course it the challenges in software and complexity come from communication

739
00:57:29,290 --> 00:57:33,710
And there are communication breakdowns dependent on org that are highly

740
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,390
Specific or at least intensify that Microsoft

741
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,360
so

742
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,280
And so

743
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:52,460
Yeah, there are that particular study to my to my knowledge it hasn't

744
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:58,540
So you're aware of the repeatability crisis right now, yes, okay that one

745
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:04,820
I think hasn't passed the repeatability it was intended to be sort of hey, this is what we've learned

746
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,740
I did I've actually had meetings with not she and

747
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:12,020
one of the things he struggled with was trying to find a

748
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,620
Variety of different right data sources right that had sufficient data

749
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:20,260
and at that point in time he

750
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,180
Shit ton of data and there was only two groups

751
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:30,040
The thing was and again granted not she used windows for the bulk of his research

752
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:35,460
Anyway, I would love to keep talking about it. We keep keep giving us your papers. We'll keep giving you bad book reports

753
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:40,180
So show notes caner paper sinner DevOps

754
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:45,900
Maybe even not cheese paper not his bot stuff if I get that far that's gonna be a lot of work for me

755
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:51,740
I'll see if I can get that done. I'm Alan. I'm brain and we're gonna see you next time. Happy New Year
