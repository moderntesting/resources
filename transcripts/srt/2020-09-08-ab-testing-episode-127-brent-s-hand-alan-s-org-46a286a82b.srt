00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,420
Welcome to AV testing podcast your modern testing podcast your hosts Alan and

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,220
Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing leadership agile and

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,260
anything else that comes to mind now on with the show we are back for another

4
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:28,100
episode hey Brent how you doing I'm doing swell Alan wow you know it's it's

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:36,660
been a break huh it looks like what August 17th yeah we had a three-week

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,220
break we shifted crap goes on that happens we are inconsistent but we are

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,340
consistently inconsistent sometimes two sometimes three occasionally four

8
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,000
occasionally one week between episodes I was just sticking through I was looking

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,490
at the last the last episode we get something that I think we're not super

10
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:06,970
accustomed to recently and that is we got praise for it high praise shocking what

11
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,860
did we talk about in that episode I don't know and then you called it Azure

12
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,260
powered oh I did because you talked about Azure so I called it we were

13
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,940
talking about names for Windows I think and as you're powered it made sense to

14
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:32,180
so unlike this episode so yeah here we are hello people watching the live stream

15
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,700
I'm sorry that it sucks but we'll do better do you have like anything new we

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,060
should talk about before we dive into talking about me you just can't stop

17
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:52,130
fidgeting with the crap around you can you yeah all right I think I so we've

18
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,770
joked in the past about the podcast being a DD written I don't know that I

19
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:04,110
mentioned before I have a child that has been diagnosed with it and I haven't gone

20
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:13,270
in but if it's genetic I think yeah I don't think you need to go in the other

21
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:21,350
thing positive news see I don't think we talked about it so you remember that I

22
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:29,120
screwed up my hand my finger yes I do remember did we do an episode post

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:39,440
surgery no no we did not so I did they plant a chip in you if they did I can't

24
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,840
tell all right what do they do hey everyone Alan hopping in here for a

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,440
little overdub I've just edited out about 25 minutes of Brent talking about

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:52,800
the recent surgery on his hand friends okay he was little anxious before the

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,640
surgery but now we can get back on with the podcast so on the podcast I think part

28
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,960
of our partnership is I'm representing the IQ side of the house and you're

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:11,440
representing the EQ not to say that Lisa no that's totally true you're the

30
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,280
smart one I'm the entertainment in your case though it's not that you're a

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:24,040
dumbass either although in my case I tell my team I have two emotions I use I use

32
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:33,540
neither of them very often but when I do I am all in that is all I do and this

33
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:43,390
one yeah it was anytime I can I can go wow I cannot push this emotion into its

34
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:49,310
little box where I normally put emotions it's the right thing to do is take any

35
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,110
emotion that you feel squish it up into a metaphorical little ball as tight as

36
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,230
you can and shove it as deep inside of you as you can and keep it there right

37
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,670
right exactly right and then you know you put it in a little box and then you

38
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,750
take that box and you squish it up into a little ball and you put a little

39
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,630
another little box and then you go find some deep and then you lock the box

40
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:20,030
absolutely you lock the box you hide it in a little dark internal corner you you

41
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:26,150
you close and you lock up the door to that little corner right yeah I mean we

42
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,350
could do this forever yeah yeah we're not we're not good but we get the point

43
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,710
so you got your hand you got your hand fixed and it freaked you out and now

44
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,410
you're better well not entirely now you're getting better getting better now

45
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,890
they're gonna amputate your hand I don't think they're gonna go that far

46
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:52,370
discussion like if they were to do that right should I go with like full-on hook

47
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:58,390
are you just like gonna stare at your hand the entire episode they it's that

48
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,700
maybe quiet right you want me to do something else maybe no you're yeah

49
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,060
play with your hand play with your hand hey I want to talk about well your EQ

50
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,700
thing reminded me of a story I have to tell now and then I want to talk about

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,860
the other thing I want to talk about which is me but you'll have it inputs we

52
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:28,410
are in the middle of we do promotions twice a year in our org at Unity and we

53
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,450
have modified very carefully because I know at scale it's gone very badly we

54
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:41,450
have modified sort of what Google do for promotions we have Oh promotions here in

55
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,610
this case does not mean like PR events it means hey annual review time blah-to-blah

56
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,010
promoting no we don't really do annual reviews but we do we do look at people

57
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:57,210
for promotion twice a year and what we do is at Google as many of you may know

58
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,850
an employee can anyone can choose when they want to be they feel like they

59
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,730
should be promoted and they prepare a packet of materials describing what

60
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:12,850
they've done and a a panel of people independent not your manager goes and

61
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:20,170
reviews that ours is very similar however we the employee doesn't do it by

62
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,130
themselves it's the manager recommendation but it's a collaboration

63
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,610
between the manager and the employee that makes sure that it's fair and then

64
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,850
we're in the middle of this but anyway blah blah blah I'm leading one of the

65
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,790
panels and for a couple of the more senior promotions and I I lead some

66
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:46,110
meetings at unity where I have to be strict father figure no you know the

67
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,750
how should I describe this no I get it you're the you're the adult in the

68
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:56,590
room you're the one major adult in the room and make sure and and really push

69
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:00,630
stuff along and be good this was a small panel of senior people and we had really

70
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:04,670
good information prepared and the goal of the meeting is to reach alignment on

71
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:08,910
a bunch of criteria of evaluation and but we had all the information needed

72
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,030
to do well so I'm kind of having fun making sure it's fun to go through it

73
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,910
and there is one of the newer directors who haven't interacted with a

74
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,230
lot one-on-one and I was doing my normal joking around and he said something

75
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:28,990
that I both felt good and bad about at the same time he goes and I won't try and

76
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,110
do his Scottish accent but imagine this is Scottish I've never seen this

77
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,620
Alan this Alan is fun and I thought well that's nice you this you're having

78
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,660
a good time here but I'm sorry that you don't think I'm fun all the time I

79
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:51,660
have to project my my fun Alan more often so I feel bad people think I'm not fun

80
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,100
yeah did you bring patron into the meetings you introduce people to the

81
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:05,810
group hug no and no yeah so that's been going on I have a couple of my folks

82
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,970
being promoted I have no idea how they're doing I prepared packets for

83
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,970
them I worked with them to prepare them and we'll see how they are reviewed one

84
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,490
cool thing about this process is the goal of the process is not to get people

85
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,950
promoted the goal of the process is for people put up for promotion no matter

86
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,550
what happens with the promoted or not that they feel like the process is fair

87
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,590
and they get good feedback as part of the the committee like I still have to

88
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,070
prepare and consolidate a bunch of feedback that my panel has written and

89
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,630
what we'll do is we'll give the decision along with a page of feedback on things

90
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:46,310
that they're doing well the areas of growth we'll give that to the manager to

91
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,490
present to them so it's a it's a cool process so anyway if I made me think of

92
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,010
a fun Alan versus unfun now so my favorite part of that is if you

93
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,370
remember the part where I'm fun the part my is that your favorite part where

94
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:13,500
I'm not no okay the so I think I think my experience of you is probably 60% the

95
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,820
fun Alan and then 40% the pain in the ass adult person Alan sometimes you have to

96
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,860
get people to get stuff no good get it good no I get I can and to be clear I

97
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:34,820
can get people to get stuff done fun but yeah I yeah we all get so in my team

98
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:43,470
there's actually a name for it and I have an employee Oh is uncle PD the fun

99
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,940
Brent or the unfun Brent no I haven't told you the uncle PD story no but I

100
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,340
don't want to hear go on go on with story number one is there's a name for

101
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:01,980
within my team and and one of my employees who's also super high in EQ

102
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:09,020
she's the team's monitor they think of it like a like a testing and production a

103
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:20,940
live site alert system and she's like up guys Brent's in command mode so it comes

104
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:26,620
from the fact that so if you remember long long long ago I put you through the

105
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:32,100
strength binders stuff yes I still I just pulled that out recently one of the

106
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,720
strengths is one called command and that's not one of mine it's it's not in

107
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:46,260
my top five but it is in my top ten it's something that I use not every day but

108
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,980
maybe once a week once every two weeks and when I'm in command mode it's

109
00:10:51,980 --> 00:11:01,110
essentially in the next five minutes a decision is going to be made that's

110
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:07,440
that's command mode I don't care where the decision comes from I would prefer it

111
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,240
become from from you all and it's something something beneficial to everyone

112
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,320
but come hell or high water there is going to be a decision in the next five

113
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:27,950
minutes that's that's command mode it in a nutshell the the second story I have

114
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,130
already forgotten it no no we can skip uncle PD for now but I want to give you a

115
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:35,790
quiz I want to give you a quiz first then uncle PD and then my stuff you give

116
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:39,830
yourself yourself I'm gonna give you a guy of my top five strength finder

117
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:45,110
categories in front of me I will give you one point for everyone you can guess

118
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,960
giving it to me so if I just stall off don't look at us so okay you don't get to

119
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:59,560
know so the one the one I I experience all the time so one of my strengths is

120
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,320
called individualizer and what that means is I'm I'm actually really good at

121
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:12,890
seeing the strengths of individuals okay okay good good what am I know you're the

122
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:20,770
guy's your arms are folded so you're not typing one that I know of and I see all

123
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:26,530
of the time uses all of the time it might even be your number one I don't

124
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:34,380
remember the order is a cheever that is number three nice job I work hard and

125
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,700
possess a great deal of stamina take immense satisfaction in being busy and

126
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,780
productive a productive more than busy yeah the the thing that's interesting

127
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:54,340
about achievers is so every strength is also a weakness is this like the job

128
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,040
interview when you say do you have any weaknesses yes sometimes I work too hard

129
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,920
yeah so that's not something I would say but it would something it's something

130
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:12,680
that you would say potentially as an achiever but the the the weakness it's

131
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,940
really what drives achievers achievers are allergic and that's just absolutely

132
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,420
the right way of saying it they are allergic to being idle they cannot stand

133
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,550
idle time which which ends up being kind of a crappy thing when you're stuck at

134
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:34,630
home all the time so you end up working a lot yeah no I'm imagining like your

135
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:44,710
backyard is frickin weed-free the front yard is looking good you're like crap I

136
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,030
need something to do on the weekends oh what's the last time we fertilized home

137
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:58,180
depot trip right crap like that for you here I'm kind of cheating now cuz I'm I'm

138
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:06,940
not leveraging my individualization I am just trying to remember I will I think

139
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:14,790
it was one as well numero uno I figure out how to get shit done and then get

140
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:19,590
well so actually the thing that's interesting is futuristic in one of

141
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:25,580
yours no it's not and I'll actually just give them to you so they can move on but

142
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,460
strength finders a book if you buy the book you can pick the quiz and evaluate it

143
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,860
I thought about doing it you can pay for more advanced stuff but I like it does

144
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,980
describe it reminds me what I'm good at what I need to which is good for me

145
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:42,980
sometimes when I'm just doing a bunch of different things number one is

146
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,340
strategic which is faced with given scenario quickly spot the relevant

147
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,180
patterns and issues I do this all the time number two you're not gonna be

148
00:14:51,180 --> 00:15:00,000
surprised with is learner my superpower to success is I am totally unafraid to

149
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,560
take on stuff I haven't done before and figure out how to do it as I go along

150
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,000
and I leverage my strategic in order to do that number three is talked about is

151
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,500
achiever number four is analytical and really it goes the strategy as I think

152
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,700
about all the factors that might affect the situation and number five is

153
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,940
intellectual and appreciate intellectual discussions so none of these should be

154
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:30,580
surprising it isn't one who knows me so yeah actually I would never in a million

155
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:41,840
years have remembered the mine so so the one thing that's interesting about you

156
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:51,530
being like your particular package of top five I mean it's well suited for the

157
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:59,450
role that you're in the strategic is number one and I don't want to go this

158
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:06,410
isn't the strength finders episode no it's not but what most people will see

159
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:14,040
of you is your first strength but the thing that is fascinating about about

160
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:22,660
the strength finders stuff is that in general what your goal is like you're

161
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:29,130
gonna give it this way you use the top four strengths to achieve some goal around

162
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:42,100
the fifth one so usually yeah in my case it's it's not true but I will say that

163
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:49,140
in the majority of the folks that I tested that one with it is true like this

164
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,020
is something that Gardner so Gardner put together this thing and they have done

165
00:16:53,020 --> 00:17:02,120
like 50 years of multiple different sort of tests on it the thing that I find

166
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:08,040
fascinating in your top five that's interesting and I think taking back it

167
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,440
makes sense with sort of your personal struggle is so these things fall into

168
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:25,480
individual pillars and in none of your top five none of them is anything relating

169
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:33,320
to people whereas I have two in my top five I wonder if it makes a difference

170
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,360
that I mean these should be my strengths no matter what but I remember when I took

171
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,850
this I was an IC but I don't know I'm not gonna go too deeply into it I do want to

172
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:50,930
talk about people and especially the learning attribute so how does your team

173
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,730
learn new stuff like what opportunities what what circumstances occur when your

174
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:03,860
teams have the steepest learning curve what happens in your product and I'm

175
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:08,900
totally I'm trying not to lead you but I'm just curious can you think of a

176
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,740
circumstance where your team went on a steep learning curve oh I'm like the the

177
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,660
one that's the most prevalent to me is I'm still in the middle of it right

178
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:30,410
starting back in May I doubled the size of my team with all new non Microsoft

179
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:37,730
folks so a variety of them had industry experience in the past but not here at

180
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:46,660
Microsoft and introducing them to two concepts number one the Kanban concept

181
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:55,510
it is definitely not typical to even if you're in industry to run a data science

182
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:03,230
team using an agile method it's it's it's coming up it happens more

183
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,510
frequently now than it did say five years ago but it's still a typical not

184
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:21,670
typical this matter of fact having any structure at all so when we grab the

185
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:29,520
bunch of these folks a couple of them came from academia which has their own

186
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:36,870
sort of long is more of a waterfall ish type process right their job their job

187
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:41,990
was to research research produced papers there's a six to nine month structure

188
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:50,020
and that might even be the best track for for postdocs when in industry a lot

189
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:56,460
of the times companies will hire what they hope is a unicorn they will hire a

190
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,260
larger companies don't do this but smaller companies they'll hire a data

191
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:07,900
scientist because they know they need one and but then the guy shows up and

192
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,460
they don't know what to do with them they don't know how to manage their career

193
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:17,780
they don't have the mentor so those folks get accustomed to a good deal of

194
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:24,660
autonomy once they figure out how to survive in that environment so what I'm

195
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,260
dealing with right now is actually in the second one is my expectations of the

196
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,740
data scientists is that they pick up the development skills as well my goal in

197
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:45,670
one to two years is that I am fully a full stack data science team if it and

198
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:50,390
then in three years four years I'm actually gonna shift it it's

199
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,590
essentially we're a development team with a strong specialization in this so

200
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,430
you're in a growth path to get there on your vision we are we are but every

201
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,830
time we get a new set of people with their old culture it kind of slows down

202
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:11,860
the team dynamics so for me and remember the A B testing is since the A comes

203
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:16,460
first it's about me the biggest opportunities for organizational

204
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,220
learning and I'm a big fan of Peter Senge's fifth discipline about learning

205
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:24,580
and I liked I do a lot of things in retros etc to focus on learning in the

206
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,620
organization but but the the bumps in learning for the organization happen

207
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,840
when we have incidents in production when something when we have an

208
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,240
operational surprise and we can find because there's we we don't just ship

209
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:43,320
crap things happen usually because of the cascade of failures a bunch of things

210
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:50,200
going wrong at once and both people problems and infrastructure or

211
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,200
environment problems and something goes wrong and we get a massive opportunity to

212
00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:00,720
learn new stuff that we can share across the organization so I also just recently

213
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:10,260
as of yesterday doubled the size of my team well that is a bigger thing right

214
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:18,540
because your team is wasn't tiny to begin with if I recall correctly so I have

215
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:25,820
about 60 right now total but what I what I cover now in my organization is the

216
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:30,860
organization I added is the it's an internal group name so I'll just describe

217
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,900
it maybe let's put it this way so the big the big new thing I picked up is our

218
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:42,260
site reliability engineering team the team of about 20 people 18 people who

219
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,100
manage our incident process for all of unity around the world okay so any time

220
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,940
there's an incident we have a bot that spins up a channel people drive

221
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,300
discussions make sure we get to get the mitigation happening people help shepherd

222
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:01,420
the issue bring in the right people etc so that team is with me so now I get

223
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,860
to any worry I had in the past about not getting optimal learning over

224
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,700
incidents is now my fault and the other the other pieces right which is good

225
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,340
right the other pieces I picked up are more of DevOps sort of teams they're

226
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,980
working on infrastructure company-wide so I'm also now responsible for not all of

227
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,340
it ninety percent ninety five percent of the infrastructure we use to deploy

228
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:34,110
services across the entire company okay no big deal you got this no big deal no

229
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:40,350
big deal just go ship no problems but it's fun because what happened with

230
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,230
this latest merger we did by last time my team grew which was only a month ago

231
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,230
the last time my team grew we merged actually the org that I used to be in

232
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,710
largely with the org that I'm in to put almost all of our services in one place

233
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:04,720
but now even the services that aren't in my organization are supported by my

234
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,040
organization in some way fun stuff all stuff I like to do I like to work on

235
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:14,760
the stuff that makes things go so I'm excited about it I haven't even met

236
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,720
with most of the I met with all of the people who will become my new direct

237
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,880
reports already but I look forward to getting to meet more of the team these

238
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,640
people I've worked with I've worked with all of them in one way or another up

239
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,680
until now just because I'm always in the incident channels in my other roles

240
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,040
trying to figure out what's going on and to push things along so lots more

241
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,240
to do so we could go a couple different directions from here you can just ask

242
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,840
me random questions about the org and what I'm going to do or we could talk

243
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,360
about incident management in general because it's a bunch of different ways to

244
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:57,080
do that but before I do that I want to share one one observation that came from

245
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,080
this merger last month we have another we have a couple new directors in the

246
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:06,600
org and when we made this announcement internally to my peer group one of the

247
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,440
more senior people said is an SRE just a culture and not a role and before I could

248
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,480
even answer my manager said yeah same thing with DevOps I thought it was

249
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,080
interesting that I'm glad he got where I was DevOps is not a role it's a culture

250
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,880
we have a team to help promote that culture and the SRE team does the same

251
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,200
thing so I'm glad everyone recognized that right off but where do you just

252
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:38,800
already answered my question because damn I'm good on a recent episode of a be

253
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:49,980
testing on it Brit discuss WTF is Alan's new team's name oh yeah we talked about

254
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,900
that before I I was gonna call it delivery but now I was just pretty close

255
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,980
but I threw that away once I I knew I was picking up everything else and so

256
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,380
it's back to being called it's back to being called Alan team for now because we

257
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,260
don't have a better name Alan team at that's cool you can use the at sign you

258
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:22,180
just caught that blow is this thing on not on not on that was your question oh

259
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,860
your question was what to call the team I don't know what to call it not gonna

260
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,980
worry about it the right name will evolve as we grow but one thing I had

261
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,660
noticed is my local organization DevOps team and the work they were doing was

262
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:42,620
overlapping a lot with this global infrastructure group and to the point

263
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:47,700
where we had to have a discussion just before this or this reorg was announced

264
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,460
where we were trying to figure out where should people ask questions about

265
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,020
tool X because you own it but we support it or we support or we own it and you

266
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,420
support it so now it's all just it streamlines a lot of confusing

267
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:07,540
situation to think of our customers being the people trying to develop

268
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:13,020
services across unity there's confusion and where to ask questions or where to

269
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,700
get support or what to do a certain situation now we can streamline a lot of

270
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:22,790
that much easier sounds so I'm excited this is a good and I have people on the

271
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:26,230
team go oh this is so great to have these things aligned so yeah yeah all

272
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,070
part of my so how did SRE come into this like so SRE were part of that group so

273
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,390
there was a group of it's a reliability engineering group but they also handled a

274
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,230
lot of infrastructure tools and groups that that group included probably half

275
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,710
the team were doing tools and infrastructure work things like managing

276
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,990
the github relationship and and some other company-wide tools and as part of

277
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:59,150
that SRE is also company-wide so they were separate so now that my DevOps org

278
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:04,950
actually is almost in all of the services unity not quite company-wide but

279
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,230
pretty close it made sense to just emerge the company-wide stuff and and

280
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:16,150
even my DevOps team does do some support outside of just our organization so now

281
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,990
it's all just the charter now is all just our org supports service

282
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:27,940
infrastructure deployment company-wide okay so makes a lot of sense why you want

283
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:36,350
to talk about incident management yes yes because while I complain a lot about

284
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,310
things that happened at Microsoft and how I've been not did not that I noticed

285
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,470
when I was there but when I left I go oh this can be better Microsoft did a

286
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:50,870
pretty good job at incident management and in most cases having development

287
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,870
teams own a larger part of it than we do here right now and having very small

288
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:58,590
SRE teams per organization so I want to talk about the pros and cons of that

289
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:02,990
and my last team at Microsoft Microsoft Teams which by the way I ran in a browser

290
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,510
on Linux for the first time yesterday and it worked so congrats to Microsoft

291
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:12,780
for finally catching up we had a very we had two people on our SRE team for

292
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:20,220
Microsoft Teams and their job was entirely to just really play oversight

293
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,180
we had the first person called the first person page was not the SRE team it was

294
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:31,220
the developer who owned the particular service that went down which I kind of

295
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,460
like the difference is between that and what we do at Unity is the SRE team

296
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,260
gets the first page so they can jump in and create the channel and monitor

297
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:47,260
things but within seconds the the appropriate development owner development

298
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,580
owners are involved in figuring out what's going on with the incident I also

299
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:56,300
know that at Microsoft Teams handled teams to handle production incidents in

300
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,580
different ways so I'm curious what have you seen as far as models for handling

301
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:06,340
production incidents and what do you think has worked well or not well one

302
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,050
of the things that's interesting right because you shared your perspective and

303
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:18,420
so I got to figure out at the same time I got to answer your question and figure

304
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:25,700
out okay what's what's what may or may not be an NDA violation one of the things

305
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:32,260
that's interesting is but this scenario you talked about but there's another

306
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:42,280
there's another bigger problem when you're trying to do this at scale and

307
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:51,320
Microsoft so we talked about Azure what is that good question what is Azure it's

308
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:57,320
a it's a very pretty color I was gonna say the same yeah that just loaded a

309
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,280
whole bunch of candidates but I think we we've killed our tank control yourself

310
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,670
I think we killed our danger quota for today the and maybe for the next step

311
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:14,910
possibly but by then we'll have forgotten it doing it at scale is a

312
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:22,490
challenge you throw in addition to that that is a metaphor I've been testing

313
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:32,490
internally the last couple of weeks in terms of trying to get people so I'm in

314
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:38,290
I'm in several executive meetings and trying to set a metaphor and and a lot

315
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:44,810
of regards as your like this is like a set of Lego blocks we have a whole bunch

316
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:55,400
of Lego blocks matter of fact what was the the cool robot version of Legos my

317
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:02,120
son even has a set of it it's the one where you can program it and cool do

318
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:11,470
cool things the mind yes happy to help Brent right so but the one thing that

319
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,770
that so we have all these components all these little different little blocks but

320
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:26,340
as we've talked about before customers don't want software they don't even if

321
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,180
they come in nifty little components what they want is a solution to a problem

322
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:40,890
that they have in a lot of regards unlike Legos which has a very clean

323
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:52,640
interface for connecting components together we don't there's and so one of

324
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,700
the challenges is not only do we have to know when we have a an incident right

325
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:07,540
the the team that actually had the monitor to detect it may in fact not be

326
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:12,800
the team that needs to be on the line and so there's a whole lot of

327
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:22,680
infrastructure around how do we how do we quickly get how do we quickly

328
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,320
identify who is the relevant knowledge expert get them on the line so we can

329
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,240
start knocking down the incident there's a lot as you might expect there's a lot

330
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:40,480
of process with that one right and that is one place where the SRE team here

331
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:50,670
locally has spent a good amount of time on optimizing it it fails a great deal

332
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:57,030
we still end up having like the old-school bug ping-pong issues you

333
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:04,540
remember back in the day I recall and but generally what happens when there's an

334
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:19,260
incident there is there are three entities that get called into a a public

335
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:27,520
teams me currently improving the name that we use for this so a call is spawned

336
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:34,320
the conference call is created and three people get immediately at it that's that

337
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:42,120
is a key the the current incident manager within SRE the current incident manager

338
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:50,160
from our customer experience team that because they are the ones accountable for

339
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:56,840
socializing any any customer-centric message that we're going to send out say

340
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:04,960
in a broadcast or to to sit say the set of impacted customers they're the ones

341
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:15,690
that own that messaging and then a person who owns the monitor that triggered okay

342
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:25,950
and then on that call there's there's a lot of positive handoff we we and again

343
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:31,550
there's that quest for what's the cause as quickly as possible who's the who's

344
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:40,980
the knowledge expert to go even deeper okay there's a lot of post incident

345
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,260
process as well so this is the part and and all that

346
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,940
administrative it was very interesting Brent actually it really it was

347
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,780
interesting but it's the it's the post part that I think I care about a lot of

348
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:01,820
work to happen to make sure stuff gets resolved we drive we are not as good as

349
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,900
I want to be at our time to detect and time to mitigate so we work on improving

350
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:10,380
those but the work on improving those doesn't happen during the incident once

351
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,020
the incident is resolved the other thing our SRE team does is make sure

352
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:23,840
that we have a one a RCA document and sometimes it's depending on the team it

353
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,120
can be more of a tax it's filled out versus driving towards a learning

354
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:33,120
experience and also make tracking to make sure that improvements are being made as

355
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,560
a result of this and that some of those improvements or where applicable our

356
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,990
organization wider company wide and not just a quick fix on the team so in

357
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:49,670
driving those where was I going with that oh other thing is I define you

358
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,830
know we define incidents as an operational surprise so we're pretty

359
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:58,390
liberal about opening these so one thing having the large slightly larger SRE

360
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,110
team helps is we have prior one incidents which are kind of what you're

361
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,870
calling about which require all hands-on debt let's get this resolved as soon as

362
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,950
possible that's where I really worry about that time to mitigate and time to

363
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:14,980
resolve but sometimes something is just wrong it's not causing any customer

364
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,660
impact but we know from our monitoring and alerts that it's wrong and we'll

365
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:23,620
open up an incident on that because again going by an incident being an

366
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:29,260
operational surprise we're surprised by the way things look CPU usage up by 20% in

367
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,180
this node okay let's go let's open an incident go look at that if we don't

368
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,380
understand it right away and then we'll take the time to figure out okay we

369
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,260
got this then we can the chances are from that we may find something we've

370
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,220
learned and in systemic behavior that we can go either implement at an

371
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,660
infrastructure level to make sure there's better monitoring in place or

372
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,820
just to educate teams on why these things may happen so they're not

373
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,580
surprised by those in the future so those I don't know how often I don't

374
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,780
recall doing the latter class at at Microsoft as incidents but we try to

375
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,300
track all those operational surprises just to make sure that not just the

376
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:10,420
customer facing bugs our customer facing issues cause that reflection to

377
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:17,100
happen but taking all opportunities we can find to learn and get better so one

378
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:24,640
of the tweaks I'm gonna make to the system is I feel like the process of

379
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,640
analyzing incident doing a root cause analysis document has become a little

380
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,760
rote like and task like and not emphasizing learning so I think that's

381
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,240
one of the tweaks I'll make that's again going back to my learner attribute

382
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:49,130
I'm really stoked about that as so I am it it fascinates me how often I find that

383
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:57,750
you're working my work or an alignment unfortunately in this particular so it's

384
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:05,070
something my manager knows this it's something that I have been trying to shed

385
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:12,110
from my responsibilities for the better part of the two years but he and I are

386
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:20,110
partners on it and he refuses to go alone which understandably where I am

387
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,950
here's his shoes so we have a post-mortem process is what we call it

388
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:32,510
we have there is a non-trivial retrospective that occurs for each of

389
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,750
these things and we do those for the prior with the ones that have customer

390
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:42,670
impact we do an in-person retro as well and there's an expectation of what we

391
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:51,030
call repair items that will get communicated the SRE team has done a

392
00:39:51,030 --> 00:40:01,640
I'll give them a C plus B minus on this because those processes the identification

393
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:10,080
the post-mortem and the repair they too have become as you call wrote right and

394
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:15,960
they're they're a bit of a make work exercise and whenever I get on a meeting

395
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:25,240
with with with folks I show two stories one of the the biggest issues and and I

396
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:31,810
don't think I'm violating India by sharing this because I think it's a

397
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:39,170
common value you go reading those SRE thing it's a problem that they have as

398
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:52,430
well although I suspect well Google wrote the book on SRE literally I think I

399
00:40:52,430 --> 00:41:04,580
think they just have a maturity that we in Azure only have in in in it's not

400
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:09,340
holistic it's not it's not something that is part of the whole Azure culture

401
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:16,880
just yet anyway we'll go through this one of the things that I have noticed so I

402
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:25,620
read every post-mortem every month the quality of these things just rain

403
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:34,010
I see the same thing one of the statements is what was the customer impact

404
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:40,720
okay um yeah I cannot tell you the number of conversations I've had with

405
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:48,100
folks around the answer to that question is a friggin number yes and actually

406
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:55,220
that's what we track there you just went that's exactly what we track because

407
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:01,040
sorry I mean it's like a type something a minute ago Julia recommended that I

408
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,320
installed the MS Teams app or said there's a Teams app available for Linux

409
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,760
I said no way I'm installing that crap but I had two quick thoughts and I've

410
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,360
forgotten one of them one of them there's I think our roles aligned

411
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:18,520
because even though neither of us or anything close to a testing role we both

412
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,200
are still driven by the modern testing principles that's our life and so we

413
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,560
of course we align things those way but in our incidents out there's a field a

414
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:34,000
must-be filled out field which is not customer impact but revenue impact and

415
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
people have to go work with the BI team and figure out if there was a revenue

416
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,560
impact and put it in there and I track that because I want to know one of my

417
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:50,770
metrics I track is percentage of net revenue lost due to incidents so that

418
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:55,370
customer impact comes out as a number and that number has a dollar sign in

419
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:00,970
front yeah the interesting thing is so we spawned up a process about a year ago to

420
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:15,870
try to pull to do exactly that in our case though that data is considered at

421
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:24,030
the source is considered GDPR and once you put those four letters on any data

422
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:31,630
source people like whoa nope not not touching that one nope nope nope nope nope

423
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:39,030
because every data point I have to add you know 60 weeks of effort to guarantee

424
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,870
I'm caretaking it it's just a lot easier to say nope come on Microsoft's

425
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:50,390
rich just pay the fines yeah no one wants to be the person that's first in

426
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:55,910
the news for doing that one either Facebook we're already first in the news

427
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:01,310
yeah no I mean like internally and I don't want to be the first Microsoft for

428
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,070
that one no thank you someone else can go first let me tell you a couple things

429
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:18,820
that that I've been beating hard on this topic one that was very helpful and

430
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:30,730
another one that that's sort of my new meme so the first thing is I find one of

431
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:36,610
the problems that we had about two years ago is the way we define the SRE

432
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:44,130
process we're essentially so you called it priority we call it severity okay and

433
00:44:44,130 --> 00:44:52,440
it's essentially the class of the incident is defined by a single value a P zero P

434
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:02,710
one and technically our prize is seven yeah so I've done a lot of work to get

435
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:11,050
that to be two values not one and the main reason why is if you look at it well

436
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:19,920
I don't know how unity operates so if a if a if a low do you categorize your

437
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,000
monitors do like if this monitor fires it's it's a 75% chance it's only going

438
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:35,160
to be a P for no okay so when a monitor fires is every monitor treated like a

439
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:43,520
potential oh shit we it depends but we have mostly smoke alarms okay so you

440
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,690
have a yeah you have a so when you you're gonna have a signal to noise

441
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,490
problem that you're gonna try to you probably want to work exactly it's

442
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:59,810
getting better definitely very good in some places but it's an area I'm working

443
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:07,370
on a person so I do like so Google in their SRE book they talk through their

444
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:13,770
which by the way is an excellent freaking book it is and it's interesting

445
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:19,650
it was published I don't know ten years ago now and I think it's still very

446
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:27,120
relevant to to today because there's so there's a lot of folks who like Google

447
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:36,590
developed this from from essentially the dominance in search and both just like

448
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:44,710
within Microsoft like Bing has forgotten how to succeed at managing

449
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:50,150
incidents that the rest of Microsoft in some areas has yet to learn yeah and

450
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:55,550
and keep in mind that Google is not a search engine company Google is an ads

451
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:00,270
company that happens to provide a search engine in order to further their main

452
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:08,220
business and that's similar to us in the fact ads are their revenue and in

453
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:16,420
the large part of my organization that is true as well sure the what I was

454
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:23,540
just saying is that the they detail a review process that they specifically

455
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:34,680
have spawned up to essentially evaluate the goodness or the the goodness of fit

456
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:42,910
for monitors and and they will they will have the authority to remove a

457
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:48,370
monitor from the system hey you know what the last nine times out of ten this

458
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:57,740
thing created noise this bad boy is gone what I have done in is change it to two

459
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:07,130
variables and I call them impact and urgency okay because one of the things

460
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:14,090
where our current system that prevented in it way we had modified or was doing it

461
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:18,650
that your system you don't have a worry about it you you don't yet have to worry

462
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:23,690
about it just remember that the the scale that we're talking about is

463
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:27,650
fundamentally different between unity in in Azure here the number of different

464
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:33,310
teams and I'm red different people it's just a fundamentally different scale but

465
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:40,070
so the the impact is intended to mean like how bad is it okay urgency though

466
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:46,110
is how is was how quickly this someone need to get on it and now the reason why

467
00:48:46,110 --> 00:48:50,830
I wanted to separate those two is because when they were combined together

468
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:56,960
people only got on it when the impact was bad in other words we didn't have

469
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,480
something in the system that said hey this thing went down we better get on it

470
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,600
right now because in the next five minutes we know from the domino chain

471
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,040
in the next five minutes that's going to lead to a major outage someone needs to

472
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,720
get on it right now to prevent an inbound outage not an already occurring

473
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,800
one for sure move it to be more of a preventative thing and we have teams that

474
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:28,800
started using this they're very successful unfortunately it created a

475
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:34,320
confusion because they were like well wait a minute what did you why did you

476
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,840
declare this as a as a seven one when there's only two customers impacted and

477
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,240
they came to us and they're like you guys are breaking the press blah blah blah

478
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:50,000
blah blah and I'm just like nope they are not and I will go to Scott Guthrie

479
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:59,360
if you even hit oh yeah go straight to super God yeah slightly different I

480
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:03,880
think my approach is slightly different but I think the same impact is again

481
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,400
we don't have the scale and when our stuff goes down well some of it can be

482
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,320
really bad but I mentioned these pry two instance or just an operational surprise

483
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:18,200
everything is a pry one by default and the first thing you need to do is prove

484
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,720
that it's not if you're if it's just a learning experience the first thing you

485
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,440
do is prove with data that it's not a pry one we assume everything is urgent

486
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,600
like an operational surprise we have to assume it's a from initially that

487
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,800
it's something we need to jump on and then if someone says oh this isn't that

488
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:41,720
big of a deal the assumed next step is but I'm gonna I'm gonna prove that and

489
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:45,810
then once they've proved yeah this is not a big deal it doesn't impact anyone

490
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:49,650
they can show data to show that and then they can go investigate it at us

491
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:55,650
at a slightly less urgent level so what will happen is what I'm saying is

492
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:59,890
we discover this of the urgency and impact sometimes in that initial

493
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:05,370
investigation there might be an incident that says it starts with installs or

494
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:11,170
down 10% in this region we'll open that as a pry one like well oh this looks like

495
00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:15,790
just an a reporting anomaly prove it yes it is reporting anomaly oh nope

496
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:21,050
reporting is right this is a real big thing so we have to get into the we

497
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:25,770
have to get into the investigation of the incident before we can start we got

498
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:33,170
someplace eventually any final recaps or rebuttals or things I just want to share

499
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:38,850
very quickly so one of the things that I've discovered repeatedly in the in the

500
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:45,170
from reading the post mortems over and over again and I'm actually publicly

501
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:53,290
beginning the question has anyone done any analysis specifically on whether or

502
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:59,840
not the post mortems or even the repairs that were targeted have had an impact

503
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:05,500
because the thing that I've seen over and over again is what's happening with

504
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:13,660
Azure right now is everything is not even the 1% scenario but rather the

505
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:23,020
point point zero one percent scenario right it's the really rare scenarios can

506
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:28,380
have a particularly big impact and because of those we right we have an

507
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:34,340
issue where the repair items in my humble view are unlikely to actually

508
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:42,050
ever be needed again like this incident is unlikely to ever reproduce the the

509
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,890
other thing that we've discovered is one of the major causes is that every

510
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:52,120
single one of the major causes is actually manual intervention that that's

511
00:52:52,280 --> 00:53:02,510
that a developer had no choice but to override an automated system and they did

512
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:08,240
so in there and that's how I'm viewing it like anyone who wants to do a manual

513
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,920
intervention is actually a victim and we need to figure out what broke in the

514
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,520
process when I do retros with teams one of the part of the speech I typically

515
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,440
give at the beginning this isn't about blame not about blah blah blah it's

516
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:29,360
about figuring out what's wrong in the system that enabled this error to occur

517
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:34,810
right all right that's a good way to close it all right good to do that I

518
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:39,450
see you again I think next time we're going two weeks two weeks we have a

519
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:45,240
guest unclear whether they'll allow us to livecast them so I'll keep the

520
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:52,880
channel posted thanks everyone I'm still Alan and I'm Brent or vois
