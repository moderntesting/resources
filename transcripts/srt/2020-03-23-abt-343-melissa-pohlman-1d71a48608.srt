00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the AB Testing 343 podcast, a podcast where we ask one of the three listeners of

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,270
the AB Testing podcast three questions about almost anything.

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,550
ABT 343 is a fun slice of what's going on in the world of modern testing.

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:22,600
Let's get started.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,980
It's been a while, but we're back for another ABT 343.

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,580
And this time I just realized I forgot to ask our guests how to pronounce their last

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,980
name, but I'm going to go with our guests being Melissa Pullman.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,260
You would be correct.

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,060
Awesome.

10
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,980
So I'm good so far.

11
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,340
I haven't screwed up anything too badly so far today.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,300
So welcome.

13
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:42,900
Thank you.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,380
Thank you for having me.

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,340
Luckily, this podcast is always remote.

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,700
We were talking briefly just ahead of me pressing record how great it's been that

17
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,810
Zoom has stayed up and running and how much of our, at least my life is in services

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,290
hosted in places in the cloud.

19
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,370
I don't know where they exist in the real world, but they don't involve people.

20
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:05,810
Yeah.

21
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,650
I also feel thankful that my world doesn't involve people.

22
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:16,010
There's a statement we could take out of context, but yeah, it's been, how are you

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,890
holding up?

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,570
Where are you located?

25
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,450
I am located in Portland, Oregon.

26
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,130
Not too far from here.

27
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,970
How are things in Portland?

28
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,290
How are you holding up with the new world we live in?

29
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,370
Well, it's funny.

30
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:36,570
My coworkers were just chatting about that on Slack and asking, what are the

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,650
weird things you've started doing?

32
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,170
I'm like, I'm just living the same I did a week ago.

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:47,810
So my life's pretty much set up to be okay with self-sufficiency to some extent,

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,890
being a little bit prepared, being a homebody.

35
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,690
So I'm doing okay.

36
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,890
I don't have children.

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,330
So I don't have that added huge amount of stress that a lot of my coworkers have.

38
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,770
And it seems a lot of the other listeners and people who are on the Slack channel

39
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,690
are expressing.

40
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:09,110
So things are okay, but yeah, people, it's a lot of things have slowed down here.

41
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,670
A lot more people walking around during the daytime.

42
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,580
So it feels neighborhoody, but also be nice if it wasn't because of this.

43
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,420
Yes.

44
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,340
I actually have had the exact same experience.

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,300
For me, it's been largely the same.

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:26,140
I've been dealing with a few more coworkers, learning how to work this way.

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,660
And I take the dog for a walk every day and I just see people in their yards and

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,500
people on their porches because the weather has been a little nicer and it feels a

49
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,260
lot more neighborhoody.

50
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,180
We don't walk up and introduce ourselves anymore, but you know, other than that,

51
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,140
well, you'll know each other now, right?

52
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,620
We, we, we wave from afar.

53
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,260
New world.

54
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,050
As you know, AB 2343, we're going to ask one of our three listeners,

55
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,610
three ish questions, but with my tendency to tangent,

56
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,570
it usually ends up being a little bit more, but we'll,

57
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,410
we can go ahead and get started.

58
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:06,570
So maybe a good place to start is, well, first of all, we don't know what you do,

59
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,970
but I want to lead into that.

60
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,570
Like what was your path into testing?

61
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,450
Talk us through a little bit,

62
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,490
how you got from where you were to where you are.

63
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,330
Um, yeah, I got here in a convoluted, disjointed manner.

64
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:27,770
Um, I graduated college many years ago with a undergraduate degree in studio art.

65
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,650
And, uh, I moved to Chicago and worked a couple of years there doing things

66
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,410
that were not going to be long-term sort of career things.

67
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,570
And I felt a little bit more ambitious than that.

68
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,330
So I took some more classes, computer, you know, in the computer science area,

69
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,450
didn't get a degree cause I just got a job instead.

70
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,850
Um, and just kind of learned on the job.

71
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,290
So I've been doing tech, I guess you could say since, who,

72
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,850
God, 19 years now.

73
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:56,290
Wow.

74
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:03,690
So I've done some technical support, um, for small software company I've done.

75
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,570
Uh, and then I started doing, I guess, QA probably about what's it been 13,

76
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,050
but for about 13 years.

77
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,490
So I've, I've really been kind of learning on the job and going to

78
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:19,370
conferences that I was doing a lot of my work in a smaller town here in Oregon.

79
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:24,650
So it wasn't a meetup specifically for, for testing, but at the same time,

80
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,170
I think that was really great because I never worked for a company that had

81
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,490
kind of the old school, like QA team sits over here and does a bunch of

82
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,890
manual testing and then reports back and is the bottleneck.

83
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,650
So I've always been able to work really closely with my development team,

84
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:44,050
small, small teams, kind of understand what they're doing, learned more about

85
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,930
unit testing and kind of the development process and, you know, through those

86
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,770
years of seeing like all the different changes.

87
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,890
So at this point, I'm now working with a small startup and I'm the only QA

88
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,130
person and probably will be the only QA person, uh, when I was interviewing

89
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,770
for my last job, I really wanted to find a company where the development

90
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,930
team understood what quality was.

91
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,250
It wasn't the separate role or the separate person that does this

92
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,200
testing at the end that they're doing a really good job of as far as

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,040
they can with a startup, uh, with their, their side of testing and that I

94
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,080
could help them understand where gaps are missing.

95
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,280
Um, I can help get some of the more front end testing up and running

96
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
where it's needed.

97
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,880
And so that's kind of been my role the past few months and it's been really nice.

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,560
Um, it's, it's great to be with a team that understands kind of what

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,400
they were looking for, didn't have, you know, too many bad experiences

100
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,000
with the whole QA role in the past and, you know, expect me to just

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
do a bunch of manual testing.

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
So, um, I feel like I can really contribute a lot with the team here.

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
So that's where I'm at now.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,600
That's great to hear.

105
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,440
I try not to spend too much talk time talking to myself on these, but I have

106
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,760
a few things to say is interesting parallel.

107
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,080
I don't know if you've, uh, listened to enough or if this even come out

108
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,080
on the podcast, but, uh, I wasn't a studio art major, but I was a music

109
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,560
major in college and then, yeah, if I found my way into tech support and

110
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,200
that's where I learned to test and to program.

111
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,680
And I, that part is very much in parallel.

112
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,960
I also like to hear is that Brent and I often say that we didn't invent

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,120
anything when we started talking about modern testing.

114
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,360
What we did was try and capture what we had seen happening.

115
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,640
The, your story is just yet another example to the many and many out there

116
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,080
of how teams are adapting to delivering quality products in the 21st century.

117
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,280
It would have happened to whether we talked about modern testing or not.

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,640
We're just trying to help people prepare and learn about the changes

119
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,280
that are happening.

120
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
So cool to hear what's going on.

121
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,480
Yeah.

122
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,660
Um, I'm, I'm not going to say it wasn't kind of difficult to find the right,

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,700
the right posting.

124
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,340
Um, I mean, there's still a lot of postings where, you know, it's just,

125
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,500
you're, you're an automation tester 24 hours a day and well, maybe not 24,

126
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,300
eight hours a day, sorry, um, in the role.

127
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,340
And it's like, well, that's not very interesting.

128
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,020
Sure.

129
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,620
I could focus on that for a year, you know, get my skills beefed up in that

130
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,660
area and you know, I was maybe open to that depending on what I found,

131
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:19,780
but this kind of role where I can be more integrated in kind of a bigger

132
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,020
picture, um, is, has always been way more interesting than me.

133
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,780
That's, that's great to hear.

134
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,540
It's fascinating.

135
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,260
I love it.

136
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,220
So just real quick, what is the, are you, can you tell me what company you work

137
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,260
for or what kind of work you're doing?

138
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,380
Is it, is it unannounced?

139
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,940
Is it secret?

140
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,620
Is it government?

141
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,070
No, it's none of those things.

142
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:45,860
Um, um, we are a startup and we are called bumped and, um, we're, we're still

143
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,380
trying to figure out, you know, some growth paths, um, hopefully with the

144
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,980
scaryness going on with the stock market, you know, we were not too

145
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,700
effective, but we are FinTech.

146
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:03,550
Um, so the application at the moment, um, is a mobile mobile app.

147
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:09,430
And basically we want to be able to have anyone be an owner of stock.

148
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,030
And the way we do that is that you will earn stock as kind of a reward,

149
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,590
um, or places you shop.

150
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,350
So, um, it's kind of like a loyalty program, but instead of getting points

151
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,030
or cash, you can actually get stock and feel like you have ownership of the

152
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,190
companies that you're shopping at.

153
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,430
Oh, that's interesting.

154
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,350
Yeah.

155
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,430
So, you know, we're looking on how do we expand it?

156
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,950
How do we, well, also stay afloat, you know, given, given the

157
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,310
times right now, um, we're, we're still hopeful, you know, we're still, we're

158
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,110
still fine.

159
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,410
Um, so, and we've got, you know, really creative people and sales and, you

160
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,890
know, everybody throughout the organization.

161
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,930
And so we'll, we'll see how it goes.

162
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:48,690
Yeah.

163
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,770
This is a great time to buy stock.

164
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,450
It's cheap.

165
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,370
Yeah.

166
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:58,130
I think it'll be even better in the few months, but hopefully not, not too terrible.

167
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:58,610
Yeah.

168
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,610
We, we, we got to keep on trying to find ways to make lemonade out of our

169
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,050
lemons.

170
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,770
Exactly.

171
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,170
Yeah.

172
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,490
And, you know, maybe, you know, once the stock market goes down some more and

173
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,850
you know, if this concept catches on, that will be a really great vehicle for,

174
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,130
you know, people who haven't been doing great to actually get some sort of

175
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,570
asset, um, diversity, um, just from shopping, from poor stuff.

176
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,490
They kind of need every day like gas or groceries.

177
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,650
I love that product today.

178
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,330
That's really cool.

179
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:25,530
Yeah.

180
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,260
You have had an evolution in testing and found what sounds like a really

181
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,020
great role for your experience.

182
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,060
And for, of course, what we talk about on AB testing with modern testing, but I'm

183
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,300
curious, what would you tell people new to a testing role to look for in a job?

184
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,580
Uh, so can I keep it in mind how things have changed?

185
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,660
You may have some good advice there.

186
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,980
Um, yeah, I, I was thinking about this because I, um, was talking to one of my

187
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,100
neighbors recently, you know, given we're seeing folks out and about more

188
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,380
and, um, found out that he is also in testing.

189
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,380
And so we talked recently because he's, he's still pretty new to it and found

190
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,820
out, you know, I'm not so new to it.

191
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,900
And, you know, he, he's in a role where it's more just manual testing.

192
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,540
Nobody on the development team has really talked to him about how to

193
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,580
deploy anything himself for the web app.

194
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:21,410
You know, they have people that are contractors that are offshore.

195
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,740
And so trying to understand like what, what is actually out there has been a

196
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:33,420
little bit harder for him to kind of get into because he's got a very myopic

197
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,660
view of what testing is.

198
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,060
And so, so we were talking about since he's in a web web app thing, you know,

199
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,100
just start small because he, he is seeing like where things are, are kind

200
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,060
of not working and, you know, I encourage people like what are the small

201
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,700
things that you see that you can improve?

202
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,660
Because changing an entire organization is not going to happen.

203
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,820
I've, I've been in many organizations and the bigger it gets, the more

204
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,140
difficult it becomes, because just a huge machine not just it's doing its thing.

205
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,580
But I told them try to get the application up and running, like learn

206
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,660
how your, your code actually works.

207
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,060
How can you deploy it yourself?

208
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,980
How can you get in there and actually see what's happening?

209
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,180
Learning how the calls from the back end are getting made to the front end

210
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,740
and then what data is going back and forth.

211
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,620
What are the tools you can use to inspect those things and, and interact with them.

212
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:28,660
So just trying to get control of as much information on your own so that you can

213
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,380
play around with it because I think at the end of the day, it's really, can you

214
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,140
learn something from it and having that curiosity and doing whatever you can

215
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,100
to get everything so you can do that.

216
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:39,780
Yeah.

217
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,260
I, I like the emphasis on learning and just what I've been having a career

218
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,620
discussions, a lot of my team.

219
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,540
And of course I don't manage.

220
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,820
I have two people who do test coaching, probably a very similar role to yours.

221
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,580
And then I have DevOps teams, of course.

222
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,790
And one of the things for all those people, I, being completely unafraid

223
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:03,350
to learn new things that take on things you don't know how to do is your

224
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,910
key to long-term success.

225
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,470
And I think that's true with, that's more true than ever with testing.

226
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,670
I've done some automation.

227
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,670
I haven't done like a full, like, I'm going to implement this framework and

228
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,710
I'm going to write the, all the tests and support and all of that.

229
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:20,150
But I have enough knowledge to kind of figure it out.

230
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,230
And in this role, I basically came in and did that.

231
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,070
And I wasn't really sure at first, but I figured, well, it's small enough.

232
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:30,390
And there's enough developers to help me that, you know, it'll be fine.

233
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,030
So yeah, don't, don't be afraid to just kind of jump in and figure it out

234
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,020
because every place it's going to be a little bit different, but the more

235
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,580
you do it, the more little things you're going to learn and you can, you

236
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,620
can do it better next time, if you need to do it next time, which you

237
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,300
probably will.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,760
Yeah.

239
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,200
I was just thinking where testing has come from.

240
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Of course the brain is a very good testing tool, but we keep on, you know,

241
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,840
just knowing how to use the, the web debugger, knowing how to make a

242
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,240
simple curl request, learning how to use postman.

243
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,280
If you have APIs, I've attended great workshops and online tutorials on

244
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,480
using postman for exploratory testing of rest endpoints.

245
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,240
And I think that's really fantastic stuff.

246
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:15,960
Oh yeah.

247
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,720
The developers a few jobs ago, like, yeah, we're using this to, you know, test

248
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,400
our endpoints and like, Oh, what is this?

249
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,440
And what are all the endpoints and how do I use it?

250
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,560
And I'm like, Oh, well, I'm going to start sending weird combinations of data.

251
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,080
And Oh, Hey, you're not handling it.

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,960
That's exactly what we should be doing.

253
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Of course, you're talking to your neighbor who you found out was in testing.

254
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,800
And we also talked about the people doing test automation, the automation

255
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,280
tester, which I think is an odd.

256
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,800
I still think today is an odd and even more so today, an odd specialization.

257
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,400
I see it a lot for, I know I see it a lot too.

258
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,760
And, and of course that means they're writing selenium eight hours a day, but

259
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,720
there are some good uses for selenium.

260
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,440
Have you, what's, what's your view?

261
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,440
You've heard my rants and we had hugs on the show last year, but

262
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:17,670
yeah, I, I'm not using too much selenium, but I am having to use Appium, but

263
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,550
I'm using it through webdriver IO.

264
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,990
So it's all kind of the same command.

265
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,510
And I think my team is pretty good about understanding.

266
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:26,470
Yeah, you don't want to write a thousand UI tests.

267
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,910
That's kind of ridiculous.

268
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:34,950
But what we do want to use them for is, uh, for a new web app that we are

269
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:39,030
implementing, we, we need, um, accessibility enabled.

270
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,910
And so my developers are using tools within the front end for the components

271
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,310
and for unit tests to make sure that accessibility rules are being matched.

272
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,990
Um, and then what we can also do just in case something falls through the cracks.

273
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,870
And also because once a page is completely composed, um, we can run the, uh,

274
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,390
ax rule sets and use our selenium, um, tests in order to just hit the different

275
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,590
pages to then call that method to run our rule set and then report back, um,

276
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,790
whether there's anything else that was missing.

277
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,030
So I, I'm, I'm going, I'm hoping, uh, to get that in place in the next few months.

278
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,710
And I think that's going to be very helpful.

279
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,210
The other thing I don't think we're going to probably do any, anytime, anytime

280
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,810
soon is for checking performance front end.

281
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,890
Um, but I think that's probably another good thing to do if you have a lot of

282
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,370
content, um, depending on, I would say probably commercial applications are

283
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,210
probably more important for that to understand when things are loading and in

284
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,850
what order and how, and if it's slowing down kind of your, the user, uh,

285
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,090
interaction, no, that's not the word I'm looking for there.

286
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,490
Anyway, I can't think of it right now because I'm talking a lot and nervous.

287
00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:02,810
So, um, I think, I think using selenium as a way, um, to integrate other tools,

288
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,250
um, but not for functional testing.

289
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,250
Obviously I can definitely agree that is a horrible way to do it.

290
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,330
You get it.

291
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:08,810
You get it.

292
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,330
You get it.

293
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:14,730
And I love the idea of, uh, plugging in the accessibility tool using selenium

294
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,450
just to navigate to the page, because that's not going to break about, or it's

295
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,770
going to break much less often.

296
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:26,010
And then I think on the performance side, you could, you have the performance viewer

297
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,810
in the debugger that shows you what's loading, how long it's taking.

298
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,450
Uh, but even accessing that data automatically.

299
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,490
So you just tell when there's a regression, Hey, all of a sudden it's

300
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,610
taking us 30% more time to load our components.

301
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,770
That's another great thing to do because my stance is I don't hate selenium.

302
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,730
No, no, I think it's overused for the wrong purposes.

303
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,130
But that's another conversation.

304
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,450
Uh, but, oh, I could tell you a story, but I won't tell you a story too.

305
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,210
Uh, the one, the one thing that does make me nervous is that, um, for

306
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,970
mobile apps, like that, that's still really hard.

307
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,010
It's really hard to test them and you still need a lot of, um, UI automation

308
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:15,170
because of all the different versions of, uh, phones and tablets and operating

309
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,570
systems. And so having an automated UI test is still one of those kind of

310
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,810
important things. And then you still have to think about all this data you

311
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,490
need to have in place in order to make sure things are in the right state.

312
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,120
Man, that part, that part's still kind of a beast, but, you know, at

313
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,760
least I don't have to worry about it for the web as much.

314
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,280
It is, but the same rules apply.

315
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,520
I think navigating to make sure the application doesn't crash or black screen

316
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,280
or, or A and R or any of those things that can happen is fine via Appium.

317
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,440
And because you're going to have such different behavior, if you use one of

318
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,160
the services like shoot, there are a bunch of services that give you a

319
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
mobile device test farm.

320
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,440
Oh yeah.

321
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,920
Brothers, staffs, staffs, labs.

322
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,560
Yeah.

323
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,080
And those are helpful to get that coverage because they're all so different.

324
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,080
But again, it loses its value when you start trying to do a whole bunch

325
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,720
of functional automation at that level.

326
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah.

327
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,080
And we have good separation, um, with our, our business logic front end

328
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,840
presentation. So, you know, we, we feel really confident for pretty much

329
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,960
the entire app of, you know, the data we're getting is like, we'll just

330
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,080
display it, you know, we don't have to worry about checking those

331
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,720
sort of things.

332
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,340
So yeah.

333
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,050
What are the challenges?

334
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:33,530
And I'm curious about how you found this role and how you found a team

335
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,130
that supports the role you're in.

336
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:40,770
Because as you know, we're watching the industry change with modern testing,

337
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,770
what, how quality is achieved on a team.

338
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,130
Yeah.

339
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,450
But as we go in that direction, do you have any insights or ideas on how

340
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:54,170
management needs to change or our testing or something about how

341
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,970
testing is managed and what changes you'd want there?

342
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,130
Um, yeah, I'm not sure how I found this team.

343
00:18:59,130 --> 00:18:59,890
It was pure luck.

344
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,930
That's all I'm going to say.

345
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,010
You find you find your own luck.

346
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,410
Yeah.

347
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,050
Good job.

348
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,690
Patient.

349
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,410
Don't don't take that first job that you find because it'll just

350
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,090
end in tears.

351
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,280
No, no, you'll learn a lot.

352
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,620
Yeah.

353
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,900
I, you can, you can cry and learn.

354
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,260
I guess that's true.

355
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,100
That, that, that is something that is pretty, pretty frequent

356
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,860
occurrence for me.

357
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,100
Yeah.

358
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:27,580
I yeah, some of, some of the things I've seen and I, and I think we, you've

359
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,380
talked about it probably in the podcast a lot too is like, there's, there's

360
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:39,040
kind of still a lot of old ideas about testing is this one person does the

361
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,810
thing of testing and it, it seems it's been very difficult for probably even

362
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,660
larger organizations to understand how do you fit in kind of the skills and some

363
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,640
of the specialties of the old idea of that role into an entire team and people

364
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,680
are having a really hard time with it.

365
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,720
Cause like you're saying, there's still this automation tester role out there

366
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,360
and it's very, very specialized.

367
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,360
And why are we not?

368
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,260
And from what I've seen that people, the management management seems to also

369
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,620
have a hard time understanding, well, how do you find like career paths for

370
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,060
these folks and how do you train them?

371
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,980
Because well, they're not developers.

372
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,820
They don't know how to code or they're not DevOps people or, you know,

373
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,100
there, there's like so many of these fuzzy skills that I think it's hard

374
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:32,250
for management to understand how to not have to have a very specific job code

375
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,250
and career path for these people.

376
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:38,090
And for that, I have no idea what needs to change for that.

377
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,690
Maybe not dividing teams up into just development and then just DevOps and

378
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,330
then just like SRE teams is having those truly like fully across functional

379
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,290
teams so that you just have skill sets of people on a team.

380
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,010
And not worry about the titles as much.

381
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:58,170
And I think we ourselves need to train ourselves out of like, here's this

382
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,330
title you have and here's this, you know, career path you can have and just

383
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,330
like, are you engaged?

384
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,450
Are you learning?

385
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,930
And do you feel you're being fairly compensated compared to everybody else?

386
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:13,610
That that's kind of what I kind of how I feel about it.

387
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,850
But I'm also a lot further along in my career than a lot of other folks.

388
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,850
And it's kind of scary to think like, well, how do you get new testers?

389
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,930
Into the job market because they're not necessarily going to have

390
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,730
kind of that broad experience that a team needs to have as well as some of

391
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:31,930
the specialized skills.

392
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:37,220
So that I think that might be worth more thought.

393
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:44,420
Maybe not with me, but maybe in another podcast or folks who are on the Slack

394
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,020
group have any thoughts about that?

395
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,060
Yeah, Brent and I get asked a lot about how does someone starting off

396
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,460
in testing do modern testing?

397
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,180
And the answer is I think they don't.

398
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:04,250
I think the role you're in requires that experience and breadth as your team

399
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,890
grows and as you help them build this.

400
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:08,170
That's right.

401
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:12,330
Principle four nurture and something your culture of quality.

402
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:14,570
I should I should really memorize the principles.

403
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,020
There could be someone from the team that's able ends up being able to coach

404
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,940
quality as well as you can.

405
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:29,860
But I wonder if the path to wonder if I hypothesize and think that perhaps

406
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:35,380
the path to one path to becoming a modern tester or a person in a role

407
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:40,020
like yours is to come from development and really embodied that culture of

408
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:44,100
quality and engineering quality so much so that you can you can lead your

409
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,620
team towards a culture of quality.

410
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,500
Yeah, I don't.

411
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,300
Yeah, I don't feel like I've come from a development role though.

412
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,460
Yeah, and I think another path is but you you were on a team

413
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,140
probably before of testers and you have people to learn from and I think

414
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,260
that's the other path.

415
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,060
I think I'm trying to think if there was a reason I had an opportunity

416
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,740
to hire someone fairly new to the industry into it as a tester.

417
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,660
What things would I look for?

418
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,180
I wouldn't look for their desire to write a lot of automation every day.

419
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:19,140
I would look for a desire to learn that what we talked about before that.

420
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,300
That lack of fear in taking on new things.

421
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,300
Yeah, I definitely ask those questions and interviews.

422
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,210
Yeah, but then if they had people in a quality coach,

423
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,850
quality consultant role around them, they could learn from them and maybe

424
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,890
they're doing a little bit more.

425
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,370
Actually, I don't even they even do a little bit more hands-on testing at the beginning.

426
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,970
I think they probably would have to get the experience to

427
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,890
I think credibility build to talk about it.

428
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,730
Yeah, they have to practice some of those things.

429
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:58,420
But I think in most cases, I would probably I don't know if the path to being this

430
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:02,100
quality testing quality coach begins in testing.

431
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,590
It feels like either you just stick around for a lot of years and you try to learn as

432
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,750
much as possible and take on different roles depending on where you're at or if you need

433
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:18,070
to find a new role or like a larger company has a concept of kind of like this floating role

434
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,510
where you're working with development, you're working with a DevOps team, you're working with

435
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,950
maybe a production support team.

436
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:31,350
And so you're learning all those steps of deployment and production from beginning to end

437
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,910
so that you can get that exposure of that big picture and how things need to fit together

438
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,020
so that you can see kind of what quality really means for a product.

439
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:45,020
And it's not just did you write a thousand tests and they all pass.

440
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:50,220
I think it's a parallel as I mentioned, I manage our I think I mentioned I manage our DevOps teams

441
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,780
in our organization and they have a big impact on quality.

442
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,940
And we hired recently six months ago, a brand new junior, I'll call them,

443
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,060
but brand new developer.

444
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,100
And there's a lot of influence they have.

445
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,380
And the goal of a DevOps team isn't to do all the DevOps stuff because it doesn't exist.

446
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,340
DevOps was really never meant to be a team.

447
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,460
It's a culture, which is the idea.

448
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,780
The problem was the problem that solves is there was a time when services developers would finish

449
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:28,860
stuff and they chuck it over the wall to the operations team who would deploy it and monitor

450
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,420
it.

451
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,260
And they realized that was stupid.

452
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,330
So they came up with this DevOps culture.

453
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,730
And they took teams that were typically infrastructure teams that okay,

454
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:41,210
you're the DevOps team, you're going to help us learn this culture.

455
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,770
I really emphasize with my team that you're and they all get it and I didn't have to tell them

456
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,010
they knew this way I took over the team.

457
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,890
Their role is to help build that DevOps culture.

458
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,090
They're never going to be able to scale to do all the operations work.

459
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,890
They help teams deliver safely and quickly, which is very similar.

460
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,770
We never made that jump in QA or test.

461
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,760
We always had this team who were dedicated to, as you mentioned,

462
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,400
the very beginning to testing and building quality in.

463
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:18,040
And really, I know Lisa Crispin has posted a lot on devtestops.com.

464
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,430
And there's this, which is bringing test into DevOps, but which I don't mind.

465
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,790
But in a way, DevOps includes testing and quality.

466
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:32,710
It's about getting rid of the walls that make sure a role is going to do one thing

467
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,830
in delivering software.

468
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:38,500
I think a lot of people still don't understand the testing part of DevOps.

469
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,900
I mean, it's great.

470
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,300
Bring that concept in for beyond initiated.

471
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,720
But yeah, I've seen good and bad things.

472
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,160
I've worked with really great people that know all of this,

473
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,280
but maybe we're stuck in a company culture where we can't actually do the right thing.

474
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,960
And it's frustrating and you're trying to swim upstream against it.

475
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,560
But you do what you can and for as long as you can.

476
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,190
You're not making things worse, I guess.

477
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,860
Right.

478
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,860
In a role like yours, you're trying to help the team improve testing and quality and helping

479
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,140
them just improve.

480
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:24,600
And you end up bouncing around between a lot of different hats of coach and program manager

481
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:30,040
and therapist and tester and everything you can do to help the team to deliver quickly and safely.

482
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,440
Yeah, it's still really difficult because

483
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:38,500
having this type of role, it still feels like your voice gets a bit diluted

484
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,180
at times because you can't be in all those places all at the same time.

485
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:50,180
And so I think if people are looking at staying in this sort of role that you need to really look

486
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:56,420
for a team that already understands this and that you're not constantly having to follow up

487
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:02,820
and like, hey, did you push back when we're trying to deliver too quickly?

488
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:09,540
Did you make sure that the testing requirements and what are we looking for in terms of monitoring

489
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,940
and metrics at the end of this, have those been set in place and do we need to build tools for that?

490
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:19,220
Like, have all those things been discussed and you alone won't be able to just constantly be

491
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,060
screaming into the void and hopefully somebody hears you, you have to have a team that already

492
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,300
supports it. So it's kind of this weird chicken and egg thing. Like, yeah, we need the quality

493
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,780
coach, but we also need a team that already understands most of these things already.

494
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,900
It's more like you're just kind of like tapping people on the shoulders, hopefully the good angel

495
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,340
to tell them, yep, you're doing a good job. Yeah, don't forget to do this. Okay, yeah,

496
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,780
we're still on the right path and keeping the team steered in the right direction, I guess,

497
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,700
rather than having to pull them out of the mud.

498
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,460
Yeah, it's hard to jump into that role when they don't know they need you yet.

499
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:04,020
Exactly. Yeah. And it can be very demoralizing. I know I'm talking about the right thing because I

500
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,900
know we need to do this and people kind of nod and agree, but then don't take the action.

501
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:16,460
I've been there too and don't be discouraged. Just keep doing the right thing.

502
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:23,100
Yeah, I have so many questions and comments, but I think we better wrap up.

503
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:29,020
All right. This has been, thank you again for being honest, it's been a pleasure talking with

504
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:35,980
you and learning from you. Anytime. I hope my experience is encouraging that it's not all,

505
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,130
a bunch of people just writing UI tests all day.

506
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,050
No, I think, you know, keep fighting the good fight. Definitely stay healthy out there and

507
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,410
and keep learning, keep being unafraid. Absolutely.

508
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:55,290
Being unafraid to learn. Yeah, not a problem. Thank you again. And I'll get this posted by

509
00:29:55,290 --> 00:30:02,490
Monday and our listeners can hear how awesome you are. I hope they agree. Thanks again for having me.
