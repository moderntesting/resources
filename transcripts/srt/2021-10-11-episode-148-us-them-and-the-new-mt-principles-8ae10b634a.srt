00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,460
Welcome to AB Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,980
Now, on with the show.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,390
Hey everybody.

6
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,420
Howdy.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,420
It's Alan.

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,650
Hi Alan.

9
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:33,650
And we're here for episode 148 of the PBS Sponsor AB Testing Podcast.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,010
I'd like you to all just get out your donor cards.

11
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,890
Now, this is the AB Testing Podcast and you never know what kind of intro you're going to

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:45,890
get.

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,700
And I guess most of you listen past the first, most of you fast forward past this part anyway.

14
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,140
So whatever, whatever.

15
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,140
Episode 148.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,140
Yay.

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,140
Yay.

18
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,860
To be clear, because I don't want lawyers contacting us later.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,780
We are not actually sponsored by PBS.

20
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,780
We are not.

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,740
We are sponsored by no one.

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:11,780
Occasionally, occasionally we will do a sponsorship, but somebody would believe in.

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,860
Although I guess we could have just hidden behind.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,580
No, no, no, not that PBS.

25
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,980
The other PBS.

26
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,980
Oh.

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,980
Yeah.

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm so confused.

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,060
So PBS is just an acronym, right?

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:26,740
And we could have just made it up.

31
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
Anyway, nevermind.

32
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,740
Let's move forward.

33
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,540
Hey, what's on the agenda, Alan?

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,820
Hey, I don't know.

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,180
Let's figure it out as we go.

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,900
We're going to do a very agile and virgin adaptive agenda that I just paid up.

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
Yay.

38
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,940
Yay.

39
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,140
Let's do this.

40
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,980
So what, let's start with what's new with you.

41
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,100
Wouldn't it be cool if I had a theme song for like, like a segment, but this is the what's

42
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,220
new with you segment.

43
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,220
Yeah.

44
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,140
We used to, when did we give it up?

45
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,140
Oh, right.

46
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
COVID probably.

47
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,170
Right.

48
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,250
Cause remember we used to have sort of a made up segment on where in the world is

49
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,250
Oh yeah.

50
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,770
Cause I don't go anywhere anymore.

51
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:14,550
I don't, well, actually, yeah, I don't do conferences, but I have the most massively globally distributed

52
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,790
team right now.

53
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,670
We just, I can talk about it now because we're going to make the announcement by the

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,350
time this goes out, but we are moving another large part of unity into my org, my org.

55
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,390
Let me see if I can remember here.

56
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,190
Cause we have some one-offs.

57
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:39,710
So right now my org is Sia Bellevue, of course, San Francisco, Austin, Texas, Montreal, Boston.

58
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:47,470
I also have some remote folks in Vermont and Colorado and Denver and Pittsburgh in the

59
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,470
US.

60
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,910
I think that covers the US.

61
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:57,150
Once we get to Europe, I have Brighton, England and a home of the ministry test.

62
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,230
Hey everybody.

63
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,580
And also in Edinburgh, Scotland.

64
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,320
I need to make a map on my wall.

65
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,820
So I remember, let me go elsewhere in Europe.

66
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:14,840
Of course Helsinki, Copenhagen, as I mentioned, anybody else, I have a one-off person in Belgium.

67
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,200
I feel like I, oh, Lithuania, Vin Vildnius.

68
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,080
All places I haven't been in a very long time.

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,680
And a few places like Lithuania have never been to.

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,000
I think maybe that's it for my team.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,560
I think maybe that's it.

72
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,320
But there may be a few other places.

73
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,960
Anyway, that's it.

74
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,080
Your team, I believe, well, no, I know this to be true, is larger than mine and I believe

75
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
significantly so.

76
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
Yeah.

77
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,960
With this new reorg, it's about 200.

78
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,440
So you're only one order of magnitude larger than me.

79
00:03:49,440 --> 00:04:00,430
But I have, my team of 10 is now in four distinct locations.

80
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,270
So one bit of growing pain worth mentioning as part of that is just to a thing, because

81
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,150
a lot of this growth has happened in the last six months.

82
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,540
And for the first time in my, since I've realized how important one-on-ones are, I

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,260
am now unable to do, you know, up until six months ago, I had regular one-on-ones with

84
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,260
every single person in my org.

85
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,140
I cannot do that with 200 people, not even close.

86
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:32,100
My schedule will be busy enough just meeting with the leads, the people managers across

87
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,380
the yard, which I find, which I will do that.

88
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,380
Those are important.

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,300
But yeah, it's a lot of peeps, a lot of things for me to learn and do.

90
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,780
Not, I mean, you won't be able to do it at all.

91
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,810
No, all.

92
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,810
Because your org is pretty flat.

93
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,530
I can't meet with everyone.

94
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,410
I can't do skip level one-on-ones with everyone on a regular basis, but I will spot check in

95
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,730
and there's some people I'll meet with.

96
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,330
I'll figure it out.

97
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,330
Wow.

98
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,470
Yeah, that's, that's to me, that's meaningful.

99
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,150
I don't know if it's good or bad.

100
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,710
I mean, it is what it is, right?

101
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,710
It is.

102
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,830
And I can do some things like some, we have a pretty, we do some things to promote transparency.

103
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,910
We have every other week, we have a team, all hands.

104
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,270
I just call it my team biweekly.

105
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,670
It's all about just transparency.

106
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,470
How decisions are being made.

107
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,990
Just let them know what's going on.

108
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:25,620
But I could also do some smaller group sort of roundtables just to have a chance to chat

109
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,020
with people, listen to them, see what's on their mind, take questions.

110
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
There's some things I'll do.

111
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:36,900
I do find a lot of value in having a personal connection with everyone in the org.

112
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,450
It's just going to take a while with this rapid growth.

113
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,130
Anyway, that's where, that's the org stuff.

114
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,010
There's some other stuff that's really cool to share that I can't quite share on the podcast

115
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,250
yet, but wait till next week.

116
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,410
That's the way we get listeners to come back.

117
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,970
I will have a really cool announcement next week about modern testing.

118
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,970
Yeah.

119
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,690
The cliffhanger is supposed to happen at the end of the show.

120
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:04,690
Good.

121
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,690
Now you told them, yeah.

122
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:11,130
We don't have a plan already mentioned it.

123
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,130
Oh, you know what?

124
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,290
In the, we're in the world thing.

125
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:18,530
I did agree to do a webinar coming up in January.

126
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,780
So I have time to prepare for it with our buddies over at practice test.

127
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,420
Oh, so I'm going to do that.

128
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,100
I don't know what on yet, but I'm going to figure it out and we're going to figure it

129
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
out.

130
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,300
Like we always do on this show, but not today.

131
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,460
I do.

132
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,460
I think that's it.

133
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,900
Any other cool stuff?

134
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,100
It's getting cold out.

135
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
All that stuff.

136
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,140
I want to talk about Twitter.

137
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,860
No, what I want to talk about.

138
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,900
I want to get the Twitter first.

139
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,920
For those of you that are still addicted to Facebook, it was probably nice having it gone

140
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,040
for a day last week.

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,100
That was cool.

142
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,210
And then not cool having it come back.

143
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,490
Somebody wrote up, I read an article.

144
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,190
It's in my five for Friday.

145
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:03,930
Someone wrote a plugin, a Chrome plugin that deleted that unfollowed everyone by default.

146
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,450
And I don't, I deleted my Facebook account quite a while back.

147
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:12,170
Their newsfeed by people just scrolling through that doom, scrolling through Facebook and

148
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,890
micropayments makes billions of dollars, but it's all filled with crap.

149
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,490
So he wrote a plugin that unfollowed everyone.

150
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,650
So your newsfeed was blank.

151
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:26,570
You could still find your, you could still go to your friend's page and see what they

152
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,570
posted.

153
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:28,890
You just wouldn't go up in your newsfeeds.

154
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:35,930
He just didn't have a newsfeed and Facebook not only made him delete the plugin with a

155
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,610
cease and desist.

156
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:45,500
They banned him from Facebook and Instagram for life, which seems like an asshole move.

157
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,020
Does this plugin still work?

158
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,300
Like can I go?

159
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,900
Yeah, his plugin is gone, but it still works.

160
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,460
The zip files are available.

161
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,860
If you know how to look for archives of things.

162
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,600
Gotcha.

163
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,000
So you can, you can still install it.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Just have to do it manually.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,280
You can't do it from the Chrome store.

166
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,440
And you know, some people go, oh, I need my, I need to see my, my memes telling me why

167
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,680
I don't need the vaccine.

168
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,060
Well, for you folks, just, I don't want to go there.

169
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,060
So anyway, that happened.

170
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,340
And then the Twitch Twitch, uh, we're actually having an account, but I, I think I created

171
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
it when I was drunk.

172
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,620
So it was a username and never used anywhere with a password.

173
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
I didn't even know.

174
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,120
Thank God for password managers, but did you hear what happened to Twitch?

175
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
No, I did not.

176
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
Oh my God.

177
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,970
Everything got dumped.

178
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:46,010
Source code, payouts, everything as was hackers got the entire like, oh, drag, they drag and

179
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,010
drop everything.

180
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,350
All of Twitch's internal shit onto the internet, all kinds of badness.

181
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,510
I assume at least the passwords were hash, but yeah, bad, bad day to be a Twitch employee.

182
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,430
And I was going somewhere with that, but I don't remember when, but I do want to talk

183
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:01,790
about Twitter now.

184
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,790
So I said Twitter.

185
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,230
I thought of Twitch, then it went back to Facebook, all kinds of stuff.

186
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,310
There's this agile consultant.

187
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,790
I follow on Twitter.

188
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,030
His name is Alan Holub.

189
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:17,630
And he is a no nonsense sort of guy.

190
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,270
And I, a lot of this stuff is very modern testing.

191
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:25,750
I don't think he, some people even bring out modern testing and replies to his tweets.

192
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,190
I don't think he really knows what it is.

193
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,430
And that's okay.

194
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,070
Because again, we're not trying to sell or make a new thing that people can think about.

195
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,150
We're just trying to find a way to describe some things that are already happening.

196
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,510
So he had one today.

197
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:45,550
No, no, two days ago, the notion of testers not being devs is odd to me.

198
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,550
Testing must be automated.

199
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,430
Can you see the triggers for people?

200
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,590
Isn't writing an automated test coding?

201
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,830
Somebody who can't code can't create tests at all.

202
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,790
If they can code up a test, they can code up anything.

203
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,030
There are no testers, just devs who understand testing.

204
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,350
Okay.

205
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,430
That's that stirs it up better than we do.

206
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,830
Right?

207
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:06,790
Yeah.

208
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:12,230
I mean, well, so we want to inspire a conversation.

209
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,400
Like there's, there's nothing to what he said to me.

210
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
I'll put it this way.

211
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,760
No, uh, cause we're recording.

212
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,120
So I can't put it that way.

213
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,760
There is a element that we constantly look in terms of traditional testing that is

214
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,720
still holding on with white knuckles.

215
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
A little bit, a little bit.

216
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,040
Yeah.

217
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,400
I mean, there is a lot bit.

218
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:46,070
There is a, I'll say a hype, a hyperbole, written, highly vocal element of

219
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:50,030
leadership in the traditional mentality.

220
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,630
Alan kinda in terms of what you just read, it kind of reads like that same sort of

221
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,270
assertiveness on an in a modern testing site as well.

222
00:10:59,310 --> 00:10:59,510
Yeah.

223
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,790
And I want to read a couple of their replies because they reek of these are

224
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,470
what I like about it is it reeks of modern testing without these people

225
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,030
knowing what modern testing is and more and more again, back at test bash me

226
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,030
first finished the principles.

227
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,710
I talked about them.

228
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,190
I was worried.

229
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,390
People said, Oh my God, you have a name for what we're already doing.

230
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,110
I had a feeling we just didn't know.

231
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,310
But more and more it's happening.

232
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,390
And unfortunately people needed to hear that to listen to our podcast.

233
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,110
But one of the first replies on that was someone saying, I literally had this

234
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:34,670
conversation yesterday asking to replace the expected test timer in our headcount

235
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:40,310
estimate in a for a project team with a dev with automated test experience, which

236
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,590
is what I would rather hire anyway.

237
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,710
Anyway, a bunch of, a bunch of nuggets since I found the thread like he's, I

238
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,950
don't read my people probably know that or I've noticed I'm not on Twitter as

239
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,310
much these days, but someone tagged me into one of into this thread somewhere,

240
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,990
some other thread and bringing up modern testing and it's worth checking out.

241
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,550
And of course, as you imagine, someone jumped in and talked about checks

242
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,070
and his answer, I was about to ask.

243
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,990
And his answers, as you'd expect from anyone experienced in the industry who

244
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,070
didn't go, isn't part of that doctor nation.

245
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,950
He said WTF for those that doesn't make any sense.

246
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:20,630
Yeah.

247
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,030
What?

248
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:21,750
Yeah.

249
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,870
You're enough on that subject.

250
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,350
I get why are the distinctions there?

251
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,270
I think people are using it as a weird weapon to gatekeeping.

252
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,910
That's stupid.

253
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,350
I like seeing modern testing in the wild.

254
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,990
I didn't find his exact thread.

255
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:42,630
I found the comment that your talks talk about, but yeah, there's a lot of,

256
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:47,550
I'll just say it the last, for lack of a better word, just glancing through his

257
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,830
Twitter feed, there's a lot of, um, me too isms that are, that are rising for me.

258
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:59,070
Overreliance on manual testing is the symptom of culture smell.

259
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,390
I totally agree with that.

260
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,270
I totally do too.

261
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:09,270
I am part of a org where despite having dedicated Estettes, the entire org,

262
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,110
uh, which you remember when we thought that was a good idea.

263
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,790
At the time, I guess in the context of our ship cycle and the way we made software,

264
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,310
it was, cause we had the test quality in, but to see it today, it just doesn't make

265
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,030
any sense to me.

266
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:23,350
It doesn't to me.

267
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:35,890
Orgs, this person who wrote this tweet today say that a term I haven't thought

268
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:43,130
of in years, like their whole org of 190 people, including a dedicated team of

269
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:45,970
Estettes will do a test bash.

270
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,920
And I'm like, wow, it doesn't mention what industry they're in.

271
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,720
There are certainly places where, uh, oh, it's funny.

272
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,520
So one person came back.

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,280
He's like, thanks dude.

274
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
It replied to that tweet.

275
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,760
Thanks.

276
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm now having PTSD flashbacks.

277
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,000
Like, yeah, that that's an alignment to what I'm, to what I'm thinking of.

278
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,200
Yeah.

279
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,320
This guy, this guy seems in alignment.

280
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,000
They completely agree.

281
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,560
Yeah.

282
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,840
But there's a lot of people.

283
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,000
He's, he's like the meaner version of me.

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,320
I'm going to read you one more.

285
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,120
Then I want to talk about why I think this is important.

286
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,680
This is happening.

287
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,640
Just realize that there is a point of misunderstanding regarding testing.

288
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,600
I am not talking about UI automation, but I talk about automated testing.

289
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
Selenium is a disaster.

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm talking about tests run automatically by the CICD system run

291
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,280
without human intervention.

292
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,840
And again, this is the whole me saying something like that is what got

293
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,480
Jason on our podcast.

294
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,800
And I think we actually reached a weird place of agreement where.

295
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,320
Selenium is a, it's a blessing and a curse.

296
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,800
It works.

297
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,880
And the reason we need to use it is because reason, not we, the

298
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,640
reason teams often need to use it is because one and most importantly,

299
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,960
their application, their web app, their testing has been architected and

300
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,160
designed so poorly that UI automation is the only place they have to test it.

301
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,200
The developers are working so fast and are counting on a test team to

302
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,040
test their stuff.

303
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,160
So people have to use selectors from hell trademark in order to

304
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,560
make their goofy automation work.

305
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,640
So the tool is fine.

306
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,480
The work is that I, I commend Jason and everybody that's worked on web

307
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,800
driver to make it work over time.

308
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:45,170
As I've said before, I think the no code, you, a automation tools are much

309
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,730
better for that because it just doesn't, I wouldn't put as much effort into that.

310
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,970
We've rehashing stuff.

311
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,570
I've said before, I try and say it nicely.

312
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,450
He just gets right to the point and I kind of like it.

313
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,570
Yeah, I, I do too.

314
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,170
The one thing like that you were just talking about that reminded me of

315
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,370
systems theory, something we're fond of, right?

316
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:10,330
The, one of the problems though with systems theory is that there's actually

317
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:19,300
a theory within systems theory and that as you change the system to, to

318
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,940
actually solve a problem and then forgetting, I'm paraphrasing of course.

319
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,180
But that the, the number of problems stays constant.

320
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:36,100
So, so for example, I'll give you a favorite example, email, right?

321
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,700
When, when email first got constructed, it solved the problem of

322
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:48,020
communication between in or reducing the calendar time between communication

323
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,260
on individuals, right?

324
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,420
That was fantastic.

325
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,140
But now everybody and their brother send me communication.

326
00:16:55,140 --> 00:17:00,700
So previously, previously it was a snail mail and the stamp was a good

327
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,460
filter to prevent people from trying to contact me.

328
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,040
You know, certain people I don't really care to or, or right now I'm

329
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,480
thinking about all the slews of people that keep trying to come and

330
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,440
bring me more work.

331
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:23,280
Email solved a problem, but then it constructed a whole new problem because

332
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,160
email was successful in solving the problem it was intended to solve.

333
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,760
And to me, like the example that we were just talking about is related to that.

334
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:38,730
I am reading one of his tweets now.

335
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,690
I'm, I'm gonna change the topic.

336
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,930
The, well, kinda.

337
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,130
Well, I have, I have a tangential topic after this as well, but you can, go ahead.

338
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,450
Good.

339
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,490
Did you do you.

340
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,730
So here's a question I'm thinking of it that he asked.

341
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,810
He asked the question, is there an adjective to put in front of the word test

342
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:02,690
that describes all testing except exploratory and usability testing?

343
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,970
And I'm guessing he's in response to like the.

344
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:06,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

345
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,090
You know, what's going on there.

346
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,010
So yeah, the word test evidently doesn't mean test anymore.

347
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:17,930
Well, it, unfortunately it doesn't in a, in a small part of the community and whatever,

348
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,570
but my big realization, I followed him for a while, but just as these threads of

349
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:27,530
the last couple of days, like, Oh my God, he is, he is modern testing incarnate.

350
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,130
And he doesn't know anything about modern testing, which is great.

351
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,730
Which again, gets me to the fact that if, and when I'm doing, of course,

352
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,210
I'm doing a webinar for practice test.

353
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,810
I'm trying to figure out the right way to talk about modern testing

354
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,250
with a non testing audience.

355
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,160
Example, he speaks of some arc, a lot of architecture conferences, but I'm

356
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,760
going to architecture conference or a, uh, DevOps conference or an

357
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,560
infrastructure conference, pardon me.

358
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,630
Thinks it like there'll be such does like, why'd you put a name on something?

359
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,110
We already know if we talk about modern testing, that it would

360
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,650
be the wrong topic, that maybe it's an aside.

361
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,330
I'm just trying to figure out how to.

362
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,170
When I read his tweets and see tweets like this, what I think is, and what

363
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:23,330
I always think it's not like I want to have 10,000 listeners for the podcast,

364
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,530
but I think there are people that do not know about our podcasts.

365
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,170
I could listen to it.

366
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:28,850
So let's do this.

367
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,810
I don't know the answer listeners do this talk about the podcast with

368
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,290
people who aren't testers and see what they think, see if they want to check

369
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,930
it out, give us reviews and blah, blah, blah.

370
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:43,650
Uh, that's, that's the sort of thing I'm realizing that with modern testing,

371
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,230
that there's just more and more things that are happening that are modern

372
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,910
testing without knowing about modern testing, which is really, really cool.

373
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,670
And I want to see more of that.

374
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,710
Oh, I love this guy.

375
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:55,910
Right.

376
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,630
So there, he has a tweet a while back where he takes a nice dig on safe.

377
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,790
So, uh, just, just keep that in mind too.

378
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:05,870
So they will, we'll talk about that in a future episode.

379
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,110
And I just tweaked my cable.

380
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:08,710
Yeah.

381
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,070
I was leaning back and my camera cable.

382
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,190
This should have been a YouTube broadcast, but oh well.

383
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,670
Yeah.

384
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,190
So tell me what you think of this phrase.

385
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:26,510
He says, knowing already upfront manual testing for final released is usually

386
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,830
a band aid over bad architecture.

387
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:33,690
I have yet to see a situation where people claim that manual testing was

388
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,290
indispensable where you couldn't change the architect to support automated

389
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:42,250
testing inside the CI CD pipeline.

390
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:47,150
So going back to your other things, going back to your last thing, you

391
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:52,550
know, how would you, how would you, how would you reach the, the dev

392
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,790
audience with this modern testing console?

393
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,790
What I'm trying to decide is whether they need, you know what the devs that

394
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,870
need to hear this or not this guy, it's the devs that think they need

395
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,110
a test team in order to deliver.

396
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,660
It's the developers who do not think they have the knowledge or the

397
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,580
permission to test their product.

398
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,180
Yeah.

399
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:21,070
I'm, I'm remembering back to the episode we did several years ago.

400
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,010
Oh yeah.

401
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,250
Good old episode 30, 70 something.

402
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
Are you being snarky or do you actually know totally snarky.

403
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,040
All right.

404
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,240
The one at Evans company.

405
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,200
Oh, at redfin.

406
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,040
Yeah.

407
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,520
Thank you.

408
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,240
Uh, I knew it was red something, but I kept on going.

409
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,400
You'd be testing live from the redfin auditorium.

410
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,160
Right.

411
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,820
And for some reason, my head couldn't let go that the name of the

412
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,700
company was red Zillow, even though I knew like there's no company called red

413
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,220
Zillow.

414
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:53,980
Okay.

415
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,780
There is revzilla who sells motorcycle equipment, but anyway, go on redfin.

416
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,300
Right.

417
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:05,280
Evan, the audience, the audience, the audience you would need to reach

418
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,880
is exactly that it.

419
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,360
And we like, that was that company at that time, they had separate Dev and

420
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,800
tests and what we wanted to do was speak to the Dev because, and I actually, I

421
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,760
think that's a really smart idea.

422
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:26,720
Cause if there is a way that we could reach that crowd and convert them.

423
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,540
Cause a lot of the times we hear that a lot of that a lot, like modern testing

424
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,100
resonates with a lot of testers, right?

425
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,460
A lot of them.

426
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:47,380
The reality is most from my experience, most test teams as an organization is,

427
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,740
is low man on the discipline pole.

428
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,870
Yeah.

429
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,990
Right.

430
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:56,150
It, they, they, they often do not have, it's not entirely the case, but they

431
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,590
often do not have the political clout to initiate change.

432
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,900
Dev is at the top of it.

433
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,740
How do you influence those folks?

434
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:12,290
I've come up with a lot of techniques as have you around basically

435
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,450
forcing functions to do this.

436
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:20,170
But my techniques have, have relied on me knowing full well, what power I have.

437
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,850
For example, I know I own that.

438
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,490
I own the resource allocation of the people on my team.

439
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:28,530
All right.

440
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,970
You don't want to play ball with modern testing.

441
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,530
Guess who just, who just lost all of their testers.

442
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:36,610
Right.

443
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,730
So let me, I have a, I have a thought exercise.

444
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,130
It's going to take a little bit of time here.

445
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,170
There's a good segue here.

446
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:50,210
So when we wrote the modern testing principles and honestly, it's still

447
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,770
kind of blows me away that one.

448
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,890
I was inspired to do so in the first place to make the draft in the first place,

449
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,130
but how little they've changed.

450
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,610
We thought maybe we'd modify more, but also how often they're referred to.

451
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,290
But we wrote them for testers.

452
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:11,970
The audience of the modern testing principles were testers.

453
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,610
Yep.

454
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,530
And I want to look at these one by one.

455
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,560
And I'm curious if there's a rewording we would do for developers.

456
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,560
So for number one, I think it stays the same.

457
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,720
Our priority is improving the business.

458
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,270
Yes.

459
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:27,950
That's good.

460
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,870
That's good for anyone.

461
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,070
That's not tester centric.

462
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:36,590
The next one is we accelerate the team and use models, blah, blah, blah,

463
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,550
to identify our prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks in the system.

464
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,630
Who's we in this case?

465
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:46,370
Is it everyone who's who's the we in that sentence?

466
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,330
We were when we wrote it, we were targeting testers.

467
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,250
That's what I just said.

468
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:53,650
Yes.

469
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,410
But as written, does it, does it target the whole team now?

470
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,970
Or would we tweak?

471
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,450
We're not saying we're going to change these, but it will be tweak.

472
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:03,890
Where is this?

473
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,370
If these were for developers?

474
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:06,370
Yeah.

475
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:11,050
So, so I put my, my old dev hat on.

476
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,420
Right.

477
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:19,100
And, and then that was like my, my, what I drew from to help craft these.

478
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:19,940
Right.

479
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,340
And I would say, oh yeah, that's exactly what we did.

480
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,140
Yeah.

481
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:32,620
My, my team did that accelerate in principle to came from accelerate the

482
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,260
shipment of the really simple quality, right?

483
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,380
Achievement of quality.

484
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,660
So I wonder if I'm not going to try and get these perfect, but if we just

485
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:46,500
said we use models like lean thinking, blah, blah, blah, then that can

486
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,860
become the whole team a little easier.

487
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,780
Let me look at them.

488
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,620
No, no, but, but that statement, that statement is true.

489
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,100
Period.

490
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,860
Whole team dev test PM that that team, maybe you're right.

491
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,940
I think let me look at the next one.

492
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,940
I think you're right.

493
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,100
We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and

494
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,460
optimize in order to succeed.

495
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,500
This one's a little interesting.

496
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,540
There's a we, then there's helping the team.

497
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,620
So we are helping the team.

498
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,050
So if the team is we that reads weird.

499
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:21,970
Well, maybe because I don't think it's a separation.

500
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:27,650
I think, no, I think what if we change the, to our, we're a force for continuous

501
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:32,490
improvement, helping our team adapt and optimize order to succeed rather than

502
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,130
providing a safety net to catch pillars.

503
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,010
Again, that clause at the end, that's about testers.

504
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,290
Yes.

505
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:44,090
So if we said something like we are a force for continuous improvement, helping

506
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:50,330
the helping our team adapt and optimize in order to succeed rather than relying

507
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,210
on safety notes to catch features.

508
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,230
Uh, I would even say even more proactively something along the lines

509
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,980
of actively removing safety nets.

510
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,340
Oh yeah.

511
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,940
And right now people are freaking out.

512
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,340
Don't change the principles.

513
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,420
And we're not going to right away, but there's something I thought about

514
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,940
for a while to dove tails in here.

515
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,180
I want it to be, I'm going to be like, I've gone on these adventures with

516
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,940
Alan in the past, just be absolutely clear.

517
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,740
We are on path to change the principles.

518
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,460
This is, it's an unavoidable path.

519
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,580
It is going to happen.

520
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,780
I cannot tell you when, but the three will speak.

521
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:38,380
And I got to say, if you're on my team listening to this, this is the way I do

522
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,940
things I, I don't dictate change.

523
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,780
I put the wheels in motion for change to happen.

524
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,500
And I'll do that a lot.

525
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,540
I don't like, I don't make very many decisions for my team has a discussion

526
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,700
before, but I make sure we have the right discussion so they figure out

527
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
what change needs to happen.

528
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,900
So, okay.

529
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,460
So let me tell you putting my dev head on reading and rereading this again.

530
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,180
Like previously I was, I was doing modern test manager versus traditional

531
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,660
test manager when we did this.

532
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,340
Yes, of course.

533
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,340
Now putting on, you know, manager of a dev team where I did not have a test

534
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,860
team that was successful.

535
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,420
What did we do?

536
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:21,580
Right.

537
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:30,500
And this one was about number one, the lean principle known as optimize the whole.

538
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:30,780
Yes.

539
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:35,620
In other words, you don't try to optimize what does it take to get to, to

540
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,420
co-complete and then what is it?

541
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,540
What does it take to get the test complete?

542
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:47,300
You optimize the whole system in that, which is how do we release this whole

543
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,980
thing in the end, the fastest?

544
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,740
Cause that that's what, that's how you get the trade-off discussions between things.

545
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,140
Yeah.

546
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:00,380
So the safety net is to catch failures, right?

547
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:05,460
This is the old school mentality around everything must be that if you're not

548
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,340
trying to prevent things, you're doing things wrong.

549
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,180
Right.

550
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:14,760
As a lot of the times, as we've discussed, CICD or, uh,

551
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,460
flighting systems with, uh, an appropriate, uh, flight controller that evaluates

552
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,860
risk before going out more and more broadly, these are actually better

553
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,100
systems that to help you avoid waste.

554
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,380
Now I'm looking at, so when I look at this, the other thing I see that's

555
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:43,420
in this is, is an element of learning slash scaling.

556
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,940
If there's a focus on the end goal KPIs, not the intermediary ones,

557
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,100
that's what we're trying to improve.

558
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:56,140
And then there's a focus on helping the whole team learn what

559
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:58,140
the whole team needs to learn.

560
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,100
Right.

561
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,410
So to me, it also kind of kills siloism.

562
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,010
Yeah.

563
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,650
As written, there's a little bit of us and them in the principles,

564
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,570
which I don't think is the right thing for the long-term.

565
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:17,410
I want to read the next one to you in the new form in a potential.

566
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,530
There's a draft.

567
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:26,010
We care deeply about the quality culture of our team and we coach lead

568
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,010
and nurture each other towards a more mature quality culture.

569
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,460
I replaced the team with each other.

570
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,340
No, I like, I like that algorithm already.

571
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,350
Cause again, that's around, there's two aspects of that now.

572
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:49,540
It's around, I don't know if you, if I've ever walked you through

573
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,340
when I'm doing a kickoff for agile, right?

574
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,220
When I'm, when a team's asked me to come and teach them agile,

575
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,100
it hasn't happened in years.

576
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:04,380
But one of the things I describe is actually agile is a team sport.

577
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,020
It's closer to soccer.

578
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,080
Galah though.

579
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:10,840
Right.

580
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,180
It's closer to soccer in my mind than it is rugby.

581
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,200
Right.

582
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,400
In, in soccer.

583
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,960
And I think I've told you this, I don't know about this.

584
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeah.

585
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,920
I'm, I'm huge on the whole soccer strategy thing.

586
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,800
We've talked about this.

587
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,040
Yeah.

588
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
Well, but not on air, maybe go ahead.

589
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,160
Yeah.

590
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:34,360
I'll just say years ago, I had an employee that was in a, a

591
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,160
competitive corporate league.

592
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,000
Okay.

593
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,560
And they got to play at what was then called Century Link field.

594
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,840
And it's now called Loomin field.

595
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,640
Yeah.

596
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,480
It's Seahawks stadium, whatever.

597
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,640
Um, Loomin field sounders play there too.

598
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,600
Anyway, go on.

599
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,380
Um, it was interesting cause that was the first time I had ever been in

600
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,580
the been in that stadium where you get actually here.

601
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,170
Oh yeah.

602
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:04,450
Yeah.

603
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:05,490
Okay.

604
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:12,290
And I could hear the chatter on the field and what I really walked away with.

605
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:18,810
And I paid attention to this even like when I watch TV games, I'm like, okay,

606
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,810
are they, can I tell that the players are talking?

607
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,010
Answers?

608
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:23,770
Yes.

609
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:24,610
Yes.

610
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:30,180
And in the soccer, the teams are very clear on the goals.

611
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,300
And when they need to be defensive, they all shift to defense.

612
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,340
When they, when they have an advantage and they can get to the goal on

613
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:46,900
appropriate number, you know, shifted towards offense while still doing

614
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:51,900
risk mitigation, like I could look at a soccer game and watch the game and

615
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,660
describe it in terms of software development.

616
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:54,940
Sure.

617
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,300
Sure.

618
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,960
And actually I would say, I mean, one thing is very true is a

619
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,590
soccer team is made up of a group of specializing generalists or

620
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,790
generalizing specialists.

621
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,590
Yes.

622
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,750
They have some things they're good at and people are put in a position

623
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,510
where they can be most effective, but some players, there are some

624
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,670
utility players on every team in the world who can play multiple

625
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,310
positions.

626
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,470
Well, it's about knowing the role you're supposed to play and applying

627
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,470
the skills you have towards the success of that role.

628
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:30,510
The other parallel I like in this is if you watch, I've played a

629
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,990
goalkeeper quite a bit, even though I'm not very tall and old, but

630
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:38,310
one thing I like about that is you see everything in front of you and

631
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,230
you do, you do a lot of directing.

632
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,990
You do a lot of eyes for everybody.

633
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:46,070
And that's where a lot of the defensive communication starts.

634
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:46,870
Yeah.

635
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:56,070
Uh, the, the, the thing I found just most notable is how audible

636
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:01,870
the team players were when I was younger, you know, whatever it

637
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:06,110
was fifth grade or whatever played soccer in a league, like there

638
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,030
wasn't anywhere like this type of talking.

639
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:15,430
Whereas at that level, the teams are covering each other.

640
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,530
They, they say they know exactly when to hand off.

641
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,650
They tell they, they are looking out for each other when they're

642
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,410
under threat.

643
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:27,290
Like, you know, someone is coming up from behind and about to

644
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,490
try to take the ball.

645
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,370
Right.

646
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:37,570
That is what I see, what I think about when I read your, or when

647
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:41,530
I think about your replacement for principal four, the only thing

648
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,570
I'm thinking about though, is when we go and talk to a dev team,

649
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:50,130
is quality the right term?

650
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,220
I think so.

651
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:56,500
It's, I only, I can't think of a better one.

652
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,260
I think of, you know, this is all around the quality

653
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,340
cultural transition guide.

654
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,420
The, so the one, I can't, I don't think of a better word there.

655
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,140
Well, if I were to, we deeply care about the culture of our team.

656
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:17,420
We care, lead and mature each other towards a mature culture.

657
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:23,060
Now, the way I just said it, I'm sure you have no doubt will

658
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,180
agree with it.

659
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,620
The difference between the two is whether or not it's important.

660
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:33,380
Cause if you remove, if you remove quality, then you're kind of

661
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,620
talking about how well people work together.

662
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,700
Let me, let me phrase it differently and see it and totally

663
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,620
change the meaning.

664
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,300
We care deeply about the quality of our product and we coach lead

665
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,190
and nurture each other towards a more mature culture.

666
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,690
That doesn't make sense that way.

667
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:59,290
Do we focus on the quality product or the quality of the way we make it?

668
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:04,870
What is as written originally, it's about the way we make it with an,

669
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,150
assuming that I'll get to an output that's high quality.

670
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:12,310
No, I like how you, I like, I like where you're going with that rephrasing,

671
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:16,630
but if we were to do that, then I would want to swap principle four and five.

672
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,510
Okay.

673
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,070
Uh, I want to move on cause we're going to talk a lot about seven, five

674
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:23,430
and six ship them as is.

675
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,430
We believe the customer is the only one capable of judging, evaluate

676
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,350
the quality of our product.

677
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:31,510
That's actually perfect already as much as it pisses people off who are,

678
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,510
they don't get it.

679
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:37,030
And number six, we use data extensively to deeply understand customer usage.

680
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,950
And then close the gaps between product hypothesis and business impact,

681
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,990
ship it as is no need for a change.

682
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,150
And then the next one is definitely a we, us, and them thing that I

683
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,350
can have to think here for a minute on how to, how we rephrase this.

684
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:57,150
We expand testing abilities and know how across the team, understanding

685
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,950
that this may reduce or eliminate the need for a dedicated testing specialist.

686
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,310
This one's all for, we wrote it for the testers.

687
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,340
What would this, how would we rephrase this written

688
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,780
for a more generic team audience?

689
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:16,740
Well, so, uh, cause this is all, what does it say in a nutshell is that

690
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,500
everyone knows how to test and gets, it gets better at it all the time.

691
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,210
What is your, give a shit about testing.

692
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:28,020
What is your simple, cause I know we had different versions.

693
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:35,700
Uh, you, what is your like two or three word, um,

694
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,740
encapsulation of principle seven.

695
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,120
Do you remember what I'm talking about?

696
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,040
Everybody tasks.

697
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,090
Every, okay.

698
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:43,810
That doesn't work.

699
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,530
Sorry, man.

700
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,170
And so, so, okay.

701
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:57,740
Number one, we can fix the first part of, of this by just getting rid of the word

702
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:00,940
testing, is this really just without the word testing in there?

703
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,460
Is that, is it about being a learning organization?

704
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,040
This is yeah.

705
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,480
How about we expand abilities and know how across the team,

706
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,760
understand this may reduce or eliminate the need for specialists.

707
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,250
For, for a dedicated specialist.

708
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,030
That may work.

709
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,100
Yeah.

710
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:29,530
That was much, much easier than I thought it would be.

711
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,490
The wheels are spinning.

712
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:34,770
And again, the audience going, no change the principles, but, uh, yeah,

713
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,530
it's worth talking about.

714
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,010
And I think, well, so that, what do we call it?

715
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,930
I don't know.

716
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:43,090
The podcast.

717
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,050
Pretty soon.

718
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:51,770
It's like, I don't know what's going on, but I, yeah, I didn't know we were going

719
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,330
to talk about this till we started, but it's something that I've been thinking

720
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:59,610
about subconsciously, apparently for a while and cause I can tell just by

721
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:02,650
talking through it, I go, Oh, now it's these words.

722
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,490
Like, how do we get to more of the people that need to hear us?

723
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,450
And we've preached to testers for a long time, but having the

724
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:13,370
realization that we need to, I would like to find a way to get this

725
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:17,050
information in front of the developers that know that they get, if I said

726
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,250
before, it's not just telling developers, they have to test often that approach.

727
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,380
They just get mad and say, I need to test.

728
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,460
I don't want to test, but what I've learned more and more is again,

729
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,500
this is extrapolated and I'll get to my point.

730
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,540
It's extrapolated by the exact aspirated.

731
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,900
Sorry.

732
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,940
By the fact that people still insist that testing is a very special thing

733
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,500
that only specialists can do.

734
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:48,570
And to be clear, some, there is room for, anyway, I'm not going to go on the tangent.

735
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,210
No.

736
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:55,000
And, and, and we talked about it here and I, yeah, I think, I think it was,

737
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,000
it was my second to last blog post where, where I talk about essentially

738
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:08,280
except in a very rare situation, I'm now the view that specialization

739
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,040
does not make sense in software development.

740
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,240
Yeah, I totally agree.

741
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,840
And the point that I failed to get to, that's all my fault, not yours.

742
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,800
So I'll take, I'll take the blame on that one is that we just need to tell

743
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,390
developers they need to give, we need to give them permission to test and tell

744
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,510
them that they can actually do it.

745
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,750
That's something that's within their realm.

746
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,950
They've been told for so long that we need testing specialists to do testing.

747
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:39,190
And we've created that codependency that it's those folks that feel like that,

748
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:45,790
that I think need to see this potentially up and coming slight revision of the

749
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,110
modern testing principles.

750
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,430
Let me, we have a few minutes.

751
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:50,670
Yeah.

752
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,630
And I have one other quick story to share at the end about a podcast I listened

753
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,710
to today, but so go ahead and go on and do your few minute thing.

754
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,670
Okay.

755
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:05,110
So I am now going to share with you the safe principles.

756
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,500
Oh God.

757
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:07,660
Yeah.

758
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:08,780
Be prepared.

759
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,140
Oh, these are actually similar and they're shaped.

760
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:19,300
Look at, yeah, I think it's kind of nerdy that they did that.

761
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:24,120
But number one, take an economic view.

762
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,840
Uh, our priority is the business.

763
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,160
Cool.

764
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:27,520
Got it.

765
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:27,920
Yep.

766
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,440
Number two, apply systems thinking.

767
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:31,760
Yeah.

768
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,080
I've, I've heard of that one before.

769
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:35,210
Okay.

770
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,850
Now, Hey, when did these come out?

771
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,930
Did they steal our shit?

772
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,070
The article, I don't know.

773
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:41,430
Okay.

774
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,870
Anyway.

775
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:42,630
Yeah.

776
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:49,550
They obviously have more assume variability preserve options.

777
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,470
That's an agile thing that we didn't cover, but yeah.

778
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:51,710
Okay.

779
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,470
I'm going to go with that.

780
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,950
Build incrementally with fast integrated learning cycles.

781
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,710
All right.

782
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems.

783
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:03,860
Okay.

784
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,500
Whatever I would, I would, I would nix that one, but whatever I would have so far,

785
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:13,420
I would probably cut number three and number five, the two that don't match up

786
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,780
to empty principal school, gotcha.

787
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,220
Go on.

788
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,260
Well, yeah.

789
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,380
Although I think this one, I don't think we covered number six, visualize

790
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,060
and limit with reduced, reduced batch sizes and manage queue links.

791
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,300
Yeah.

792
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,860
But our intention was that, and I totally agree with, I don't disagree with that at

793
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:33,300
all, but our intention was not to talk about the basics of agile.

794
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,980
So it's more of the approach, but yeah, I get, I get why it's there.

795
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,220
I think we, I think we've collapsed that like in the principle.

796
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,460
What is it to this?

797
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,220
There is a construct on that.

798
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:45,500
Right.

799
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,180
Right.

800
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,380
Apply cadence and synchronized with cross-domain planning.

801
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,860
Um, that cut.

802
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,680
That would be cut.

803
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,640
It's important to be cut.

804
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,160
Okay.

805
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,040
Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers.

806
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,240
Oh my God.

807
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,160
Do I love that one?

808
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:09,040
And we, we have things that touch on it, but not exactly what that is saying.

809
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,410
Decentralized decision-making, right?

810
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,890
We don't, we don't even touch that.

811
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,210
Right.

812
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,930
And then organize around value.

813
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:24,200
Now I'll tell you, organize around value is, is it specifically talking

814
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:31,060
around literally a reorganization, uh, but having gone through it, I will tell

815
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:37,420
you that that principle is starting off with principle five, it's starting off

816
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,220
with principle five and going even further saying you should also

817
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,700
organize your teams around that.

818
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,060
Yeah.

819
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:44,460
Okay.

820
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,100
Tell your story.

821
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:45,460
Okay.

822
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,940
Quick story.

823
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,580
And then when I got to go out of time here, actually I got two minutes.

824
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:53,980
So I was listening to the knowledge project podcast and this time it's

825
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,580
Walter Isaacson who's written a bunch of stuff.

826
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:04,670
He's super, super smart, but he was talking about Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs

827
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:07,230
started using this word impute.

828
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,830
You know what impute means?

829
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:09,870
Of course I do.

830
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,750
I'm a data scientist.

831
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:11,350
Okay.

832
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:18,030
He started using it a lot and he wanted like the reason when the iPod first

833
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,110
came out, it had, it wasn't just the iPod.

834
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,590
That was this thing you wanted in your dreams.

835
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,990
It was the packaging and Apple products, even going back to the max.

836
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,190
I just got a new Mac a while back.

837
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:31,950
They spent a lot of time in their packaging and money on the packaging

838
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:36,630
because they want to impute on you that this whole thing is high quality

839
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,190
awesomeness and he talked about a couple of other examples and he goes,

840
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,910
and he says, and then when you look at something like Microsoft Teams,

841
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:50,110
they also impute and they impute that you want a horrible user experience

842
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,230
where you can't figure out how to do anything.

843
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:53,390
And it just cracked me up.

844
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,230
He totally in his eloquent way, just totally dug on teams.

845
00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:00,390
So I thought that was, thought that was just fun.

846
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,230
I like a little bashes on, on the old team.

847
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,550
Okay.

848
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,830
So that was my little story there.

849
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:11,030
So if you want to find out more about this podcast, you can join
