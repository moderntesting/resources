1
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,630
Hi everyone, howdy, I'm Alan, I'm Brent, and we're back for another episode of AB testing.

2
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,630
Yes we are.

3
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,750
And Brent was, that was the face of, oh my god, what number are we?

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,750
That's where you usually say the number.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,750
No, I had written it down.

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:23,750
Oh, it's 83.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,750
Yeah.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,060
You notice the three looks kind of like an eight?

9
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,060
It does.

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,220
Is someone a race part of it?

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,540
Yeah, I'm not good with numbers.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,620
Aren't you a data scientist?

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,940
Alright, what's new, what's up, what's going on?

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,300
It's exciting times, it's review time at Microsoft.

16
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,620
Yeah, I don't miss it.

17
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,100
You know, you mentioned it last time and I completely forgot.

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,380
Yeah, I wish I had the luxury of that.

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,680
We even had, you know, I got a raise recently because I've been there a year and we actually

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,740
have three times a year where we do merit increases, raises at Unity.

21
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,900
And usually we don't do the first one for a year, unwritten rule but not official

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,540
rule at all.

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,540
And I didn't, I forgot.

24
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,340
I knew I'd been there a year but I forgot that I would get it.

25
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,460
It's so weird how much that's changed.

26
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,820
I do not miss the Microsoft review season.

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,070
No.

28
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,230
I'm so sorry, my condolences?

29
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,270
No, I mean, you got to take it in baby steps, right?

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:30,350
Right now, Microsoft's regaining momentum, right?

31
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:31,350
Sure.

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,030
We're at all time highs.

33
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,950
We're more capitalized than Google now.

34
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,870
Again, there are folks thinking that we'll, there's actually discussion about Microsoft

35
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:48,750
being a $1 trillion company in the next year.

36
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,200
Which I, I mean, certainly I would love that.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,640
I was just going over, now total tangent, don't dive too deep.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Yep.

39
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:07,360
The big story is I was going over my savings and college expenses, figure out how long

40
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,240
I'd work and had a couple weird realizations yesterday.

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,240
One is that I have saved, as far as I know, more than most of my peers.

42
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,080
So I'm very lucky to work at Microsoft for a long time.

43
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,920
And I was just thinking about this because I have zero regret.

44
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,640
I left a lot, a lot, now a lot, a lot more dollars of stock on the table when I left

45
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,840
Microsoft.

46
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,030
But I'm still 100% glad I left.

47
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,270
But I realized that as much as I've saved, which is-

48
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,630
As things says, money isn't even close to a primary motivator.

49
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,910
It's enough for it's, and that's, I really, that really rings true.

50
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,390
And that I lost sight of that at Microsoft because you're sort of chasing that, that,

51
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,230
ooh, I wonder if I can get in this band of bonus.

52
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,230
Oh.

53
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,230
Yeah.

54
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,230
I don't share that.

55
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,700
I mean, I know a lot of people who are aggressively going after money.

56
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,820
I don't share that.

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,220
For me, I just want to not have to worry about it.

58
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,810
So anyway, the point I realized is, first point I realized is how many people are

59
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,390
planning to work pretty much until they die.

60
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,710
Like this idea of retirement has faded.

61
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,230
People kind of spend what they have.

62
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,370
Lots of data showing that.

63
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,970
And then with, here's a weird economic thing.

64
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,370
And a coworker said they read an article on this.

65
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,170
I don't want to find this, but I was thinking through it.

66
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:41,490
If people work into their 60s and 70s and maybe 80s and life expectancy increases,

67
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:47,410
we're going to have an odd, it's not, I was called odd, that's probably not the diverse

68
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,270
way of putting this, but we're going to have a workforce of lots of people in their 60s,

69
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,710
70s, 80s working, which would mean fewer jobs for those in their 20s entering the job market.

70
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,920
What happens then?

71
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,680
It's a systems problem.

72
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,520
It is a systems problem.

73
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:13,760
The thing is, is that assumes that the market hasn't grown to require additional.

74
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,480
And I imagine we'll move into a world where additional labor is needed.

75
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,320
But anyway, interesting.

76
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,280
Interesting.

77
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,240
And I don't think about retiring as a point like, I don't want to work anymore,

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,600
because I'll probably always work.

79
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,520
And even when I quit a full-time job, probably do some consulting to make ends meet.

80
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,360
But it was interesting looking.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,750
I don't think most people realize how much you need to save if you want to stop working

82
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,710
even in your 60s.

83
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,580
Yeah, you know, for me, so it's interesting you bring this up.

84
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,040
I had lunch with a long time friend who's still at Microsoft today.

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,480
I had lunch with him yesterday.

86
00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:06,580
And he shared that he's got some developer that is coming to him on a monthly basis,

87
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,780
trying to get him to sell his house.

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,980
And the developer is currently not offering the make me move money.

89
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,180
But he's like, I kind of hope he does.

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:31,100
Because he's intending, if he gets that, he already owns two condos in Maui.

91
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,970
And he's found a bed and breakfast that if he got the make me move money,

92
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,840
that would be enough for him to put a down on that bed and breakfast.

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,100
And then he's out of here.

94
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,540
Oh, and so he would have residual income from being being a landlord.

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,500
You just need a plan.

96
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,380
You just need a plan.

97
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:02,720
And I worry that so many of my home friends, my people I interact with, so many of them,

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,120
their plan is no plan.

99
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
I'll work until I can't work anymore.

100
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,520
And then I'll figure something out.

101
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,600
So I'm in that camp.

102
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,080
Like one of the things that I realized when talking with him.

103
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,740
So something I know about me already.

104
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,740
My cost of living goes up when I have too much idle time.

105
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:22,950
Right.

106
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,250
So if I'm going to retire, I need to have a sense of what I'm going to do.

107
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,720
Right.

108
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,600
If, for example, if I got hit by a layoff today, it's very clear what I would do.

109
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,120
I would just take time off, go back to school.

110
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,060
I have one class left in my master's.

111
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,060
Oh, you haven't finished that yet?

112
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,220
No, this class.

113
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,180
So the classes that I got to do now are just not interesting.

114
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,780
And I didn't go back to school to get a degree.

115
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,460
I went back to school to learn the content, but I'm just like, no, I'm tortured.

116
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,880
I'm like, uh, yeah, just why not.

117
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,600
Might as well just finish it.

118
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,120
At this stage, you may as well do it.

119
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
But I would go back.

120
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,680
But even then, right, that's sort of an activity, a promise of some future goal,

121
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,880
which I haven't identified.

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,120
Great.

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
I'd go back to school for what?

124
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,760
What am I going to learn?

125
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,800
What do I want to do with it?

126
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,070
Although I will say, going back to like a culinary art school.

127
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,230
I've thought about that.

128
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,510
I have thought about that myself.

129
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:31,710
So reeling back on track, because I do have some topics today.

130
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,030
Very quick, I'll be in New York next week at the Test Leadership Congress.

131
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,070
Cool.

132
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,910
Giving two workshops and a keynote.

133
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Busy, busy Alan.

134
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,680
Managing the Modern Tester is one of the workshops.

135
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm sensing a theme.

136
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,600
The other one is, I forgot the title.

137
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,720
It's on building communities.

138
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,020
And then the keynote is the Leaders Guide to Building Equality Culture.

139
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,330
Which I want to talk about a little bit more afterwards.

140
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,730
But this was probably the hardest keynote I've ever had to put together,

141
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,090
because I had to think.

142
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,330
Because most of the time when I give a keynote, I said,

143
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,490
like, OK, I got the ideas in my hand.

144
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,090
I got to organize them into a story below law.

145
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,210
What's the title again?

146
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,450
The Leaders Guide to Building Equality Culture.

147
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,010
So I had to think a lot about this.

148
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,250
And I worry a lot about telling a story as I go along.

149
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,850
And I'll tell more about it afterwards.

150
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,130
But I'm pretty happy with what I ended up with.

151
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,610
I'll do some more tweaking on it before the presentation.

152
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,330
Thank you, Test Leadership Congress, for not asking me to submit my slides.

153
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,290
Three months in advance.

154
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,010
I appreciate that.

155
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,450
One thing I started to do at conferences now,

156
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:49,490
that I'll continue to do, is I create a friendly URL bit.ly link to my presentation,

157
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,250
like Google Slides.

158
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,810
And I share those on the first slide of my presentation.

159
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:53,970
So.

160
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,620
Oh.

161
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,260
So.

162
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,620
So that people can follow.

163
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:57,860
Yeah.

164
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:01,700
So it gets rid of the inevitable, are your slides going to be available?

165
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,940
And my slides are frickin' useless to anyone not telling the stories.

166
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,020
But if people always ask, so I just make them available.

167
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,300
Yeah.

168
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,500
It's actually.

169
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,930
No, you write slides for what slides are for.

170
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,050
This is something I learned a long time ago.

171
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,530
Do you know what the number one purpose of a presentation is?

172
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,290
Convey information?

173
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,090
Information sharing?

174
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,410
Nope.

175
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,970
What is it?

176
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,770
To entertain.

177
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,220
Oh, that's a much better thing.

178
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,860
I do do that.

179
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,340
I do try to do that.

180
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,460
The secondary goal is to convey information that sticks.

181
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:43,330
Yes.

182
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:43,650
All right.

183
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,850
I'm going to try and do both of those.

184
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,770
Hey, one quick thing before we dive into the principles,

185
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,170
which we promised to do and we will do is I want to thank you for episode 82.

186
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,010
If you recall or you're back and listen right now, we'll wait.

187
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,050
Welcome back.

188
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,060
And I trust you hit pause in the right spot.

189
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,620
I went through the exercise that Brent walked me through with some of my peers and worked out

190
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,100
pretty well.

191
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,500
People.

192
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,180
It caused.

193
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,740
It caused the right discussions to happen.

194
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,100
I went through a bunch of other things as well, but I walk through that exercise as

195
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:23,140
part of a larger presentation I was giving and it lots of proper conversation happened.

196
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,860
And the one line I'll give you without diving too deep is we finished going over

197
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,940
data or business value for a feature in data collection.

198
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,460
And someone said, we should do another.

199
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,940
So we'd get another hypothesis.

200
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,740
Another hypothesis.

201
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,060
Yeah.

202
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,180
So we did it again.

203
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,660
Yeah.

204
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:48,500
The thing I think that's very valuable is it's a structured approach.

205
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,300
It kind of creates it forces system thinking.

206
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,710
So did you encounter a situation like we did on the air where you got to a particular point

207
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,570
and then they realized, oh crap, this is the hypothesis.

208
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,170
Yeah, I couldn't have planned it better.

209
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,730
We came up with we struggled for our hypothesis.

210
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:12,450
We came up, said, yep, that's the right one for that feature.

211
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,250
We started going through and someone said, wait, wait, wait a minute.

212
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,770
I think we have the wrong hypothesis.

213
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,250
It was perfect.

214
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,610
I couldn't have planned it any better.

215
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,130
Yeah, that's great.

216
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,130
It's a total improv works out great.

217
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,170
And we will refer back to that and dive deeply into that when we get to principle number six.

218
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,690
But today we're going to spend the rest of the podcast talking about principle number two,

219
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,690
which I will read to you to get started.

220
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,290
These are the modern testing principles on moderntesting.org.

221
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,400
We accelerate the team and use models like lean thinking and the theory of constraints to help

222
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,640
identify, prioritize and mitigate bottlenecks from the system.

223
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,040
What the heck does that mean, Brent?

224
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:01,900
One thing that that means is so what that is expressing is first, our goal is,

225
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,780
is to accelerate the team.

226
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:05,740
Okay.

227
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:11,860
So it doesn't say we help the team go fast.

228
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,300
It says we are a force multiplier.

229
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,950
That's very, very important.

230
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,190
It isn't people follow the trap.

231
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,470
It just needs to go really, really fast.

232
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,950
Right.

233
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,780
Go fast and break things.

234
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,820
Well, one way to say is that we're constantly making the team go faster.

235
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,060
Okay.

236
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,710
But then the other bit of it is, is using models like lean theory of constraints

237
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,800
to identify how.

238
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,430
So this principle is around, in my view, it's around adaptability,

239
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:56,320
reaction and identifying the places.

240
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,600
Now this is a modern testing principle, but it's adapted from Agile principle.

241
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,360
So in this particular case, it's okay.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,520
Now that we have a sense of, you know, a much like your what you just described

243
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,520
with your organization, we have a hypothesis around what creates quality.

244
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,800
Okay.

245
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,320
How do we accelerate towards that hypothesis?

246
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,360
How do we validate it?

247
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
And how do we do it faster by using Agile principles?

248
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:23,760
Okay.

249
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I want to dive a little bit into just for those who may have only heard about these

250
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,560
and not studied them a little bit into theory of constraints and lean thinking.

251
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,240
Let me ask you a question.

252
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,130
Why is who cares what I want to do?

253
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:38,690
Right.

254
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,930
Why is this the second principle?

255
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,010
We talked about why it's important more than why it's the second principle.

256
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:45,970
All right.

257
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,410
So I'll ask you before I go back into the what, because you brought up the why

258
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,090
and screwed up the whole flow.

259
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,890
No, why?

260
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,930
Okay, we'll come back to why.

261
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,530
So what is there?

262
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,570
I don't want to anymore.

263
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,930
What is the theory of constraints?

264
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,050
All right.

265
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,890
What is the theory of constraints?

266
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,010
I'll wait to turn that around.

267
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:09,650
So theory of constraints is introduced in a book called the goal by what's his first

268
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:10,370
name, goal threat.

269
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:11,680
Dunno.

270
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,720
Total preparation.

271
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,760
Dunno, goal threat.

272
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,160
We're so sorry.

273
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,960
We'll remember later.

274
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,770
My introduction to theory of constraints is through right.

275
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:21,810
It's okay.

276
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,400
So it's just a methodology for identifying the most important limiting factor, the constraint

277
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,630
that's in the way of achieving whatever you want to get done.

278
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:35,070
And then improving that constraint until it's no longer the limiting factor.

279
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,470
Doesn't say eliminating the constraint, just improving it until it's not the limiting.

280
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,470
It's no longer the worst bottleneck.

281
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:47,790
So the goal is sort of is business novel that describes pretty much right.

282
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,950
It sends how flow works where you don't have to solve all the problems.

283
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,030
You just want to figure out where the bottlenecks are,

284
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,710
make them not bottlenecks and things flow through the system much faster.

285
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,910
It prioritizes improvement improvements.

286
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,430
And in the top priority is always the current constraint.

287
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:05,810
Yes.

288
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:08,450
That's pretty much the summary of theory of constraints.

289
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,890
There was a book about from an IT angle called Phoenix Project,

290
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,650
which I liked.

291
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,450
Some people didn't like.

292
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,370
I thought it was a good, fun read.

293
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,610
A lot of it rang true.

294
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,210
And it's just a way to do rapid improvement.

295
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,690
So the way it works, the way the constraint work is you,

296
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,930
like I mentioned, is you figure out what the constraint is,

297
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,570
you make it a priority, you mitigate it or work on it until it's no longer the biggest constraint.

298
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,410
And then you reprioritize on what is now the biggest constraint.

299
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,930
So from that thinking, that's sort of what theory of constraints is.

300
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,730
Let's talk about, I want to go into lean a little bit because they cover each,

301
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:46,930
they overlap each other.

302
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:56,990
Both lean and the Kanban method, which is a specific...

303
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,510
Well, Kanban comes out of lean.

304
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:06,510
Kanban method, capital K, capital M, trademarked by David Anderson.

305
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:17,730
Both of these are sort of grown out of the theory of constraints.

306
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,460
I'm not certain around chronologically the theory of constraints.

307
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,020
Kanban itself came out of this concept of Kaizen.

308
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,860
And that's an old concept that Toyota developed.

309
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,540
I'm not certain what came first, theory of constraints or Kaizen.

310
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,710
Nevertheless, today's methods kind of combine both of these things together.

311
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:43,950
Yes.

312
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,810
Anyway, you were going to the place.

313
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,130
You kind of already summarized lean, lean, just in a nutshell.

314
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:56,610
There's seven lean principles that guide lean thinking.

315
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,850
It's optimize the whole, system thinking, eliminate waste, create knowledge, build quality in,

316
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,120
important, deliver fast by managing flow.

317
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,590
This is pretty much the core of lean thinking,

318
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:13,710
the idea that focus produces higher quality work.

319
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,550
Defer commitment and respect to people.

320
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,300
Yes.

321
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,050
But in the thing is, so this is one of the things I think is most often forgotten.

322
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,130
By managing flow.

323
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,060
People all know Agile is all about delivering fast.

324
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,220
And that's what seems to stick.

325
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,360
But the other bit after that is critical.

326
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
By managing flow.

327
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,020
Now is the time.

328
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,460
I think for those who have been waiting, now we dive into the why this is important.

329
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,820
You've already started diving there.

330
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm just actually officially announcing the transition.

331
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,460
Yes.

332
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:03,100
So what I want to try to do in a time remaining is, so we're adapting.

333
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,580
We got some feedback from 81.

334
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,300
We want to try to cover what, why, and how.

335
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,500
But I also want to make sure that we're not forgetting the modern test context.

336
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,380
Because a lot of this discussion is going to be very easy to describe it

337
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,020
from an Agilist only paradigm.

338
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,820
Right.

339
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,820
Why is this important?

340
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,580
There's a couple of things.

341
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,420
A couple of things why I think it's important.

342
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:40,940
Number one, by focusing the modern tester on identifying their role as acceleration.

343
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:50,820
We're choosing these models because quite honestly they're proven out.

344
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,100
Right.

345
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,140
These are great structural models to learn to how to accelerate in a positive fashion.

346
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:03,860
The reason why I think this is an important principle is I think far too much of test

347
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,020
is the reverse.

348
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,200
They create the bottlenecks.

349
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:18,100
What we want is tests to be recognized that being a bottleneck in the system is actually harmful.

350
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,740
Not only for customer quality, but for the business.

351
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,290
Work towards the exact other side.

352
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,860
An example I constantly think of is the stabilization period just before release.

353
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,220
Yeah.

354
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,260
Well, why do you feel that way?

355
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,600
It means you screwed up earlier.

356
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,280
It means you have not built quality.

357
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
It's a bottleneck.

358
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:54,240
It's always faster to fix the things as you go along and build quality from the beginning

359
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,610
versus try to test quality in at the end.

360
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,410
And this is the way Office was built forever.

361
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,170
They would have these minuscule coding milestones where people would shoving their code as fast

362
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,490
as they could to meet the arbitrary deadline.

363
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,370
Then there'd be an extensively long stabilization period.

364
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,010
Yeah, those these drove me freaking nuts.

365
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,890
I'm sure I mentioned it on here before, but it just makes my blood boil.

366
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:31,940
There are these sort of timeline concepts that, like one of the worst concepts I've ever recalled.

367
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,540
Now, when I was a test manager, I never had this milestone.

368
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,940
But do you remember, have you ever worked on a team that had a test complete date?

369
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,180
Yes.

370
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,180
WTF.

371
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,030
What is this concept intended to mean?

372
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,210
Like I have tested everything I'm going to by this date?

373
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:59,410
No, we when I was on a team that had it, there was a test complete date of they wanted to lock

374
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,090
the source tree except for fixes.

375
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,330
So we had test development was complete like one week after product development.

376
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,480
Yeah, it was.

377
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,560
Yeah, again, I'm not happy about it.

378
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:20,620
No, it's I remember once I had a director get so pissed off

379
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:25,200
at me, he called me and I didn't work in his org, but he was so pissed off.

380
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,760
He called me.

381
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,920
He's like, Brent, when are you?

382
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,600
When is your test complete?

383
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,520
And I'm like, there is no test complete.

384
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,780
Oh, yes, there is.

385
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,940
Okay, that's a date you set.

386
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,900
I am choosing to not follow it.

387
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:49,700
And he's like, but Brent, if you if you continue to test after test complete, you'll find bugs.

388
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:56,820
This is a director test telling me this you'll find you'll find bugs and that will cause us to

389
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,580
slip. Right.

390
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,180
A director of tests is telling me that I'm going to obviously a Peter principal promotion.

391
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,590
Yeah, he he longer story there.

392
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,300
He and I worked together years later and he came to me.

393
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,580
We were peers at that time.

394
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:27,950
He came to me and there was an opening for another TM role and he asked me to if I would back him for

395
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,830
that role and I looked him straight in the eyes.

396
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,510
I said, not a chance in hell.

397
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,410
So anyway, yeah, let's tie this back to accelerating.

398
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,730
Well, so these are some of the the the pre existing.

399
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,170
Right.

400
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:51,150
It's that mantra is around completion and predictability.

401
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:51,390
Right.

402
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,950
It's not around value.

403
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,200
Right.

404
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,050
And in order to accelerate, you have to have a mechanism that that first identifies what the

405
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:08,450
value is that you can iterate very rapidly on analyze and understand what's the next bottleneck.

406
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,490
There's a nice tie in to principle number one here and improving the business versus versus

407
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:14,370
being a cost.

408
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:27,680
A part in my mind, a lot of the principles we've laid out are specifically intended to contrast

409
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,360
with current practice.

410
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,150
Right.

411
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:42,110
We do not want testing anymore to be viewed as a cost as a as a bottleneck.

412
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:42,990
Right.

413
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:51,260
The we cannot win the battle around all of those testers.

414
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,620
You know, they keep finding the bugs and are slowing down the release.

415
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,180
Right.

416
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,460
It and I'm like, yeah, you know what?

417
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,820
I'm I'm with them.

418
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,020
Let's stop that.

419
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,540
Let's stop slowing down the release.

420
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,340
Let's figure out what.

421
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:16,300
Let's figure out how we get product out to the customer faster so that we can actually

422
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,700
use the customer to determine whether or not we are delivering quality.

423
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:27,920
As we've set out over and over again, quality is a problem solved to a human being.

424
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:38,880
And a lot of our bottlenecks are around this theoretical champion of quality crap.

425
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,520
And this is the the canonical bottleneck in a software team is you have an agile team as

426
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,640
air quotes their agile team of eight developers and a tester.

427
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,800
And the tester is overwhelmed and he's the bottleneck for the team or she's the

428
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,760
bottleneck for the team.

429
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,700
Hiring eight more developers for that team isn't going to make the team any faster.

430
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
But it says you can view the theory of constraints go well,

431
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,760
if I add eight more people surely will be faster.

432
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,600
But no, you'll actually be slower.

433
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,920
It's solving the wrong problem.

434
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:18,190
So the modern tester, of course, recognizes that the modern tester is coaching his team

435
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:22,990
on owning much more of that testing and making sure that they are not the bottleneck.

436
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,430
But so even more so.

437
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,390
So now in terms of like the behavior we're trying to remove,

438
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,550
let's talk about the behavior we're trying to get.

439
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,750
Why do we need this?

440
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:40,480
Well, in a quality context, a customer quality context,

441
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,840
getting that fast feedback loop is critical in terms of triangulating around what is quality.

442
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:59,260
So getting smaller releases, determining, hey, creating that feedback loop,

443
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,460
determining, okay, did we create a risk?

444
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:11,760
Minimizing that risk, getting that loop adapting and accelerating is what we're saying this is

445
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,160
all about.

446
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,600
It's all about the fast feedback.

447
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,630
And I want to reiterate, it isn't, and you mean this, I know,

448
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,780
but it isn't just about fast.

449
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,660
No.

450
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,700
So there's a fine line.

451
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,140
It's actually a thick line.

452
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,140
There's the fallacy of now, as I call it, meaning I got to get it out now,

453
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,900
even though it's not ready, but I got to get it out of it.

454
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,460
They have to have it.

455
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,530
And you have to balance that with failure to launch.

456
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,970
Whereas Reeve says you don't get any value from your engineering effort

457
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,650
until it's in the hands of customers.

458
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,870
So you need to get...

459
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,910
You don't get any value.

460
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,870
And if you're in tests, you don't get any sense of the quality of what was released.

461
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:55,950
You don't have any learning opportunities until it's out the door.

462
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,270
Yeah.

463
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,470
So you're trying to create the best possible learning opportunity.

464
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:05,790
And then again, as we called out earlier, it's about going fast by managing the flow.

465
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:06,590
Right.

466
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:07,390
Yes.

467
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:14,030
It's about reducing the friction so that you can get access to these things

468
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,310
that are very valuable for you to learn from.

469
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:21,070
I just wanted to underscore it isn't just about fast.

470
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:22,610
No.

471
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,090
That's it.

472
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,330
So it's super important.

473
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:28,690
It's worth underlining, if you can underline in a podcast.

474
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:30,530
Rents thinking.

475
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,210
Yeah, I don't know how to do that.

476
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,330
I probably could figure it out, but it'd take too much time.

477
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,370
Have you done this?

478
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:49,020
So I'll say, as most are aware of, I'm a data scientist now.

479
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,700
I still live this principle.

480
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,990
However, my sense of quality is primarily around usage.

481
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:07,620
So for me, a data scientist, hey, I'm producing things where people are supposed to be able

482
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,620
to make decisions off of.

483
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:09,860
Okay.

484
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,020
So that's always the beginning phase.

485
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:18,820
Until you have earned enough trust from the humans who are making the decisions currently,

486
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:26,740
you build your models and you support the decision making until that trust is established.

487
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,940
And then you just automate it.

488
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,580
Okay.

489
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:37,100
Now, if I spend months on a data set and an analysis and then a model

490
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,280
and then release it and no one uses it, it's the same thing.

491
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,960
It's no different than any other product.

492
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,110
And a lot of the times, this is why it's really critical to get these things out sooner.

493
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,750
There's something that I did very recently on this.

494
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:03,900
And I realized shortly after my release of a new data set that my target customer was wrong.

495
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,360
I very quickly figured out who it was.

496
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,080
And it turned out I was able to shift over, create demand

497
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,560
without having to change anything around my underpinning asset.

498
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,600
I forget the name, but having recently studied the Eric Ries pivots from the Lean Startup,

499
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,960
there's a name for that pivot.

500
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,620
He names that one.

501
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,140
That's a very common pivot.

502
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,380
Yeah.

503
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:39,500
No, and that kind of goes into 82 around our hypothesis, right?

504
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,000
We spent a lot of time last time talking about customer segment, right?

505
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,640
Maybe when we were talking about what was it, the hub and the landing, something or other,

506
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:49,680
right?

507
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,200
You had gotten this feedback, but one of the problems with feedback is,

508
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,880
okay, is that the noisy 2% of your customers?

509
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:00,860
Agree.

510
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,020
So I want to talk...

511
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,620
But one of the... Actually, where I was going...

512
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,180
Nevermind.

513
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,700
And no, I'll let you choose your topic next.

514
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,980
Choose your own next adventure.

515
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,450
I want to tie it to testing.

516
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,250
Last time I was in dev, I did this model.

517
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,090
It worked very successfully.

518
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:26,460
And what I learned from that is, yeah, I don't need a separate testing.

519
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,800
Now, in my case, I had a unified engineering team and I had testing talent on it.

520
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,340
And I spent a good amount of time thinking,

521
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,740
do I need to separate this stuff?

522
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,900
And I'm like, no, actually, I don't.

523
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,580
My actual, quote unquote, testers are my better developers.

524
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:46,940
Yeah.

525
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,420
Yeah.

526
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,580
No, I fully agree.

527
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:57,260
So I want to kind of transition this into the how, but do it by talking about something that...

528
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,460
I just double checked.

529
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,700
I don't think it's mentioned explicitly in the principles, which is systems thinking.

530
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:04,850
Yes.

531
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:07,090
And being able to see the whole picture of the system.

532
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,010
One of the things I ask everyone on my team to do is...

533
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,450
In my viewpoint, in order to accelerate the achievement of a quality,

534
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,930
in order to provide acceleration, you need to understand the system.

535
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:26,080
And you need to understand the system in order to understand where bottlenecks may exist.

536
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,900
So what I ask people on my team to do is, for your features,

537
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,400
you should understand everything from developer desktop to deployment, how that works.

538
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,920
So whether it's, what are the tools that run as part of the local build?

539
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,260
What...

540
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,780
I can dive in there in a minute.

541
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,460
What testing occurs for the check-in?

542
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,540
What testing happens during the continuous integration pipeline?

543
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,540
How are things deployed?

544
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,660
Are they deployed all at once?

545
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,780
Is there blue-green?

546
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,260
What happens?

547
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,300
How do we get feedback?

548
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,500
What data is available?

549
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,260
I know you know this.

550
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,300
You probably know it by a different name.

551
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,190
You're deployed to this server, server farm, and you have a new version.

552
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,470
You deploy here, and you slowly route traffic from one to the other.

553
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,460
Oh, got it.

554
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,020
Okay.

555
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,180
So there's lots of different names for it.

556
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,100
I think blue-green's fairly popular.

557
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:26,130
I'm surprised you hadn't heard of it.

558
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:26,610
No.

559
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,490
But you go from the blue, green, and then the green becomes the backup.

560
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,850
So you always have the hot and the live.

561
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,210
It makes it easy to roll back.

562
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,050
If you have good traffic mapping, you can slowly route people over

563
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,970
and look for errors in the new version, et cetera.

564
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,660
So understand that whole system.

565
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
You understand where are the bottlenecks?

566
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,580
What's difficult for us to do?

567
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,340
But you have to understand the system in order to do it.

568
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,530
Yeah.

569
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:59,200
And again, I want to – the bottlenecks here, because it's the modern testing principle,

570
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,160
right?

571
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,600
The other thing, too, is I think where tests should spend their time is

572
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,420
on the delivery of quality.

573
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,380
Mm-hmm.

574
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:09,700
Right?

575
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:15,940
Now, here, it's going to be harder, because every time I say quality,

576
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:20,560
I am not referring to code correctness, right?

577
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,480
And so if we have new listeners on the podcast today, to me, quality is not bugs.

578
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,600
Quality is, did it satisfy a customer problem?

579
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,560
Mm-hmm.

580
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:30,880
Right?

581
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,200
So how do we get – if we start off with the basis that in order for us to achieve quality,

582
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,440
we need to get that fast feedback.

583
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,520
What's slowing us down from getting that feedback?

584
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:41,600
Right.

585
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,120
So I will push back a little bit and understand that whole system, because I fully agree with that.

586
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:54,000
But if we are blocked from being able to get that feedback because of code correctness,

587
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,440
I'm not going to go do the work.

588
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,200
I believe that belongs – well, it's not what I'm concerned with,

589
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,400
but I'm going to make sure it's happening.

590
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:08,350
Like, you know what, you should really run – I'm going to change CI, so unit tests run there,

591
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:16,910
or I'm going to change the developer flow so that this linter or this other tool runs before – this

592
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,670
static analysis tool runs before check-in.

593
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,910
I may facilitate that.

594
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,870
I may do that.

595
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,430
But you're right.

596
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,900
My concern is customer value.

597
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:31,660
The thing I will say to push back on your pushback is –

598
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,060
This is as close as we get to fighting on A-B testing.

599
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,060
I don't think you're going to disagree with what I'm going to say.

600
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,620
Dammit.

601
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:51,220
While I agree with that, I think QA needs to temper way back or scale way back

602
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,060
on this idea of how proactive we have to be.

603
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,260
Come on, dude.

604
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,460
Shift right or left.

605
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,180
I forget which way.

606
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,230
Yeah.

607
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:04,750
I hate the term, so I don't remember how it works.

608
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:16,480
So you can ship bad code, but you can't ship bad code without the ability to detect and revert it.

609
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:24,400
I will say having the ability to ship bad code with detection and reversion,

610
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:33,230
letting devs ship bad code into the wild is something QA should do.

611
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,360
So you're saying –

612
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Which I think is counterproductive to everyone's instinct listening to it.

613
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:39,840
Yes.

614
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,900
Less proactive, more ability to be massively fast at reacting.

615
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:51,020
Our job is to minimize harm overall.

616
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,610
But the more proactive we are, the more we start adding bile next back in the system.

617
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:01,810
What we are trying to do is not create that dysfunction loop.

618
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:13,550
And the way you get devs to be accountable for code correctness is let them realize that they

619
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,670
just harmed a customer.

620
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,390
Now, at QA, we can't allow catastrophic events.

621
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:21,870
You can't allow that sort of thing.

622
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:25,470
But the number of tests that we need to cover proactively is much smaller.

623
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,190
I want to push back on your pushback on my pushback.

624
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:28,670
Okay.

625
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:28,990
Okay.

626
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:36,590
So let's say we have a system where we can go, oops, bad, roll back.

627
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,550
Oops, bad, roll back.

628
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,110
Super fast.

629
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,510
We're great.

630
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,390
We detect the stuff.

631
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,110
It's great.

632
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:43,710
But we can never get a deployment out because code correctness is so shit.

633
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,670
Then, if you look at it as a system –

634
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,390
No.

635
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,270
Then it goes right back to principle two.

636
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:53,570
Right?

637
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:54,770
It's, again –

638
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,730
Exactly.

639
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,290
Exactly.

640
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,290
Our job is to deliver quality, and quality is value delivery to the customer.

641
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,530
So if there's – so first off –

642
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:09,250
For unable to deliver value to the customer, and the root cause of that bottleneck is code

643
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,370
correctness, we kind of have to go make sure something happens there.

644
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,010
Right.

645
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:17,010
But here, the thing that's – this is fantastic.

646
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:26,140
The thing that is important about this principle is that the modern tester is disallowed

647
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,630
to create significant bottlenecks back in the system.

648
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:31,950
Yes.

649
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,720
So once we do this and we realize, oh, code correctness,

650
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,600
the answer is not bring back the one-month stabilization test pass.

651
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,800
The answer is how do I coach these – how do I coach these – or these devs?

652
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,600
What – one of the things I blogged about this years ago,

653
00:37:53,600 --> 00:38:01,120
one of the things that I did to resolve this problem is I put my strongest test automators

654
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:08,530
into the dev team, and I said, all right, these guys – they're now your reports.

655
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,050
These guys are responsible.

656
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:17,890
They're going to be first responsible for teaching the rest of your dev how to do unit tests,

657
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:25,970
how to do the automation that is necessary so that they can CYA and stop reverting.

658
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,200
Right.

659
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:33,840
The most positive thing is, in this particular case, when dev is constantly

660
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:44,350
shipping and then that's having to be rolled back, it's not just QA.

661
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,310
It's going to be concerned.

662
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:46,350
It's going to be the business.

663
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,710
We're not going to – now, but the thing at that point in time,

664
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:57,710
and I love when we get to that bottleneck or that decision point, rather, because what you have to

665
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:04,990
do if you're a modern tester is show a better way forward than falling back to the old ways.

666
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:12,430
Which means that the big essence of this principle is that you constantly need to be

667
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,030
looking at the system, take a step back.

668
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,590
Yep.

669
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:21,630
Because you may – it's very possible and very common you may be focusing on the wrong bottleneck.

670
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,490
So, stop and ask yourself, is this the right bottleneck?

671
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:26,050
Back up.

672
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,210
Look, is this really the slowdown in the system?

673
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,570
Does it exist somewhere else?

674
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,490
Have I already mitigated this bottleneck?

675
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:33,170
What is the largest one in the system?

676
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,130
Dive back in.

677
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,570
It's really easy to get stuck.

678
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,530
What is creating risk to the system?

679
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:43,730
That's something test is very good at, although they don't think of it that way.

680
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,010
What is creating risk?

681
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,770
I've talked about it a million times before.

682
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,490
I hate Scrum.

683
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:58,000
It doesn't take long going through Scrum to realize when all of the bugs are created.

684
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,240
It's at 11 p.m. the night before the sprint in demo.

685
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,040
Yes.

686
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
Almost all of the time.

687
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:13,120
And when you shift to a Kanban model –

688
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,040
Which is optimized for flow.

689
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,080
And one check-in gets absorbed into the system at a time.

690
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:27,410
Then you go, hey, it's a lot easier to create a mechanism.

691
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:36,370
Let's say you want to – some teams want to have a staging or a test environment before they go to prod.

692
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:42,450
You create a system that says, okay, let's do one check-in at a time.

693
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:45,650
Let's validate goodness.

694
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:50,610
I think – and a little bit of a rant here, but it falls into the principle.

695
00:40:51,570 --> 00:41:00,620
I think too many teams use Scrum as – one, incorrectly, and they think they're doing Agile.

696
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:06,660
But what they're – they're focusing on iteration versus adaptability.

697
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:15,890
The other value add – so when people say we want a hybrid between

698
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:23,360
waterfall and Agile, one of the learnings that I've done is I've actually realized that Scrum

699
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,230
is not Agile. Scrum is actually that hybrid.

700
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,860
Because what you want is – the problem with waterfall is –

701
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:43,140
Scrum has turned into – the idea of Scrum is that if the item's not complete,

702
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,940
it's fine. It goes back into the backlog at the end of the sprint.

703
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,060
But people feel bad not completing their commitment, so they shove them in at the end

704
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,990
and create waterfall out of Scrum. Scrum as designed, I don't think, is the hybrid.

705
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,670
What Scrum has grown largely into on, I would say, most teams following Scrum is exactly that.

706
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,940
And I disagree.

707
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,860
Well, one of us is right.

708
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,700
Oh, well, good.

709
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,500
And one of us can edit out the I disagree part of the problem.

710
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:22,240
But it's not – that is spawning – I mean, that can be episode 93.

711
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,080
What else do you want to hit on this?

712
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,320
What are some other things that you've done to support this principle,

713
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:35,060
or that you've seen done to accelerate the team?

714
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:43,380
The single most important thing is get folks moving up front.

715
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,900
The second most important thing – so these are very tactical things that I've discovered

716
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,700
work very well.

717
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:58,900
Shift to a flow model, not a Scrum or a waterfall model.

718
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,330
Do one check-in-a-time.

719
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:06,100
Create a process where one check-in-a-time goes to stage,

720
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,460
and then that gets validated and goes to production.

721
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:20,140
Create a mechanism where you're using test and production to drive automatically your rollback

722
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,220
process.

723
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:34,060
One of the biggest issues that I've seen is a lot of teams, they're still heavy on the proactivity

724
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:39,420
and have it invested in the ability to solidly roll back automatically.

725
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,190
It's a forward only.

726
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,780
And once you detect harm, you've got to roll it back.

727
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:56,610
But what you'll find is that a lot of the situations – things that we've done in the past,

728
00:43:56,610 --> 00:44:01,730
the traditional testing methods – were a waste of time.

729
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,020
Yes.

730
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:09,870
One thing also to bring up here – and we've mentioned this on the podcast before – but

731
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,590
an important aspect for understanding the system and figuring out where improvements

732
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,230
can be made.

733
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,240
It's part of agile.

734
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,480
It's even part of Scrum that teams don't take advantage of properly, is the retrospective.

735
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,130
Yes.

736
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:33,810
It's a method for the team to discuss and discover and sometimes solve the bottlenecks

737
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:34,370
in the system.

738
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,010
The other thing that, again, that – I mean, you asked what have I done.

739
00:44:39,730 --> 00:44:48,100
One of the things that I've done is deeply invested in the telemetry and the data.

740
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:48,820
Yes.

741
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:59,540
Because one of the ways to really accelerate the team is to kill the theoretical discussions.

742
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,410
More than hours, I would say – I'm old.

743
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:15,820
At this point in time, it probably is, months of my time in my career has just been lost

744
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,600
to theoretical triage discussions.

745
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:20,080
Yes.

746
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,200
Right?

747
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,600
And you know what?

748
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:27,860
It doesn't – it takes far less calendar time.

749
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,190
Like, this is the thing I think that is critical to hear, is what this principle

750
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:41,440
isn't just about – it actually isn't – we've talked about it being about acceleration and about

751
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,240
moving faster.

752
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:52,450
At the end of the day, what this is about is test has a responsibility in today's market

753
00:45:52,450 --> 00:46:00,720
to contribute to getting to the same goal and reducing the amount of calendar time it takes.

754
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,320
Yes.

755
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,400
We have not, as a society, figured out how to scale calendar time.

756
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,720
In Principle 1, we talk about being a business value, and our focus is improving the business.

757
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,440
And one of the primary ways we improve the business is by accelerating the team, by

758
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,400
accelerating our ability to get feedback on what we're building.

759
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:21,740
Yes.

760
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,300
And you're right.

761
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,060
Retrospectives is absolutely valuable, one of the most critical questions.

762
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,540
Like, yes, you're right on something I said five minutes ago.

763
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,740
That was awesome, Brent.

764
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,060
Thank you.

765
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,020
I was just tying it all back together.

766
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:35,500
Book ending is what they call it in the business.

767
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,020
I don't know the business.

768
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:37,980
I don't know the business.

769
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:42,930
Yeah, and you completely caused me to forget what the hell I was.

770
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,050
That's because you're old.

771
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,770
It is.

772
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,170
Although chronologically, I'm older, you're older.

773
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,450
Probably.

774
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,300
It's all the – yeah.

775
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:55,460
Okay, Brent is, I think, ready for his nap.

776
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:55,860
Stunned.

777
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:04,670
And I hope that all three listeners got an idea of why this principle is important,

778
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:10,030
or why we think it's important, and things you can do to exercise that principle.

779
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:15,390
I think one of the things that we may need to just already retrospectively

780
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:22,510
thinking about this podcast, we may need to start calling them medium dives.

781
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:23,550
It's not really a deep dive.

782
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:23,950
Yeah.

783
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:24,590
Okay.

784
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:25,950
Well, there's no official title.

785
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:27,710
We're going to dive into each one.

786
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,710
I think the discussion is – Drill in.

787
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,510
Drill in, yeah.

788
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,910
Lean in, drill in.

789
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:33,470
I don't know.

790
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:33,630
Yeah.

791
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:36,030
Anyway, we just did one.

792
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,350
Okay, whatever it was, you tell us what to call it.

793
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,190
I can't wait for the next one.

794
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,080
It should be exciting.

795
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,080
Okay.

796
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:46,960
All right, everyone.

797
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,120
We'll see you next time on AB Testing.

798
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,760
Bye.
