1
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,850
Hey everybody!

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,850
Howdy!

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,850
I'm Alan.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:12,850
I'm Brent.

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,500
And today is episode 53.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,300
Today is January 20th.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,540
Today is January 20th, not if you're listening.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,500
If you're listening, don't go adjust your calendar.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,460
But we're recording this simultaneous with the presidential inauguration and the beginning

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,420
of Alan's last day at work at Microsoft.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,420
Yes.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,140
We can record this and you can get it edited and out.

13
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,460
Perhaps people will have something amusing to do today.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,770
It's not going out today.

15
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:46,770
I'll tell you that.

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,610
I have crap to do all day today.

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:50,770
We'll get back to that later.

18
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,770
Maybe.

19
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,770
Yes.

20
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,770
I don't know.

21
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,010
I tweeted this morning that I said, hey, I was watching the inauguration preparation

22
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,690
this morning and Obama has a staff to help him move out.

23
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,330
I have a gym bag in my car.

24
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,110
I'm hoping everything I have left fits in there.

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,110
You have employees.

26
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,110
I know.

27
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,670
Have you not really learned how to use these guys yet?

28
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:14,230
You thought I was a good manager.

29
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,230
Wrong.

30
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,430
Wrong.

31
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,190
By the way, I told you I submitted your connect.

32
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,190
Not yet.

33
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,670
I hit send in an hour.

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:26,150
Oh, no, they're all done.

35
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,480
I'm all done.

36
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,000
Hey, this episode of A.B.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,030
Testing.

38
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,030
Big milestone.

39
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,250
Why?

40
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,780
What's the milestone?

41
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,840
53, is it a prime number?

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
It might be.

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
I tried to stump the math major.

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
I don't know.

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
I have to have a calculator.

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
53, does it divide by?

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
No.

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
No.

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,840
I think not.

50
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
I think it's prime.

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
Yeah, I'm looking forward to being 53.

52
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,640
I haven't been a prime number in a while.

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Age wise.

54
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Yeah, I'm not looking forward to it.

55
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,240
Oh, I don't know what the milestone, but today's episode is brought to you by Techwell, the

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,280
company that brings you the wonderful Star Conferences.

58
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,800
Star, and many other conferences.

59
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,920
So we've talked about Star Conferences before, and Star East is coming up.

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,640
Not coming up right away, but time to start making travel plans.

61
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
It's in May.

62
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,220
Where is it?

63
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,500
It's in Orlando, the home of Harry Potter World and Disney World and many attractions.

64
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,500
Orlando in May.

65
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,640
Orlando is a good time to be there.

66
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,280
So that's May 5th to 12th.

67
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,240
And as our listeners know, Star East is one of the longest running and most respected conferences

68
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,240
on software and testing.

69
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,160
It's probably the biggest, I don't know of a software testing conference that has more

70
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
people there.

71
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,160
No.

72
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:53,400
And one of the things that I continue to espouse, something, say something about Star Conferences.

73
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Preach.

74
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Preach.

75
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Preach is the word.

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Proselytize.

77
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:05,560
Star Coffee, which is not empty enough for me to be on full Allen speed, but one of the

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,560
biggest values I get from conferences is the networking and talking to people and talking

79
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
to speakers.

80
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,000
If you go to these conferences and just sit in the back of the, if you go to talks

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,080
and just sit in the back and take notes, you're not getting the full value.

82
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,820
You really need to talk to people and see what they're doing and get those experiences.

83
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,920
The talks will give you plenty of good ideas on things you can do.

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,360
For me, the bridge between even the most experiential talk, taking that from something

85
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,420
that you've listened and were motivated by to something you can do that connection is

86
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,360
often made just by talking to others.

87
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:50,360
The Star East, the Star Program, unlike other conferences we may have talked about on the

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,560
AB testing podcast, the Star is paying attention to how the world is moving.

89
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:06,560
So, not only will you pick up and help establish a network, and quite honestly, if you have

90
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,550
been in the industry, if you've been in the industry and you get to the 10 plus year

91
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:19,550
milestone, if you haven't built up a network, you're really hurting your career.

92
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:26,990
Working on that network, getting associated with people who have similar likes and tastes

93
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,790
in other companies grows your options.

94
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:34,310
Going to Star is also going to help you be more valuable.

95
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:43,310
It's going to help you understand and pick up the learnings of how testing is done in

96
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,470
today times, not 1993.

97
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,470
Sure.

98
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,190
There may be some 93 there, but not much.

99
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,190
The thing is, you can learn to differentiate that.

100
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,870
If you get enough information, you begin to form your own opinions.

101
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,810
One thing, first before we go any farther, I'll mention this again, but as usual, if

102
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,850
you want to go to Star, we recommend it, use the promo code AB testing.

103
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,650
AB testing, one word.

104
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:10,450
AB testing, one word, 200 bucks off.

105
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,450
Two hundred.

106
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,490
You go to your boss, say, I want to go to this conference, and he goes, yeah, it

107
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,010
approves and goes, and I can get $200 off.

108
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:23,370
I have that money for extra expenses and nice dinners and drinks.

109
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,370
Try and work that out.

110
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,730
Upgrade to first class, depending on where you're flying out of, I guess.

111
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,730
Yeah.

112
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,440
Lots of different topics, test automation, agile testing, which I'll talk about a

113
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,840
little bit more in a minute, perf testing, leadership, more.

114
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,520
They've done this a couple times now, but a full day bonus session on women in test,

115
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,920
which I think is really cool.

116
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,920
Oh, speaking of which, because we do tangents, there is nationwide women's

117
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,680
march tomorrow should be, I think it's like a million women in Washington, D.C.,

118
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,680
just doing a silent march down the walk, but down the mall.

119
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,580
And then there are every city has these things just to support, not just to

120
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,500
support women, but equal rights for everyone.

121
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,700
And some of the worries we have in the change in leadership and where some of

122
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,780
those equal rights may go.

123
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:19,940
And as the first day of my one week retirement and my nine day retirement,

124
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,740
I'm going to take place in the women's march tomorrow.

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,040
Where?

126
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,760
It starts in Judkin, Spark, and Seattle, in the Seattle one.

127
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,320
Oh, okay.

128
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,320
Quick flight to Washington, D.C.

129
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,560
Yeah.

130
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,480
I'm like, really?

131
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,280
We better hurry up this podcast.

132
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
So yeah.

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,200
You're walking.

134
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,640
I'm going to go do that and support equal rights for everyone.

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,400
I think it'll be largely women there, but I think, you know, people of all genders,

136
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,440
races, it would be silly to have a right of walk for equal rights and then not

137
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,960
exclude some people from attending.

138
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,080
So there'll be several men there as well.

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,880
My son's going to walk with us.

140
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,800
Whole family is going to go just to, I think it'd be a good experience for all

141
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,360
of us back to star again, promo code AB testing, lots of exhibitions, et cetera.

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Really, if you want to get like an onslaught of different ideas and testing,

143
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,640
you know, I'm a big fan of the peer, the smaller peer conferences where you can

144
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,600
have a lot of one-to-one discussions.

145
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,600
You can make those happen at STAR, but the great thing about STAR is if I want

146
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,720
to suck in all kinds of information, it's a great place for that.

147
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:34,560
And we know that Lee also pays attention to other conference styles.

148
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,160
Absolutely.

149
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,360
Yeah.

150
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,880
Right.

151
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Alan mentioned when he came back from Test Bash that Lee interrogated him on what

152
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,880
was a positive negative.

153
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,080
So I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing some of those other aspects of

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,680
those conferences fold into STAR.

155
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,040
I bet they would.

156
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,160
Yeah.

157
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,040
He wants to know, when he sees that go to a different conference, he goes,

158
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,200
who was a good speaker?

159
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Who should I get for a STAR conference?

160
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,760
He's always trying to upgrade and get some new blood in there.

161
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,480
Wasn't it STAR that, cause you're the one that introduced me to this concept.

162
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,360
Wasn't STAR that introduced you to the concept of the lightning talks?

163
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah.

164
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,600
The lightning talks happen every time, but it's not.

165
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,800
I've been doing lightning talks for longer.

166
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,320
Okay.

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,800
But every STAR, they have one keynote session, which is all lightning talks,

168
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,000
five minute talks, which I love.

169
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,280
A great way to, one, for people to get up and just get an idea across that maybe

170
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,160
isn't appropriate for a full talk, but man, talk about onslaught of ideas.

171
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,560
Uh, one thing, STAR doesn't do this.

172
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,870
Nobody does it, but when I've gone to conferences, uh, again, tangent, uh,

173
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,220
I've always thought that, that, uh, the hour talk is a little too long.

174
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,120
Some people, I would love to go...

175
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,920
Lots of science on that one.

176
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,920
Is there really?

177
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,360
Oh yeah.

178
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,280
I would love to go to a conference full of half hour talks.

179
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,760
Like the TED talk 22 minutes, wasn't just some number they pulled out of the

180
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,300
air, right?

181
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,100
There's research, research behind that.

182
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:07,640
So I, I'm waiting for that.

183
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,360
Maybe Lee, if you're, if not, if, when you're listening, there's something to

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,040
consider, maybe have one track.

185
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,200
That's all 22 minute talks or do one day of the conference or, or a morning

186
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,440
session where all the talks are 22 minutes with an eight minute passing period.

187
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,640
I think it would be very interesting.

188
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,520
There's more structure to the, to have you ever, uh, look this up?

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,600
That's not just 22 minutes.

190
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,840
Do I, do I look like someone who looks things up?

191
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,680
Actually I do.

192
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,760
I know you things up.

193
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,040
Um, just not necessarily the same things I do.

194
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,760
Um, there's a, I don't have the hard drive space for that.

195
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,560
By the way, uh, not yet, but I sent you my, my computer specs for tangent number

196
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,120
four.

197
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:51,840
Yeah.

198
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,480
And, uh, I order parts from my computer, a few upgrades from what you had and a

199
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,880
few things I didn't get didn't get a raid array of SSDs.

200
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:06,120
Um, I got one down the video card and what I, which is fine.

201
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,440
You got the, like the super, oh my God, fast mega.

202
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,640
There is one more better.

203
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
But the coolness was not worth the price tag.

204
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,040
But I didn't get an M2.

205
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,480
Um, I got the, uh, the new Intel Kaby Lake processor, so a little faster processor.

206
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,730
Okay.

207
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:24,150
What'd you do for MB motherboard?

208
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,110
Oh, I got, um, an Asus Z270.

209
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,910
So I like the Asus.

210
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:34,870
Um, yeah, I like there by, I, uh, there's a lot of tangent upon tangent.

211
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,590
It's tangents all the way down.

212
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:39,420
Uh, yeah.

213
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,900
Anyway, I, I've, I've, I've been an Asus user.

214
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,620
I decided to go with Asus cause I'm used to it and I knew I know the bio.

215
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,940
Well, you mentioned rate array.

216
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,460
I didn't buy a rate array.

217
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,140
My motherboard already had that, but I didn't buy like a whole bunch of, uh,

218
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,580
SSDs to just bought two really big ones and then I striped them.

219
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,220
Yeah.

220
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,700
Okay.

221
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:05,420
So anyway, oh star, oh promo code AB testing may, may, uh, Orlando,

222
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,060
200 bucks off AB testing.

223
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,340
Let's talk a little bit about a couple of the agile test sessions there.

224
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,680
If you don't mind, Brett, actually I'll start off.

225
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,400
What is agile testing?

226
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,420
Why it's just testing as fast as you can.

227
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,740
Right.

228
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,580
Shut the hell up.

229
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,960
Actually, before we go into that one.

230
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:35,260
So as, as you mentioned, uh, it's, it's Obama's last day.

231
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,340
Today we were recording on Alan's last day.

232
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,660
That is all correct.

233
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,100
And before we get much further, I have a gift for you.

234
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,740
We're still talking about star, but okay.

235
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,500
No.

236
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,940
Well, yeah, we're talking about star, but it comes with cups.

237
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,900
Should I worry?

238
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,800
This is the sound of paper coming out.

239
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,960
Oh shit.

240
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,400
It's tequila.

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,320
I think Brent and I are actually drinking tequila during AB testing today.

242
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,450
Happy inauguration day, everybody.

243
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:04,810
Yes.

244
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,410
I wanted to, I wanted to get that out while there was still an

245
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,970
opportunity for Alan to say the forbidden words.

246
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,330
We've talked about this before.

247
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:25,560
I have in my hands here for those who thought the video feed second of all,

248
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,720
second of all, stop looking for the video feed.

249
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,520
There isn't one is a nice bottle.

250
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,800
Oh, yes.

251
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,860
Uh, this is, I don't drink a lot of hard alcohol, but the hard

252
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,760
alcohol that I adore is tequila.

253
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,400
And I have a bottle of, uh, uh, patron on yay.

254
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,520
Oh, which I don't like the Blanco.

255
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,520
So very, very nice.

256
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,120
Oh, good.

257
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,760
This is beautiful.

258
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,920
For those it's a patron gold.

259
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,200
Yeah.

260
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,480
Holy cow.

261
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,090
I'll bring it home.

262
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,570
My, my wife also likes tequila.

263
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,270
She may just take it from me, but I'm going to hide it in my room, which

264
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,850
makes feel a little weird to have like hidden.

265
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,530
I'm not an alcoholic.

266
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:08,930
I'm not.

267
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,130
I just really love to be drunk all the time.

268
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,450
I don't know how to get, I'll work on getting it open while we talk,

269
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,850
maybe talk about, uh, get back into the topic here.

270
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,450
Yep.

271
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,330
We're doing the age old trick of using your key as a knife.

272
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,040
As a saw, I don't have a key.

273
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,880
I just have a remote that shaped like a car.

274
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,090
Hear that?

275
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,080
I'll do that again for the camera for the microphone.

276
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,940
So you remember, um, there's like four half the bottle in each cup.

277
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,760
So you remember the, the, the, uh, the drink I invented.

278
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,760
What's the drink you invented, Brent?

279
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,840
It's N shots of Patron.

280
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,120
I call it the group hug.

281
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,160
It's a group hug men can do.

282
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,400
All right.

283
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,160
Uh, to my last day at Microsoft, little toast with plastic cups.

284
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,360
Do a fake clink here.

285
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:23,490
Cheers, Alan.

286
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:23,850
Cheers.

287
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:29,450
Oh, that is so good.

288
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,010
It is.

289
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,090
All right.

290
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,650
So what do you want to talk about?

291
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:35,050
Well, I talked about this before, but

292
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:36,850
Oh, shot.

293
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:44,230
No, I wanted to dive a little bit into a couple of the agile testing sessions at

294
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:48,230
star East coming up in may code AB testing.

295
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,950
We'll get you 200 bucks off Orlando in Orlando.

296
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,040
Um, so I don't know how much you follow the work of Bob Galen.

297
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Uh, he's done a lot of work around agile testing and agile, agile in general,

298
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,600
figuring out how testers of today fit into agile of tomorrow or really

299
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,720
testers of yesterday fit into agile of today.

300
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:08,520
Right.

301
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,360
Uh, given a couple of tutorials and talks around, uh, agile testing team

302
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,160
tactics that deliver the goods along with Mary thorn and also with Mary thorn

303
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,000
agile test team leadership from concept to product.

304
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,560
And then he's giving also a talk on test automation strategies for the agile world.

305
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,280
So, uh, jumping back to the question I had before, we're gonna give me a real

306
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,560
answer.

307
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,400
So what do you, what is agile testing?

308
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,220
I asked, cause I think it's one of those things that can mean some

309
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,480
different things to different people.

310
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:45,900
Um, I don't want to try to invent a concept, right?

311
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:53,710
The real, the reality is, um, so when I went to Bing, I went to the dev team,

312
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,660
as we talked about, um, throughout the podcasts on combined engineering.

313
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,280
Um, I didn't have a test team and I wouldn't go back to that world.

314
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:14,750
The, the, the discussion he's talking about here is I believe where you have

315
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,870
still the separation of teams, but you operate in an agile world.

316
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,510
Or you have an embedded tester on an agile team.

317
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,470
Yeah.

318
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,310
The, um, it's probably, I, I think that is a concept used more often.

319
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,020
I, perhaps you have, but I haven't observed, uh, a team that calls

320
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:42,620
themselves agile that has, um, split discipline that just, that doesn't do

321
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,980
waterfall with sprints.

322
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,750
I think so.

323
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,950
I think, but to me, we're talking about agile.

324
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:54,590
One of the concepts that I think you've got from safe, which I've loved is this

325
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:59,990
idea of, uh, waterfall is predictive and then you can do iterative development.

326
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:01,950
But agile is adaptive.

327
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,370
And when I think the role of a tester on an agile team,

328
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,530
which is another way of saying agile testing is their role is to be adaptive

329
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,970
and to do adaptive testing, figure out what testing needs to get done.

330
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,130
And you look at sort of the role on my current team for about six more hours.

331
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,030
And my role has been very much to figure out what testing needs to be done.

332
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,430
Uh, no matter who it's done by.

333
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,270
So there's like agile test leadership.

334
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,470
Maybe that's a little bit of it, but I think there's a lot of things to

335
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,400
learn around sort of what, what is the role of someone?

336
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,160
What is the role of a test specialist on an agile team?

337
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,860
If I were to decompose it again, um, I would prefer to have to see some direct

338
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,940
experience on this, to see teams succeeding in this, but if I were to decompose it,

339
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:59,420
like agile at its nature is about breaking things into smaller shippable chunks and

340
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,060
focusing on ROI first.

341
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:08,540
So with testing, if you apply that to testing, then you would have a team that's,

342
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:18,030
um, not only working on the, the high ROI, uh, dev code that we're sending out,

343
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,870
but also focusing on the high ROI test cases moving now.

344
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:32,380
It would also in my, uh, vision of this, it would also generally tend towards

345
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:40,470
um, reactive strategies, not preventative strategies.

346
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:48,490
Meaning much of how we do testing in 1993 was we tested everything and we tried

347
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:49,610
to stop it from shipping.

348
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,360
Uh, in 2017, I wouldn't be trying to stop shipping.

349
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:05,420
I would be trying to maximize the, um, or to minimize the amount of risk that is

350
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,120
still valuable agreed.

351
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,440
I just remembered, uh, that it's been like six years ago.

352
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,680
I was still in engineering excellence.

353
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,920
So at least six, maybe seven years ago.

354
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,960
Uh, I remember I gave several talks to intact talks to teams when the premise was

355
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,750
this, Hey, my team is doing agile and I'm not sure what to do.

356
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,670
Testors were sure what to have the testers do.

357
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:38,170
And given in, in many ways, to be clear, Microsoft is behind the industry in many

358
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,410
things, but as far as dev practice is usually ahead of the curve, I would imagine

359
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:47,370
that there are several, maybe not of the three because they know what they're

360
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,950
doing, but many, many testers out there who are team is moving to agile and

361
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,710
they're not sure what to do going to sessions like this.

362
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,790
We'll get you some ideas.

363
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,070
Yeah.

364
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,310
Where do good ideas come from?

365
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,820
Uh, multiple ideas coming together.

366
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,460
Other ideas.

367
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,510
So you need to go, if you're not sure what to do, go suck in the information

368
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,310
from all these sessions, merge it with what you've learned on your own team

369
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,750
and come up with your own plan on what, what is the best way to be valuable

370
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,070
as a tester on an agile team.

371
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:19,150
And for those going through that immediate transition that you're just

372
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,110
talking about that the answer to that is relatively easy.

373
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,670
Uh, you can even use what you've done in the last year as an example.

374
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:35,470
Your primary job is to pass on your knowledge to the individual developers.

375
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:44,430
Your primary job is to teach those developers how to do their new part of,

376
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,990
of these new testing requirements, uh, so that you can scale to an agile world.

377
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,350
Right.

378
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:59,870
Um, imagine, so if we were to say agile world, uh, with a test agile testing

379
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,480
in a world with continuous deployment, right?

380
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,720
That's the thing that, that I think testers today, if you don't have a

381
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,520
team that you're on continuous deployment, start researching this because.

382
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,720
That product development model with continuous deployment, I can

383
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,080
guarantee you is in your future.

384
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,240
And you have an opportunity right now to be the expert and help set the

385
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,200
stage and be ready to run when it lands.

386
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:30,680
Yeah.

387
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,480
I think the test role can, can be, or really should be the most valuable

388
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,560
role on an agile team, someone to eat that system thinker.

389
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,040
It's almost becomes an architect type role where you're the person looking

390
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,960
at how everything fits together end to end.

391
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,960
And I guarantee there are teams out there that say they're doing agile

392
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,910
and they have a tester on the team and they, everyone checks in code and

393
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:59,790
sends mail or a message to that tester saying test this, I just checked it in.

394
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,190
That's wrong.

395
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,910
You want to get some ideas on what's the right way to do that?

396
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,750
Uh, I think there are probably a lot of things, uh, like it's been

397
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:12,910
10 years ago at Microsoft, I introduced, uh, my team to unit testing.

398
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:13,750
Yep.

399
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:14,390
That's crazy.

400
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,750
Cause most people do it for a lot longer.

401
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,890
And then I had developers on the team saying, Hey, if we're running a

402
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,450
unit test, what's the test team going to do?

403
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,770
And after I recovered from slamming my fist into my face, uh, I told them,

404
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:34,720
yeah, um, you know, that was a long time ago for me now, but it's,

405
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,160
the memories are still, they come back quickly.

406
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,840
So I think as teams, uh, get into like, I guess guarantee there are a lot

407
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,280
of testers will be at start says my team's doing agile.

408
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:47,960
I'm not sure what to do.

409
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,000
My team's doing agile.

410
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,120
It doesn't feel right.

411
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,720
You know, it's, it's painful for the testers.

412
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,640
I think listening to what Bob Galen and Mary Thorin have to say and other

413
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,840
talks at star is going to help out a lot and give you ideas to be successful and

414
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,400
not just successful, but to change culture on your team.

415
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,600
I think that's super important.

416
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:15,220
I think one of the most important things that agile testing or, or testing

417
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,980
in an agile world really helps to do is again, this ROI focus, right?

418
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:25,530
You brought up this, this scenario that, that happened to both of us where we were

419
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,290
knee deep in a transformation stage and we got pegged with questions from Dev.

420
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,570
Hey, if I'm doing unit tests, what is test doing?

421
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,330
Okay.

422
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:41,640
And part of your ROI, the ROI, you don't get to define it.

423
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,160
The ROI of your job, the ROI of what you produce, you don't get to define it.

424
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,470
It's defined by, by those you serve.

425
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,670
Okay.

426
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,870
And if Dev is coming to you and it's a common practice and saying, Hey, if

427
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:02,960
test goes away, or if I pick up unit tests, what does test do?

428
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,860
That's a clue.

429
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,940
The ROI of testing in your environment is wrong.

430
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:15,500
The ROI of testing in your environment is to do the, uh, the crap work

431
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,380
that Dev doesn't want to do or to be the scapegoat for the organization.

432
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:25,500
Um, these are not valuable to any business whatsoever.

433
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,570
And certainly none in this world.

434
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,220
Totally agree.

435
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,740
So anyway, highly recommended, uh, regardless of whether your team is doing

436
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,020
agile, you're at your agile pro or just want to learn a lot about testing.

437
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,990
Star East Orlando, May 5th through 12th code AB testing, all one word,

438
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:47,910
200 bucks off.

439
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,130
All right.

440
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,650
Go right.

441
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:51,690
Thank you.

442
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,690
Tech well and star.

443
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,010
I'm actually, I need to do a star conferences here.

444
00:24:56,450 --> 00:25:01,140
So Alison Lee, anyone, if you're listening, um, I'm open.

445
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,180
Just let me know.

446
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,000
I'd have some free time.

447
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:04,400
Who knows?

448
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,680
Uh, let's move on.

449
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,600
So as we mentioned before, I think we already covered the fact that, uh,

450
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,520
Obama and I both have the same last day at work.

451
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,660
In fact, we have to end here a little early so I can listen to the

452
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,780
inauguration speech on the way back to my office because apparently

453
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,860
Trump wrote his own.

454
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,500
Yeah.

455
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,820
Which means there should be filled with gold.

456
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,060
It will be on YouTube.

457
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,700
Be it later with auto tune, et cetera.

458
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,960
So, uh, let's, oh my gosh, we should talk a lot about my new job,

459
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
which I haven't started yet.

460
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,180
Uh, and then go to the mail bag.

461
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,140
So one thing I wanted to mention, not on the board, a little bit more about, oh,

462
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,900
by the way, I'm wearing a unity t-shirt today.

463
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,680
Nice.

464
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,310
I had a breakfast yesterday with my bot, my new boss's boss, uh, who was in town.

465
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,430
He's based in Copenhagen.

466
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,310
Oh, he's Danish.

467
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:03,790
No, I don't think he is.

468
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,350
Oh.

469
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:12,860
So I'm, I became even more excited.

470
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,340
First, the product's cool.

471
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,100
People love it.

472
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:20,330
Uh, but it is, it just sounds like a really cool place to work.

473
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,330
I have to tell you one thing, uh, a couple of things he said that were really

474
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,930
interesting and you can compare and contrast him with Microsoft.

475
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,490
He said there's no, there's so globally distributed, distributed.

476
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,490
They have like, they're only like, I thought they were bigger.

477
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,730
I thought there were 3000 people.

478
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:37,490
They're about 1400 people, about 450 engineers ish.

479
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:41,330
Uh, but they have like 12, 15 offices around the corner.

480
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,410
The biggest office is like 250.

481
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:44,130
Okay.

482
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,820
And he said, there's no way in an org like this could be top down.

483
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,180
Everything is bottom up.

484
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:55,460
People have, and I've talked about my role at Microsoft for the last 15 years

485
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,820
as I figure out what needs to get done.

486
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,420
And I do that.

487
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,100
And that's the role of pretty much everyone at unity.

488
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:01,590
Nice.

489
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,070
He says, uh, if you show up and there's something else you want to do that, go

490
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,590
do that.

491
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,060
And then he told me a great story, which I told my life before she cracked

492
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,340
up is just cause she's, uh, you know, been with me for most of my career at

493
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,940
Microsoft and she gets what the soft is like, but to get an idea of how

494
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,380
non top down they are, he says, so if you come ask me permission to do something,

495
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:24,140
the first time I'm going to go, I'm going to write it off and, you know,

496
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,260
give you a little guidance on, on how you can make your own choices.

497
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,180
As long as you're not like losing the company money, you know,

498
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,500
make your choices and move on.

499
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,700
We were blind people to do that.

500
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,260
He goes the second time.

501
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,900
I, we're going to have a long talk about it.

502
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,180
And if you come to me a third time asking for permission for something,

503
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,980
I'm going to fire you.

504
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,390
It was worth the exact words.

505
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,110
Pretty close.

506
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,110
He did say fire.

507
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:54,070
So, uh, which I love because I, uh, I do want to be held accountable for my

508
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,870
decisions, but if you, I've been doing this long enough, um, and thought that

509
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,750
even experience wise, but as a knowledge worker, as someone who has experienced

510
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:07,070
at all, I should be able to make my own decisions.

511
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,710
I shouldn't have to go ask for everything.

512
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:09,990
You shouldn't.

513
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:13,230
I mean, um, there's a way to balance that if necessary.

514
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:13,710
I'm sure that.

515
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:13,950
Yeah.

516
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:14,830
Right.

517
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,830
And I'm sure once I get there, I will find out there are checks and balances

518
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:20,990
in place to make sure I can make decisions that won't like wreck the

519
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,630
company or, or you know, cost a million dollars.

520
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,670
One of the practices.

521
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,070
Um, I did order a gold plated laptop.

522
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,700
Seems like the right business decision.

523
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,620
I did not.

524
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,180
I'm kidding.

525
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,660
It, well, yeah, I mean, it's not gold plated solid gold.

526
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,940
The, there's two things that.

527
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:45,860
Just a minute.

528
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
Did we talk about this before?

529
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,420
I think we did.

530
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,870
What you, your story from unity.

531
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,630
No, nope.

532
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,230
I watched one excuse, take a drink.

533
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:54,870
Oh, gotcha.

534
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:04,060
I actually had a discussion with, um, one of my peers, uh, the other day who,

535
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,820
who is struggling with their manager.

536
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:10,140
And he, and he came to me and he's like, Brent, what should I do?

537
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,330
And I said, here's, here's my philosophy on management.

538
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,540
Managers are split into three people, three types in general for me,

539
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,140
people like me, three types.

540
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:29,440
Number one manager generally agrees and does what I say, right?

541
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,680
Uh, from a bottoms up organization, I don't mean does what I say from like

542
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:40,040
a Napoleonic complex, I mean, from a bottoms up, there is an expectation

543
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,780
that I know more about my business than my manager does and that I have

544
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,300
experience and I'm not just guessing.

545
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:55,340
And I have, um, the right set of standards where I care and are deeply,

546
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:58,380
and I'm deeply focused on the business goals.

547
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,980
So one thing is the manager just generally agrees with what I say.

548
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,050
Okay.

549
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:08,960
Um, second, no op, a no op manager.

550
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,640
Doesn't really block me from moving forward.

551
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,400
Doesn't really help me.

552
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,940
Um, I'm fine with that manager as well.

553
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:24,820
Like I ideally the one that's going to help a work actively with me towards

554
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,340
a common goal, I'd prefer that, but failing that a no op is better.

555
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:34,900
The third is a blocking manager where they block either by their action or inaction.

556
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,620
Blocking managers.

557
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,860
And when I'm, and he went into, he asked me, what do you mean by

558
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,500
inaction?

559
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,260
I said, Oh, that's very easy.

560
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:47,580
So blocking manager, number one, if he, if he comes to you and says no all the

561
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,540
time, they're a blocking manager.

562
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,420
You can't live in that environment.

563
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,780
There is that's a heuristic, your style and your manager style are not aligned.

564
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:01,580
So either you'd need to change as Alan said, last time you needed to change your

565
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,420
manager or you need to change your manager.

566
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:07,270
Um, and Brent eventually figured out what that meant.

567
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:07,870
I did.

568
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,950
The, but the other style of blocking is the passive aggressive style where you

569
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:22,390
feel like you, you need to get permission from your manager and they defer a choice.

570
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,000
Which is just the worst.

571
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,840
That is the worst.

572
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,550
Um, and I said, like, look, in that particular case, if you feel like you

573
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,150
really cannot own your business and move forward without permission from your

574
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:43,870
manager and they're constantly delaying this, then try this.

575
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:50,190
Uh, for example, uh, he was told, uh, that he had an opportunity that his manager

576
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,670
was going to prop them up for a specific leadership team and that action

577
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,550
hadn't been taken yet.

578
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,830
And that day was this one on one.

579
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,660
I'm like, go to him and say, Hey, I like this action.

580
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,340
You haven't taken it yet.

581
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,740
Can you tell me who I need to talk to?

582
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,380
How do I reduce the friction so that the action you need to take is much smaller.

583
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,780
I'll go talk to them and get myself on and, um, they can come back and confirm

584
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,140
with you that you sponsored it.

585
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,200
Right.

586
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,080
And he's like, well, he's just going to say, Oh, no, I should do it.

587
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,750
And I'm like, you got to be more assertive and say, look, you said that last time

588
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,350
time's taken, let's move forward.

589
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:28,730
I'll take it.

590
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,330
You're busy.

591
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,010
But you don't have to be rude about it.

592
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,010
Hey, you keep ignoring me that you don't have to be a ass about it.

593
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:38,930
You just go, look, I see that you're super busy.

594
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,090
I'll take it.

595
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,930
It's in my better interest to take it.

596
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:42,850
I'll take the section.

597
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:47,530
Um, but if you find that you can't even do that, it's, it's time to go.

598
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:52,450
One of the things that drives me, just drives me nuts is anyone in a, and

599
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,210
again, there's a difference between management and leadership and, but

600
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,710
all managers should have at least a little bit of leadership.

601
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,910
So many of the great leaders, all managers should be at least

602
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,830
have some leadership qualities.

603
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:11,040
Uh, and to me, one of the attributes a leader needs is an ability to make decisions.

604
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,350
Regardless of the amount of input they have drives me crazy.

605
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,150
When people can't make decisions, he can make decisions.

606
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,750
He's make he, he made the decision to prop them up.

607
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,310
It's acting on the decision.

608
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,670
That was the, the, the problem here.

609
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,800
Um, and I babble long enough.

610
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,140
There was another point I was going to bring up, but I forgotten it.

611
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,180
Oh, great.

612
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,460
Should we, uh, do we have two mail bags?

613
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:45,140
Uh, we might, if we have the time, let's go, let's do the, um, let's do the first one

614
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,580
and I'll, I'll load it up.

615
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,060
All right.

616
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,380
This is the one from test Pappy or the other one.

617
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,060
Okay.

618
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,460
We'll do that one.

619
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,180
I have it up already.

620
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,580
So, oh, almost forgot mail.

621
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,690
Actually, there was one comment on the Slack channel that, that, uh, that I enjoyed.

622
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,450
Did you not hear me say mail bag?

623
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:08,970
I did.

624
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:09,250
Okay.

625
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,130
What did you enjoy?

626
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,850
I'm going to do a mail baglet.

627
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:19,050
Oh, what, and, and I'll, I'll tangentize your mail baglet and say, uh, with the

628
00:34:19,050 --> 00:34:23,250
last episode, I actually posted it to the Slack channel, one of the three.slack.com.

629
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,010
Uh, a day ahead.

630
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:26,450
Yep.

631
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,290
This because I want, I wanted to give the three a heads up that about

632
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,530
the leaving Microsoft thing, but Brent said, you should do this all the time.

633
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,330
It's like the insider club.

634
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,010
And so we may do that.

635
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:44,260
I think I may, uh, I will, I will post our episodes to one of the three.slack.com.

636
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:49,060
I'll give the link there, uh, about a day before it goes, uh, for the blog post goes

637
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,260
out.

638
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,100
Yes.

639
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,060
So insider information, if you wanted, if you wanted a day early,

640
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,740
join the Slack channel.

641
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,700
Exactly.

642
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,380
If you don't want it at all, just, well, that one, I think is pretty easy to solve.

643
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,020
So could you read us, is it called a Slack clip?

644
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,300
Oh yeah.

645
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,520
The, uh, a brantlet.

646
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,040
Uh, it might've been a tangent looking tangent.

647
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,750
Canorum, norium, norium.

648
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:19,790
Okay.

649
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:27,100
Uh, suggested to me that I should try to find a different Alan at Microsoft.

650
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,420
Just so that we could keep the podcast.

651
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,570
Uh, Oh, the podcast is going to keep going just so that we can keep the

652
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,410
podcast, uh, Microsoft only, I guess.

653
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,530
Doesn't half the Microsoft only there was, that was never in our contract.

654
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,290
Oh, never.

655
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,650
And then it was, uh, there was a suggesting suggestion.

656
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,010
Then, well, then screw that find another bridge that unity.

657
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:51,290
Oh, that's a, there's a Brett.

658
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:52,580
Is there?

659
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,260
Yeah, that's my boss.

660
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,140
That's my boss's boss.

661
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,340
Yeah.

662
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,100
And then I'm like, I was thinking about, I was thinking about this idea about,

663
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:04,180
um, about finding another Alan.

664
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,410
There's lots of Alan's at Microsoft.

665
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,410
We have like, I mean,

666
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,370
now I said, you know what?

667
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:13,810
Now, if I were to do that, I wouldn't do another Alan.

668
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:20,740
I would probably, um, invite Steve Rowe partner with him on this.

669
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:24,100
Oh, it could be BS testing BS data science.

670
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:30,710
Okay.

671
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:32,750
It's like a pod.

672
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,110
It's like a podcast spinoff.

673
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,590
Yeah.

674
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,510
I bet you BS data science would actually get the four listeners.

675
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,830
And you're keeping the recording equipment in your office.

676
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,270
You could just like Steve come over.

677
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,350
One of us can figure this out.

678
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,270
It can't be that hard.

679
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,660
I bet you Steve could figure it out.

680
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,260
I like that BS testing.

681
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,340
Welcome to BS, BS data science.

682
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:56,710
Oh, that could happen.

683
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:58,270
All right.

684
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,070
Actually I had fully distracted myself.

685
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,670
So I already sang the male big song.

686
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,830
It seems like a long time ago, but I might have to cut and

687
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,190
paste it into this section.

688
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,950
So Patrick says, I can read it.

689
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,790
Go ahead.

690
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,230
Go ahead.

691
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,070
You're not a very good reader.

692
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,910
This is to sound out the big words.

693
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,620
It's it's time for reflection.

694
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,700
This is, this is Patrick.

695
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,860
It's time for reflection.

696
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,580
Alan said a couple of things about reasons and all in 52.

697
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,780
So I'd be interested in hearing a bit about personal habits.

698
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,540
Yeah, I'm a little uncomfortable with that one.

699
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:45,140
You, you, I'm not, keep going or ways of doing things.

700
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:52,050
What do you want to continue doing like at Microsoft and what

701
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,050
would you want to change immediately?

702
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:59,010
Do you find stuff in the past where you said, Oh, I want to try this, but in my

703
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:06,060
team, I'm not credible enough for doing that, that you now pull out from a drawer

704
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,540
and you try to give it a shot.

705
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,660
Now first, actually, I find that last question interesting.

706
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,420
Is there, was there any situation where you had a credibility problem?

707
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,380
No, I wouldn't imagine not in a long, long time.

708
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,180
Alan does what Alan wants, including talking about himself in the third

709
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,420
person, which is weird.

710
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,220
You do it in second person.

711
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,060
Oh, great.

712
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,020
So I haven't had that problem myself.

713
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:39,460
I'm pretty much depending on the scope of the change, you may have to do it in

714
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
smaller chunks or to a smaller audience.

715
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:47,840
Uh, but as far as credibility, that hasn't been a problem.

716
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,080
I've been able to try again, at least for like the last 10, maybe 15 years

717
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,840
at Microsoft, pretty much anything I want to do, if it's a big thing, I do it in

718
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,400
small chunks.

719
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,760
I don't do like everybody were doing this because I said so.

720
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,530
Uh, it's, I have a, again, one of the things you do in any leadership position,

721
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:13,730
whether it's a management position, just sort of a technical leader is you have

722
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,010
to figure out the best way to implement new ideas and it can be an all at once

723
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:22,450
thing, but often, especially in a big org, it's a small gradual thing or a thing

724
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,530
that you do either the whole thing across the org in small chunks, or you

725
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:30,730
do the thing with a pilot group of small people, small number of people.

726
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:36,650
I have found on the credibility topic that, uh, in particular, I could, I'm

727
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:43,050
guessing when Patrick brought this up, but I have found a problem with that.

728
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,770
This seems to be common in, in test, right?

729
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,650
Me on an easy solution.

730
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:54,770
Typically when, when, when test joins a new team, there is, it's far too common

731
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:00,130
that I've noticed where they operate of, of, well, it's obvious that I'm the

732
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:03,970
little man on the totem pole, therefore I'm going to have to earn credibility.

733
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,020
Right.

734
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,180
And so they, they themselves start with this idea that they are not credible.

735
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:16,550
Um, I recommend the more the fake it till you make it strategy.

736
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,110
That is the story of my life.

737
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:25,150
And that you start from the ground zero with, no, I am a leader in this space.

738
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,070
You hired me because I'm the expert.

739
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,110
I'm the credible one.

740
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:33,550
But you can, without getting defensive, but you can make a mistake there and go overboard.

741
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,870
You go, I'm the credible one.

742
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,710
We're doing this and this and this and this.

743
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:43,260
You still need to have small victories without leaving a wake of bodies in your.

744
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:43,740
No, no, no.

745
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,620
It's not about being dictatorial.

746
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,100
It's about, but you say it's not about being a dick.

747
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:49,540
What?

748
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,820
Dictatorial.

749
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:59,340
It's, this is going to be all touchy feely new agey crap, but

750
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,620
I'm going to step out of the room for a minute.

751
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,980
Another way of communicating it.

752
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:10,070
But when you step in, you got to think about your body language and you got to

753
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:17,670
emanate an aura of confidence and credibility and you, and not that you

754
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:25,120
have to earn it, but that you have it immediately and it can be taken from you.

755
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:26,850
Sure.

756
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,050
You have to, and what you earn is respect.

757
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:29,570
Right.

758
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,770
And you do that by making good decisions, not pissing people off, reading body

759
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:37,090
language, paying attention to how you're coming across.

760
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:43,250
And we've talked about this emotional quotient or, uh, which a lot of people

761
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,930
see as, Oh, I just need to make sure, uh, I'm not being a dick, but it's really

762
00:41:46,930 --> 00:41:50,970
about constantly evaluating how you're coming across these are leadership things.

763
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,530
And, and, and reading the reaction of people, uh, in the room and

764
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:59,530
reacting in real time, you do this as a speaker a lot in one way, but you do

765
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,970
it in a room full of peers or leaders as well too.

766
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:05,770
You, you can tell whether they're getting in there, approving, you can

767
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:09,730
look for head nods, you can look for eye rolls, you can, which are the obvious ones,

768
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:13,570
but there are other more subtle signs you can look for and you need to be

769
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:16,930
able to adjust the way you're coming across and adjust maybe your idea

770
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,890
or your goal in real time in order to get that buy-off.

771
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,850
So let's go back to the completely agree.

772
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:24,730
Let's go back to the, because I'm right.

773
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,370
The meat, I demand.

774
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:26,970
No, sorry.

775
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:32,570
So the meat of, I think Patrick's question primarily, although the, the

776
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,770
credibility was a talent tangent on my side.

777
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:35,610
Um,

778
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:36,810
that's so weird.

779
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,130
Cause we don't do tangents very often.

780
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:38,890
No, I know.

781
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:39,410
Sorry.

782
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:50,140
Um, what's something that that's a practice at Microsoft that you can't wait

783
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,020
to introduce unity to what's a practice at Microsoft that you can't wait

784
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,340
to never have to do again.

785
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:01,290
Those are tough questions because I, I haven't worked at unity.

786
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:03,690
So the way I work is very adaptive.

787
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,050
I'm going to look at what they're doing.

788
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,850
I'm not going to go in there and go, we're going to change things to my way.

789
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,770
The stupidest thing I could do, if we go in there and go, I have a way

790
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,940
of doing things that's the way we're going to do, darn it.

791
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,420
Uh, it's about learning and adapting and figuring out where we need to go.

792
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,100
Now I'm sure you're going to identify at least one practice from Microsoft

793
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,340
that unity could pick up and move forward on and then, and that you'll

794
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
probably take a boil the frog strategy.

795
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,140
That's this, this is typically how I've seen you do things.

796
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:30,580
Yeah.

797
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:36,010
I think, uh, there may be some things around, oh, wow, here's a, there's a

798
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,490
type of tool or type of tooling that they're not doing that would be really

799
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:41,530
advantageous and solve this big problem they're having.

800
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,770
Uh, but those are very situational sorts of things.

801
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,250
There aren't things like, Oh, I want to go make sure we have a, I'll just

802
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,370
question in the opposite.

803
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,850
I want to go make sure we have a really big bureaucratic process around

804
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,810
doing a lot of important things that get in your way.

805
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:01,370
You bring up bureaucratic process, but I've had several, um, friends of mine

806
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:05,490
that have left to, to their own versions of startup recently.

807
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:11,050
And it was interesting to me, um, particularly in one case, they wanted

808
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:14,890
me to come in and, um, do an interview loop.

809
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:20,570
So I went night, I did an informational and the one thing that was.

810
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,930
Puzzling was just how slow HR was in the getting that scheduled.

811
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,370
I was talking with the president, so he's a busy guy.

812
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:35,050
Um, I'm generally busy as well, but me and the president sort of closed on,

813
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:40,610
um, back and forth and whether or not I, I would be going to that company.

814
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:45,450
And then a week later, HR said, Hey, the president would like to talk to you.

815
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:46,370
Right.

816
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:52,820
So there's some of these processes that are common that I'm pretty sure you'll go.

817
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:55,320
Oh my God.

818
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,940
We, we went back to 1986 in terms of how we do some of these things and they

819
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:03,620
could be made efficient without being bureaucratic.

820
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:04,800
All right.

821
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,000
So let me go back to Patrick's original question.

822
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,600
So what do you want to continue doing like Microsoft?

823
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:14,840
I'm sure it'll be in, ask me in two weeks for the next podcast and I'll

824
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
be able to name some things.

825
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,840
Like here's something that worked well at Microsoft that actually is, I'm going

826
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,800
to implement in my work at unity, but there's no, there isn't like, I'm not

827
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:27,920
bringing anything with me in my bag of tricks at like, let's do, let's do this

828
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:28,240
thing.

829
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,990
Uh, and what do you want to change immediately?

830
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,830
I, again, it's the way I work.

831
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,670
This is a tough question for me because I don't have like a toolbox that I

832
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:44,990
use and unfold and, and the only tool I use is, uh, learn what's going on and

833
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,830
adapt, take everything I know going back to, we're talking about a star, uh,

834
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:53,990
the benefits you get from a star, uh, learn what's going on and reach in my,

835
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,070
and reach in my big old toolbox and figure out what the right thing to do

836
00:45:58,070 --> 00:45:58,950
is for the situation.

837
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:03,190
So I don't have a good answer for you, but, um, but it is a good question.

838
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:06,230
So I, I think we should discuss that again in a few weeks.

839
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:10,470
Uh, I think it'll come up organically, but I don't know what

840
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,710
the answer is for those today.

841
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:22,510
I think the, so the way I see you operate and, and I don't know, because it's

842
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:30,890
kind of how I operate and so I may be, um, projecting, projecting, but both Alan

843
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:38,780
and myself, I think are fairly good at seeing the critical goal, right?

844
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:45,040
Uh, whether or not the team around us would agree with that goal, right?

845
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,160
If we, there are many times where I see, Oh, the, okay, this is a goal that

846
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,440
we clearly need to get to these, the guys that I'm working with do not have

847
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,960
experience if I were to tell them we're going to do this, they would all run

848
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,600
crazy scared, uh, it would bring up the credibility issues with Brent like,

849
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,760
Oh my God, he is well, so out there sort of crap.

850
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,540
Um, so once you have a clear insight on the goal, the, the next thing you

851
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,980
need to do is figure out where you're at.

852
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:15,300
Right.

853
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,670
You, you, it's like you're traveling across country, right?

854
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,670
The map.

855
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,270
Yeah.

856
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,390
If everyone wants to go to New York, that's great, but you know what, the

857
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,270
directions you're going to take depend on where you're coming from.

858
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:27,670
Yeah.

859
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:32,510
One of the models I use all the time for organizational changes, define the,

860
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:37,910
define the desired state, define the current state and figure out the map to

861
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:43,150
between and then realize that as soon as you start going down that road, the

862
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,910
road may change.

863
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:47,110
So if you think if you use your map analogy, if I'm in Seattle, I'm going

864
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:48,790
to New York and you say, okay, I want to go to New York.

865
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:49,350
It's here.

866
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,430
I want to go to Seattle.

867
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:50,950
It's here.

868
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:52,110
Here's the path I'm taking.

869
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,150
Oh, the road's closed.

870
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:53,950
Kevin, I go another way.

871
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:58,230
I'm going to change as I go along and adapt versus just stop.

872
00:47:58,910 --> 00:47:59,230
Right.

873
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:05,390
We're in Washington and for, for the global three, Washington, um,

874
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:09,290
Washington is in the Northwest of United States.

875
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,930
California is in the Southwest of the United States.

876
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:20,720
And if we know that metaphorically that we want to go to California, you know what?

877
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,320
Sometimes you have to do that by going North.

878
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,120
You can drive North to the Vancouver airport and take a flight.

879
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,740
Uh, if you have the right equipment, you could potentially find a way to

880
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,180
circumnavigate the world.

881
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:39,980
I don't, I don't think that's actually possible.

882
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,420
No, I'm just saying it's sometimes the journey and getting to the goal.

883
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,460
It's going to be a marathon, not a sprint.

884
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,980
And you can't be freaked out by that.

885
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,420
No.

886
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:54,450
Evaluate where you are.

887
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:56,370
Hey, I think we're about out of time, right?

888
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:56,730
We are.

889
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:00,850
Thank you very much for listening to episode 53 of A-B testing.

890
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:01,330
I'm Alan.

891
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,090
I'm Brent.

892
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,090
And we'll see you next time.

893
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,450
Congratulations, Alan.

894
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,250
Thank you.
