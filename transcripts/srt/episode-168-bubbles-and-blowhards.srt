1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
If you want to increase velocity, you can't view it as a development task.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,160
You got to view it as a quality task.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,520
In other words, development and testing of that code is the same friggin thing.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,100
Welcome to A.B.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,180
Testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:26,900
Your hosts, Alan and Brent will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,140
leadership, agile and anything else that comes to mind.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,940
Now on with the show.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,220
Did you know there's a button you can press to record?

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,680
I would assume so.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,480
It's the A.B.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,440
Testing podcast.

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,880
I am not Brent Jensen.

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,920
He's the other guy I'm Alan.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,440
And I am too.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,880
Nice.

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,640
Hey, you're good on my end.

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,490
Yeah, I'm squiggly.

19
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,890
Less weird.

20
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,170
Okay.

21
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,410
I, I, I am filled with squiggle and be I'm going to hope.

22
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,770
Um, so what we're talking about is we've been using Zen caster for the past

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,250
few weeks, I get a little better feed from the Brent Meister and all in all,

24
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,090
hopefully record ends up in a better sounding podcast.

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,690
But, um, Brent's not seeing little squiggly's, but I am hopefully we're

26
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,490
recording Brent.

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,690
Yes.

28
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,930
Actually, should we stop and test that?

29
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:18,890
No, no, no, we're good.

30
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,250
We're good.

31
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,730
Cause I'm recording you directly via the magic of USB as well.

32
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,090
I have a backup rent.

33
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,490
Oh, fantastic.

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,810
There are extra recordings.

35
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,210
You're good to go.

36
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,770
I believe in redundancy.

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,090
Do you know in my backup?

38
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,290
So I have, I have a NAS at home, um, or we back up stuff from our computer, a

39
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,290
network attached storage.

40
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,290
No, I know.

41
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,410
I would just like, wow.

42
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:42,970
Okay.

43
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,610
Where we back up stuff from our computers and photos and things like that.

44
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,210
And then that computer is also backed up to the cloud.

45
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,530
So if the house blows up, we still have the main files.

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,260
I believe in redundancy.

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,100
Yeah.

48
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:05,260
I had, I was running with a NAS for a while, but then to me, I'm like, okay,

49
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,180
carbonite, $99 a year.

50
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,460
Here you go.

51
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,900
Like carbonite just works for me.

52
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:12,820
Yeah.

53
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,420
But I like having the, the onsite stuff is good.

54
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,740
I like redundancy.

55
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,100
Carbonite may go out of business and where does your stuff go?

56
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,980
Oh, I don't know.

57
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,060
Then I, then it's kind of like the stuff in your closet.

58
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,260
I don't know if, do you have rules around?

59
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,420
When your closet gets filled up, dude, I don't have rules for anything.

60
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,660
Oh, once a year, I'll go through the closet.

61
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,780
It's usually right after Christmas where you know, you got all the new

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,580
shirts or whatever and you got to figure out, okay, where the hell am I going to

63
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,980
put this and it's, it's now at a lease recently used goes to Goodwill.

64
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:50,740
All right.

65
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,220
Yeah.

66
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,500
I don't have rules for that stuff.

67
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,380
I just, it's all, it's all just as needed, just in time flexible.

68
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,180
I was talking about rules this week.

69
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,220
I'm not going to go into a rule story, but I don't generally follow them.

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,780
I follow them.

71
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,940
I don't, I don't look at me.

72
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,020
I listener, I'm looking back at you.

73
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,300
Don't look at me like, Oh, Alan doesn't follow any rules.

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,860
Rules are a great guideline.

75
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,780
I think rules, I think they're good.

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,260
They give me a, a lane to work in, but I don't really walk down the middle of the

77
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,580
lane.

78
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,740
I wonder whatever side of the rules makes most sense to me in my context.

79
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah.

80
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:35,860
I think, I think we're now going into sort of why Britt and Alan are INTPs.

81
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,600
Cause I absolutely hold the same opinion.

82
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm like, okay, well rules are good guidance, but there's a reason why they

83
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,960
came up with the phrase exception to the rule.

84
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:53,760
I think I can give you an example just recently from work where I don't think

85
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,680
I'll get myself in trouble for talking about this publicly.

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,920
Although I got to tell you one of the listeners, Hey, Rasmus, I just saw him.

87
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,760
He was in the room with someone I was about to have a one-on-one with remotely.

88
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,520
He kind of waved to me and said, Hey, Alan, I have to talk to you

89
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,840
about your last podcast.

90
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,000
And that was it.

91
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,320
So I don't know what he had to say about it, but that was interesting, but

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
I think I can get away with this.

93
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,480
So for example, I think it's the same at Microsoft.

94
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,360
Microsoft does, you have your three check-ins a year, and this is, this is

95
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,040
six year old data, but you have a number of check-ins a year that it's

96
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,480
Connect or something new, but then one promotion process per year.

97
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,180
Or is that not right?

98
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,580
Trying to remember how that worked.

99
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,060
Well, it doesn't matter.

100
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:44,580
So two, two required Connects a year, two, two formal promotion events,

101
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:53,860
a year in alignment with Connect, but you can promote literally any time of the year.

102
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,220
You just go through a different process if it's not part of the formal.

103
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,020
And we're kind of in that phase where we have the official process and the

104
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,310
unofficial process, but the unofficial process isn't really air quote supported.

105
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,830
But it's just a place where I bend the rules.

106
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,030
Cause sometimes it's where it's, it makes sense to do it.

107
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,950
So I, I will bend rules.

108
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,590
I will not break rules.

109
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,070
There's always wiggle room.

110
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,110
There's always wiggle room.

111
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,070
So, um, what do you bet up to, man?

112
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,430
Anything exciting?

113
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,630
Mariners, Mariners, Mariners has made a big portion of my life recently.

114
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,470
Except they lost the last two games.

115
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,990
Yes.

116
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:35,190
And sadly two one run games hurts.

117
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,300
They both hurt very bad and it's all because of Alvarez.

118
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,660
Um, and I don't know how we got seven and let them get eight.

119
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,580
The first game like, uh, girl, uh, don't worry listeners.

120
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,020
I won't let him talk about baseball for too long.

121
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,780
Now I, this is about the end.

122
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:03,580
I'm I haven't looked yet because I'm not very optimistic, but I would very much.

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,440
Like to see if I can score a pair of tickets for tomorrow.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,970
Ooh, you will, you should be able to, I don't,

125
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,620
you can pay top dollar online, like on, on what is it?

126
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,260
Stub, stub.

127
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:19,900
Oh no.

128
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,980
Yeah, you're right.

129
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,580
If you can, I've done this in the past, having had or shared season tickets in

130
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,660
the past, even for playoff games, um, you can get tickets outside for face or

131
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,900
sometimes lower because people are looking and get rid of them.

132
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,620
We'll see what happens.

133
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:43,020
Um, I, I, I, I, I, I did a podcast last week.

134
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,540
Did you know this?

135
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:52,860
Uh, I did know that you were doing the podcast last week and I'm guessing I

136
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,340
learned that you did this roughly 10 minutes into you doing said podcast.

137
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,260
So there was an invitation that you were on.

138
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,340
I'm not sure what happened there.

139
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:06,820
Like my end looks like Brent Jensen is on the invitation and he's accepted.

140
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,740
But you weren't there, but I, um, if you remember Darko from episode

141
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,420
one 59 ish, I think, uh, we promised to go back on his podcast and you can

142
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,980
just imagine Brent and I went and recorded on his podcast, not released yet,

143
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,100
but that Brent was just very quiet.

144
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,060
Yeah.

145
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,660
We, yeah, we were absolutely both there.

146
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,060
Yeah.

147
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,220
Yeah.

148
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:28,860
We were both there.

149
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:36,220
Uh, except for more than likely everyone on the, all the listeners know.

150
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,440
Pretty good chance.

151
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,360
Alan, uh, mocked me on the podcast and I never mock you.

152
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,480
No, well, you actually have two personas.

153
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,350
Oh, do you think only two?

154
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:50,910
That's great.

155
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,230
No, no, there's two in this, in this particular context, one where you're

156
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,870
like, okay, this is formal.

157
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,070
Brent's my partner.

158
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,510
Yeah.

159
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,510
This, like if we were going to head to head with someone that was shooting down

160
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,910
MTP, uh, yeah, you wouldn't go into the mock phase.

161
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,750
But if we're not doing that, it's all bets off.

162
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:10,590
Anyway, anyway,

163
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:11,870
yeah, it was good.

164
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,230
We talked about software.

165
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,190
It went great.

166
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,190
Uh, not posted yet, but you should be subscribing to the

167
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,390
semaphore uncut podcast, uh, semaphoreci.com slash podcast or your

168
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,830
favorite podcasting host.

169
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:28,550
I don't think that people could like go to websites to click on podcasts,

170
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,270
listen to them there.

171
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,150
No, they get an app to play their podcast for them.

172
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,230
So anyway, go check that out.

173
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,870
Our episode should be coming out shortly unless, you know, sometimes I've had,

174
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:42,870
I'm not going to mention where, but I was a guest on another podcast a while back.

175
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:50,360
Well, I did a guest recording for another podcast and I'm guessing that as they

176
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,120
listened to it, they realized, yeah, this isn't that good.

177
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,200
Cause it never ever got posted.

178
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,760
So if, and I don't think that the maker of that podcast, listen,

179
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,560
this is our podcast.

180
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,200
So anyway, I'm hoping that doesn't happen with Darko and we, and I get

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
posted on his, but I think it will.

182
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,520
Yeah.

183
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,840
I can't even, I can't even imagine that.

184
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,280
Like, like there's like, sometimes people think I'm interesting than they

185
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,120
realize I'm not.

186
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,920
And even in seven years of podcasting, you have not yet figured that out.

187
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,680
So that's okay.

188
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,560
Yeah.

189
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,480
Fair enough.

190
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,520
All right.

191
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,840
Uh, let's do a couple topics today.

192
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,560
I promise.

193
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,080
Again, two episodes ago and then last episode, I promise we would talk about

194
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,640
moving from being a tester as many of us think about it today to moving into

195
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,560
experimentation, that kind of testing.

196
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, also last weekend, I should mention, cause we're going to get to that topic.

197
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,880
I hope in about 15 minutes, but last weekend I went camping out in the mountains

198
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,520
again, um, did not get eaten by bears.

199
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,720
So that was great, but, but it's a great way for me to supercharge my recharging.

200
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,140
So, but while I was high up on a hill somewhere, trying to jump over a waterfall

201
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:09,900
or something, uh, my presentation, my recording played for the test flicks event.

202
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,020
So this is the one where I, you saw my slides.

203
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,220
This is the one where I talked about, uh, the tester.

204
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,060
I was this traditional or even modern tester and the tester I want to be, which

205
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,540
is I want to experiment and make sure we're building the right thing.

206
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,460
The one quote from the Twitter sphere that got repeated from the whole thing

207
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,460
was, uh, and great, you're not going to have any problem with this.

208
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,980
I don't think, but I said, you can be the advocate for the customer.

209
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,500
You can be the proxy for the customer, but you are not the customer.

210
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,380
Oh, yes.

211
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,420
That was the only thing re-quoted over re or quoted over Twitter.

212
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,220
Quitted over Twitter.

213
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,660
No, I quoted over Twitter.

214
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,540
Really?

215
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,860
Interesting.

216
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,620
So it's all right.

217
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,300
It should be, it should make it to YouTube at some point.

218
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,940
You can all check it out, but for now you've said that folks who registered,

219
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,700
well, I'll let you know when it shows up.

220
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,180
You've said that you said that quote in more interesting ways in the past.

221
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,260
I'm sure I have.

222
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,020
Yeah, that was very, yeah.

223
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,460
You're not the freaking customer.

224
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,220
You blow hard.

225
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,660
That's the softest version I've seen.

226
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,780
I've ever heard it from, uh, from second hand from actually is the second hand.

227
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,100
So you are saying second hand of someone quoting you anyway.

228
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:27,740
Doesn't matter.

229
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,540
Let's carry on.

230
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:28,860
Yeah.

231
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,460
It's carry on.

232
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,260
So along those lines, uh, one of the things I do for paint, so I do a five for

233
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,780
Friday every week, and this is it again, every, all of my stories ramble.

234
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,860
The reason I have five things to write about every Friday.

235
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,900
What the hell just happened?

236
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,100
So I'm back.

237
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,100
Okay.

238
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,700
I'll stitch it together later, but this is may go in the podcast with some

239
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,580
beeping, but the Zen caster piece, which is good.

240
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,460
When you get to the end just crashed in the middle of the podcast.

241
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,860
I was, I was about to ask you, okay.

242
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,900
Did you figure out what that button did?

243
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,620
I didn't touch a thing.

244
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,020
All I did, I immediately looked to see.

245
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,420
Okay.

246
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,220
I wasn't so Zen caster crashed.

247
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,380
Uh, we're back now.

248
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:23,020
So the way I end up with topics for five for Friday is probably 10, 15, 20

249
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,300
minutes a day, usually in the evening.

250
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,860
But sometimes just when I get a break and I needed to veg, I'll go

251
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,300
read crap on the internet.

252
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,580
And a lot of it comes from Reddit.

253
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:36,220
A lot of it comes from a half a dozen other sites I go to other slack

254
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:41,180
communities and I find well, glance at a lot of articles and I'll take notes

255
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,700
on the ones I think, you know, this is kind of interesting and I'll, and

256
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,940
I'll give it a deeper read and I'll find stuff worth sharing.

257
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,220
One of the places I go where I have, I have yet to find a post to share

258
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,220
on my five for Friday, but it also reminds me of what bubble we're in.

259
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,140
Is the software testing subreddit on Reddit.

260
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,900
There was a question yesterday.

261
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,500
I wanted to share with you just to get an idea of where we are in the bubble topic.

262
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,500
Should dev teams test their products and features?

263
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,380
Obviously they're in the bubble.

264
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,700
I just know that bubble.

265
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,700
We're in the other bubble.

266
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:22,940
Yeah.

267
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,140
But the fact that this is like a credible question with, you know, a dozen

268
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,220
answers lets you know where we are.

269
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,260
The answer is yeah.

270
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,980
Of course we have an AI.

271
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,140
Wait, wait, hold on.

272
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,260
How many you said a round a dozen answers for team up votes.

273
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah.

274
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,660
And I'm trying to think through how many different synonyms for the word.

275
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,060
Yes, there are.

276
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,180
Yes.

277
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,820
Definitely.

278
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,180
Absolutely.

279
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,180
Uh, there's at least three who replied said, let me know what's wrong with

280
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,260
this sentence speaking from the perspective of a dev, I test my stuff

281
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,020
before sending it to QA.

282
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,460
That's that's nowhere.

283
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,380
And I was expecting something dramatically worse than that.

284
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,420
No, no, but handoffs are inefficient.

285
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,860
Well, no, no, this absolutely.

286
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,640
But at least he he tests his stuff before sending to to QA.

287
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,200
Although I have not, I mean, I've been in my career for a long time.

288
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,820
I've not ever, not ever met a dev that said anything other than that.

289
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,850
So of course I test my stuff.

290
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,730
Scrolling through here, one person did reply with just yes.

291
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:34,890
So that's good.

292
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,970
Anyway, a bunch of other answers, not going to go into them, but just, I

293
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,010
see that I go, Oh, that's where we are.

294
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
Somebody had to ask this question.

295
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Oh, I was, I got to it very quickly.

296
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:54,460
What about dev testing other devs work just like code review as a

297
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:54,860
dev.

298
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,660
Did you go find this?

299
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,540
I did.

300
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,620
I don't want to dwell on it because I want to go on to something else.

301
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:04,340
No, but let me, as, as a dev, how feasible do you think that is?

302
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,020
Okay.

303
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,780
Devs can code review other devs.

304
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,020
Why can't they test their, and they can't, I mean, in a way they can.

305
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,580
A lot of the devs, one of the things I coach dev teams, I work on with, it's

306
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,180
not just like, here's my code, go test it.

307
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:20,300
You're responsible as a developer for code correctness of your own code.

308
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,300
The way you test it is, Hey, let's, let's build an app with, if it's an API, let's

309
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,060
build an app with our code together on this Thursday and Friday.

310
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
Let's do something to test this together.

311
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,660
Let's, uh, let's do security testing together on this.

312
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,780
In that case, testing everybody else's code together, but that's the way I would

313
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,940
have, I wouldn't, I would not give devs like, Hey, here's a folder

314
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,260
of my code, go test it.

315
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:42,940
Hold on.

316
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,500
Hold on.

317
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,580
I didn't even hear what the hell you just said because I was reading.

318
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,580
You were reading something.

319
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,180
And I am getting pissed off.

320
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,580
Okay.

321
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:50,820
All right.

322
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,780
I already closed the window.

323
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,860
I don't even know what's there anymore.

324
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,740
I was ready to move on and piss you off even more.

325
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,660
Uh, we'll do that in a second.

326
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,380
Again, the question is how about dev testing other devs work?

327
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:03,940
Yeah.

328
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,660
Okay, great.

329
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,780
So dev replied, not feasible.

330
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,940
This is not feasible because number one, it would cause an unpleasant

331
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,420
amount of context switching between projects and tasks, the hell, like what

332
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,420
the hell do you, what the hell does this person think is happening

333
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,220
when they hand off the test?

334
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,340
It would slow down the development of two too much.

335
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,500
And there is, you go look at, Oh, I'm blanking product development flow.

336
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,060
Author.

337
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,020
Reiner's.

338
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,100
Thank you.

339
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,140
You go read his book and he shows that that's a bullshit argument.

340
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:52,030
Like you can't, if you want to increase velocity, you can't view it as a development

341
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,430
task, you gotta view it as equality task.

342
00:16:56,110 --> 00:17:00,870
In other words, development and testing of that code is the same frigging thing.

343
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:08,870
And as well as an accelerate, yet these guys are living in 1998 again.

344
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,230
Okay.

345
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,550
So let me go on, let me go on.

346
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,550
Cause I have another one on this topic and to be clear, I'm going to read

347
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,950
a post from says I was tagged into in LinkedIn.

348
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:18,710
Okay.

349
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,030
And I want to be very clear.

350
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,350
I'm not going to try and hide the author, but I'm not going to

351
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,310
tell you who it is first.

352
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:27,750
I don't mean this as an attack, but I do want to get your reaction

353
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,150
on about four paragraphs.

354
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,030
I'll pause after each paragraph for you.

355
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,190
Four paragraphs.

356
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,670
How many?

357
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,270
Okay, fine.

358
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:33,670
Go.

359
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:33,910
Okay.

360
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,030
Just, I'm going to read you.

361
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,670
They're short.

362
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,350
I'm going to read you like two sentences.

363
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,230
I want you to react.

364
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:41,150
We'll repeat that three more times.

365
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,150
And then I want to talk about like the bubble and then that's going to

366
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:50,110
transition if all goes well into the discussion I wanted to have around

367
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:56,390
moving into experimentation, a paragraph one shift left is a slogan created by

368
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,830
people who don't respect testing to justify the elimination of testers

369
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,630
where they do the most good, which is towards the right, or if not that,

370
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,630
then it's a slogan that naively asserts that the bugs we want to find will

371
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,390
be put in at the left and be easy to find there.

372
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,950
If only testers weren't playing video games or otherwise wasting their

373
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,110
time while developers were developing.

374
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,510
Yeah, that's a stupid rant.

375
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:28,850
And it is, it's somebody who's, who's just getting defensive and, and not thinking

376
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:34,070
through even, even in 1998, right?

377
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,750
We had the opinion that bugs are cheaper when they are the most left.

378
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,110
Well, that's been, that's been in textbooks since 1972.

379
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,950
Let me go on because you're going to let you have a different reaction

380
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,630
for each paragraph, but that's all you get.

381
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,510
All right.

382
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:54,190
In fact, many important bugs are not put into the code in the earliest hours.

383
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,590
I think that's provably wrong.

384
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,710
And in fact, many bugs that are put in are expensive to find early while being

385
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,710
rather easy to find when the system is more mature.

386
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:12,180
Um, yeah, if you put it together, a bunch of components and didn't do

387
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,060
testing along the way yet, you're going to find out pretty quickly.

388
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,980
It doesn't integrate.

389
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,900
So that's, I think product to get shittier.

390
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:22,900
Like, yeah.

391
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,500
Give me that whole paragraph is just pure horse shit.

392
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,620
No, it's, it's pure horse shit, but based off of actual and actual truth, right?

393
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,420
And it's essentially, yeah.

394
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:39,340
If you, if you build a bunch of shit and then you wait until the last second to

395
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,420
string it together, yes, it falls apart.

396
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:41,820
Yep.

397
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,460
Next part shift, shift left doesn't mean shift left.

398
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,500
It means spread left because we still need to test after the product is built.

399
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,980
Since shift left comes along with prohibitions against testing a built

400
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,500
product, it also means spread right.

401
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,300
Forcing us to test in production.

402
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,620
Think they know the author of this.

403
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,740
Doesn't let me get to the end here.

404
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,020
I don't want it to be a, I want to actually be a respectful reaction to this.

405
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:16,060
No, but the thing is, this is the first time I'm wondering what hole I'm under.

406
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,700
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,900
That's exactly what I'm going to bring it up.

408
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,980
Cause I feel like when I read this stuff, I go, oh my God, last paragraph.

409
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,420
Cause I want to focus on the words, not the author shift left is supposed

410
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,500
to mean collaborating with developers.

411
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,780
This is often problematic, especially when developers don't understand

412
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,460
testers and are powerful enough not to have to understand this puts

413
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,980
tremendous social pressure on testers to conform to a devs fantasy about

414
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,540
what a tester does for a living.

415
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,900
I don't know that I would disagree with that last one, right?

416
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:56,140
It just, to me, it feels, so I'm trying to, I'm trying to run a rant

417
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,860
filter, uh, uh, on your phrases.

418
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,540
Right.

419
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,860
When I read that, I'm like, okay, ignoring the rant bed, it kind of sounds

420
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,380
like they're talking about the codependency loop that you and I speak to all the time.

421
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,140
Obviously the conclusions that they're referring to, I don't agree with.

422
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,180
Well, but the phenomenon is absolutely there.

423
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:24,500
Like this sounds, I mean, hell I could have shift left was a thing 20 years ago.

424
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,870
Maybe I could have made this ranch 20 years ago, but I don't think I would

425
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,430
have because we had testers involved very early in the product cycle, even a Microsoft.

426
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,990
Uh, but it just, it feels very 1992.

427
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,830
Oh, and, and just, uh, I don't know if it's, if it's helpful to you or not.

428
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:49,430
But Wikipedia says the first reference of shift left testing was in 2001.

429
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,310
Okay.

430
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,110
Which was in fact, 20 years ago.

431
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,270
There we go.

432
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:54,150
There we go.

433
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:57,590
They bring up, they bring up the whole, the whole V curve

434
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,190
that we've seen a million times.

435
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,830
Yeah.

436
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,150
Yeah.

437
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,830
So a lot of this is, I don't agree with really any of it in there.

438
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,750
Nothing today, especially.

439
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,870
And of course everybody's figured it out.

440
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:14,350
This is a post on LinkedIn from James Bach, who, um, you know, I think continues

441
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,590
to function in his world.

442
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,270
And I think there's a collection of folks who see what he writes.

443
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:19,630
Who's yep.

444
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,070
Yep.

445
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,070
That's exactly it.

446
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,270
And that, and the main thing is, is not pick on, you know, I don't,

447
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,540
I just don't care about James.

448
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:30,940
He lives in this bubble of a world, but he's not alone there.

449
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,820
It's not like he's preaching to nobody or yelling at the wall.

450
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:37,060
There are, I didn't read the comments.

451
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,500
Um, I just looked at what I was tagged into and comment on that last paragraph.

452
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,130
But that's for a lot of the testing world is, and you can tell from that Reddit

453
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,250
post and this, there is a chunk of the testing world still in the world.

454
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,410
We lived in in testing in the early nineties.

455
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:53,410
Well, yeah.

456
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:59,290
But here I, I don't know who's in the bubble and who isn't quite honestly,

457
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,970
but I'll just say from my perspective, the Island that they've been living

458
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:06,780
on has been eroding, right?

459
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,820
To me, it's, it's kind of now at this point in time, sort of the tail wagging the dog.

460
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:20,920
It's, it's a vocal minority and these moves around software development, right?

461
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,480
They continue to sort of threaten to shake their, their worldview.

462
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:33,950
And to me, it doesn't, if someone doesn't satisfactorily answer the question

463
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,310
around why is this way better?

464
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,470
It's going to continue to happen.

465
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:47,630
You can't get someone to believe something when their incentives are, are, are,

466
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,030
are motivators to not believe that thing.

467
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,360
I don't know.

468
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,800
At this point in time, I'm like up until accelerate came out.

469
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,650
You and I just had our experience.

470
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,810
We hadn't heard of any sort of formal study being done on this.

471
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:08,680
So to me, accelerate was just a fantastic body of work because great.

472
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,680
Someone's finally gone out and done a scientific study on, on what we've observed.

473
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,120
That's, that's the huge part.

474
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,160
It's not just some business author writing a story about what worked for them.

475
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,920
It's based entirely on research.

476
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:22,680
Right.

477
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,600
That continues.

478
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,120
That research continues every year and it continues to support those metrics.

479
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:28,720
Right.

480
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,680
And everything else, you know, yeah.

481
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,280
The people holding onto this whole world with, with white knuckles, they would

482
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,680
probably be best suited in my mind, right?

483
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,560
At this point in time, it's a bunch of, in my view, disciples and acolytes

484
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,720
that are keeping this alive.

485
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:50,080
But in the longterm, if they want to win me back over, okay.

486
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:58,920
A place to start is go and read, go and read the, the current research and

487
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,640
then start talking about how that research is invalid.

488
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,880
Just have a little bit of breakdown on this and then we can probably move on.

489
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,200
I want to dwell on it forever.

490
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,640
The first three paragraphs are the part that's just in the wrong century to me.

491
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,880
It's just, it's based on experience, not on research or knowledge across

492
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,320
the software industry, based on the author's experience.

493
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:20,840
That's fair.

494
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,680
That's fair for James.

495
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,400
I get where he's coming from, from the bubble he's in.

496
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,400
The last one is the part that bugs me maybe even more in the last paragraph,

497
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:39,400
whether it's true or not, because it points to a, from again, from James point of view,

498
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,640
from the author's point of view here, a continued observance of a lack

499
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:51,560
of psychological safety, which is not, you know, I just will not allow, I will not

500
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,560
work on a team like that, that has that sort of devs are powerful enough not to

501
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,240
have to understand just, it's like, whoa, whoa, hold on.

502
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,680
I just thought of a way I would ever, ever want to work.

503
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,840
And if you're a tester listening to this and you feel like you're

504
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,720
powerless on your team, that's just, it's just wrong.

505
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
You don't have to work.

506
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,760
You can change your job or you can change your job.

507
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,720
These days you don't have to work on a team like that.

508
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,920
I at least, and again, you may be in a place where you, that's the only

509
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,080
job you, only option you have.

510
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,640
Maybe you can't, but I would, I just hate the, to consider the fact that

511
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,000
people are working in unsafe environments.

512
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,480
Right back on.

513
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,520
I completely agree.

514
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,640
Like I don't, I don't live in that.

515
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:42,430
Even here at, at, at Microsoft where, where once we were claimed to be the

516
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,190
evil empire, right?

517
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,950
The, and as you know, toxicity used to be alive and well here.

518
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,230
It's in fact, it's one of the main reasons I'm at unity.

519
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,590
I just got sick of it.

520
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,430
I don't, I don't have that anymore.

521
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,510
I'm glad to hear it's going away.

522
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:06,450
So you still have, you know, you still have big, big asshole or you still

523
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,810
have assholes who think they're, they're, they're crap don't stink.

524
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:11,690
Right.

525
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,330
But that's going to happen everywhere.

526
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,530
But what's now different is they don't thrive here anymore as they used to.

527
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,170
If you can't collaborate.

528
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,720
Yeah, it's, it's the one thing that's actually changed a big deal here at Microsoft.

529
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,320
And it's, it's essentially anyone can anonymous, anonymous.

530
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
I can't say, so I had a dentist appointment this morning.

531
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,280
So in my tongue is starting to start.

532
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,520
Um, num.

533
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,350
Anyone can anonymously report abuse that we used to see all the time.

534
00:27:51,140 --> 00:28:01,860
I had HR call me in regards to one of my employees who had, uh, was being

535
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:10,610
berated by a PM and, and an entirely different party said, what this guy is

536
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:12,810
doing is total crap.

537
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,230
It needs to stop.

538
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,780
And they just set it off to HR and HR came back.

539
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,340
Now, thankfully I had it.

540
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,020
Every company should have, should have that, should have that safety.

541
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,020
I feel like you can speak up that 80 repercussions.

542
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,060
Absolutely.

543
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,340
So, all right.

544
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,140
That's enough of that.

545
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,940
You can go read it on your own.

546
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,820
I'm not going to link to it, but I just wanted to get your reactions on that.

547
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,820
Cause it's the bubble part and there's a safety part, but now, I mean,

548
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,900
we're moving on, we're moving on now.

549
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,540
I am not going to go another week without getting to the topic where we're going to

550
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,060
spend 20 minutes on the next topic.

551
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
So we're moving on.

552
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:54,260
And I have a story around this because I was around at the big MSFT when they

553
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,420
waved a magic wand and they said, Oh, you testers now you're responsible for data

554
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,900
stuff and we did, um, what, what did they call them?

555
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,620
Uh, something in measures, questions and measures.

556
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,100
No targets and measures.

557
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,780
I can't remember.

558
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,140
Uh, we did some, uh, kind of dumb stuff, but it was a start.

559
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,500
It was a start and I knew it wasn't right, but I knew it was a start to

560
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,820
get people in the right direction.

561
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,380
I'll remember the phrasing in a minute, but let's say I do, I don't

562
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,820
care whether I'm exploratory tester.

563
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,180
I do.

564
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,780
I'm writing automated tests because our developers suck and aren't doing them.

565
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:30,220
Or I am coaching developers how to write better testing wherever you are

566
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:31,700
on that spectrum or bubble.

567
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:37,270
My stance is, I think our stance is it would make sense for you to,

568
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:40,750
it could make sense for you to move into experimentation as well, into the kind

569
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,670
of testing that we call modern testing.

570
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,670
Now it is modern and it is about testing.

571
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,630
How would you make that transition?

572
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,190
And I'll tell that I'll tell the story about me in a minute, but how would

573
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,030
you suggest, what's your advice to someone wanting to make that transition?

574
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:02,340
So I have, I have, I've written this up someplace.

575
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,260
Is it, is it in the unpublished Galazzo book?

576
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,500
No.

577
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:15,700
Um, this was, so when I first took on my data science role here in Azure, you

578
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:22,980
were still at Microsoft and it was a, it was a role that was at the beginning

579
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,660
of blowing up within Microsoft.

580
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,420
Now there's data scientists everywhere.

581
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,260
But back then, um, I was on the leading edge of this and others would come up

582
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,540
to me and said, Hey, I want to do what you do.

583
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,820
I even, I even had a talking deck for this.

584
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,900
If you're trying to get into, if you're a traditional tester and you're

585
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,780
trying to get into this space, right?

586
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,700
The first thing you have to do is get into the production data.

587
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:59,910
You have to wallow in the data and, and look at, Oh, here's a great example.

588
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:06,190
So you previously we've advised people, uh, long, long, long, long, long time

589
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,470
ago around how to change their automation.

590
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:09,570
Right.

591
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:15,200
Don't, don't write, don't write the driver code, just write the validation

592
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,250
code and have your validation code.

593
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:19,650
Or was that the other way around?

594
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,890
No, write your, write your driver code, have it manipulate the product.

595
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:30,040
Then write your validation code entirely off of the telemetry of the product.

596
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,160
Don't write your specific validation.

597
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:32,920
Right.

598
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:39,560
So the first step is, is to, to realize that the telemetry can

599
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,960
also be used for, for testing.

600
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,280
Sure.

601
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,280
So I'm going to interrupt because that's, if that's step one,

602
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,320
I'm going to interject step zero.

603
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,280
Oh, and again, you're coming from a place of a little bit of privilege and

604
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,360
knowledge working at a company that's collected customer data, non PII customer

605
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,400
data for decades now P zero.

606
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,040
Go ask someone, find out what data your company has now about how

607
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,440
customers use the software.

608
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,360
They may have no telemetry, but they have some sort of business metrics,

609
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,380
figure out what your baseline is and figure out what, look at that until

610
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,220
you can come up with more questions you can't answer and then figure out,

611
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:24,780
then you can at least know what's there and what you have to work with

612
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,260
and what's missing to get started.

613
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,540
Then you can move on to Brent step one, maybe, maybe with a step zero

614
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,620
a in there as well.

615
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,300
You're, you're absolutely right.

616
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,220
And like it, I remember having these conversations at the same time.

617
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,820
I was having agile conversations, right?

618
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:47,420
I specifically got called into an office offsite years ago and they

619
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,740
were the client team and they were like, well, how do we get,

620
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,140
how do we get our data?

621
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,340
I'm like, well, it's, it's easy.

622
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,820
You, you put on a checkbox that says, may we collect data?

623
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,100
It's to make your life better and happier.

624
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,900
And they're like, yeah, but we only get 10%.

625
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,860
Well, yeah, that means you have to figure out how to make effective

626
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,860
use of that 10% of the people who do send you stuff, obviously

627
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,780
getting data first, right?

628
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:18,660
Then, then to me, and I don't want to make this too long

629
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,700
and below the, I'm trying to at the same time answer your question,

630
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,740
trying to remember the deck.

631
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:28,540
The next thing is getting accustomed to interpreting that

632
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,830
telemetry and the hypothesis of explain customer behavior.

633
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,420
What are they trying to do?

634
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,540
Why are they doing it that way?

635
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,140
Cause here, here we're no longer really trying to validate.

636
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,760
How do I put it?

637
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,240
This goes to the heart of the thing that you and I keep talking about.

638
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,720
We don't give a rat's house about testing anymore.

639
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:54,640
Nope.

640
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:00,240
Here, like in this world where like that's Jeff's job and we trust them to nail it.

641
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:08,910
But now what we're trying to do is, is determine quality, determine, okay,

642
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,190
what are the problems that you're trying to solve?

643
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,710
Do we find anything that's that's, um, so anomaly detection, I was going to say,

644
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:22,710
that's not really experimentation, but with experimentation, you can take, uh,

645
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:31,640
the cuss or the PM's sort of documents and then turn those into hypotheses and

646
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,320
roll them out and measure it and do statistical testing.

647
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,720
I mean, it's, it's stuff I do all of the time.

648
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,760
I want to, I'm jumping back and forth.

649
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,000
Oh, yeah, you are a little bit, but I want to, I'm going to, this is a good

650
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,680
time for me to interject and tell my story because you're a data scientist

651
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,120
and I'm not, you've been doing this for a long time.

652
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,080
And I haven't, but I can talk about the journey that happened whenever it was

653
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,000
2014 or so after Xbox one shipped.

654
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,360
And I worked on that stupid science project to put Android apps on windows phone.

655
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,040
Uh, one thing that happened at that time was Mike, that was when windows and I

656
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,040
was in Xbox, because pulled into windows and then my manager was going to run this

657
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,080
science project team.

658
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,680
So I did the science project with him.

659
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:25,110
And at that time they basically got rid of testers Estes in windows, but they laid

660
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,840
off some, yay, Microsoft.

661
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,280
And then they put the rest into these fundamentals teams and some of the

662
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,920
dev roles, but these fundamentals teams did one big thing they did was they

663
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,000
called it data science.

664
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,480
It really wasn't data science right away.

665
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,000
It was a crash course for everyone.

666
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,310
Some people like Steve Rowe, guest former guest on the podcast will be back

667
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,510
again someday, just whole hog into it.

668
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,630
Sometimes a little bit too much into like, we need to learn a statistical

669
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,790
algorithm said, no, we need to learn how to collect telemetry.

670
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,870
But, but again, he got to the right spot.

671
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:03,630
So what happened was I ran data science until we hired, um, so we hired

672
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,670
someone who knew what they were doing.

673
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,310
I was the data science rep for our group.

674
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,550
So I would go meet with the other fundamental leads or data science leads

675
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,110
across the cross windows.

676
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:20,790
About 12 of us would go meet once a week and just be completely stupid about

677
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,230
what it meant to be dated.

678
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,470
How do you, how do you use data?

679
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:29,030
One of the things they wanted to do was take their old test pass rate dashboard

680
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,110
and just make it work via telemetry.

681
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,270
And I pointed out that maybe, maybe that isn't the thing we want to check.

682
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:38,350
Maybe we want to check on quality or customer outcome.

683
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,070
Like, Oh yeah, interesting.

684
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,550
So, you know, one thing I can do is be the voice of reason.

685
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,350
So the other thing I did, as Brent recalls, is I just read a lot.

686
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,590
I just tried to learn as this, the, we talked last time about how I learn.

687
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:59,980
I tried to shove my brain full of stuff about how using data works,

688
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,980
trying to get more information so I could speak intelligently about it.

689
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,780
That's when I went and gave that talk on AB testing, use a little

690
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,980
bit of the language that was great.

691
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,520
Uh, that's kind of how I'd start.

692
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
You just try and experiment.

693
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,440
We did this thing.

694
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,570
I was trying to remember the name of it earlier, something in measures.

695
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,530
It's something metrics, metrics and measures.

696
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,210
Maybe it was that, but we tried to do, instead of doing like, here's the test

697
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,650
plan, here's how we're going to test it.

698
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:27,130
We looked at here, the outcome, here's what these features do.

699
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:29,650
How will they know we're working in production?

700
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,250
And then we'd have meetings to go over these where I don't know a lot about

701
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,970
this stuff, but I could raise my hand and I could say things like maybe

702
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,050
average is a bad metric there.

703
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,610
And we should use percentiles because average is a horrible metric.

704
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:46,970
Generally, Bryce will tell me that I'm completely wrong, but I believe

705
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,770
average is generally not the metric you want.

706
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,650
So little things like that.

707
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,090
And we, and it was still sucked.

708
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,890
And we, again, I imagine it's way better today, but you have to start somewhere.

709
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,610
You have to be afraid anytime you're trying something new, just be,

710
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,010
don't be afraid to suck.

711
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:04,370
Otherwise you're not going to get there.

712
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:07,760
My advice is go figure out what data is there.

713
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,680
See if you can collect more data to help you understand whether the feature or

714
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:16,160
product or shipping is being successful for customers and use that,

715
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,520
use the data you get to help drive more questions.

716
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,840
Today, I'm going to plug Ron Kohavi's book, trustworthy online controlled

717
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,200
experiments, because I reread that in preparation for putting together my

718
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,120
test flicks talk and just, it's full of good anecdotes.

719
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,440
It will, this is the book.

720
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:39,080
If you don't believe me just saying, you have no reason to believe me saying

721
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,480
that you can be the advocate for the customer.

722
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,040
You can be the proxy for the customer, but you're not the customer.

723
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,800
You are not the customer testers.

724
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,350
You are not the, you, I could argue maybe you're not even the proxy

725
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,030
for the customer, these testers are saying you're the customer.

726
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,750
You're not, but you don't have to believe me.

727
00:38:55,750 --> 00:39:00,550
If you go read Ron's book and you look at the results of the studies

728
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:04,030
and how stuff works, you are going to walk away going, Oh, you know what?

729
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,030
I have no idea how my customers work.

730
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,990
I need to trust the data.

731
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,150
Amen.

732
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:20,340
No, it's one of my favorite things to do is go up, go to the executive and

733
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,380
inform them that the business does not run the way they think it does.

734
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,140
Yeah.

735
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,050
And it's one of the things that, that does my value proposition.

736
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:34,050
I was thinking through, as you told your story, like, how did I get my role?

737
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:35,050
Right.

738
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,410
Essentially what I did, and you kind of were doing the same thing with me

739
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,770
cause we've always been leading edge on this one.

740
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,050
We kind of saw the beginning of the end of tests.

741
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:50,850
We, we, we knew it several years before it actually landed that it was on its way.

742
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,930
The momentum was clearly there.

743
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:53,650
Yep.

744
00:39:53,970 --> 00:40:01,130
Um, so I shifted into a sort of a proactive self-defense, right?

745
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,410
It's essentially, okay, if this is coming, I have two years.

746
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,050
Where should I develop myself?

747
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:07,730
Right.

748
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:10,090
And so what I did is I did exactly what you said.

749
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:16,130
I started reading like crazy, then started what's even more important is used

750
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,130
it in my day-to-day life.

751
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:23,680
And if, as I used it, I learned, Oh, okay.

752
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,920
I'm not yet at the experimentation, but man, did this say statistical

753
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,760
technique really shortcut all of this pain that it used to take me days to

754
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,440
take care of.

755
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,040
Mm-hmm.

756
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,760
Now I got straight to it.

757
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:37,960
Right.

758
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:44,600
And then for me, it's been learn a new technique incorporated into my, my repertoire.

759
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,960
And then I get another almost anything, right?

760
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,600
Right.

761
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,640
That's the way I learned musical instruments.

762
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,680
Now that was just, that's why I use the word repertoire.

763
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,560
Cause it's very similar to that.

764
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,880
It's right.

765
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,400
You don't start off playing piano, being a master at Mozart.

766
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,360
You, you start off learning, uh, Oh God, what is that one?

767
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,340
Done to, uh, the one that goes dumb.

768
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,420
No, it's hot cross buns.

769
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,580
Right.

770
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,180
That's sure.

771
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,300
Right.

772
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,340
Or, or, or, or twinkle twinkle little star, right?

773
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,940
It's something very simple.

774
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,740
Although I don't, I do think hot cross buns is like everyone's first song.

775
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,900
But just to summarize, so you have to, or to recap whatever, I don't know my

776
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:38,340
words, you can't be afraid to fail or can't just be, don't yourself get stuck.

777
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:43,620
And, and again, no matter what you're doing, we find that the people who are

778
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:48,500
curious, people who want to learn people who are hungry for knowledge, they just

779
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,020
do better in their careers in general.

780
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:57,470
And if you want to make this transition, and honestly, I think a lot of people

781
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:01,830
in test rules should, whether you become an expert in doing it all the time,

782
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,950
whether it's something you're just able to do and understand how to use data.

783
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:06,590
I think it's critical.

784
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,990
I think it's critical for anyone in software, but dive in, don't be afraid

785
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,990
to screw up and again, start by asking what data is there.

786
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,710
Yeah, totally.

787
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:20,710
I was talking about crash reports today at work and there was a time in my

788
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,540
career when basically I was, I was thinking about it in hindsight.

789
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,660
I was a full time debugger.

790
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:30,220
I debugged code most, most days every day.

791
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:35,820
I used to, when I was doing campus interviews, I would go and talk to the

792
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,660
computer science department, right?

793
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:44,640
Because I wanted, I would go there and say, Hey, I'd like to know who has the

794
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,860
reputation of being the best debugger in your, in your depart or amongst your

795
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,580
students, cause I would like to talk to them.

796
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:00,680
Cause I, I discovered long ago that test people in tests when I wanted to hire

797
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,600
and test people who had exceptional debug skills were awesome in this role.

798
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,080
Yeah.

799
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,040
Well, the reason I brought it up was when I was learning, when I was debugging

800
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,840
full time, I didn't know how to do it.

801
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,520
I mean, again, just for context, mostly debugging in windows was

802
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,240
done at the assembly level.

803
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:25,580
Um, so I didn't, at first, I didn't know much what I was doing.

804
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:26,740
I could get a call stack.

805
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,660
I ended up doing it full time.

806
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,940
Cause I learned a lot about it.

807
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:30,260
I did.

808
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,060
I would learn about it in a bunch of different ways.

809
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,460
One was just watching people.

810
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,660
I own the debugger.

811
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,740
So it had a remote connection.

812
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,460
So I would watch people debug things.

813
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,980
Sometimes you could have multiple, multiple people connected.

814
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,940
I would watch people debug and say, Oh, that's cool.

815
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,700
How did they do that?

816
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,860
Or I would, a lot of it was I have, I probably finally gave it to Goodwill,

817
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,820
a book on x86 assembly.

818
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,540
So I could understand not only, I knew what most the fact, I know what all the

819
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,700
instructions do in x86 assembly, but I would understand how many clock cycles

820
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,820
they took to understand where for performance issues, a lot of things like that.

821
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:13,940
Or I would, Oh, and one thing I did, which I did when I was teaching debugging,

822
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:19,020
when I taught debugging once in a while was make sure you understand what all the,

823
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,780
I knew what all the critical parts of the system looked like when they were

824
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,820
healthy so that when they were screwed up, I would know what was different.

825
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,300
Oh, okay.

826
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,180
That makes sense.

827
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,060
So it was pattern matching, right?

828
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:33,980
So you know, that's, that's relativism.

829
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,740
And that's what AB testing is all about.

830
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,660
Yes.

831
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,500
Yes.

832
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,220
We want to know what's different.

833
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,740
I was using human pattern matching in a perfect world of knowing what I know

834
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:46,580
now and going back then I could write pattern matchers for that.

835
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:50,140
Some sort of fuzzy pattern matching between a healthy system and healthy system.

836
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,860
One of the things I was helping a team debug on memory, like I wasn't really

837
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:59,500
helping, I was there trying to live vicariously through my team, but in a

838
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,780
memory leak, this is the one I love when I use a teach, if you, if your

839
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:09,980
working set is normally half a gig and you look in your working set is 10

840
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:16,530
gig, good news, because now chances are, if you look at a random bit of memory,

841
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,930
it's leaked memory because most of your memory is leaked.

842
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,770
So if you know your project well enough to know what kind of data structures are

843
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,850
there, you can look at those constructs.

844
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,650
If you're lucky at strings, it's probably not, but you can look at the pattern.

845
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:33,410
And if you know the data structures in your application, you can get a pretty

846
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:37,290
good idea of which data structures are being leaked, you can't like that.

847
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:43,210
But that's, I mean, that's not really relevant in terms of this experiment.

848
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,450
No, no, no, I was just thinking about, uh, I was elaborating on the

849
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,210
looking what's different from the same.

850
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,610
Anyway, a whole bunch of stuff you can try.

851
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:51,730
I encourage you to try it.

852
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:56,930
What else should people do to learn more about experimentation,

853
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,370
A B testing or actually practice it?

854
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,020
So when I go through it, right?

855
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,180
It's all I spent a lot of time.

856
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,400
It's important to think through bias here that that comes up quite a bit.

857
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:09,240
Really?

858
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,110
I don't even want to bring any of that up because the thing I find the most

859
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:20,100
meaningful is just start trying.

860
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,590
Now assume that you're interpreting the data wrong, right?

861
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,070
And do your best.

862
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:32,030
Anytime we try out a new technique, try it out and then assume that

863
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:33,790
you screwed it entirely up.

864
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:34,310
Yep.

865
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,830
And then do everything you can.

866
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,790
This is where you want to read and say, okay, what's the data telling me?

867
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:45,430
Is the data telling me it's no different or it's the same if that's unexpected.

868
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,670
Uh, particularly, I'm particularly interested in unexpected patterns.

869
00:46:50,470 --> 00:46:55,590
Then that's where I drill down and say, okay, how could we see this

870
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:58,430
result come to a different conclusion?

871
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:02,210
Uh, and, and come to the exact opposite conclusion.

872
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:08,430
And that's, that's all around getting confident and enough in the, with the

873
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:13,270
data to be able to objectively call BS on, on yourself.

874
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,030
Yeah.

875
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,350
I think it's one I want to close here, but yeah.

876
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,190
The first thing you said was the answer to all questions.

877
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:27,030
Hey, Brenton Allen, I want to get, I want to learn how to do X or get

878
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:28,990
better at X the canonical.

879
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:35,630
How do I get into automation or how do I learn to debug or how do I,

880
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:38,350
whatever the answer is you try it.

881
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:39,870
You, yeah.

882
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,470
Start you start.

883
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:47,270
And I think a lot of times people are looking for a shortcut, like, oh, all

884
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:51,590
you, they want like, is there a video course I can take maybe, but it may

885
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:54,030
not be helpful, just fricking try it.

886
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:58,750
I would say like, if I don't know which one I favor the most.

887
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:04,760
It would be try it, just start or apply it.

888
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:05,900
Right.

889
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,060
To me.

890
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,820
So a lot of times I see a lot of people go through and they play with toy

891
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:15,660
data sets and like, look, I made a perfect model based off of this

892
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,060
data set that Google publishes that no one cares about, right?

893
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,260
It's the, no, no, no.

894
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,380
You got to connect the dots between the things that you care about, say, you

895
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,260
know, the quality of your product and this technique.

896
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,260
That's what I mean by start.

897
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,820
That's what I mean by try.

898
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,420
That's what I mean by apply.

899
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,620
Nice start, man.

900
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,140
Try it.

901
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,700
We covered it.

902
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,980
We got to our topic finally, after talking about talking about it for a long time.

903
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:41,940
Yes.

904
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:43,180
All right.

905
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,460
Listeners, I'm going to tell Brent to have a good weekend.

906
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,140
This is Friday.

907
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,940
If you're listening on Monday, have a good week.

908
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,900
You're listening on another day.

909
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,180
Have a good whatever.

910
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,380
I'm Alan.

911
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,340
I'm Brent.

912
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,380
Goodbye from AB testing.
