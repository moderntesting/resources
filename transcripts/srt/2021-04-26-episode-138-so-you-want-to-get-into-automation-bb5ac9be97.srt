00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,940
Welcome to A.B.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,460
Testing Podcast, your modern testing podcast.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,580
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing, leadership,

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,220
agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,540
Now on with the show.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,540
Today on the A.B.

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,980
Testing Podcast, Brent will eat food.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,100
Hey everyone, I'm Alan.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,220
I'm Brent.

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,940
And Brent is eating and crinkling already.

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,180
It's good, good fun.

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,820
Everyone will pay $5 to the first of the three that can guess what I'm eating today.

13
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,860
It's a new segment on the A.B.

14
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,860
Testing Podcast.

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,760
Is this like what's in my pocket?

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,240
It's like that, but the audio version of it.

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,080
Oh my God.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,440
I think it's episode 138.

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,700
Still season one, because we don't do seasons because that's a thing that other podcasts

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,660
do and we're not like other podcasts.

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,860
Our season never ends.

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,860
It does.

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,860
A lot of things never end.

24
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,790
Kind of like pandemic.

25
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,080
Yeah.

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,300
A real quick rant that didn't post this.

27
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,740
Last weekend I got excited.

28
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,700
I logged into one of the, I'm not going to throw anybody under the bus, a local hospital

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,970
and got an appointment set up for May 2nd to get my first shot.

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,210
And I got an email back the next day saying, hey, we made a mistake.

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,410
None of those slots are actually available.

32
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,350
You're out of luck.

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,790
And then there was rage and apparently people, other people must have raged more than I did

34
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,150
because then the next day got another email saying, uh, hey, we're going to call you and

35
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,350
reschedule those things so you don't hate us as much.

36
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,350
That was the good news.

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,110
And then they called today, but, uh, I was out on a hike and my phone dropped right

38
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,510
after I picked it up and they didn't call back.

39
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,870
And I don't know if that lost my place on the list or what.

40
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:03,460
So right now I have no appointment to get a vaccine, but I'm hoping I do someday.

41
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,140
Um, I am in this similar place.

42
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,220
Although, um, are you, are you currently picky?

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,940
Uh, not yet.

44
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,140
I, I was excited cause I, you, I think it was you that told me Moderna is the, is the

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,540
best one in your opinion.

46
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,940
Uh, actually if I did tell you that I am now reversing that cause I literally, I now

47
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:32,760
have a whole bunch of friends who are going through shot number two and literally a hundred

48
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,010
percent of them are reporting life is hell after shot two.

49
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,770
I heard that from, uh, the teams, the teams on my folk, the folks on my team who had Pfizer

50
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,770
as well.

51
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,570
Yeah, it could just be a thing.

52
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:55,600
It could just be, uh, crawl under the covers and suffer for the day or so till it's over.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,660
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,220
I'm currently favoring Pfizer.

55
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,580
Okay.

56
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,120
I'm going to take what I can get.

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,920
That's my plan.

58
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,160
Yeah.

59
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,970
The, the, the J and J one is probably the one I'm least likely.

60
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,610
All right then.

61
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,530
So we have a podcast today.

62
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,970
We got stuff to talk about.

63
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,850
Um, and we should probably get going.

64
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,650
I don't know.

65
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,740
What do you want to talk about?

66
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,860
Uh, stuff.

67
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,180
Okay.

68
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,060
I got stuff to talk about.

69
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,300
Newest one.

70
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,820
I might not even have five for Friday at this, but I mentioned it to you as we're logging

71
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,180
in today, I have a brand new Mac book.

72
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,940
My last one, um, it still works, but I just wanted to get the battery replaced and they

73
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,940
won't do it.

74
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,940
It's out of warranty.

75
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,420
So it says just your, you're due for a refresh anyway, cause your computer is four years

76
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,420
old.

77
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,300
So I got a new Mac book M one.

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,900
It is lickety split fast and I've never heard the fans turn on yet.

79
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,140
I can't make it work hard enough to actually try and spin up fans.

80
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,570
So I need to this weekend to try and do something a little bit more strenuous to it.

81
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,770
Start advent for coding early.

82
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,430
Maybe, maybe those things don't let you do the brute force solution.

83
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,610
Those things don't really compute a lot, but anyway, I like it so far.

84
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,250
Uh, totally irrelevant to the podcast.

85
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:25,050
Uh, I'm in the, I'm in the market for a new laptop piece of crap laptops that

86
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,250
I've been using.

87
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:32,940
Like I think, I think my laptop now is at eight years old.

88
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,710
You know, you work for a company with a lot of money.

89
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,950
They'll probably get you a new one.

90
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,470
Yeah.

91
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:46,690
The issue is I need, I'm picky now on which one the, so it's eight years old.

92
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,050
Like I can plug it in.

93
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,450
It still works as long as I don't, like it's now got like 15 minutes of battery,

94
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,770
even on the full charge.

95
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,130
All right.

96
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,690
For the listeners at home, Brent, uh, actually slid his chair back, opened his

97
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,770
laptop bag, got his laptop out.

98
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,810
He opened it.

99
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,130
He like, they flipped it around, looked at the bottom a little bit, looked at the

100
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,490
top, opened it up, and now he's typing a letter from his laptop.

101
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,810
No, I'm not.

102
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,130
Cause the battery's already dead.

103
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:13,610
All right.

104
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,930
Um, the battery life lasts just a little long.

105
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,490
I'm trying to just trying to find on here when I got the damn thing.

106
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,130
I don't see a date anywhere.

107
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,210
Oh, there's one.

108
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,450
Uh, I believe that says 2014.

109
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,370
All right.

110
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,330
Damn.

111
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:32,580
Yeah.

112
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:39,350
Anyway, the issue so much for me, it isn't, it's the screen size now.

113
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,070
It's, it's an order because I'm old.

114
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:52,540
And, um, it's essentially when I blow up the screen so I can actually read what

115
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,380
it's saying, I now have essentially two inches of real estate and therefore I

116
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,100
can't do anything with the stupid thing.

117
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,500
So I actually went with, I, this topic is not very exciting, but I went

118
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,340
with a smaller computer this time.

119
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,940
Uh, I had a choice of getting a 16 inch MacBook or a 13 inch MacBook

120
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,340
with the new MacBook and I went 13 because there'll, there'll be a world

121
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,140
at the end of this where I'll go back to traveling often and it is impossible

122
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
to open a 16 inch laptop on an airplane.

123
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,370
So I thought ahead, hold the smaller one.

124
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,290
Okay.

125
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,370
So, all right, then.

126
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:26,730
All right.

127
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,170
Let's, let's get on with the podcast.

128
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,690
Hey everyone.

129
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,650
I'm still Alan.

130
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:30,610
I'm great.

131
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,170
We did that part.

132
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,090
I, um, I mentioned, I did a teaser on one of the three dot slack.com, which

133
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,890
you can join just go to modern testing.org and find the link.

134
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,210
And there are several of the three there.

135
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:47,010
In fact, if you count up all the three, there's only, only ever three listeners.

136
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:53,850
They take turns listening, but we have 633 members of our one of the three.com,

137
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,770
one of the three dot slack.com slack community.

138
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,770
You're welcome to join that.

139
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:04,400
And yesterday I teased a little bit because yesterday or the day before was

140
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,040
the exact two year anniversary of me joining the organization that I'm in.

141
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,300
The bi-annual Alan changes jobs event.

142
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,220
It is, it is.

143
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,300
And, and bring his tease about this and I was told, no, no, no,

144
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,660
but then it always happens.

145
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,620
And in this case though, it's not as dramatic as the other ones.

146
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:34,700
Uh, what has happened is my org largely supports the division that I'm in

147
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:40,980
because the division that I'm in, well, my org does internet infrastructure,

148
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,340
cloud CDN, uh, C C I CD, uh, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

149
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:52,060
You name a tool used in deployment infrastructure is probably supported by my

150
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,100
team while our largest customer is the division Maria and we do work company

151
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,240
wide, which has been fine.

152
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,600
Unity is very flat.

153
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,640
We don't have a lot of hierarchy.

154
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,480
It makes it easy to do.

155
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,200
However, uh, that was out of convenience and it was out of convenience of my

156
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,400
management chain to fund that, uh, central org within their org, but

157
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,480
recently unity has formed a org, especially for central stuff like this.

158
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,160
There's a labs group there and labs is like lot like Microsoft research,

159
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,880
much smaller scale.

160
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,950
There are a similar team to mine supporting a lot of the desktop developers.

161
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,990
And we tend to overlap and not optimize as well as we should being in different

162
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,430
orgs and some other things that I won't go into,

163
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,310
but, uh, we, I'm just, it's just a drag and drop reorg.

164
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,500
I, my, and my org are being drug over to another part of unity with a new manager.

165
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,780
Well, we will continue with our mission, but also, uh, work on.

166
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,140
There's a couple other things we're doing there.

167
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,820
One is just keep doing what we're doing to is to fix that alignment or not.

168
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,780
I shouldn't say fix.

169
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,580
It's not broken.

170
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,460
It's to increase the collaboration between our team and the other team at unity

171
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,660
who have similar goals for different developers.

172
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,260
And also to bring our culture with us.

173
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,220
Uh, we have a reputation for the way we work with, uh, things we've talked

174
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,020
about here, uh, transparency, accountability, collaboration, psychological

175
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
safety, all that stuff.

176
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,740
Uh, we're going to bring all that with us and shove it down their throat.

177
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,300
No, we're going to, but safely.

178
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,240
So, uh, yeah, so it's going to be fun.

179
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,560
That's effective Monday.

180
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,960
Just wrapping all that stuff up by the time this hits, it'll all be

181
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,880
announced across the company.

182
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,280
And I didn't, I don't think I revealed any trade secrets, just to, just

183
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,880
to drag and drop, reorg gives me a little different perspective.

184
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,160
So it counts as my migration because I have different people I'm working

185
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,920
with, even though I'm generally doing many of the same things.

186
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:59,440
Um, doesn't feel like, unlike last few, it doesn't feel like you're anxious

187
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,240
in any way, shape or form, but what, what, what, um, in terms of your

188
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,240
team's missions, oh, this would be a good opportunity to load up the unity.

189
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,280
Three questions, if I could, uh, which I can't, our mission doesn't change.

190
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,120
Where do you see an advantage for you executing your mission, your mission?

191
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,280
Uh, and where do you see a disadvantage?

192
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,200
Well, I think it's obvious this is good questions.

193
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,320
Nice interviewing Brent.

194
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,760
The advantage is working from a central organization will increase

195
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,640
discoverability from the other parts of unity that we, that we work with,

196
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,920
but sort of ad hoc, uh, it makes it a little easy for them to discover.

197
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,160
Okay.

198
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,040
This central org has the ha is the place for us to go ask questions.

199
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,640
The disadvantage of course, is anytime that the team you work with the most,

200
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,440
uh, we're being not in the same org as them.

201
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,760
Uh, there's always a little bit of a fear or a challenge there, but again,

202
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,230
we are transparent and flat enough.

203
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,670
I don't think it'll make a difference, but, uh, it would be silly of me not to at

204
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:10,170
least consider that it could be an issue, but I'm not worried.

205
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,190
I mean, your culture is different than here.

206
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,180
So that's what's going on with me.

207
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,260
Not the, not a big change.

208
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,100
Sorry for the cliffhanger in slack and then the not that exciting of a change,

209
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,700
but we'll hear more stories cause you get to work with different people,

210
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,020
a whole different set of folks get to be my peers or as I should say,

211
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,860
a whole different set of people have to suffer through my questioning and, uh,

212
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,970
discernment,

213
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,650
interrogation,

214
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,050
discernment,

215
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,620
Oh, discernment. Sorry.

216
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,380
All right. So, um, that is what's going on with me.

217
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,300
I actually have a question for actually have two topics for today.

218
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,460
Would you like to start with data or test automation?

219
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,980
Oh, I want to start with, uh,

220
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,860
uh, automated checking for sure.

221
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,700
I would like to start by punching you in the throat.

222
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,700
So, uh, a little bit of a soapbox leading to a question.

223
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,900
You've all heard me see, say and discuss and write about that developers should

224
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,620
be doing the vast majority of the testing, testing,

225
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,060
and that they're definitely the best suited.

226
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,380
Not only can they test to the best,

227
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,020
definitely the best suited for test automation.

228
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,820
Also realize, well, before I even get there,

229
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,820
I will repeat a rant from, uh, maybe it was last episode,

230
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,700
more and more. I'm thinking that nobody should be writing any web automation.

231
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,710
Given, given how many of those tests it should be writing, not very many.

232
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,990
And given the massive improvements in reliability in the just recorded tests,

233
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,110
and there was a time when we hated those,

234
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,630
but for the web stuff with the AI they have in there,

235
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,510
which can detect changes and the massive amount saved and the fact that you're

236
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:07,510
well handcrafted tests are going to be flaky anyway, because, because reasons,

237
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,030
I would just have everyone use,

238
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,150
oddify Mabel test and test project, whatever,

239
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,550
something that lets you quickly create some tests for the main things you'd to

240
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,350
check in the, in the web, web UI, but that's not the rant.

241
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,190
I want to get out. It's not my question for you. Uh,

242
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,990
the question is despite the little bubble I live in,

243
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,950
where developers do write tests, many testers,

244
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,990
checkers, no testers insist that the majority of the industry doesn't and can't

245
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,430
work that way.

246
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,950
And that just because of the way things are and because changing things is,

247
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:50,780
is harder that they have to write the automation.

248
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,010
So, um, so despite all that, okay,

249
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,890
that isn't even my question yet. My question is I'm going somewhere.

250
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,570
I forgot where it was a couple of times, but I'll get there. Okay.

251
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,460
Let me just ask you this. So if I'm a tester,

252
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,460
and now you don't talk to any testers,

253
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,900
but if I'm a tester on your team and I say to you,

254
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,930
I would like to get into automation because that's what they say on the

255
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,250
internet. They say, I'm a manual tester and I want to get into automation.

256
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,690
And I face Palm twice, but if I say that to you,

257
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,220
I'm a manual tester and I want to get into automation. What do you tell me?

258
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,950
I, I, I'm like, what the hell have you been doing?

259
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,430
What do you mean you're an automated tester? I said, I'm a manual tester.

260
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:41,710
I want to get into automation.

261
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,190
I feebly responded because I'm like, uh,

262
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,270
the idea of a manual tester and on my team are

263
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,470
okay. All right. So you didn't play the part as I wished. Oh,

264
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,590
we should do,

265
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,350
we need a follow up to the modern testing manager versus traditional test manager

266
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,590
where we talk about automation or something like that. It'll be fun.

267
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,910
Uh, didn't plan ahead well enough on that, but no,

268
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,990
that would be a good idea though.

269
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,510
I am thinking more and more and more that the answer like I'm drinking some

270
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,150
tea right now. I usually have some water here,

271
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,390
but I think the answer to any injury or ailment is to drink more water.

272
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,790
If you, if you're feel horrible after the second modern shop, just drink water.

273
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,870
You'll be fine. Break a leg, drink more water. You'll be fine. Uh,

274
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,630
but for the automate for any problems in testing and quality,

275
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,470
my answer is getting to be more and more again and again, time after time,

276
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,750
pair with the developer.

277
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,030
Uh, I was actually going along the same line that I was thinking, you know what,

278
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:46,390
uh, let's find a bug for you to go fix or something,

279
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,070
something that's a lightweight coding exercise.

280
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,230
But I need to automate the UI, man. That's, that's,

281
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,750
that's what the cool kids do in this case. Also,

282
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,630
I is also a broken problem where these people writing web automation,

283
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:05,190
they're automating a bunch of BS.

284
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,620
I'm going to automate these user scenarios because I can.

285
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,130
So I wonder if imagine today we did,

286
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,330
imagine this today when someone wants to get into automation,

287
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,730
they take a class or they there's no books, they read some blogs,

288
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,330
they watch a whole bunch of crap about selenium.

289
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,650
I don't think that's right because then they end up automating like these,

290
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,610
they don't automate the right things. They're,

291
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,330
they don't know how to design automated tests. I don't know what to automate.

292
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,330
If you go talk to the dev and you say, Hey,

293
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,090
I want to get into automation and instead of this as great,

294
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,930
what do you want to automate? And they say,

295
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,010
I want to make sure that I can put things in the shopping cart and check out,

296
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:48,210
blah, blah, blah, and do it in all these permutations. That's great.

297
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,210
But we can do all that at the logic layer or just having that

298
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:57,170
conversation with the person who actually knows how it's implemented.

299
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,370
And some people are going to say, but Alan, but Mr. Weasel,

300
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:04,890
when, when the developer, they, they,

301
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,850
they can't think about testing. They only care about the code and not the

302
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:12,090
customer and I bullshit and crap. Uh, and I,

303
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,490
if that accent defended anybody, I meant that to be, uh, just, uh,

304
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:20,370
me as a young, young tester. So, uh, I did not mean to, um,

305
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,330
insight that anybody that actually sounds like that person,

306
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,650
I just made with anyone other but me.

307
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,890
My, my, my, I wish my middle son were here.

308
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:32,090
He has mastered the art of the, the,

309
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,490
the know it all bratty kid with.

310
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,690
Yeah. That's so the, the point is, I think if you have a discussion, uh,

311
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,930
and when you get over the fact that developers aren't going to be skewed or

312
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,770
tainted by the fact that know how it works,

313
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:49,050
you'll actually have a discussion on what the right things are to test and what

314
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,170
the right things are to automate.

315
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,770
It goes back to the anger Weasel's tautology of you should automate 100% of

316
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,290
all the tests that should be automated. A lot of people today,

317
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,490
especially in this web UI automation world are automating stuff that shouldn't

318
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,330
be automated.

319
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:07,090
Yeah. Actually, I want to go back to a basic question. Yes.

320
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,650
Like if you're a manual tester, somebody right now is going,

321
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,450
there's no such thing as manual testing. Do you call it manual programming?

322
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,790
But anyway, go on. No one's we're using the term to differentiate,

323
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,670
but no, uh, people who are creating test automation. So it's fine. No, no.

324
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:28,110
So you have a manual tester and, and no one would say it's,

325
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,950
there's no such thing. I do think there's a large number of people would say

326
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:37,110
it's redundant. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And so like for me,

327
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,750
why is it that they're saying,

328
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,150
I want to get into automation versus saying I want to get into

329
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:50,060
coding through automation.

330
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,780
Like that, that to me is the thing that I think is the important sort of

331
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:01,530
perspective. Like I don't care. Like automation,

332
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,230
as you just called out, um, from a testing standpoint,

333
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,390
like we got accelerate that's that absolutely tells the businesses,

334
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,630
your team,

335
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:18,070
your software company is going to have a

336
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,750
stronger performance when your devs own the

337
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,510
automation. That is true. That is true. I don't think, and again,

338
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,700
most of these people don't read book like accelerate.

339
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,260
They don't read books. They don't want to program.

340
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,580
They just want to make sure. Remember we started AB testing way back when,

341
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,020
to help people transition as, as jobs are changing.

342
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,900
These people for the most part want to get into automation because they're

343
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,940
worried their job will go away if they don't.

344
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,450
And what this, in my opinion,

345
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,290
what happens because of this is a bunch of people learn to crapily use

346
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,010
some crappy tools to create some crappy automation.

347
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,070
And I want that to stop. Well, yeah,

348
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,710
I don't have any data that says to what degree that happens.

349
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,790
I know that it does happen cause I've,

350
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,030
I've had to manage several of those transitions

351
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,670
and it's a, it's a journey,

352
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,470
but it's one that doubles down on things that I just don't

353
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:28,630
agree with anymore. Right. It's, it's, it's so,

354
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:33,190
if a, if a manual tester on my team came to me and said, Hey,

355
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,950
I want to do that. My first question is going to be why, why,

356
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,910
why, why are you doubling down on harming your career?

357
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,950
If that's where you want to go, you need to go in a different direction.

358
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:50,710
And for our world and for, and actually, and as you and I see,

359
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,140
the bubble that we live in is getting bigger and bigger and affect huger and

360
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,100
huger. That's what you're doing is actually, yes,

361
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,220
it's true and more and more of the world. And you're right.

362
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,180
My answer would be, well, if I had, I would never have, I mean,

363
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,220
I may have a tester,

364
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,060
but they would never want to get into automation because it understands that

365
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:18,200
automation is the developer's job. So this can't happen in our world,

366
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,180
but in a world where a tester asks you this,

367
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,500
yeah, I think getting into motivation and understanding why is really important.

368
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,780
But if they just want to do it, learn more about it,

369
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,740
the paths that we give people today,

370
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,340
the paths that we give people today who want to get into automation are the

371
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,540
wrong ones. Cause they, they lead them down a path,

372
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,780
which is not productive for their career. I think, yeah, no.

373
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,980
So what I, I want, because they don't design good tests.

374
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,580
They don't use the power of the computer to make some aspects of testing

375
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,860
easier. It said, or they just want to automate a bunch of clicky,

376
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:59,340
clicky, clicky user tasks and ask trivia questions about X path that I see on

377
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,540
LinkedIn all the time. I think by talking to the developer,

378
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,780
how should we test this? Cause the tester, they're going to have,

379
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,820
and despite the fact that the arguments people have with me,

380
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:14,380
when I said developers could test the expertise of the tester is if they're a

381
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,660
dedicated testing specialist,

382
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,100
they're going to have better testing ideas for a lot of things.

383
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,540
So talk about all those ideas with the person who should be writing the

384
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,900
automation in the first place.

385
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,380
And maybe they'll take you under their wing and have you write some of the more

386
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,460
simpler ones to start or pair a program with them and get an idea of how to write

387
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,580
test automation from someone who understands code design and test design,

388
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,300
automated test design, probably far better than you do.

389
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:43,420
That is a much better path to long-term success for your career.

390
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,020
Then reading a bunch of blogs on Selenium and getting excited because you can

391
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,460
make some archaic stuff, click a button on a screen.

392
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,100
Again, it comes back to their motivation.

393
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,820
If their motivation is saving their career, then,

394
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,340
then I would absolutely guide them in an entirely different direction. Right.

395
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:03,860
It's, it's, I'm like, yeah, that's,

396
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,980
obviously if they're coming to me, right, if they want to go to,

397
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,300
let's say one of the other thought leaders in this space,

398
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,340
that has a polar opposite opinion, right? Maybe that's the answer.

399
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,020
I send them to there because look,

400
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,060
I can't, from where I'm coming from,

401
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,700
I can't even see you from, from, from where I'm at. Right. I, that's,

402
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,980
that's now an entirely foreign idea to me. And to me, it's harmful.

403
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,260
But the,

404
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,700
but if that's their motivation, then their motivation,

405
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:42,540
my answer would be to redirect to something that I felt was far more

406
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,140
productive. Right. The,

407
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,720
if their other motivation might be to,

408
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,880
hey,

409
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,960
we're lacking coverage and I want to,

410
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,350
I want to accelerate the coverage. Hey,

411
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:02,190
I'm supportive of that. Right. That would be, again,

412
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,470
what you're saying is, Hey,

413
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,830
pair program with the developer who should be the one accountable for that

414
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,750
automation,

415
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,470
work through their template and, and,

416
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:18,190
and learn from that as you add additional coverage. Right.

417
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,830
But also throw in, right.

418
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,270
The,

419
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,630
the developer should not be allowing coverage into their suite,

420
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,390
unreviewed and do put them through at least the,

421
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,710
the code review and,

422
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,310
and those others are the processes.

423
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,870
So that person gets familiarity with how code is produced.

424
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,830
Design constructs,

425
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,830
that might pop out of that.

426
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,100
Right. Um,

427
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,020
it might not. Uh,

428
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,340
I would hope it did,

429
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,020
but in a way that didn't blow the person's mind.

430
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,980
I don't know.

431
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,120
I just typed into duck duck go. I'll, I'll,

432
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,080
you won't hear me type in the edited version,

433
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,000
but I typed in literally I'm a manual tester and I want to get into

434
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,960
automation. So let me lead you, read you a few of the, uh,

435
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm not going to go into the pages,

436
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,120
just the part that shows up in the search page. Um,

437
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,410
many manual testers wish to land an automation job with qualifications of

438
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,250
manual testing.

439
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,410
The process of learning coding is tedious and for a person working as a manual

440
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,410
tester for so long, this means going back to square one,

441
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,530
never what other one it requires dedication, hard work, motivation,

442
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,600
lots of time and money to train for a test automation job.

443
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,240
You do not start with the test automation libraries to selenium.

444
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,680
No, you start with something considering the market situation.

445
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,720
Many manual testers are now becoming more interested in test automation.

446
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,120
Some want to expand their skills by including programming,

447
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,200
test automation framework in their testing toolbox.

448
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,480
Others are contemplating switching direction completely. It goes on. I'm, I'm,

449
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,440
it's making me sad. So the, the point there is, and tell me if I'm wrong,

450
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,480
I think one, you want to get motivation.

451
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Is the point there that our bubble is still too small or I mean,

452
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,840
I don't, I acknowledge I live in a bubble on this, on this front.

453
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,920
We both do. I think the more we talk to people,

454
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,760
the more I find out our bubble is bigger than we think it is sometimes.

455
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,960
Maybe at least I think it is because a lot of people go, oh yeah,

456
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,800
we already do that.

457
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,560
Given these answers and given some of the folks who doubled down and freak out

458
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,960
when we do make some of our, uh, what our outlet,

459
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,560
what are not outlandish points, uh, there are people out there with this,

460
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,360
this is a, that's a thing they do.

461
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,720
And I think the thing they should do when they want to get into automation is for

462
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,760
whatever reasons, the part that drives me crazy.

463
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,360
They think I want to get into test automation.

464
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,320
So I'm going to learn how to click around a webpage with this shiny new

465
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,390
framework. I think that's the wrong place to start. And I think I could just,

466
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,270
do you want to think about test design? You want to make,

467
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,030
you want to do this one and I've done, I've,

468
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,590
I've talked about that before long in the past,

469
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,270
how to think about test design.

470
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,990
I've given talks on test design that help you think like which tests should be

471
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,830
automated and not, and what you can use the power of the computer for.

472
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,990
But I'm tired of doing that. It's not what I do anymore.

473
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,510
I'd rather just, I think some good generic devices,

474
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,910
if you want to get into automation or get into programming,

475
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,430
go talk to the developers on your team,

476
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:32,510
find opportunities to pair with them on bug fixing or automation ideas,

477
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:36,970
et cetera. And if, if,

478
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:40,970
if it comes back that every single absolutely no developers on the team want to

479
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:46,090
work with you on that, well one, I hope that's not the case, but two,

480
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,010
it's a different problem than it's a different problem. Exactly.

481
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,530
And as you know, there's, there's part of this bubble is I listened to,

482
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:57,450
and I, I ranted a little bit about this on, on our Slack group,

483
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,130
but I listened to a panel of people who do exploratory testing and,

484
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,200
which I have nothing against exploratory testing. Although once I,

485
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,840
I made a joke about whether I could use the word exploratory testing.

486
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,160
If I wasn't in the special club,

487
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,120
this was 15 years ago when a certain group of people on the internet were

488
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,720
talking about it a lot and correcting people that they didn't use it right.

489
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,480
And one of them wrote me an email just bitching the hell out of me for,

490
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,480
for referring to it that way. And like, there's no club,

491
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,660
you're just being a jerk. And well,

492
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,260
there is a club and I was being a jerk.

493
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,020
The folks on this panel talking about exploratory testing,

494
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,140
their ideas around ET were all fine.

495
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,820
But the scenarios they described on why it was valuable for them are right out of

496
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,780
1992. They get a new,

497
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,580
they're excited cause they get a new build from a development team they never

498
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,900
see. And they, and with no instructions and no notes,

499
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:04,730
and they get to figure out how it works and give them feedback. And well,

500
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,530
I guess maybe that could have been fun for me one time in my career.

501
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,490
That sounds like a living hell to me today.

502
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,060
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, completely hell. Uh, the,

503
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,940
yeah, I don't know what else to add to that one. The,

504
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,420
in fact, I will,

505
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,940
what other rant do we get back to the other question here?

506
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,020
Cause we only have like 15,

507
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,100
18 minutes left is some people on the other side of the bubble.

508
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,620
Like again, I'll go back to the one that really triggered people.

509
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,700
I talked about developers being able to do testing.

510
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,500
Still see post people saying, well, I'm in the developer's mindset.

511
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,500
I have to shift gears and change in order to find, to critique my own work.

512
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,300
And yeah, I get that.

513
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,620
But what is missing from a lot of these stories is that creating

514
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,140
good software is a highly collaborative process.

515
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:00,100
And yeah, it is a little harder maybe to do your own testing when you're just by

516
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,020
yourself. But if you make something by yourself, you're probably not,

517
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,050
probably don't have a lot of customers. Uh,

518
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,530
when you're trying to do something significant,

519
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:11,690
it's a collaborative process and that collaboration is, uh,

520
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,420
where you get the benefit from.

521
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,820
And there's so much in what you said. I want to,

522
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,860
I want to just go on a rant on the very first statement is I have to shift

523
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,460
to the, the, the, the tester mindset to move forward. That's to me,

524
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,980
like, why is it phrase that way?

525
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,540
When I sit down to write a new chunk of code, okay,

526
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:40,740
I go through, uh, the TDD process and I say, okay,

527
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,560
now before I begin, it's, it, to me,

528
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,440
it's more like a Steven Covey. Have you ever read, ever read Steven Covey?

529
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh yeah.

530
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:54,880
Okay. Begin with the end in mind. What is the end?

531
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,920
How can I sit down before even get colored by how the code was written and be,

532
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,200
you know, no, uh,

533
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,440
run the risk of not being able to discern the forest from the trees.

534
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,320
According to this, um, this theory is, is, okay, well,

535
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,440
how do I know if I got there? What's the sunny day scenarios?

536
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,880
What's the rainy day scenarios?

537
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,240
What are the tests that I'm going to, to write up first?

538
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,080
Uh, and then I'm going to write my code to,

539
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,520
to the point where they pass those tests. Okay.

540
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,440
I can get a long ways there. Will I forget about things?

541
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,240
Will I neglect something on my own? Damn straight.

542
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,520
But that's not because I'm going to developer versus tester mindset.

543
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,200
That whole thing is, is, is bull. And we've,

544
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,080
I think our listeners get that. I don't want to go too far in the echo chamber,

545
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,600
but it's still out there. I wanted to mention it. Did you want to rant some more?

546
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,640
No, no. So in this one, I'm just like, how much of this,

547
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,480
of this point of view is being solidified because the,

548
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,840
the language choice and,

549
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,120
and how they're presenting it in the first place is just bullshit. Like to me,

550
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,360
actually you represent this all the time on the podcast. So, and you, you go,

551
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,840
Hey, here's a problem. Here's my definition of done.

552
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,600
This is how far I've gotten. Brent,

553
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,520
do you have any, any additional thoughts on this?

554
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,520
Like you've probably done it five or six times on this podcast. It's like,

555
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
no, it's,

556
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:33,300
it's the value of collaborating and recognizing,

557
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,460
and maybe that's it, maybe that's it.

558
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,300
Maybe that's my problem with specialists in some of this regards.

559
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,340
Like you and I have encountered this in the, in the old school days.

560
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,060
Like there were teams when I was a test manager that I would go talk to the dev

561
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,300
lead and he would just say, all right, if we have a bug,

562
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,420
it's test fault because my devs are,

563
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,980
are five star devs just ask them, right?

564
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,740
And there's this sort of specialization ego that gets

565
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,140
involved. And, and, and I'm wondering now,

566
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,460
because I am very much a generalizing specialist or a specialized,

567
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,740
and generalists, one of those things now. And I'm wondering,

568
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:16,240
am I a lot more collaborative now because I no longer even

569
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,680
pretend to believe that I frigging know everything,

570
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,180
right? I'm not trying to know everything.

571
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:28,340
I'm trying to accomplish a goal and I know quite a bit about it,

572
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,180
but I also know the things I don't know. And you know what?

573
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:34,060
I'm going to go ask Alan what his thoughts on this topic is,

574
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:39,090
or I'm going to go ask Sally what her thoughts are on this one.

575
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:45,380
Because we're better together. Yep. Whole team quality, baby. Yeah.

576
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,020
Maybe you saw this. I saw this on LinkedIn.

577
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,500
Someone was was ranting against whole team quality. Oh, I saw that. And I,

578
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,220
do you have whole team design? Uh, yeah. Yeah, you should.

579
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,660
Do you have whole team performance? Uh, yeah,

580
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,940
it was, uh, awkwardly, it was just awkward to watch.

581
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,300
It was, it was, it was a little cringy. Okay. Um, I have a question for you.

582
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,820
Different subject, different subject. You promised me something about data. I did.

583
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,820
I did because I ran into an interesting question recently,

584
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:28,900
which again, it comes down to framing and the question you and I often ask a

585
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:32,500
lot, a lot of people do is, okay, what's the outcome you want?

586
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:35,740
Imagine you had this, what are you going to do? The question,

587
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,940
what was, what was actual question? Uh, Hey, Alan,

588
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,940
do you have any tips for us? We want to build a data org. Okay. Okay.

589
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,300
What do you want to do? Well,

590
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,580
we want to be able to make a data driven decisions about our business.

591
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,830
Oh, you just,

592
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,870
you just immediately changed it to shit.

593
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,830
I deal with all of the time. Okay.

594
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,470
So what I want to know is because I'm here today for advice.

595
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,870
Cause the answer I gave him was that I need to think about,

596
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,670
this a little bit more. If you can give me some more context,

597
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:20,550
I'll get back to you hoping I could just chat to you about this, uh,

598
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,890
about this. So the stage I got them in,

599
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:26,130
they asked me those questions literally. That's what they want to do.

600
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,330
They want to be more data driven and building a data org is the answer they

601
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:34,170
decided on. And right now the,

602
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:38,530
this team is trying to understand, okay, what will this data or do?

603
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,290
What questions will they help us answer?

604
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,810
And I feel like I can't put a finger on it,

605
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,450
but I feel like they're starting at the wrong end of the question. Um, yeah,

606
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,930
I was going to say, uh,

607
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:54,690
though just with the questions that you asked me, uh,

608
00:35:54,770 --> 00:36:00,020
that is absolutely a sign of the tail wagging the dog.

609
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,860
Yeah, I felt that way. I'm checking with you. So, so what do you do?

610
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,220
Imagine just came to you like,

611
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,980
what are the questions you asked to get the tape to get the,

612
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,660
to get to the front of the dog?

613
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:15,500
I have better metaphor is the underwear norms, right? On this one, right?

614
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:19,740
We got data where we're missing step two,

615
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:25,160
but once we find finished that up, massive profit. Yeah.

616
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Okay. So the first thing they have to unwind is what is a data culture and

617
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,440
hold on a second. I just rolled over my goddamn headphones.

618
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,160
The, I can imagine I got his pause for a second here. Let me come back is, uh,

619
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,680
I got to imagine it's like Brent's on a rolly chair rolling around.

620
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,520
I've been sitting on a ball the last month or two. So I can bounce. All right,

621
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,280
go on to tell me, tell me what, what to tell this team. Um,

622
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,800
they want to improve the, the, the data culture of the org. Okay.

623
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,940
Correct. So what is, so in my mind,

624
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,580
I would say, okay, what are the principles that are going to find that?

625
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:11,380
And, uh, again, what are the actions? Cause improving,

626
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,180
like even improving the data culture of the org, that is a,

627
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,740
like I did that presentation. It's basically, right?

628
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,180
It's essentially how do we transform? Right. And it's essentially,

629
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:31,180
what you're trying to do is make quantification a stronger influence than

630
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,900
intuition on decision-making. Sure.

631
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,480
So that like the first thing I would say is they have so much to learn before

632
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,000
they would even begin doing that. Like it,

633
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,440
if someone came to me, I would with that question now,

634
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,160
and I would immediately go and say, uh, this needs to stop. Like, um,

635
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,800
but, but you can't say this needs to stop. They have a,

636
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,320
they have the right to do it.

637
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,200
They can't say this needs to stop. They have,

638
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,640
they have the right desire in place. Let's go back to the beginning. Right. They,

639
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,320
they want to be more data driven. They want to quantify over intuition.

640
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,440
Those are all good things. We want those things.

641
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,360
So I can't just tell them to go away. I think they're solving that, that they,

642
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,440
they define their end state. We always have current state. We don't have,

643
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,950
we were data oblivious desired state want to be data driven. Uh,

644
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:25,870
what are the next, what are the right next steps for a team like that?

645
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,190
So begin with the end of mind, you know,

646
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:31,030
what is the single most important in,

647
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:34,830
and you want me to wind this to the head count. So you're going to need,

648
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,150
like from this, you're going to need a lot of PMS.

649
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,230
You're going to need a lot of data engineers.

650
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:48,150
You're going to need developers to buy off on, um,

651
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:51,550
telemetry. Am I not going to the right director?

652
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,870
I think so. I, a little bit,

653
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:57,390
something I've noticed for years and years and years,

654
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,350
even going back to my time at Microsoft in the early days of a data science,

655
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,190
some of you may recall,

656
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:07,750
I actually briefly led one of Microsoft's first data science engineering teams,

657
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,790
that a science teams when I worked for Chris on the stupid, the stupid thing,

658
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,630
I ended up giving that I ended up hiring, uh, uh,

659
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,510
Gigi and given him and given him that role. Oh, right.

660
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:22,790
But I did it to hold, to hold things down, but there was an idea.

661
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:27,390
And I see this notion. I hear it a little bit between the lines from this team.

662
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,590
And I've seen it before where teams think, okay,

663
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:37,350
we just get a bunch of data and then we'll get a data scientist and they'll

664
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:41,230
just make cool things happen in there. Magic, magical happen.

665
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,070
When, when someone comes to me along these lines, it's,

666
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:49,350
it's essentially a belief that all we need to do is hire a bunch of dead

667
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,510
engineers, right? It's essentially build it, and they will come.

668
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:58,310
Okay. And that's when you came to me, that's what raised in my mind. Oh my God,

669
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,350
this is a building. They will come exercise. Yeah.

670
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:04,550
I think they're starting with what are the questions we can answer with data.

671
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:07,910
We'll make a big list of those and then we'll hire a team to go make sure we can

672
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:13,300
answer them, which seems it doesn't, it, I know it's wrong.

673
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,820
What's the alternative? What I can't just tell them, I don't think this is

674
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,300
wrong. Don't do it this way. Cause then the next question is,

675
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,020
how should we do it? You gotta do, you gotta do a journey, right?

676
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,580
The, the first thing everybody wants is, uh, I,

677
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,300
and I don't know what unity uses, but, um,

678
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:36,980
first thing everybody wants is their pretty little dashboards, right? So it's,

679
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,020
it's having the dashboards there gives proof that the data is there, right?

680
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:51,220
Um, and, but it doesn't advance the data culture per se.

681
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:57,780
It creates a new bottlenecking team. You'll end up having, uh, you know, five,

682
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:02,020
depending on the size of the team, five or six vendor, uh,

683
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,860
power BI developers,

684
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:08,980
then you'll end up having your unfair share of data engineers,

685
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:13,900
uh, who are spending 50% of their time. I call it data hurting.

686
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,580
It's sort of data, the data version of cat hurting.

687
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,300
It's essentially a going through and figuring out where the hell the data is,

688
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,780
because of course there's no, there's no, um,

689
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,420
formal data engineering structure in play. Like the first thing I would,

690
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,660
I would hire would be a,

691
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,700
a business analyst who would come in and absolutely figure out what are the

692
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,740
actual important business questions to answer.

693
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:48,340
I would almost start that way. Just hiring a business analyst,

694
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,180
biz, biz dev kind of person to figure out,

695
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,460
figure out those questions cause they're going to know better.

696
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,700
They're going to know better what they want to solve. So,

697
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,220
but the thing to keep in mind here also is that I'll bring up is,

698
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,500
is if they know the questions they want to answer already,

699
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:11,010
then they can go add the instrumentation so they can answer those questions

700
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:16,290
where I've seen value from data engineering or data science teams is helping me

701
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,370
figure out what questions I want to answer.

702
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,530
There are two approaches there, right? It's like,

703
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:26,730
you're far from a data science space right now. If,

704
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:28,610
right, maybe I don't know.

705
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:32,730
Well in my current org got a crap ton of data scientists cause they do all the

706
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,130
modeling and prediction algorithms for our, for our, our advertisement placements.

707
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,290
All right. So that team should be approached.

708
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:45,730
That team should be approached and say, Hey, we want to do this broader.

709
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,700
What's the unity gaps?

710
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,500
Cause that team's going to understand where the pain points are.

711
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,660
Yeah. For again, this is actually the team. I'm,

712
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,180
this is the team asking about this, not a unity team. Um,

713
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,540
so making that connection isn't as easy. Uh,

714
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,060
and it would be a little bit different. Gotcha. Gotcha. No, no,

715
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:08,220
it's not a unity team that, that, that puts it into a different context.

716
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:12,940
I have gotten, uh, questions before around, um,

717
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:18,580
if you hire two people, you want to hire, um, you want to hire,

718
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,580
um, number one, a business analyst who will,

719
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:27,020
who's experienced in this and will, we'll go through first and foremost,

720
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,900
what are the questions that the business is trying to answer?

721
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,140
The second thing you need is a data engineering architect.

722
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:34,770
Cause, um,

723
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:39,810
the biggest slowdown in this space is cleaning the data and even discovering the

724
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,170
data, putting something in place where that data can be curated up front without

725
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:49,530
turning it into a month.

726
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:55,090
I've seen huge pain points from that when people have gone crazy,

727
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,690
crazy, where people have gone wild, uh,

728
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,530
excessive with the data collection with poor schemas in place and just things

729
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,370
are broken forever.

730
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,530
They're broken forever, but then the,

731
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,370
the solution is not to go the other way either. Right?

732
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:12,250
Cause I've also see, uh, people propose monthly, um,

733
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:16,970
multi milestone, uh, big design up front. Oh,

734
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,010
we're going to,

735
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:21,250
we're not even going to write the first line of code until we have, you know,

736
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,530
figured out the entire perfect snowflake schema for the entirety of the

737
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,970
company. And I'm like, okay. Um, you know, 10 years when you,

738
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:33,650
when you failed to achieve that circle back with me,

739
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,400
because basically then where data science comes into play,

740
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,760
you're right. There are two places for, for data science here.

741
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,040
Number one is the simpler one, which is hypothesis testing.

742
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,160
It are deductive reasoning. And in their earlier phases,

743
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,880
that's the more in the earlier phases of the company towards this.

744
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,640
That's actually the one I would suggest doing.

745
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,640
It's basically the intuitionists have a belief and you use deductive reasoning

746
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,800
to, to prove or disprove it.

747
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,080
It helps to get that moving forward. Then when that gets tiresome,

748
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,560
because you know, after every hundred hypotheses,

749
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,880
only two to become validated,

750
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,360
then you want to go into inductive reasoning.

751
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,360
We're using AI and ML to learn the patterns within the data.

752
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,880
And push them up so that someone can, can go, okay,

753
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,760
is this interesting or uninteresting? Um,

754
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,320
but it all starts on that,

755
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,920
that journey starts on in my mind very clearly with the two bookends.

756
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,400
How do we create a solid curation culture of the data and treat the data as if

757
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,920
it's a product that's that's prob for my experience.

758
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,040
That is probably the single hardest challenge is,

759
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,480
is that the, the, the PM, the dev team, they'll have data,

760
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,800
but they're not viewing that as a challenge.

761
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,680
And so people are trending stuff or on trying to understand what happened here.

762
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,520
And there's a lot of gaps and holes. And it's not,

763
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,160
from a dev point of view is like, look,

764
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,580
I'm just sharing my diagnostic feed. If I don't, right,

765
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,460
don't ask me to turn it into a product. And then I'm like, no,

766
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:26,820
that's exactly what I'm doing. It's great that you can,

767
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,260
you can use my data for other things, Brent, um, but it's not a product.

768
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,620
And I'm like, uh, actually it is now.

769
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,530
There's a, we need to wrap up. There's a meta point here, which is, uh,

770
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:41,130
I think, you know, you and I both get this a lot.

771
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:43,690
I'm sure a lot of the three do as well. Uh,

772
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:49,500
people will ask you how to get started on something they've set up

773
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,780
fundamentally wrong. In fact,

774
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,340
this question is actually at the meta level is very similar to, Hey,

775
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,600
I want to get into automation. What do you really want to do?

776
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,740
I want to build a data team. What do you really want to do?

777
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,890
And even then, and so the five whys is a fantastic tool here.

778
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,540
Like, okay, great. You advance the data culture of the organization.

779
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,780
Why does the business care? Yeah. And that's definitely a line of questioning.

780
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,940
I'll get into, um, when I discuss this with these folks that asked me,

781
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:28,180
I think they'll say, well, we want to improve our business. Why? How? Yeah.

782
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,700
It'll be fun. Uh, okay. Well,

783
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:33,140
thank you for helping with that and need a little bit of framing on that.

784
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,060
I think it's really just one of those coaching consulting,

785
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,980
asking a bunch of questions to get people to reflect on what they're really

786
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,530
trying to do. Uh, but a little bit of context helps me out. All right.

787
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:47,010
I am late for another meeting. I'm going to get going, but Brent,

788
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:51,290
as usual, it's been good talking with you on our AB testing podcast.

789
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,450
And, and you as well,

790
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:58,570
I will talk to you and the three next time.

791
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,910
Awesome. See ya.
