1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:12,570
Hello everybody!

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,570
Howdy!

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,570
I'm Alan.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,570
I'm Brent.

5
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,570
Back for episode 39 of AB testing.

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,570
Welcome back.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,570
I remember the number.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,570
Right?

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,570
Yeah, it helps.

10
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,570
Because Brent wrote it on the board.

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,570
Yeah, it helps.

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,570
It does help.

13
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,570
It does help.

14
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,070
So, ask me where I've been, Brent.

15
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,070
Where have you been, Alan?

16
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,390
I just got back last night.

17
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,470
I flew back from Waterloo and boy, my arm's tired.

18
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,470
Ha ha!

19
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,290
Ba dum bum.

20
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,290
I went to Waterloo.

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,730
Do you know where Waterloo is?

22
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,730
No.

23
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:40,730
Canada.

24
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,850
A?

25
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,570
Is it Tim Hortons right next to it?

26
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,530
Of course there is.

27
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,170
Waterloo is about an hour drive west of Toronto.

28
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,970
So I flew into Toronto, drove to Waterloo, parked my car where it stayed until I drove

29
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,330
back to the airport.

30
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:06,850
But in between there, I had dinner with the board of KWSQA and then I gave a talk to

31
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:12,850
a sold out hundred-ish group of software quality professionals.

32
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,850
Sold out!

33
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,570
You raking in the testing cash!

34
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,570
Yes.

35
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,290
Yes, it's all on paper money.

36
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,850
But it was a good time.

37
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,050
Is that how you afforded all this fancy new equipment you got brought in today?

38
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,570
So Brent just wants to change the subject and go.

39
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,890
Happy 39th birthday to A.B.

40
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,890
Testing.

41
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,770
I bought us a new mixer.

42
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:42,730
So whether you can actually hear us after this podcast is, we will find out.

43
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,090
I don't know if that will work or not.

44
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,450
Hey what's this button do, Alan?

45
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,210
Don't push any buttons because normally when I get a new piece of audio equipment I will

46
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,370
take time to learn it and make sure I understand what all the buttons do.

47
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:03,380
And although I've had mixers similar to this in the past, let me make sure, yes I'm

48
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,460
actually recording on.

49
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,620
I just thought that's a brief nightmare.

50
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,860
Like I had set it up to record and then like left the program recording off of the

51
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,580
laptop microphone, but I didn't.

52
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,020
So we're actually recording off these microphones.

53
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,540
So anyway, the subject was, I was talking about Waterloo where I had a great time.

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,140
I knew there was a lot of tech there.

55
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,780
I know Microsoft has recruited a lot from University of Waterloo there because they

56
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,400
have a great program where they do lots of internships, which is super valuable.

57
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,980
And anyway, I didn't realize how much tech was there.

58
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,580
They have like 200 startups there and all kinds of tech.

59
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,740
There's this huge physics building next to the hotel where I stayed.

60
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Pretty cool town.

61
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,900
I liked it.

62
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,980
And I gave a talk that was similar to, I think I'm probably going to give an evolution of

63
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,100
these talks I imagine over the next few years and it'll go into our topic today, but sort

64
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,420
of what is the role of testers in this new world of software development, whether

65
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,980
it's agile testing, whether it's testing without developers.

66
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,820
Sometimes I feel really good about what I'm doing.

67
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,980
Sometimes as you know, I'm frustrated with, I feel like our team could be more agile than

68
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,380
it is.

69
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:22,340
But then I look at it from the delivering frequent customer value at a sustainable pace

70
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,740
and we managed to do that despite the fact that we do things that I don't feel very

71
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,700
agile-ish about.

72
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,380
So it depends a little bit how you look at it.

73
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,900
But anyway, I'm sharing a bunch of stories about what I do, what's worked for me, what's

74
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,180
done, what to worry about, what not to worry about.

75
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,820
I asked a question at the beginning like how many of your testers, all the hands go

76
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,820
up.

77
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,980
How many of you are here because you're afraid, you think I'm going to tell you how your job

78
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,300
is going to go away and all the hands go up.

79
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,220
And by the end they're going, okay, I don't feel so bad.

80
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,700
I kind of get where I fit in in this new world, which is I think a great gospel to

81
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,210
share.

82
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:59,140
Yeah, you, was that, that's not the same presentation.

83
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,420
Was it the same presentation you did for what was the QA?

84
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,860
No, I cannot give the same presentation in a row.

85
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,540
So what I do is I wanted to give a variation of that talk.

86
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,040
So I got, excuse me, I got rid of about half the slides, added another half to fill in,

87
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,080
and let it evolve that way.

88
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
I believe in evolution.

89
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,080
I assume the, yeah.

90
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:25,300
A lot of the same ideas come out, but I can't give the same talk, I've done it before,

91
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,380
internally at Microsoft, when I used to teach things like at Neo and classes and things.

92
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:35,520
But I don't like to give the same presentation twice because it gets stale for me fast.

93
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,540
So I like to always change it and not just a little.

94
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,300
I like to change it, you know, at least 25, if not 50% if I'm going to give something

95
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,040
sort of in the same topic.

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,120
And as I learn more and as I do more things.

97
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,680
There's some valuing consistency.

98
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,800
I think to me it's just like the same principles that apply to software work.

99
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,960
I want to evolve.

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
I want to iterate.

101
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,560
I want to make, I want to throw out what didn't work and add what I think will work

102
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,000
before and listen and learn from that.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I agree.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,900
Of course you do because I'm right.

105
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,690
There's an agile onboarding deck that I've been carrying around with me for the last

106
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,770
five years.

107
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:24,690
And every presentation I go through, I am happy to say that it's now at a point where

108
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,170
I essentially do minor tweaks.

109
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:34,640
The onboarding process is very similar to going through a class, right?

110
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,240
You got to talk about the same things.

111
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:44,090
You got to say the same reasons why essentially the only differences I do now with this deck

112
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,090
is I change the stories.

113
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,690
And we're always getting new stories.

114
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:49,690
Right.

115
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,730
There's new, and not even the stories, even experiences.

116
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,830
And I like sharing those.

117
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,590
So a funny thing happened on the way to the forum.

118
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,810
What?

119
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,570
With the forum being sort of me going to Waterloo and the reference to the musical.

120
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,410
Are you catching on here?

121
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,400
No.

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
No.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Someday I'll introduce you to culture.

124
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,720
Good luck with that.

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,140
Many have tried before.

126
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,980
I'm still trying to work on getting into soccer.

127
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,980
And thank you.

128
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
That should be an easier one for you.

129
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,980
We'll see you next time on People's Testing.

130
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,980
God!

131
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,120
Oh my, my, my.

132
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,190
So I was, hey, don't you have another conference coming up?

133
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,190
I do.

134
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,190
I do.

135
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:39,170
Oh, tell us about that.

136
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,290
I'll be at Better Software in Las Vegas.

137
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,290
Oh, sweet.

138
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,890
Are you a gambler?

139
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,890
No I'm not at all.

140
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,250
Because you don't know the games?

141
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,690
No, I know the games.

142
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,680
I just like money.

143
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,260
I don't like losing it.

144
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,140
I don't like to pretend that I...

145
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:01,100
What you need to do is go, you go buy chips.

146
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
You're buying chips.

147
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
Yeah.

148
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,620
And then I give them to the guy with the cards.

149
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,460
And then it's not money anymore.

150
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,940
You're losing chips.

151
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,720
No, I'm really not interested.

152
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,600
I often won't gamble at all.

153
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,360
Sometimes I'll play, I'll be very careful to walk up to the lowest wage blackjack table

154
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,880
I can find and I'll play for like 20 minutes and walk away just a little poorer than I

155
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,880
came.

156
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,120
But I'm not really into gambling.

157
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,680
I really like holding on to my money versus just giving it away to people for a very brief

158
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
amount of entertainment.

159
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Yeah.

160
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,320
I could have went and saw Deadpool again for that much money.

161
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,560
Would have lasted longer.

162
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,360
Hey, I finally seen Deadpool.

163
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Deadpool.

164
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Really?

165
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
That was really funny.

166
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Okay.

167
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,320
So anyway, yeah, I'm going to the Better Software Conference.

168
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,440
That's like the first Monday in June.

169
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,200
I'm giving a workshop on A-B testing or experimentation.

170
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,720
I have some good information.

171
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,000
I feel pretty good about that.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,520
About filling my time and having some good information.

173
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm not going to give away all the secrets today.

174
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,080
Was the last time we did this a workshop format?

175
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,880
No, last year, about a year ago, I got a call.

176
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:25,140
It was less than a year ago because I got mail that said pretty much something, hey,

177
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,740
are you free next Thursday to give a presentation in Las Vegas?

178
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,740
This was on like Friday.

179
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,170
I said, okay.

180
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,370
So I went down and gave someone that canceled and I went down and filled in and gave a presentation

181
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,970
on A-B testing.

182
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,810
One thing about Seattle to Vegas, direct flights about 25 a day.

183
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,050
Easy to get there and back.

184
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,370
And apparently went well enough that Mr. Copeland called and said, hey, so next year, how about

185
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,370
a workshop?

186
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,370
Same topic.

187
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,890
I said, sure.

188
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,180
So here we are.

189
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,180
All right.

190
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,180
Shall we get to the topic of the day?

191
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
We should.

192
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,180
So remember when I remember like a half hour ago when I was about to go into a new subject

193
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,980
and you distracted me?

194
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,280
While I was there, I was checking out the Twitterverse.

195
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,680
While I was in Waterloo, I was checking out the Twitterverse as I don't often do these

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,560
days but do when I'm traveling to see what's going on.

197
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:29,380
And there was a tweet and I'm going to get into, I was going to dance around for the

198
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,220
beginning, I'll dance around context, but we'll have to get into it.

199
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,260
There was a tweet from another small workshop conference.

200
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,700
Wait, wait.

201
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
First and foremost.

202
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,790
Without explaining it, do you know the context?

203
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:49,790
Yes, there was a conference on, a peer conference on reinventing testing by James Bach.

204
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,790
Okay.

205
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,030
I'm going to go ahead and use names up at, and I'll get into the rest later, up at, I

206
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,590
think it was placed in Orchis Island and there was one slide that was controversial.

207
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:05,630
So while it could have been, well, it could have been just contained within the workshop,

208
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:11,790
Matt Hoiser for reasons, I think, to stir up controversy or to just share it with the

209
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,010
world or to share his thoughts, took a picture of it and tweeted it.

210
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:26,680
And I looked at it and I thought, what the front door is very interesting.

211
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:35,670
So it was, I don't want to go into a lot of, I want to try and just look at the facts

212
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,790
here and my experiences and how they relate to the bullet points versus I think there's

213
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,590
a lot of psychology that I could go into why James put these bullet points on the slide.

214
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,070
Because I think James is really smart and I like him.

215
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:56,710
And the only thing I'm going to say is it's slide comes across as very defensive and

216
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,550
without context in many cases.

217
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,350
So again, not a slime on James.

218
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,670
And thanks, Matt, for posting it.

219
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm sure, I'm not sure how James feels about that now that the controversy is rolling,

220
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,480
but I do want to talk about the bullet points on the slide.

221
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,240
So if you haven't seen it, you can go find it.

222
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,640
Look for the, and what was really weird is the make testing great again tag.

223
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,240
It's a little too Trump like and made things a little awkward for me.

224
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,540
But actually, can we start with it?

225
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Sure.

226
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
Sure.

227
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Make testing.

228
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,320
Great again.

229
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,820
When you read that literally make testing great again, right?

230
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:50,160
I don't think there's anyone, well, at least in my mind, there's no one that's going to

231
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,960
disagree with that when you look at it literally.

232
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:06,010
Now I suspect that the intent behind that hashtag is make testers great again.

233
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,480
I don't want to, I think it's unfair of us for to dissect the words and go into intent.

234
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,680
No what I want to do is there's, so for me, this is relatively context free.

235
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
All right.

236
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,680
Okay.

237
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,680
I'll let you continue.

238
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:30,660
And what I want to really what I want to address is look at this sort of visually

239
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,400
on its face.

240
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:43,000
What is from our point of view, the most likely interpretation of the intent here as well

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,840
as what is what would be the most respectful interpretation.

242
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Okay.

243
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,900
So spit it out.

244
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,740
That's so for me, making testing great again.

245
00:12:54,740 --> 00:13:06,430
I know most or the three will know that we are supportive of unified engineering.

246
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,070
We are supportive of agile practices.

247
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:19,360
We are not necessarily, I know I'm, I don't want to speak for you here, but I am definitely

248
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:32,160
not supportive of a large dedicated testing, tester individuals that all they do.

249
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:41,150
But the hashtag says test Dean and I am definitely supportive of testing improvements.

250
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:45,310
But I believe that those efforts need to be moved up the stack.

251
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:49,950
I need, I believe dev needs to be trained on these things.

252
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:53,850
And that's how we achieve making testing great again.

253
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,420
One of the things, uh, that was a lot of words to not say very much.

254
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,820
I said a whole bunch of, okay.

255
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
All right.

256
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,620
So one of the things I tweeted in some tweets term about this was that I'm working with

257
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,740
some of the best testers I've worked with in my 20 years, 25 years of testing.

258
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,620
They're just not called that.

259
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Right.

260
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,360
Yeah, it's true.

261
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:27,090
The yeah, the, the, the other thing when I, when I first look at this, right, I like that

262
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,640
line.

263
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:36,480
Um, it reminds me of our presentation at redfin where, uh, one of the questions that got asked

264
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,840
us is, is in my view, this sort of old school archaic, uh, question of, well, isn't it true

265
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,760
that if devs test their own code, they can't maintain objectivity.

266
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
Right.

267
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,460
And I'm no, it's not true.

268
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,700
That is actually, that's a myth.

269
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,420
And uh, and some people would say that the op that, that the opposite is a myth.

270
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,420
There's a big, that's a controversy.

271
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,750
It's a disagreement.

272
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,180
Software testing is not a field without controversy.

273
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,310
Yeah.

274
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:14,030
So for, for 22 years now, I guess I've been dealing with, um, even when I was in test,

275
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,030
right?

276
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,710
And dealing with the questions around is a great tester, uh, born or made.

277
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,710
Whatever.

278
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,710
Right.

279
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,550
So I want to get past the make testing great tag.

280
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,550
Go ahead.

281
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,550
Actually talk about the slide.

282
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,550
Go ahead.

283
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,310
So I'm going to, uh, let's have a discussion on the title and the bullet points.

284
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,870
Hopefully not too philosophical or long, but just kind of see what they mean to you, how

285
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,870
they resonate with you.

286
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,350
So the title of the slide, it says, this is the premise, the theme in the agile world.

287
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,960
There's an ongoing and longstanding attack on the testing role.

288
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,330
So you want to start?

289
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,330
Yes.

290
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:52,330
Go ahead.

291
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,330
And no.

292
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:55,050
So I look at that and I go, no, there's not.

293
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,050
But in a way there is a little bit.

294
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:06,920
There was one of the, uh, one of the books on agile had a chapter on manual testing and

295
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,480
the chapter said, and I'm paraphrasing or could have been called, it was manual testing

296
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,560
and it was just one page.

297
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,270
It said, don't do it.

298
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:21,160
And it was tongue in cheek and, and it, one thing and I'm paraphrasing some little correct

299
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,280
me and it's fine, but you get the idea.

300
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:32,410
Uh, the ads, any book on agile or any, actually this podcast, anything I say, anything you read

301
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:38,890
in a book, anything you hear anyone say, it is not a blueprint to tell you how to do everything.

302
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,250
Context always matters.

303
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,890
Whether you're in the context driven community or not, you have to be driven by context.

304
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,980
So, so when I read books on testing, I found plenty of stupid things.

305
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
Didn't mean testing was stupid.

306
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,740
It means there were some stupid things in there.

307
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,100
Same things happens in all the literature on agile.

308
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:05,860
Uh, so there have been jabs at not testing, not the testing activity, but little jabs

309
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:12,040
that the tester role, maybe do we need a team dedicated to doing testing?

310
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,600
So I can see a little bit where that's coming from.

311
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:23,720
But for me, no, I think in my experience in agile, um, testing has been, ah, for the most

312
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,070
part embraced, sometimes briefly forgotten, but then quickly remembered.

313
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:37,070
To me, when I look at that, I, I think of other industries that have gone through transition,

314
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,070
right?

315
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:46,730
Um, in the auto manufacturing world, there has been a ongoing and longstanding attack on horse

316
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,290
trainers, right?

317
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:57,690
If you think back to the 1800s and when the automobile was introduced in, um, similar in

318
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,530
in Detroit, when, when assembly lines, uh, started getting robots added to it.

319
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,530
No, not automation.

320
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,210
Automation will take our jobs away.

321
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,210
Right.

322
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,210
Exactly.

323
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,290
Uh, and actually that, no, that's a very good point because that's, that leads us

324
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,370
straight to manual versus automated testing.

325
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,370
Right.

326
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,690
Testing is not a world without controversy.

327
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,560
Now it's the world.

328
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:28,680
Any time there is a change in which the world, uh, is, is moving toward this is a better

329
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
practice.

330
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,740
Go ahead.

331
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,740
One of the points I made in, uh, it reminds me that I'll continue to make, I made it

332
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:39,660
up at Waterloo is I, before I said a minute ago, testing is not without controversy,

333
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,020
whether it's manual versus automated, exploratory versus scripted testers versus no testers titles.

334
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,140
Uh, you can do a couple of things with that.

335
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,660
You can either deny it and tell the world that this change is stupid and it's, and it's confrontational,

336
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,100
or you can figure out what it means for you.

337
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,020
How does that change me?

338
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:06,540
And anytime I look at a sufficiently complex problem, I will look at one technique I love

339
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,740
is look at extremes.

340
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,420
What would it look like if we automated everything?

341
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,340
What would be the bay, the gains, the benefits, as well as the drawbacks and losses.

342
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,460
And also what if we automated nothing?

343
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,620
What if we did everything without automation?

344
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,940
What would happen there?

345
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,700
And the answer is somewhere in between, depending on the product and the context and how often

346
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,820
you're shipping, those things are going to happen.

347
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,260
That the, where that slider is between those two is going to be in a different spot.

348
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,260
Yep.

349
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,140
And it's the same thing here in the world with, you know, are we, what would it be

350
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,890
if we had no testers versus a massive one to one or even larger test to dev ratio?

351
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,650
Look at the pros and cons figure out where that line is.

352
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,370
There are lots of inefficiencies there.

353
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,040
So that's going back to my topic from Waterloo and away from the topic on the page here.

354
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:55,200
But I think this first bullet point I'm going to go ahead and read because I think it's

355
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,520
in the, you finished because it will, it will relate to the title.

356
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Yeah.

357
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,800
It says agile was not created by testers or with testers.

358
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,480
It's a programmer's utopian vision.

359
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,870
So what's your takeaway on that?

360
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,710
I agree with the first sentence.

361
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't necessarily agree with the second.

362
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,690
Agile was, was around before the manifesto was around, right?

363
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:34,470
It was a large number of people seeing similar practices working through similar things.

364
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:39,840
And they said, Hey, let's get together and, and knowledge here.

365
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:54,700
Now the, the, this entire slide is, is sort of filled with controversial terms meant to

366
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:05,200
inspire emotion towards the point that the, the author is making the, the, just because

367
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:11,840
agile was created by or not created with testers.

368
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:19,800
We are to believe that that is sufficient to prove that it was a programmer's utopian

369
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,570
vision.

370
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,570
Right.

371
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,570
And, and right.

372
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:30,680
And you use the word utopia to sort of imply that this is a dreamlike state that's never

373
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,560
achievable.

374
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,560
And when I look at this slide, we talked about this on the podcast.

375
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:44,120
And if I had realized that we now had the ability to bring in the third mic, I would

376
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:52,970
have invited Jeffrey Weston to join us today so that we could, as we go through this slide,

377
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:59,060
also have a brief lesson on fallacies.

378
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:10,150
The, the, the thing that actually puzzles me about this slide is Bach is well known in

379
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:15,070
the testing world as a grandiose systems thinker.

380
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,070
Right.

381
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:23,760
But this slide, this slide without any context now, and I want to say one thing, one thing

382
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,390
very clearly, I don't suspect this happened, but if the slide that came after this just

383
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:35,750
said the word not, well, then, then I'm like, okay, I get the point you're trying to make.

384
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,710
That is a worthwhile comment to make.

385
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,310
I don't know if you ever read the Lessons in Software Testing book.

386
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,310
I have.

387
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,630
Well, one of the things they didn't ask me to quote anything from it is they would have,

388
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,910
they would say, blah is good on one page, next page, blah is bad.

389
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,950
Just showing context.

390
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,390
So that very well could have happened.

391
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,260
So we don't know that we don't.

392
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,260
We're out of context.

393
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,420
All right.

394
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,180
I don't think it's utopian.

395
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,220
I think it was, you know, add the manifesto came about.

396
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,460
There were some developers who were doing some lightweight development techniques who wanted

397
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,500
to figure out, can we, they're just trying to get rid of inefficiencies.

398
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,060
To me, anything that gets rid of inefficiencies, I'm a big fan of theory of constraints.

399
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,620
I think Agile and theory of constraints work well together.

400
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,380
It's about identifying what's the bottleneck.

401
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
Let's mitigate it enough.

402
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,380
We're not a bottleneck.

403
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,380
Let's move forward.

404
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,900
And Agile is about eliminating some of the bottlenecks and finding some of the things

405
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,980
that work well and finding ways to make them better.

406
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,300
It is not a playbook.

407
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,430
It is not a, you know, I think one of the things that, you know, you're talking about

408
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:39,750
utopian being a word that that makes it that as drama here, the fact that they call the

409
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,110
the principles of the principles of the called the Agile manifesto.

410
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,110
The principles are different.

411
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,710
But the manifesto sort of mentally conjures some of those same images.

412
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,100
It's easy to push back on something that's called the manifesto.

413
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,820
Well, and I've talked about it on the podcast before.

414
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:04,900
I'm not going to go deep, but as you well know, I am not a supporter of the manifesto.

415
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:11,300
It encourages people to just go look at one page and go, oh, I get Agile.

416
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:15,940
And Agile is far more complex than the waterfall model.

417
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,780
It's a lot of moving parts.

418
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,700
It's primarily a principle driven.

419
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,060
Yes, absolutely.

420
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:29,860
I don't even know if calling it a principle driven framework is even correct because how

421
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,220
do you have a framework with principles?

422
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:40,840
But as you call out correctly, it's about consistently identifying and eliminating waste.

423
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:54,050
The other thing on this first bullet point, right, the why is it a problem?

424
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,890
That's the thing that I ask myself upon reading this bullet point.

425
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,340
So what?

426
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,300
The one thing, and we talked about Ryneartson's book.

427
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:11,440
If you go into look at Ryneartson's book and you want to understand the details about why

428
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,500
they made that decision, this is trying to lead us to believe that a bunch of programmers

429
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:22,140
got in a room and they said, how do we screw over test?

430
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,180
No, that is not what they did.

431
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:30,020
They said, how do we build better software faster to compete?

432
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:37,380
They were looking at what is the better practices that get rid of waste that adds value.

433
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,280
So it isn't, in my view, like if we want to talk about testing, it isn't about making

434
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,720
testing great again.

435
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,360
If we want to have individual tester roles, then what we need to do is make those roles

436
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,640
valuable again.

437
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,640
Sure.

438
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,520
Okay, I'm done with that, Ryn.

439
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Go to the next one.

440
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,920
They frequently said that Agile discourages specialists.

441
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:05,820
A specialist tester, a specialist seems to be defined as anyone who does not specialize

442
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,900
in programming.

443
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,620
Agile definitely discourages specialists.

444
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:15,270
So when I think of specialists, I guess when I see specialists, I think of the generalizing

445
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,030
specialist or the specializing generalist, which is different than the specialist.

446
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,030
You're correct.

447
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:25,330
So I guess in that sense is correct, but I believe that.

448
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,290
For the next sentence, I think I know where you're going, and I think I agree with you.

449
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,290
So shoot it out.

450
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,050
A specialist seems to be defined as anyone who does not specialize in programming.

451
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,290
And that is not true.

452
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:41,510
An Agile team is made up of these T-shaped personas, to use the term most often used

453
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:47,850
in Agile, and fit together to make sure that the sum of everyone can do all the parts.

454
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:53,380
A team full of specialists is very difficult to do that.

455
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:58,740
Someone who is solely a testing specialist, you have to provide a lot of value.

456
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:03,420
And generally someone who's smart enough to be a really good testing specialist also has

457
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,380
the breadth they can fit in well with an Agile team.

458
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:14,360
The other thing I'm going to call out, the thing I find wrong with this, is I don't

459
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:21,560
think a traditional testing role is a specialist.

460
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,190
I think they're a generalist.

461
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:32,070
Now it's still correct in that, as we have said on the podcast repeatedly, we don't like

462
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,590
either of these.

463
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:39,780
We don't like pure generalists, and we don't like pure specialists.

464
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:47,420
And as sort of hand-wavy proof of my point of view, I'll point to your deck.

465
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,020
Any place where you have a role where the individual is responsible for doing the remainder

466
00:27:53,020 --> 00:28:00,250
of the stuff that no one else wants to do, that in my view is the definition of a generalist.

467
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,970
And that's traditionally what test is done.

468
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:07,770
Program management has defined what the project is, programmers write the code, and then the

469
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:10,170
remainder is done by the test team.

470
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,290
And that can be a lot of different things.

471
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,290
There's definitely specialization when we talk about automation.

472
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,290
Sure.

473
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,290
Right.

474
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:18,290
Dev.

475
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,290
And there's over-specialization.

476
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:25,620
Some people, I knew a lot of testers at Microsoft who wrote functional tests eight or nine hours

477
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,700
a day, every day for their whole career.

478
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
Is that testing?

479
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,540
Ish, but it's a very, it's very de-specialization.

480
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:37,220
Those people are either not here anymore or actually many of them turn into pretty good

481
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,660
programmers, developers.

482
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,260
One of the earliest works on Agile, the XP white book, claimed that no one likes to

483
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,460
do testing.

484
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,570
This set the tone ever since.

485
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:54,340
So I'm going to go back to the comment I made earlier about the, again, every sentence starts

486
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:58,900
with a truth and then ends with a huh.

487
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,900
So two sentences.

488
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,180
First sentence, yes, the XP white book said that, I can't dispute it.

489
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:10,220
But just because it's written down doesn't mean you have to follow it.

490
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,140
And then I disbelieve that it has set the tone ever since.

491
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,700
There have been plenty of things that have happened all over in the Agile and outside

492
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,700
of the Agile world that have set the tone for testing not being exciting.

493
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,940
That is not the fault of Agile.

494
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,420
We've talked about this on a, uh, I'm going to make you drink every time you say we've

495
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
talked about this.

496
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:36,770
I'm bringing in tequila shots for number 40.

497
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,590
Okay.

498
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:43,580
You have, okay.

499
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,170
What's that point again?

500
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,570
One of the earliest works on Agile, the XP white book claimed that no one likes to do

501
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,780
testing this set the tone ever since.

502
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
We've talked about it.

503
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,980
I've blogged about it.

504
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,590
The history of test.

505
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:06,180
One of the, if we want to talk about the history lesson, then let's talk about how

506
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,680
tests got developed.

507
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,360
It's actually in your, uh, in some degree it's in your presentation.

508
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,880
There's one aspect I think you're missing.

509
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
Probably not.

510
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,920
Maybe you usually write how did test get, how did the testing role get created at least

511
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,400
as it relates to Microsoft, right?

512
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,080
It's Hey, we can hire this cheap guy to do the crap we don't want to do.

513
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
Yeah.

514
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Right.

515
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:38,030
So pretty much it, it, um, this XP book did not invent this concept.

516
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:45,230
This concept has been around ever since the, the dev test codependency loop began to get

517
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,230
constructed.

518
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,230
Correct.

519
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:55,760
Um, now does, uh, so in, in one regard, you could say the agile community, if it is a community

520
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,760
of programmers said, you know what?

521
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,640
Yes, we created this role.

522
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,800
We made a mistake.

523
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,520
We going to take it back.

524
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,480
Okay.

525
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,320
Uh, that's one way of looking at it.

526
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
Okay.

527
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,320
The next one, um, I'm just going to read and move on because I wasn't there.

528
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,320
So I can't comment.

529
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,160
Uh, 2004 agile fusion conference collapsed in acrimony when Brian and Merrick claimed that

530
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:25,810
testing is only reluctantly about finding bugs and Bock and chem can or vigorously objected.

531
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,620
So I don't know if it collapsed again.

532
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,620
I wasn't there.

533
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,900
I don't know.

534
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,980
Testing is only reluctantly about finding bugs.

535
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,860
And I'm not sure I entirely disagree with that, but I'm not going to debate that.

536
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,340
I've often said that finding bugs is sort of the side effect of doing the testing

537
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,340
job.

538
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,250
I'm not sure if that's the same thing or not.

539
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,530
And then this event, this is like, then we kicked him out.

540
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:54,210
This event marked the exit of Brian Merrick from the context driven testing community.

541
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:59,270
Um, so it's, I think that was, uh, I'm not sure how to read that one.

542
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,470
I just kind of want to move on.

543
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,710
Do you want to add anything on that?

544
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,830
Yeah.

545
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,470
Uh, Brian's making a face complete non, you know, thanks for that information, but it's

546
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,990
a complete non sequitur.

547
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,990
Yeah.

548
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,990
So moving on.

549
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,990
Yeah.

550
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:19,310
So the most popular book on agile testing by Crispin, actually it's by Crispin and Gregory,

551
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:23,150
is not cited or thought of as a testing book among testing specialists.

552
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,860
It barely discusses testing.

553
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,460
Go ahead.

554
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,100
So you're friends with Lisa.

555
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:36,740
So I like to consider myself, um, one of my specialties to be testing.

556
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,740
I wrote a book on it.

557
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,740
Um, it's obsolete.

558
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:41,100
I've mentioned before, but, uh, I wrote a book about it.

559
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,860
I consider myself a specialist in testing and, um, I, I liked the books.

560
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,740
I especially liked the second one.

561
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,940
The second one has a lot more testing goodness in it.

562
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,380
The second edition.

563
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,660
Yeah.

564
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,580
No, it's called more agile testing.

565
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,860
Okay.

566
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,820
Um, a lot of guest writers and there it's a, they're really good books.

567
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,740
I consider them.

568
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,500
I, I recommend them often.

569
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,820
People will talk teens about having a no-chester role.

570
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,620
I said, go read this book.

571
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,300
See how it figures out.

572
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,180
It's there's lots of great information there.

573
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:12,730
I don't know why it depends on context because James may not consider me to

574
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,410
be a testing specialist among his peers that are testing specialists.

575
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:21,170
Maybe they don't know about the book or like it, but I think if I consider my

576
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,170
peers who are testing specialists, most of them do know about it and do appreciate it.

577
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:29,910
The, I don't mind.

578
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,670
I have to drink.

579
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:41,210
So I think this comes back to sort of, um, one of the discussions on CDT and

580
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:45,570
their, their point of view of how the world turns and, and it kind of, for

581
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:53,210
something that is context driven, uh, their view is some is incredibly static

582
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:57,950
around is this testing or is this not right?

583
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:05,690
The, and then the thing is, so I have read Lisa's book.

584
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,960
Unfortunately, I don't recall much from it.

585
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,620
Um, I read it years ago when I was going through my own self-training

586
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:23,780
on Agile and I wanted to get a better sense of how Agile worked in multiple

587
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:31,670
discipline, uh, scrum teams and Lisa's book, uh, does give great insights.

588
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:36,500
Her point, as I recall, and please correct me, cause I'm sure you

589
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,860
remember this better than I do.

590
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,980
Even though the book is titled Agile testing and, uh, I'll go ahead and

591
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:52,030
agree with that it barely discusses testing and I'll say that's not the

592
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,350
point of her book.

593
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,510
That's a good point.

594
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,510
There's plenty of books on testing.

595
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:05,630
The value add that Lisa brought into this is essentially, Hey, this Agile

596
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,950
thing is a better way to go.

597
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:18,630
And she's actually attempting to actually make testing great again, or to reduce

598
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:25,310
the losses given Agile is an unstoppable force at this point in time.

599
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,030
Right.

600
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:32,580
The, the world is not going to go back to these long delivery cycles.

601
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,500
The world is not going to go back to, to the, like the, the, if you want to

602
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,590
talk about who's making the greatest attack on testing, it's data science and

603
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,770
telemetry, right?

604
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,490
We, we now can measure the ROI of things.

605
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:53,850
We now can very rapidly get actual customer feedback.

606
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:57,930
We don't need artificial advocates in the front of it.

607
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,490
So yes, in many ways, yes.

608
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,370
And I want to actually play devil's advocate for James and his community

609
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,130
because again, I have nothing against James.

610
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,850
I think it's important to talk about these in the context of AB testing, these

611
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,890
bullet points on this slide and kind of what our testing world is.

612
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,930
But if you think of our testing world, the reason we're opposed to these

613
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:22,050
bullet points, because we live in a different testing world than James

614
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,010
Bock and his peers.

615
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:27,570
I think a lot of his projects, I have to assume, again, I'm not in, I, I, I

616
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,810
don't get to look over his shoulder.

617
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,770
Um, but I think he does work in a lot of, we get software at the end.

618
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,610
If you think of you're working with companies where it's an IT company,

619
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,370
you're getting software at the, you know, here's the software, make sure it works.

620
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,490
Doing that rapid software testing.

621
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,730
Like you have two days, let us know whether it's okay to go to customers.

622
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,450
Um, the things he teaches in his world is really good at finding

623
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,370
those key issues at that point.

624
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:52,930
We just don't live in a world where we're going to do that.

625
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:57,450
We live in a world of high daily quality versus let's, let's try and

626
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,850
make sure quality is really good at the end.

627
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,650
Here's, here's something we have talked about recently.

628
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:07,640
One of the things that, um, now I'm super conscientious about having

629
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,760
talked about that recently.

630
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,320
Thanks for that.

631
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,000
You're welcome.

632
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,040
Yeah.

633
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,200
I was trying to help my peers improve.

634
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:23,610
Um, you and I have been talking about these sorts of topics for at least six

635
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:30,890
years, and we have seen Microsoft go through a massive transformation.

636
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:36,010
Uh, one that I'm very pleased with and we're not completely done.

637
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:41,530
Um, and I know that you're happy with this trans, uh, transformation as well.

638
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:51,960
But we also know, we also know that most of our, the, the people who are one of

639
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:59,120
the three, but they, we know that for the most part, they don't live in that

640
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:05,320
world, but one of the things that, that I have observed is when I talk to these

641
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:13,820
guys or I tweet them or we, we chat on the slack channel, um, they're now what a

642
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,380
place where we were three years ago.

643
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,840
Where there's this sense that it is coming.

644
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,240
It is real and it's hit their company.

645
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,940
So there's this, um, right.

646
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,790
Uh, we've had multiple conversations, uh, with other, other folks.

647
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,110
Uh, I remember one time you, you pulled together an agile panel.

648
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:45,550
You asked me to speak on it, uh, for tests and, uh, when tests was still here

649
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:52,900
at Microsoft and there was a lot of anxiety around, this is a threat to my job.

650
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,660
Hidden behind, this is a threat to quality, but when you, when you just

651
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,940
scratched the surface and didn't take much to, to get there, it's really,

652
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,620
this is the threat to my wellbeing.

653
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:04,460
Yeah.

654
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,620
And I remember as early as it's funny, I remember this and recalled this at,

655
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:14,540
uh, in Waterloo, but as early as maybe 2005 or so, I was asked to come talk to

656
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:19,720
a team, uh, I did a lot of that at that time, uh, where they said, Hey,

657
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,920
we are, our team's doing agile and we're not sure what our test team should do.

658
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,010
It wasn't, I hadn't done, I knew about agile then did I didn't, Lisa's book

659
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:32,450
wasn't out and really having any ideas, but in talking to them, the, the

660
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,170
answer emerged quickly.

661
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:38,650
It's like one of the best things you can do is it helped define what done is

662
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,450
and make sure that, make sure that done happens.

663
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:44,210
So when we think of that testing role or that quality role within an agile team,

664
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,690
it's, uh, there's a lot of coaching and training of developers on what

665
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:49,770
testing needs to be done.

666
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:53,610
And, and thinking about, well, what actually gets, cause when I get that

667
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,370
highly daily quality, make sure things, things are done now versus having a

668
00:39:57,370 --> 00:39:59,390
coding milestone or stabilization milestone.

669
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,490
It's like, what needs to happen to be done?

670
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,770
And those things are really important.

671
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,850
Like a great value for testers to bring to the table of the slides, like this,

672
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,170
uh, of all these bullets, right?

673
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:16,410
Uh, under the, the hypothesis of the context is, Hey, everybody hate agile.

674
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,050
Cause it's coming to steal your jobs.

675
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:23,970
This bullet is the one I find the single most offensive one because

676
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:27,650
Lisa is not attacking testing.

677
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,570
What Lisa is doing is recognizing testing is a set of outcomes

678
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,370
and a set of activities.

679
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,290
The world is shifting.

680
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:41,930
We have a bunch of people who are trained and understand how to help make

681
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,370
better software in this product.

682
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:50,010
And she is teaching testers how to thrive in this new world.

683
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,090
Yeah, I agree.

684
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,650
I agree completely.

685
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,010
She is the defender of making testing great again, way

686
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:58,690
more than she is the attacker.

687
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,050
All right.

688
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,970
And to be clear, it's, it's they cause because Janet wrote the book too.

689
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:02,810
Right.

690
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,770
So I'm just, just to give credit, this slide calls out.

691
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:11,330
Let's do the last bullet point, which is again, um, a slight non sequitur,

692
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,690
but, uh, just goes into the whole theme of the slide.

693
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:21,650
TDD and BDD are focused on excuses to be done rather than a sincere inquiry

694
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,010
into the status of the product.

695
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,570
Yet both are regularly confused with testing.

696
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:33,390
I'm not confused, but I don't know anyone who actually has those anything other

697
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:38,750
than the definition of TDD and BDD, who thinks they're, um, a substitute

698
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,950
for a larger set of testing.

699
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,910
Um, TDD is a design technique for writing unit tests that make sure

700
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,150
you write simple testable code.

701
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:47,790
Yeah.

702
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:53,110
BDD, I love even more behavior driven development because it makes you think

703
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:56,430
about what the outcomes are of the software, the behaviors of the

704
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,190
software before you implement the code.

705
00:41:59,310 --> 00:41:59,710
Yes.

706
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:05,910
Um, and I've said before drink, uh, maybe not on here, but to me, the

707
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:09,910
biggest benefit of BDD, there's all kinds of, I'm a fan of gherkin and

708
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:15,510
BDD frameworks, but the benefit to me, the, the majority or the vast

709
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:19,750
majority of the benefit of behavior driven development comes from just

710
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,950
thinking, what are the behaviors that need to happen?

711
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,030
Cause it makes you, it's helps you scope your code again, write more

712
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,350
testable and sensible code.

713
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,390
If you want to automate that test, that's great.

714
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:30,910
That's fine.

715
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:35,390
That gives you a nice integration test, but really thinking about the

716
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,870
behaviors before you implement the code and then writing the code to

717
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:39,910
make those behaviors work.

718
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,630
That is the win.

719
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,150
The thing, and this is prevailing in this one, like this last bullet

720
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,070
point just hits it hard.

721
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:48,870
Okay.

722
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,940
Both TDD and BDD are regularly confused with testing.

723
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:58,660
That's the final point of this bullet point.

724
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:06,440
And I have to say first and foremost, that's wrong.

725
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,360
They are not regularly confused with testing.

726
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:22,130
What they are is regularly confused with a better way to reduce risk to the product.

727
00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:28,930
The thing I find that troublesome with this last sentence is he's holding true

728
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:34,730
that test testing is inherently valuable.

729
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:42,240
He's holding true that a sincere inquiry into the status of the product

730
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,500
is inherently valuable, which isn't to say that I'm disagreeing with it.

731
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,580
I'm saying it is not black and white.

732
00:43:53,590 --> 00:44:00,960
The, we know from, uh, uh, many of these conversations and

733
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,040
CDD sort of community, there's a point of view that testing's role is to

734
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,400
provide information to the business leaders.

735
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:08,880
Okay.

736
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:13,840
If testing's role is to provide information to the business leaders, TDD

737
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:21,320
and BDD is about prioritizing and identifying upfront what information is

738
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,960
valuable and incorporating that into the strategy of writing code such

739
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,880
that, you know, upfront and continuously.

740
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,240
On development teams that practice TDD and BDD, uh, what you get out of them

741
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:40,440
in my experience is code that works pretty well and beyond just the

742
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,760
functional level at the integration level.

743
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,160
And then instead of having the world where you give me code and I go, okay,

744
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,240
here are the bugs, blah, blah, blah, I'm not even half thinking about it.

745
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,880
You give me a product to test.

746
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:51,840
It's like, okay.

747
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,880
Now I take my serious, inquiring exploratory system thinking, testing

748
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,600
mind, and I have to work hard to find out where the detractors, the customer

749
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:05,160
value are and that, that is where we need that skilled specialist tester.

750
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,890
But without using some doubt, putting effort and care into making and

751
00:45:11,890 --> 00:45:16,090
programming the software correctly, the testing job, it actually does become

752
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:20,410
something that the moron out of junior high school can do because

753
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,970
it's easy to find bugs.

754
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:23,570
There's a quote.

755
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:27,330
I, and I'm, it's, it's a quote from this guy named Alan page.

756
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,090
So, but I forget and I'm going to misquote it, but I remember an event you

757
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:40,660
did, or maybe it was a tweet is that bugs should not, should be hard to find.

758
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,020
I say that all the time.

759
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:42,460
Right.

760
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:49,410
And even in the world where there's a mixed role, where you have tests and

761
00:45:49,410 --> 00:46:00,520
dev as distinct specializations within a team, TDD and BDD should be highlighted

762
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,040
for this, I can't tell you how many years I've been dealing with these

763
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,920
the testers in a room going, how do we move quality up the stream?

764
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,520
How do we help, uh, dev not create all of these bugs that keep throwing

765
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,680
crap across the thing?

766
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,880
I'm like, you can't have it both ways.

767
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,480
You can't simultaneously say, we want to move quality upstream.

768
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,000
We shouldn't be finding these low hanging fruit, stupid bugs.

769
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,800
And then also bash the key and extremely valuable techniques that does exactly

770
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,000
the things that we've been complaining about as a community for decades.

771
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,240
Yeah.

772
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,200
And if you also, if you say that developers are not capable or they're not

773
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,440
objective enough, test their own code BS, because those types of things,

774
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,360
those easy to find those low hanging fruit bugs, things they should be finding.

775
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,800
And they can use techniques like TDD and BDD to make sure those idiotic bugs,

776
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,400
those brain dev bugs, those stupid bugs that a junior high schooler, that my

777
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,600
kid in junior middle school sixth grade could find actually my daughter

778
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:06,400
in fifth grade could find are found before they get to the specialist

779
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,080
testers who can then go, ho, you know, when's the last time you had a product?

780
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,480
You had to look at and go, it's hard for me to find bugs.

781
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,200
That's the kind of stuff we need our skilled testers to do.

782
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,160
We don't need, if you want to think of testers as this lower skilled, you

783
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,320
know, this, what was the bullet above about setting the tone for no one

784
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,720
likes to do testing, no one likes to do boring, repetitive testing.

785
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,440
If you give me a testing activity that is hard and I have to mentally strain

786
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,320
myself and I feel exhausted at the end, but happy with my work, that's

787
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,560
the kind of testing I want to do.

788
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,960
That's kind of testing, testing specialists should do.

789
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,560
That's, that's reinventing or make testing great again.

790
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,840
It's not about this other BS.

791
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,910
It's not about setting up boundaries and looking for conflicts between

792
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,310
communities or processes.

793
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,830
It's about making the job challenging and rewarding.

794
00:47:56,550 --> 00:48:03,270
Now, I think of this and I think of the other James Whitaker six years ago,

795
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,230
huge controversy test is dead.

796
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:07,380
Right.

797
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,860
And I look at this and I'm like, was it even six years ago?

798
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,580
It was longer than that.

799
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:11,860
Wasn't it?

800
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,180
No longer.

801
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,540
10 years ago.

802
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,180
And, and I look at this and he's going, uh, test is dead.

803
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:20,560
Right.

804
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,760
In, in, in, how do we go after agile?

805
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,220
Like dude, you don't like this stuff.

806
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,460
Again, it goes back to what does it mean for me?

807
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,340
How does it impact me?

808
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,340
It's not an attack.

809
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,700
And, uh, I know, but the reason why I spawned this up and I should have

810
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,340
actually tied the, or connected to before I gone into it, right.

811
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:47,330
You, if you want to have this world where you have, um, you said Dev and

812
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:51,850
tests and Dev can't test their code because they're, they're too subjective.

813
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:52,690
Right.

814
00:48:53,250 --> 00:49:01,180
The thing is, as we've said over and over again, that world is increasingly

815
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,860
shrinking and it is not the dominant part of the world today.

816
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:12,460
You can't, the single most precious asset in software today is calendar time.

817
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:19,090
You can't afford that world where you assume Dev is moronic.

818
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,860
And that is the business reality.

819
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:28,950
And it is ever increasingly becoming true in a world near you.

820
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:30,510
All right.

821
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:31,470
One last thing to say.

822
00:49:32,550 --> 00:49:32,910
I'm done.

823
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:33,710
Good.

824
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:34,710
Thank you for listening.

825
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:35,550
Thanks.

826
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:36,270
I'm Alan.

827
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:36,830
I'm brain.

828
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:37,710
We'll see you next time.

829
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:38,150
Bye bye.
