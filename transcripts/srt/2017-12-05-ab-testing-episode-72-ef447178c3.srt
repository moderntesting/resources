1
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,140
Good morning. Hello. For whatever time you're listening, I guess good morning is presumption something.

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:27,140
You should listen in the morning. Okay, I'm Alan. I'm Brent. And we're here for episode 70...72! 72.

3
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:35,200
Of A-B testing and probably now because we have no strict agenda, I want to pre-plug 73,

4
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,200
which will be our annual Reflections and Predictions episode.

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Yep. I have to go back and look, find last year's episode and write down what our predictions were.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,200
Well, I think the predictions got cut off because that recording went to shit.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,330
Oh. If I remember right. So then I have to go back and make up what our predictions were.

8
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,330
Yeah, exactly. I think I predicted there would be exactly 73 shows.

9
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:06,550
It's one of the shows that actually requires prep from both of us. It requires some pre-thinking.

10
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:11,550
So it's kind of fun. So that episode will be way better than this one. I'm pretty sure.

11
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,550
If you downloaded both, I would just skip this one probably.

12
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,710
Yeah. I mean, in general, it's a good idea.

13
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,710
One of my employees came up to me just two days ago and said,

14
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:32,710
Hey, I listened to your podcast. I said, Oh, which episode? One. I said, Oh, don't start with one. That one's awful.

15
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,710
Well, I'm sure it gets better.

16
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,940
Exactly. There's only a couple I think is that are worse than one.

17
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,940
And I forget we have always one for sure.

18
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:59,160
There was one. I can't remember one time in the Slack group, one of the three dot Slack dot com.

19
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,160
You can DM me on Twitter and I'll add you. One time in that channel, we had a discussion of like,

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,260
what's the best episode to start on? I think it was somewhere in the thirties, forties.

21
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,350
You don't have to look at it. It's okay. You can go all the way back. It's cool.

22
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:22,800
I want to. I want to. I want to. I thought it was like in the sixties, but yeah, it was there was a there was a dispute.

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,800
It could have been 60. Yeah. Now, I mean, it depends on the context. Like we've been we've been doing this, what, four years now.

24
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,800
No coming up on our four year anniversary. Yeah. In April. I'll bring flowers.

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,800
The industry has changed. And we've changed. Why the bit? It would be in a perfect world where I retired tomorrow.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,800
Maybe I'd go back from the day job. I still keep podcasting till I till I die on the air.

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:57,800
But I would like to sort of plot our progression. You'd have to die after you finish editing. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Plotting our progression. Like how have our views changed? Like what is what has been the the made a story of A B testing over the last three point seven two years.

29
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:16,800
That's a good topic for next episode. That requires way more. The episodes have horrible titles, which Brandon's promised to fix someday.

30
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,020
But there are short descriptions there. Maybe I'll maybe I'll do that. Maybe I'll try to see if I come up in the mid story of the story of A B testing.

31
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:36,340
I think we'll find that they haven't changed much. We firmed it up things. We've created language like modern testers.

32
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:44,050
I think I think we used to talk much more about testing and we talked much more about quality now. That's my my hunch.

33
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:47,050
My prediction for the prediction show. What I'll come up with.

34
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:55,050
If you replay when we started this, the majority of our listeners and I think it's no longer true. The majority of our listeners were internal to Microsoft.

35
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:04,050
Yeah, that is no longer true. And we were talking about to at least half of the members of the A B podcasting testing crew no longer work at Microsoft.

36
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:23,540
It's true. When we started this, we were talking about this as I recall, we're talking about the similar things, but the context was different because then Microsoft was going to undergoing the transformation and that we are now seeing the rest of the world undergoing.

37
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,310
That's how I kind of view it.

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,920
I don't view it that way because there was a there were a lot of companies going under that transformation and then Microsoft then did it mostly wrong.

39
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:47,370
And we talked about that a lot and they've sort of bounced back. A lot of the big changes around it's not HR, but around organization or yeah, I'll call it organization.

40
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:56,780
How to organize a team have been very Microsoft. My experience was very much a pendulum shifting like it was all in on one of the other.

41
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:08,450
It was OK, every testers in Estet and then 10 years later, OK, every tester is a developer without exploring the path of the pendulum.

42
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:18,580
How you get from one extreme to the other. I would say when we first started, I think a lot more of our discussions were around agile.

43
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:49,780
We should we still talk about that a great deal. The other aspect is back then we were expressing an element of fearlessness around the change, but now it's a lot more around validation because back then we were like, no, we don't know where we're going, but we do know everything will be fine because we see the system.

44
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:58,850
We see the patterns and now we can look back and go. Yeah, we were right. So let's let's talk even more about that next time.

45
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,850
You have questions about that ping us on Twitter or if you're in the Slack channel, ping us there and we can dive deeper in there.

46
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:10,850
But let's spend a little bit of time on that next time. Yeah, so it is December getting towards the end of the year.

47
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:19,710
I am off to Moscow on Tuesday speaking at the Heisenberg conference. Looking forward to it.

48
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:29,940
I'm confident it will be a good conference because they are very what's the word I should use particular. They follow up a lot.

49
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:39,100
They asked for I gave him my slides, which I'm giving. I mentioned last time giving two talks, a track talk and the closing keynote.

50
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,450
And I will definitely adapt the closing keynote based on what I see during the week.

51
00:06:43,450 --> 00:07:01,510
But for giving a talk on the abuse and misuse of test automation, which will be largely interactive because when I if I do a track talk and I actually rarely do track talks and I will get up in my pedestal and I'm too I'm just too freaking old to do track talks most of the time.

52
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:07,510
But since I'm already there for the keynote and they're paying my way there and they're taking me on a tour of Moscow, I figure I owe them a little payback.

53
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:17,510
I'm very much I would feel bad if I said no, although they did ask me to do a tutorial as well. I said no to that because I do limit out on things.

54
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:25,510
Anyway, when I give a track talk, I make sure it's largely interactive, one for two main reasons.

55
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:33,510
One is I think there is more learning that happens if you can get people involved and get them to interact. So we will design some tests.

56
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:38,510
We will write some test automation, kind of predicting what they will write. And now I've written it already.

57
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,510
But we'll use the numbers app.

58
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,510
I was going to ask, are you going to give everyone their own copy of numbers?

59
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,510
Numbers is on my slide deck and I'll put it up in the show notes or on my blog.

60
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:55,510
But it is up on GitHub. You can just go to github.com, angryweasel. It's all there. You can look at it.

61
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,510
But the main reason, maybe the second reason, maybe not the main reason, main reason is learning.

62
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:05,510
The second reason is because I just don't want to talk for an hour if I don't have to.

63
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:14,900
The last track talk I gave was maybe five years ago at a star. And James Whitaker came to my talk just sitting in the back, you know, watch.

64
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,900
I don't know why he was there. And he comes up to me afterwards and he goes, I can't do the James Whitaker draw.

65
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,150
He goes, dude, you had the audience give the whole talk.

66
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:31,220
And I said, yeah, that's my jam.

67
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,220
So I think conferences are a great place to learn from each other.

68
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,220
So if I can facilitate that versus me reading off some bullet points, then that's much better.

69
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:48,340
So what they freaked out about is, hey, you only have like 14 slides for this hour long talk.

70
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:53,570
I said, yeah, yeah, that's good. Yeah, it might be too many.

71
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,570
So the difference is, and it's just a difference in approach, is for a track talk, I'm planning on interacting.

72
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,570
We're going to have a few slides. We're going to talk a lot.

73
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:10,570
And in fact, I will do a tutorial, a workshop on web testing tools at star east in May.

74
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:20,210
May. And I will probably have 20 slides for a four hour workshop because it's all it's interactive and demonstrations.

75
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,210
And we're going to do stuff together with hands on when I do a keynote.

76
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,530
My keynote is like 50 slides. Really?

77
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,530
I use a lot of slides. Some you only see for about five seconds.

78
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,530
Some I'll park on and talk about for two or three minutes.

79
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,530
But I use a lot of slides for a keynote.

80
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,530
I don't think I've ever seen a slide deck from you that was more than 20 slides.

81
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,530
Yeah. I have my keynotes are usually pretty big. In fact, I'm sure you have.

82
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,530
You didn't realize they were that big because you just flipped by some because they were just some picture.

83
00:09:52,530 --> 00:10:01,420
Yeah. No, I'm thinking about the one where you had the the Avengers and the the janitors with the elephants.

84
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:07,520
Maybe that was that that was probably at least 30. OK. Anyway, so that's coming up.

85
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,520
That's the story there. I calmed them down. I said, look, interactive, blah, blah, blah.

86
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,520
They said, OK. And they will be there in the audience watching me go.

87
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,520
You make sure you fill this time. We will have a good time.

88
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:26,810
I did a lot more work on the test for numbers, the automated test.

89
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:34,810
And it is I think it's a good example of how to use automation or one way to use automation.

90
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:45,000
There are 100 ways to use it. I am, as I've mentioned many times before, not a fan of UI automation and becoming less and less of a fan.

91
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:53,220
As I feel like there's this this is balance. The world is falling deeper in love with UI automation.

92
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:03,220
That statement is based entirely on tweets and blog posts and the massive number of UI test automation tools.

93
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:09,220
I still I still see being created. So as the world falls more in love with it, I hate it even more.

94
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Why do you think that is? Because the test tools much better. No, the problems that we face back in the day.

95
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:25,220
I think the problem is, is this we're going back to our transition into modern testing and agile testing.

96
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,220
There's a world of crummy testers out there who think their way out is to.

97
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,220
And this is the way they put it. I'm a manual tester and I want to get into automation.

98
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:43,830
And they go, here's a tool for you. There are hundreds of thousands of those people who, as you know,

99
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,830
the industry will take a long time to get where we're going and to reflect the testing pyramid.

100
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:54,830
And I read Mike Cohen's original paper from 10 years ago, eight years ago on the testing pyramid.

101
00:11:54,830 --> 00:12:00,630
And when he points to the top, he says you should write as few of these as possible.

102
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:09,300
Yet people invest all their time. It drives me nuts. It I don't know why it is.

103
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:16,720
But it appears that it's just what we're proposing is just blatantly counterintuitive.

104
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,720
No, I think it is. But then I see people I respect agreeing. Maybe not wholeheartedly, but agreeing.

105
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:36,170
When Richard Bradshaw, who gives workshops on test automation, I went on a tweet storm about this and he fully agrees.

106
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,170
It's like, oh, but it turns out that it is that test automation term, which can often,

107
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:47,170
which means to a lot of people writing code to automatically manipulate the UI of the application.

108
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:54,390
And if you in his world, he calls it automation and test, I think, or we need a little better terms

109
00:12:54,390 --> 00:13:00,620
because I think there is a lot of code we can write to make our testing easier.

110
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,620
And if you call that automation, it often gets lumped in with that UI automation and gets lost.

111
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,620
I almost think we need a new term for that. Canar calls it tool assisted testing.

112
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:18,190
I just call it testing. It's a slippery road. Anyway, he agrees.

113
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:26,190
There are a lot of people who I think the people I see who are experienced in testing, they get it.

114
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:32,190
It's the up and comers. And this is a gross generalization, but the up and comers who are,

115
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:39,190
quote, getting into automation are the ones who want to dive into manipulating the UI

116
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:45,190
and living with the pain themselves and driving their teams to live in that pain.

117
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,190
I just, I just, there's so much better use of your time as a tester.

118
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:56,190
I could see some influencing or influencers on this topic, right?

119
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:03,540
The we've talked about this before. There's reason to believe that the rest of the world,

120
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:08,540
at least in my view, there's reason to believe that the rest of the world is

121
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:19,860
following down the path of a unified engineering model or the reduction of a separate test team.

122
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:30,860
We still see a lot of folks on in the Twitterverse talking about manual testing still being a dominant thing.

123
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:38,860
One hypothesis is that these guys are, they're constantly under threat by, by, by the

124
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:46,860
phrasing of not technical enough. And so in a world where you're accused of not being technical enough

125
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,860
and you're moving towards a unified engineering model, then you,

126
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:57,060
I think you start looking around trying to find how do I make myself valuable?

127
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:03,440
And you go, oh, automation. And I've been doing UI testing.

128
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,700
So the next obvious step for me is to automate my job, which I mean, you and I have talked about this.

129
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,700
We agree with that approach.

130
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,700
And it is in fact, this path you're going down is in fact, what my keynote is about at,

131
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:29,820
Oh, is it? Heisenberg. Gotcha. Yeah. And so I actually, and it's because,

132
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:33,820
and that's probably it is because there's a high demand for this space.

133
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:41,820
People are willing to sell it, even though those of us who are, have experienced in this space,

134
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:48,820
which is probably not the universe of manual testers, don't realize that these problems are

135
00:15:48,820 --> 00:16:00,330
significantly harder than the majority of our, of our testing problems, or at least automation ones.

136
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:07,840
I'm being distracted by Alan monkeying with. So I had to pause because windows made by,

137
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,840
I got paid by me. Screw you. And I'm going to keep this in the podcast.

138
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:21,190
But of all the teams I worked in at Microsoft over 22 years, by far the most dysfunctional and Steve Rosen exception.

139
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:30,860
He knows what he's doing. But what a piece of junk. I'm just so frustrated. Anyway, God, it just pop up.

140
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,860
It's galore. I'm trying to record a podcast. That's awesome. Really happy with that. Really, really happy.

141
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:45,860
So where were we? I just saw an article written this week talking about testers staying irrelevant in the new world.

142
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,860
But over, you know, I was generalizing earlier, but over gross generalizations things,

143
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:59,340
the article saying things like some teams think they can improve testing by firing all the testers and hiring just developers.

144
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,340
I guess if you squint and back way up, you can look at it that way.

145
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,340
But and I'm sure some pointy haired boss somewhere will say, oh, that makes sense to me. That's what I'm doing.

146
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:18,340
But that's just kind of a stupid way to look at it. I know I could. And I'm not I'm not getting.

147
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:25,600
But it is not. I mean, it's just you have to have the talent to be able to do that. Sure.

148
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,600
And I'm in and I have seen that same approach implemented by idiots.

149
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:42,050
And I have said this before and I'm and I'm sure I'll say it again, but I have told my boss and his boss that if I do my job right, I work myself out of a job.

150
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:53,050
And I'm working. I am slowly embedding my team in development teams, not just as a member of my team, working for them as a member of their team working for them.

151
00:17:53,050 --> 00:18:01,140
So I am shrinking the size of my org slowly but surely while growing the size of my community.

152
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:10,810
And that's and eventually I will just run a community. And then eventually that community will become self-sustaining.

153
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:17,810
It will. That that's my goal. That's how I want to run. That's how I want my modern testing org to work.

154
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:31,810
So eventually, eventually, I would expect all of my team to work for and be partnered with the feature teams they work with while I still run that community, help them discover ways to learn new things,

155
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:43,810
facilitate learning across that community. But as they get better at that, as I get better at working with not only them, but with the developers and product managers they work with, that community becomes self-sustaining.

156
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:48,060
And at that point, someone has to give me a new job.

157
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:57,640
What I see you doing is you're slowly but surely within your org. This is my view.

158
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:05,640
Slowly but surely killing the concept of modern tester because what I see you doing is boiling the frog towards an actual unified engineering organization.

159
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Yeah, but a good one. Yes. A very good one.

160
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:22,640
So you're maintaining, unlike what I've seen several dysfunctional teams in Microsoft, you're maintaining control of the test org while you push towards this unified engineering model.

161
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:31,640
And a big difference to what I see among a lot of people in the web verse, I'll even go beyond Twitter, is that I'm not afraid of my job going away.

162
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,150
No.

163
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,150
In fact, I embrace it and it's a goal.

164
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:51,730
One of the things that I have learned, like this has been my secret sauce in my entire career, is the more I automate my job away, the more valuable I become to the business.

165
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,730
And the point is, one way to look at this is I'm growing and learning too.

166
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:05,730
So at the time that my job becomes irrelevant and I'm no longer needed, I want it to go away because I know there'll be something different or better.

167
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:11,730
You'll be grateful because you're like, crap, all that old world crap is slowing me down. Now I can go all in on this new thing.

168
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,730
Yeah, and it's not even just a shift like that's done. Here's a new thing.

169
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:23,730
As the community becomes self-sustaining, I likely already have my eyes on the new thing I want to do.

170
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,730
And so that's what having that sort of transition excites me.

171
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,050
So I just don't understand and it freaks me out and it doesn't freak me out.

172
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:43,050
I'm annoyed a little how much people dig in their heels and say, no, I'm not going to change.

173
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:47,050
I could just do what I've been doing forever and it'll be fine.

174
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,880
Sure.

175
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,880
I guess it's not the life for me.

176
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,880
And then one other thing before we actually begin the show is ...

177
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,880
There is a saying, right? Knowledge is power, but ignorance is bliss. So pick which one you want.

178
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:11,520
Absolutely. Absolutely. 40 years ago-ish, I used to go down to Tower Records.

179
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,520
I remember Tower.

180
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Tower Records. There was one in Limwood. I sometimes go to the one in the U-District.

181
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Silver Platters still exists.

182
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:27,520
It does. But Tower was awesome because thumbing through albums with album art and the days before the internet when you couldn't look up and see when a band had a new album out,

183
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,520
I would go for the bands I liked. Every week I'd go and I'd check out and see if they had a new album coming out.

184
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,520
They had a magazine there. Maybe it's called Tower Records. Probably had a name. I forget what it was called.

185
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,520
But in the back they had Desert Island Discs.

186
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,520
As far as I know, this is the first publication to talk about Desert Island Discs.

187
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,520
You could only take 10 records. I think it was 10 for them.

188
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,520
To a Desert Island, what would they be? And they were always albums.

189
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Almost every single one had Dark Side of the Moon on it.

190
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:09,060
So the episode of Tester's Island Discs, the 2017 and going on version, Episode 5 came out last night.

191
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Did it?

192
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:18,290
Which includes me and my eclectic but interesting selection of music and some stories.

193
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:24,290
And I had a great time. I'm grateful for Neil having me on the show. But you can check that out too.

194
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:30,290
I'm excited to have that out just in time for the end of the year flurry of podcasts and conference speaking.

195
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,480
So there's a plug there.

196
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,480
Plug away.

197
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,180
Okay. Are we done with the intro?

198
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,180
Yes.

199
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:46,180
Okay. We're going to kick it right off with Marcus had a question for the...

200
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,520
Mailbag!

201
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,520
Yes, Marcus.

202
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,520
We might have to get a new mailbag sound in 2018. That one was funny a long time ago, but I don't know.

203
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Listeners, tell us what you think.

204
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
So I'll read one from Marcus.

205
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Okay.

206
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,520
He had read an article from Bob Martin, Robert Martin, on cleancoder.com on code is not the answer.

207
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:18,650
And he asks, any chance we can have your opinions again crafting great about crafting great code on a future podcast?

208
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:29,700
What can the modern tester do to help if at all, and how does this tie into how much separate teams of testers test the product?

209
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
I don't know, Brent. Do you and I have opinions?

210
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,700
We do.

211
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,990
I do. Do you want to start? I mean, start.

212
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,990
I can start.

213
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:42,990
Okay. And if I remember, I'll put the link in the notes to the article.

214
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,990
To the article that inspired it.

215
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,280
So just looking at the...

216
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:57,920
I read the article. I'm trying to recall the salient points.

217
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,050
If I had prepped it, I'd have written it down.

218
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:02,050
We don't prep here on A-B testing?

219
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,050
No.

220
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:10,080
But what I recall, the general theme, the name of the blog is tools are not the answer.

221
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Although the link to it is code is not the answer, which is interesting.

222
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
It seems like he renamed it afterwards.

223
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Correct. He did.

224
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Right.

225
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:35,160
And he said, hey, people doing all of this stuff, and it's resulting in the square root of nothing improvement.

226
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
But it's people claiming it.

227
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,290
And I will first say, yeah, that's true. Tools are not solely the answer.

228
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:47,450
There is always, I'll call it the process trinity.

229
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:57,410
If you, every time you want to influence a change, you need to simultaneously attack three things.

230
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,410
The people, the process, and the technology.

231
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:06,410
If you just create a new tool, and the people don't use it,

232
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:14,860
because you haven't changed the process to incentivize this, you're going to get nothing.

233
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:22,270
So you can't focus on one of the pivots of that trinity.

234
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:29,660
What Marcus asks is around, okay, recrafting great code.

235
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,660
And then on separate teams of testers and the modern testers.

236
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:43,880
So the first thing I'll say, in my humble opinion, modern tester does not focus on code correctness.

237
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,360
I think the modern tester actually plays a very large role in crafting great code.

238
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:58,780
And one in addressing that trinity, and two in identifying other ways in which the code may improve.

239
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,780
And let me give you a crap ton of examples.

240
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,780
Okay.

241
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,780
One, I'm going to refer to your trinity, which is absolutely true.

242
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:14,670
One of the things I've challenged every person on my team to do, if you're listening and haven't done it yet, it will come.

243
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:22,280
One of the things, I don't like individual metrics, but I realized I don't like individual metrics that are shared.

244
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,280
So in other words, I want to give, I ask you to measure something, but don't tell me how you measure.

245
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,280
Don't tell anybody else.

246
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Just so you can measure your own progress.

247
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,280
If you game that, then whatever.

248
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,280
And the example I use for that is Brett makes faces here.

249
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,280
Oh, I need the eye roll sound effect.

250
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,280
Where's the eye roll sound effect?

251
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,280
That wasn't an eye roll.

252
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,280
That was a...

253
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,280
What the hell?

254
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
And I will explain this better.

255
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
So I'll pop out of the tangent.

256
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,280
That's a brief, this is going to be a circular tangent.

257
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,280
This is going to be hard to get out of.

258
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
I will challenge you.

259
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
I'll just talk to you, Brent, as if you're on my team.

260
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,280
Okay.

261
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:03,440
I expect you to make the developers on your team better testers.

262
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Okay.

263
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,440
And I'm going to leave it up to you to how to measure that.

264
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:13,760
And some examples may be code coverage, number of tests to say right.

265
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,760
It can be a bunch of stupid things like that, some combination.

266
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
You figure it out.

267
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Don't share it with them.

268
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Don't share it with me unless you think it's really interesting.

269
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
But have some measurement.

270
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,760
If your goal is to, you have a goal to make the developers better testers,

271
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,760
you should have an idea of what makes sense for you in your context in your team.

272
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,760
And I don't care about the measurement.

273
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,760
That's what I mean about that individual measurement.

274
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
I don't care what the number is.

275
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
I care about the output at the end.

276
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
So I want you to measure it so you can measure your own progress

277
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
and that's something to drive towards.

278
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,790
But I don't care about the number going on with that.

279
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,790
That's what I mean by the individual metric that I don't want to know.

280
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:56,240
I want you to make the developers on your team better testers.

281
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Okay.

282
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
Don't just write, going back to the Trinity,

283
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I almost got the stack popped here.

284
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,300
Don't just write a testing tool.

285
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,820
What I've found is, or an automation framework,

286
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,820
if it's not brain dead easy to use and part of the system

287
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,450
and or part of the system, people probably won't use it.

288
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:22,450
For example, if I, as Brent Stairs said, it's fun.

289
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,450
The funny face was for his phone, not for me.

290
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,450
So if I write a framework and I tell you it's great

291
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,450
but it's hard to use and I can't figure it out

292
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:34,450
and as false positives, you're not going to use it.

293
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:36,450
It doesn't matter.

294
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,450
If I make it so brain dead simple for you to use

295
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,450
that you can't use it, they can't not use it,

296
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,580
you're going to use it.

297
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,580
So there's an example there.

298
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,580
I have spent a big chunk of my career,

299
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,580
talking about code craftsmanship,

300
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:53,580
implementing static analysis tools in code.

301
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,700
Way back before we even had some of the more fancy

302
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,700
static analysis tools at Microsoft,

303
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,700
I would find a bug like,

304
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,700
here's a for loop with the semicolon that's going,

305
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
this is C code.

306
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,700
Those of you that are not old like me, a loop.

307
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Java has semicolons.

308
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Basically someone created a loop where the actual,

309
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,700
what they intended to be the inside of the loop

310
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,700
would never execute.

311
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:21,410
So I just wrote some Perl regx stuff

312
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,410
to grip through a whole bunch of code

313
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,410
and see if that existed elsewhere.

314
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,410
This was back in 1996.

315
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:28,410
So you scanned for a while one loops?

316
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,410
No, actually excluded those.

317
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,410
Oh, okay.

318
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,410
Because those can be valid.

319
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,700
I found.

320
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Anyway, baby static analysis.

321
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Found a bunch of bugs, file bugs, stuff got fixed.

322
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Then static analysis tools came to automate

323
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,700
sure those were implemented,

324
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,700
not just as something that was run outside

325
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
of the like, oh, run this when you have a chance

326
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
and fix the errors.

327
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,700
Run it as part of the build process,

328
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,700
part of the check in process to find things.

329
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,700
I learned coding in a backward way.

330
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,700
I, before I was really very good at coding,

331
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,700
I read books like writing solid code

332
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,700
and debugging the development process.

333
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,700
So I, not being as good of a coder as my peers,

334
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,700
as far as knowing all the language idioms

335
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,700
and things like that, I proved my value

336
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
by knowing a lot about how to craft good code

337
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:27,620
and how, what well constructed code looked like.

338
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
So I came at it from that angle

339
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,660
and then pushed and spread that through static analysis,

340
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,660
through code review, through making sure

341
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,660
people could write tests, making sure people

342
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,660
thought through the system of what they're trying

343
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,660
to implement based on that learning.

344
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,660
And that helped the teams I work with craft better code.

345
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,660
At the end of the article, he talks about,

346
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,660
the paraphrase here, he's in a room of developers

347
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,660
and he asks them how many had written unit tests

348
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,750
and nobody puts their hand up.

349
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,750
He said like two out of 20 or something.

350
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,750
Okay, alright.

351
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,750
Artistic license.

352
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,750
Yep.

353
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,750
Which is frightening to you and I,

354
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,750
but when you look at the industry overall,

355
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,750
it depends who he's talking to.

356
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:08,750
It's not unexpected.

357
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,750
Not unexpected.

358
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,750
One of the things I think,

359
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,750
if my role as a modern tester, maybe this is,

360
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,880
as Brent and I further define,

361
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,880
what are the principles and actions of the modern tester,

362
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,980
to me, one of the things they do is they make

363
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,980
the people around them better testers.

364
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
I'm not even going to say developers.

365
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
They make the people around them better testers.

366
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,980
And that includes from unit tests

367
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,980
all the way up to exploratory testing.

368
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,040
So I think if I'm the modern tester on that team,

369
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
where nobody's writing unit tests,

370
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
some of the low hanging fruit I go after right away

371
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,040
is not just telling them to write unit tests

372
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,040
or setting a mandate that they must write unit tests,

373
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:57,040
but helping them discover why unit tests are important

374
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,040
so they want to write unit tests.

375
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,040
So there's a lot of discussion in the test community

376
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:05,360
around testers being specialists.

377
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,360
And what you just talked about reminded me

378
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,360
of one of the things that I do actually believe in.

379
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,360
And I don't think I've talked about it before.

380
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,870
And that is, if you do have a specialist on the team,

381
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:26,870
their role is to share the knowledge,

382
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,870
particularly if it's something that's general,

383
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,870
such as testing.

384
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,130
The one of the things...

385
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,130
Can you be a specialist in a generality?

386
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,130
No.

387
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,130
Okay, I'll hold on.

388
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,130
Like, you're talking about, hey, make better testers.

389
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,130
And I realize that I have executed similar themes,

390
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,770
but I do it a different way.

391
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:53,770
I operate under the assumption that a tester,

392
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,770
let's say a test specialist in this team, okay?

393
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,900
First thing I will say,

394
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,900
the test specialists on this team

395
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,900
will not do your testing for you, okay?

396
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,900
I'm not going to spin up the dysfunction loop.

397
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
True, right?

398
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
So that's one of the problems I have

399
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
with how Marcus has phrased his question,

400
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,900
is how do we do this modern testing with several teams?

401
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:24,900
And when I saw that unit testing statement at the very end,

402
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:28,900
I'm like, yeah, I'm willing to bet you anything

403
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,060
that those developers,

404
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:38,560
that a strong or a large number of those developers

405
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,560
are trained that tests owns testing.

406
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Sure. There's that...

407
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,560
Yeah.

408
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
And this is one thing we have talked about before.

409
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,560
It's that codependent feedback loop of...

410
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
I imagine the tester going,

411
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
oh, you haven't tested your code at all?

412
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
Oh, I'll go test it for you.

413
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Yeah, thank you.

414
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Here are some bugs.

415
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Thank you. I feel validated.

416
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Like, it's like, no.

417
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
You're definitely hit it on the...

418
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,560
You hit the button when you said that

419
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:07,560
the role there is to help them test,

420
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,560
not to do the testing for them.

421
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Correct.

422
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
And that is the...

423
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Okay, good.

424
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,560
So we're on the same page.

425
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Of course we are.

426
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
So far.

427
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,560
Important to bring that up.

428
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,560
But wait, I got a couple more things I want to say there.

429
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
No problem.

430
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,690
The next thing is...

431
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,140
You say I want to make it better...

432
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:31,140
I want you to make your devs better testers, right?

433
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,420
I would actually...

434
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:39,840
If I did report to you, then I would say, okay, great.

435
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,100
This is how I'm going to roll it out in my team.

436
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,770
And what...

437
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,770
The way I would approach it is I would look at

438
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,770
what are the goals for test.

439
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,960
And then I'm going to go and analyze how dev does their job.

440
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,540
And either by changing the technology, people, or the process,

441
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,540
make it hard...

442
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm going to add friction to the easy paths

443
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,860
and I'm going to make it hard for dev to fail.

444
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,020
That's where I'm going to start with first.

445
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,020
So what you were talking about.

446
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,020
The...

447
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,020
All right, static analysis is super valuable.

448
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,020
No developer is going to...

449
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Devs are going to focus on building their own features.

450
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,020
Let's get a static analysis tool

451
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,020
so that when they do a check-in or when they do a private build,

452
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:39,020
they get a bunch of free feedback instantly.

453
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
Right?

454
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,020
So those type of assets.

455
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,020
The other thing I'm going to put into play

456
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,370
is I'm going to remove every stabilization period

457
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:53,370
and every friction point I can from check-in to prod.

458
00:35:53,370 --> 00:36:01,200
Because the biggest part of the problem here is the people side.

459
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:09,680
Devs have been used to not being accountable for bugs in their own code

460
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
and it's time to get rid of that.

461
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,940
So look, dev, when you think it's ready, check in.

462
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,940
Knock yourself out.

463
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,420
I'm going to add no prevention model

464
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,420
between their check-in to going to prod.

465
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:30,450
But, and if you're afraid of the risk there, cool.

466
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,450
Let's talk and figure out what you can do to solidify that.

467
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:40,060
One, our devs, to varying degrees, are actually pretty good at...

468
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:43,060
They're moderately good at testing also.

469
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
They don't have...

470
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,060
They all write unit tests.

471
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,060
So we're pretty far down that road.

472
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,060
But one thing you...

473
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,090
You started with an assumption that

474
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:58,410
for maybe a more junior modern tester is worth pointing out

475
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,500
is before you use...

476
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:08,500
One prerequisite to going down this path is, what's your life like?

477
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
And again, nobody's afraid of like,

478
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
well, if they're doing all the testing, what am I going to do?

479
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
But I imagine...

480
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
So what happens?

481
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Imagine your developers are really good testers.

482
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
Then what's your role like?

483
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
So far, nobody is freaked out and thought,

484
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
well, I don't have anything to do.

485
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Because there's all kinds of stuff to do.

486
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,300
Friends making a funny face.

487
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,300
I don't understand the connection between what I just said

488
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,300
and what you're doing.

489
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,300
It is, but I'm starting with why.

490
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,300
Okay.

491
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,300
To quote Simon Sinek, I think this works really well here.

492
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,300
Why?

493
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Is talk about why you want the developers to be better testers

494
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
or reflect on that.

495
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,300
So if the developers are all much better testers,

496
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
what does my world look like?

497
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Think about that first and then figure out what you want to do.

498
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,300
You kind of, inherently because you know that,

499
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,300
you skipped bringing that up.

500
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,300
So I wanted to bring it up, even though I did poorly at the beginning.

501
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
Thank you.

502
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,620
I think the things I would focus on, just to sum up from my point of view,

503
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,520
is number one, I would...

504
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,740
In order to make that team better, the dev team better testers,

505
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,060
I would remove my testers from Critical Path.

506
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,610
Right?

507
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:33,610
To do so otherwise is just inviting the dysfunction loop to just persist.

508
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,610
And that is the number one thing, in my humble opinion,

509
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:39,610
that is the number one thing that prevents success here.

510
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:42,610
It's that intra-team process.

511
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:45,630
So I agree.

512
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,630
I want to make sure you hit a little bit the second half of Marcus's question.

513
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,630
Oh, sure.

514
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:58,630
Which is, how does this tie into how much separate teams of testers test a product?

515
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,630
And as you know, we're not fans of separate teams of testers.

516
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:07,630
But say you have, for example, a large desktop product that ships quarterly,

517
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,860
and you need, and for better or for worse,

518
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,860
you need that stabilization integration period at the end of the product cycle.

519
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,980
So I'm testing at the end before it goes out.

520
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,980
I still wouldn't do that. Do I have to have that requirement?

521
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
You don't have to.

522
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,980
Okay, thank you.

523
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:29,980
So, but your statement leads to my better answer for that,

524
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,340
which is, over time, if the developers are better testers,

525
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,340
the need for that decreases.

526
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:45,230
So the goal then is to reduce that time into zero or as close to zero as possible.

527
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:53,230
Yeah, there is a variant of Kanban that integrates multiple different teams,

528
00:39:53,230 --> 00:40:00,230
where you have dev finishes coding in a small story,

529
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:07,230
that goes into a queue, and then test draws from a queue and validates.

530
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:14,230
And in that model, tests often ends up being sort of acceptance testing.

531
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:21,230
And it's still one small chunk that gets checked into main at a time.

532
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,230
I would get rid of the stabilization period.

533
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,230
I would keep the zero bug goal.

534
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:32,230
I would add a new thing, a new process that says,

535
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,230
hey, we're going to integrate into main one thing at a time,

536
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,230
and main is always RTM-able.

537
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,230
In addition to that, one of my favorite tricks on this is you,

538
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,230
is you tell the business team, by the way,

539
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:51,230
we're going to proactively communicate what features are in main

540
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,230
every time we add a new one.

541
00:40:53,230 --> 00:41:00,230
And the dev, the engineering team, will no longer have any say on ship date.

542
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:04,320
So the business team could ship in a quarter,

543
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,320
they could ship in four months, they could ship every day.

544
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,320
And what happens is then there's motivation on the engineering team

545
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:16,320
to literally keep main RTM-able all of the time.

546
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,320
Absolutely.

547
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,320
And of course, living in the services world, that's always the case.

548
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,320
But I think a lot of teams who have traditionally done shrink-wrapped

549
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,320
slash desktop products forget that,

550
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
or they think it's okay to ease away from that.

551
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
But I fully agree.

552
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Keep main, keep trunk, always shipable,

553
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,320
and a lot of those end-of-cycle problems go away.

554
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,320
And just because I don't think we've talked about

555
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,320
the separate teams on a Kanban before,

556
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,510
the one thing that's really brilliant about this is,

557
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:54,510
so imagine you have a dev work column

558
00:41:54,510 --> 00:42:00,510
that goes into a test queue column followed by a test work column.

559
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:06,240
If then it becomes super visible,

560
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,850
if that test queue column is growing,

561
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,850
so dev is contributing to it faster than test can pull from it.

562
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,850
Unlike, so a lot of the problems we've had in the past is,

563
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:22,850
oh, well, I'm getting compressed,

564
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:27,850
and or the ratio discussions, how many tests per dev, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

565
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,850
What this does is it creates a visibility tool

566
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,850
where leadership can look at it and say,

567
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:39,010
right, dev, you need to start helping test push these things through.

568
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,170
But it's important that leadership recognizes that, oh.

569
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,170
Well, transparency does that.

570
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,810
No, we need more testers,

571
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,810
which is a conclusion you may make from that.

572
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,810
When you and I look at that, well, you wouldn't,

573
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:53,810
but someone may make from that.

574
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,810
You and I look at that and go,

575
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,810
oh, we need developers to have done more testing

576
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:02,840
so that the time it takes in the queue is shorter for these items.

577
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,840
Or even if they've done a great job

578
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,840
and they just are accelerating a bunch of features.

579
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:19,160
We need to make it a clear statement that test and dev are specializing generalists.

580
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:27,260
And so at times, because our job is to finish work, not start work,

581
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,290
if there's a blockage in the queue,

582
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:33,290
we're going to ask the dev team to switch sides

583
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,290
and, yeah, they're going to go slower.

584
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,420
But it's still going to help the work move forward.

585
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,420
Similarly, like it, and I don't like scrum, as you know,

586
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,420
but if you have a sprint model where you start and stop work all the time

587
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,420
and you have a sprint model with separate teams,

588
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,420
well, a lot of times if you have a one-to-one test to dev ratio,

589
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,420
you have a lot of idle testers.

590
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,420
Well, that's a perfect time where they should be switching sides

591
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,420
and helping to write some of the code to get the flow going.

592
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,540
Sure.

593
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
Yep.

594
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,540
So if we could shove in one more quick tangent mailbag, I think we can.

595
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,540
Yeah.

596
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,540
All right.

597
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,540
So I was listening to the online test conference off and on.

598
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,540
Danny Fott, one of the three, shout out to Danny,

599
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,540
gave a talk on modern testing.

600
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,540
It's pretty awesome.

601
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,540
It was.

602
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,670
And then I also heard a talk from Jesper Tutsen.

603
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,670
Jesper on shift left, which is a term I'm not.

604
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:30,670
I get what he means.

605
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,670
I'm a fan of Jesper and what he said.

606
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,670
This whole shift left concept is, or it's not the concept.

607
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,670
It's the, I don't like the word, but I did realize,

608
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:44,670
I tweeted this last night, is that when I type,

609
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,670
I use the left shift key almost exclusively.

610
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:49,670
I hardly ever use the right shift key.

611
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:52,670
So that's my new interpretation and final interpretation

612
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:53,670
of what shift left means.

613
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:57,670
But anyway, he was asked whether testers who,

614
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,670
air quote, shift left, get pushed back from other areas

615
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,670
as they generalize.

616
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,670
For example, do ops folks say, hey, this is my area.

617
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,120
Go back to testing.

618
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,120
You know my answer.

619
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,120
I'll let you answer first.

620
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,210
Probably.

621
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:17,240
So the next question is, and should you care?

622
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,240
Well, but one thing that's true in the,

623
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,240
what I think is true with modern testers is,

624
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,240
especially compared to the traditional tester,

625
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,240
is that conflict between disciplines just does not exist.

626
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,240
It isn't a dev versus test thing.

627
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,240
It isn't a test versus dev ops thing.

628
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
It is a collaboration.

629
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,240
And for anyone that doesn't get it,

630
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,240
you can have a conversation with them.

631
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,240
You can collaborate with them and they will get it.

632
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,240
I think modern testers don't seek out conflict.

633
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Modern testers resolve conflict.

634
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,500
That's my thought.

635
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,500
And I think part of being, this rule is,

636
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,500
and not that shift left equates to modern tester,

637
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:05,500
but from our viewpoint, I think that it makes sense to...

638
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Did you see all of his talk?

639
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Yes, first?

640
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,500
No, just the last half.

641
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,500
Okay.

642
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:16,070
Because he tweeted out a shout out to the podcast

643
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,070
and I don't know.

644
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,070
I don't.

645
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,070
I wasn't able to see the deck.

646
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,070
Oh, I did see that part, yeah.

647
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:21,070
Yeah, what was the context there?

648
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,620
Are we left shifters?

649
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:25,620
Apparently.

650
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,620
Okay.

651
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,620
So on the dev ops, are people in dev ops going to...

652
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,620
Yeah, I mean, yes, they are.

653
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,620
Of course they are.

654
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,620
Anybody who is solidified in the job

655
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:42,620
and sees it, a whole bunch of untrained people

656
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,620
going into that role,

657
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,620
yeah, they're going to get a little bit defensive.

658
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,620
The thing is...

659
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,620
I don't think they necessarily will.

660
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,620
You can say they can get a little defensive.

661
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,940
It's the job...

662
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,940
In my experience, they may or may not.

663
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,940
You just have to distinguish between the job

664
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,940
and the activity.

665
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:04,940
Right?

666
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:11,940
I have not encountered a dev ops problem space

667
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,060
where they were sufficiently funded,

668
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:21,500
where they had all of the staffing to handle the problem

669
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
that they need to.

670
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,500
One of the biggest problems in a dev ops space

671
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,500
that I've observed, it's actually very similar,

672
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,500
in my mind, to the automation space back in the day,

673
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,500
where if you get into this infinite loop

674
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,500
where you have leadership who thinks that we need to automate everything,

675
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:45,600
what ends up happening if you're not paying attention

676
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,600
is that slowly but surely

677
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,600
all of your particular resources are being sucked into maintaining

678
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,600
the technical assets that you have built.

679
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
Similarly with dev ops,

680
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:03,600
brute force, this idea of STEs moving to dev ops,

681
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,600
yeah, that's important right now

682
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:12,600
because services, a lot of the tooling isn't universalized,

683
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,600
the universe isn't generalized across all of these contexts.

684
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:21,600
There's a lot of great tools, a lot of monitoring systems,

685
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,600
but who's looking at it, who's taking action?

686
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,600
That tooling hasn't hooked up.

687
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,600
It's all context sensitive based off of the service that you're building.

688
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:36,560
So you hire these dev ops people to mitigate via brute force.

689
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:42,560
As you do that, you find that people start then optimizing for,

690
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,560
how do we corral these army of manual dev ops folks?

691
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,560
Because we need to make that more efficient and that more efficient.

692
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,560
And that's where I start actually,

693
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,560
I'm starting to see a little bit of the same sort of test as function

694
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:57,560
that we used to have.

695
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,560
So I haven't seen that.

696
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,560
And I use dev ops as an example,

697
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,560
or ops, I can't remember if that was Jesper's example or not,

698
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,560
but it's an area where I chose it for my example

699
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,560
because I think there's a lot of overlap

700
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:12,560
between a specialized generalist tester role

701
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:16,560
and a specializing tester, specializing generalist ops role.

702
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:22,910
They both probably use and know how to use Docker, for example.

703
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:24,910
I think it's important they do.

704
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:26,910
I think there's a lot of overlap.

705
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:28,910
I am working on partnering my team a lot with our ops team

706
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,910
on creating monitoring for quality metrics.

707
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,910
And it's a partnership.

708
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:35,910
It's not like, oh, that's my job.

709
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,910
It's like, let's work on this together.

710
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,910
I think that's what I'm going to do, and you help me.

711
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,910
While I have seen ops as sort of the dumping ground that test used to be,

712
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:50,460
I don't think it's necessarily the norm.

713
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,460
Anyway, to rewind the stack and go back to the point,

714
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,460
sure, there can be some conflict.

715
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,460
I don't think it's necessary.

716
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,460
I don't think it's rampant.

717
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:06,460
I think that in a team where the specializing generalist quality role

718
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,460
could accelerate the achievement of shipable quality,

719
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,680
that personal conflict is a bottleneck that we can help resolve.

720
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:24,160
I personally have a lot of interaction with our DevOps here in Azure.

721
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:34,150
And I'm doing a lot of things that one could argue belong in their domain and control.

722
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:38,250
When they discover it, I'm like, hey, you know what?

723
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,250
You're right.

724
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,250
There's one bit that doesn't belong to you.

725
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,250
It belongs to me.

726
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:49,110
But everything else, I'll hand off to you immediately.

727
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:53,240
It's about who can get things done.

728
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,240
And the thing that I often fall back on is like, look,

729
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,240
I'm in Azure Compute, and my business is asking for these results.

730
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,240
So if you're going to build it, great.

731
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,240
This is the time we need it.

732
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,240
If you can't deliver that to the timeline, I need to build it.

733
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,240
This is what's being asked for.

734
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,240
I'm happy to work with you as I build it,

735
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,240
and then we can construct a mechanism that I build it in a way

736
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,240
that then eventually hands off to you.

737
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,270
That's fine.

738
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,270
Yeah, exactly.

739
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:28,270
My goal is to solve a business problem in the time in which the business needs it solved.

740
00:51:28,270 --> 00:51:32,270
Yeah, and I think it should be at a larger scale,

741
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,270
is that we need to cut our throats, apparently, is telling me.

742
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:37,270
I guess we're out of time.

743
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,270
There's people getting it.

744
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,270
All right.

745
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,270
OK.

746
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:42,270
We got to go because Brent talked too long.

747
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:43,270
I'm Alan.

748
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:44,270
I'm Brent.

749
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,270
And we'll see you next time.
