1
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,300
Guess what what it's episode 26 of a be testing Wow

2
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,740
Holy cow, what are we doing?

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,300
And yet again, we have a list of things that we don't know what we're talking about

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,060
But we're gonna talk about them and see what happens

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:30,260
Yep, every time we come here with like that looks like about five minutes of material, but somehow we stretch it into

6
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:37,580
Longer. Yes. I wonder how many people play our podcast back at like a faster speed so they can get through it quicker

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,420
How do you do that? Like the tools that I have playback tools like on YouTube. I did that all the time

8
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,560
I watch talks on YouTube at one and a half speed

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,520
Sure

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,860
So YouTube is very handy

11
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:57,100
Maybe no, but maybe if you just if that's like your thing and it's if all three listeners say like we listen to you fast

12
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,180
I will maybe I should just make like two

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,620
versions of the podcast one at normal speed for the noobs and

14
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,780
Then one like at one and a half or double speed so you can get through

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,220
But this time if people want to get through the podcast fast

16
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:18,780
We're helping them out. Yeah, we started a little late here cuz Brent got lost. Yes, Brent has come to the lovely

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,420
confines of

18
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,180
Lincoln Square

19
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,620
Yes, downtown Bellevue as I've mentioned before I used to work in Bellevue. I love it here

20
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,260
From where I'm sitting right now. I can see two different lakes

21
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,360
If we had gotten here a little bit earlier, we would have seen the sunrise

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,500
This doesn't help for the podcast but the sunrise in that direction

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,300
Yeah, my office is right under the side of that wall that my view is that direction to yeah 20th floor here

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,700
not bad my last building I would

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,020
Wake up and get to watch the sunrise over man

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:00,410
Only it wasn't so darn busy here. I would look out the window more. I guess so. No, no, I

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,130
What have your office facing the window

28
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,770
Work is fun, but busy. It's it's it's a good challenge

29
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,810
Yeah, it's also really cool that when I walk the other way to get coffee

30
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,290
It looks out over Seattle. I see like little tip of a space needle sticking up that way. Oh, yeah that way

31
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,690
Yeah, all right. Wait, maybe I got a better idea for getting people through the podcast quicker

32
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,890
I'll just cut out all this boring crap

33
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:28,290
Episode 26 three minutes

34
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,210
The three minutes where Alan and Brent actually talk about testing. Oh, yeah, and that's Alan and I'm Brent

35
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,070
So so speaking of talking about testing

36
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,930
Starting this one off. Well

37
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:51,230
Look, I'm starting it off. Well, I'm sorry. You're not along for the ride. I'll follow. Okay, so

38
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,550
Yesterday I was I have like an hour at my desk or two and getting some work done

39
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,990
Take a glance at Twitter and

40
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,350
I see oh, there's a cast talk going on

41
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,710
I said and I had no idea what it was about but I'll just listen in and see what's going on at cast

42
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,670
Oh, I'm guessing our listeners. I think one thing about people to listen to a podcast

43
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,550
Is that you actually pay attention to the internet and if you're listening to our podcast

44
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:22,870
You're probably a tester who pays attention to the internet. So you probably know that cast is the conference

45
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:30,530
The Association of software testing it's the context driven schools conference they do it once a year and

46
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,810
bomb bomb

47
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,770
Yeah, so anyway, the cool thing is that they I don't know

48
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:42,350
We've done a rant on the context school testing on this thing. I don't know, you know

49
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:50,160
It'll probably have the number of our listeners, but it could it could I have nothing against the context driven school

50
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
I just think it's entirely

51
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Redundant perhaps perhaps

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes

53
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Anyway, what what was the topic of the cast talk? I was getting to that

54
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,200
I thought but anyway, the cool thing is that they they broadcast

55
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,480
Some of the talks all the talks. I don't know. I only got a chance to listen to one and not even all of it

56
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,920
I jumped in halfway through it was a woman

57
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,040
You wanna sermon

58
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,060
Don't know the name. I I followed her on Twitter because it was actually a good talk. I

59
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,340
The tweet I said about it

60
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,860
I'm gonna give the punchline then I'll get a little about the talk and then we can talk about that and then we can do something else

61
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,320
And then this will all get cut from the the non boring version

62
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,930
So the the last my punchline was it says I hear so much I can't from testers

63
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,590
and it was great to hear her message was just just ask and go do it and

64
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,760
It was and it was wrapped in some really cool nerd geek

65
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,520
Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game plus, you know plus 10 agility kind of you know

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Things it made it a good talk. I thought it was very well done

67
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,040
but the point is beyond all the fun part that actually made the talk interesting as opposed to

68
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,160
95% of the talks I listened to receive is

69
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:10,410
The core message was very good. Also. It says look if you

70
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,740
You want the keys to the castle as a tester?

71
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,540
And you and I take it for granted that we can that we see source code we see

72
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,540
We can look at the the database is supporting our product in the background and see how they're

73
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:29,820
Put together and how the schemas work, etc. And a lot of touches go are very much

74
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,820
I'll be blunt here. They play the victim role. Well, we're not allowed to see the source code

75
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,660
If we see the source code, they think it'll mess it up and and I'm making the really windy voice here

76
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,620
But you get the point. Yeah, and she says screw that

77
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,720
If you want to see the source code ask to the source code they say no

78
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,720
Tell it ask them why not and say look I'm not gonna wreck it. Just give me read-only access

79
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,320
I want to know how things work

80
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,620
And say thing about you know the databases and deployment is well, you don't even know how to play more shows. Yes, I do

81
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,000
What if I want to make my own test environment for some really invasive destructive testing?

82
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,480
Whatever you want to do do it and the cool thing was is she and I'm gonna get this wrong on the details

83
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,840
Cuz I was kind of working while I was listening. Sorry

84
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,740
She did this eventually got the keys to the castle at her old job

85
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,700
It took like two years or some long just cuz she was new and learning and once you realize the keys to the castle

86
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,540
we're powerful being able to have you know access to everything as a tester and

87
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,600
To abstract as we do and and go off on tangents here

88
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,960
We've talked a lot about that that that it's what generalists do

89
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,340
We want to know a little bit about how everything works so we can know where to dive in

90
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,380
Right and it was good. It was so whenever I see somebody doing that

91
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,300
I really I get raw raw behind them

92
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,620
But she joined eBay a while back and took her about two and a half weeks to get the keys to the castle

93
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,940
Cuz she knew she needed him

94
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,200
But she knew how to ask and she had all the techniques for asking and and being persistent

95
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,820
So that was pretty cool. What exactly does the keys of castle here mean keys to the castle?

96
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,820
Oh, I mean escaping out of the metaphor. Oh

97
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,200
I'll leave the metaphor. I can make a little like Keith key motion with my hand

98
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,460
So keys of the castle are you have access to whatever you need to?

99
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,140
You know how to deploy to environments you can look at the databases you have access to source code

100
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,620
You know whatever else so what I met details you need to know that a lot of it is yeah

101
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,460
So respect maybe trust I think and you and I

102
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,610
Have seen this but it's a lot more prevalent at other companies

103
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:35,130
Especially smaller companies probably not as much as eBay where the testers are you're just you're not respected

104
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:41,850
You're the just you're you're on a different level than us because we're the ones writing code and making money for the company

105
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,850
You're just slowing us down

106
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,370
right

107
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,210
there's

108
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,410
That's the one thing that I was thinking of a lot of the times

109
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,650
and again, it's been a while since I've been in a test role, but

110
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,480
Every time I went to a new team, I would always find a large pocket of my new employees

111
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,510
who had firmly established themselves in a

112
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,450
Dysfunctional codependency relationship. Oh

113
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:20,050
Very similar to like domestic abuse. Have we talked about codependency on here before in testing because I bring it up. It's like I

114
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,690
Don't think we have actually

115
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,610
Maybe I tweeted somebody asked what do you mean codependency and testing once and I said well

116
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,170
Tell me if you've seen this

117
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:35,130
Developer says here's my code. Please test it for me tester says I found bugs in it

118
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,310
I feel validated because I did my job has to go. Thank you for finding my bugs. That was very nice to you

119
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:45,190
Please find some more. I found some more. I feel validated and this loop goes off like

120
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,630
God, give me a break

121
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,710
Yeah, but that loop also

122
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,630
Not only does the developer happy because he doesn't have to test his own code because he feels that as the burden

123
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,550
The tester is happy because hey, I did something useful

124
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,070
but that loop as it repeats over and over and over and over again, it

125
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,670
solidifies the perception that

126
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,310
test is non-technical or

127
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,950
test is

128
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:24,810
There was a comment I heard yesterday where one of my mentees went to a team and the and the head holy of that team

129
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,210
Didn't like tests. He's like I'm just gonna hire

130
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,010
High school interns to beat on the product right? It's it's viewed as

131
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,440
Something non-scientific. Yeah, and and that enablement

132
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,900
Just re solidifies that and once that role was in locked in

133
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:54,550
Yeah, it's the victimization of tests will persist. So let me

134
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,150
This is weird how?

135
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,700
This conversation comes to something that just happened yesterday

136
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:07,100
I wanted to share with you and just for context for people that have been paying attention to me because seriously, why would you?

137
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
I'm on a team

138
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,140
engineering team

139
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,060
Really no testers, but the asterisk I'll talk about in a second about 70 people. I'm in charge of quality

140
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,200
I we are not completely without testers. I have we have half a dozen vendors we use for testing

141
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:30,160
Mainly helping us get promoted to our dog food environment a lot of other tasks

142
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,980
They do have actually do a bunch of things. But one thing I did recently was

143
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,860
Yeah in the old days, you know, you had the one-to-one tester ratio here. Here's your tester great

144
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:45,340
I'll put them under my arm. Okay, wherever I go probably a Dilbert cartoon in there and if you look at what's the ratio here one to

145
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,700
12 am I so it's you your personal tester is

146
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,340
That's not the way we do it

147
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,740
We are testers do a bunch of different things and they do some really great testing as well

148
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:04,860
One thing I did just late last week was I figured out a map of feature areas to testers and dev managers

149
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,020
so I could kind of plug them into standups into

150
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
spec reviews and

151
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,180
Etc. Just a little bit as not as their tester but as their liaison

152
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,350
So that the tester the vendor tester that works for me

153
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,870
Will work with a feature team here

154
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:26,230
It'd be sort of a liaison and bring that information back to the other testers

155
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:30,910
Just so we could know when new features were coming in because we move very quickly and new features are coming in all the time

156
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,030
This is spy so it's it is the ease of communication

157
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,470
They're figured they were losing about 20 30 percent of their time of the day just tracking figure out how things are working

158
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,110
This is supposed to eliminate that make a little more connection one thing. I was worried about

159
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:50,630
Was will these dev managers now consider this person to be their tester code opinion?

160
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,750
So I got unlocked so yesterday

161
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,430
I got some mail and it was from one of our one of our DMS and

162
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,470
Said hey, I'll paraphrase here to protect the innocent because I didn't have a chance to sanitize

163
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,710
Say so-and-so is working on a major refactor over the course of this week and a bit of next

164
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,870
The plan is to phase check in the work to avoid a huge change set with a lot of aggressions good approach

165
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:21,910
And the question is can we get an affinitize tester to work with them and run through a set of scenarios?

166
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,270
I'm thinking oh

167
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:27,410
This sounds like they want yep

168
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,370
Yeah, yeah, so I

169
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,580
Very asked a clarifying. I asked a clarifying question. I did I said, what's the plan?

170
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,520
Are we gonna check are these in like a local branch or by check-in? Do you mean they're going to dog food, etc?

171
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,880
then I said

172
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,760
our tester can make sure there aren't huge regressions, but we really expect that you guys do the testing and

173
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,780
They're applied back with the answer that I have that that was okay with me

174
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,980
They said this is good. This means that things are there. They're figuring it out. Mm-hmm

175
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:09,340
Says we're already doing a bunch of testing internally including writing a lot of automation and we're doing manual tests from these are developers

176
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
They're doing manuals. I go. Okay

177
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,140
Yes

178
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Now that the CDT guys are listening because they heard us like say that all testing is context-driven now

179
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,860
They're going oh man. It's not manual. It's it's something anyway. They're doing stuff. It's not automated. Whatever anyway

180
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,420
Said I still want to dedicate a tool with a good I'm paraphrasing here

181
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:35,860
So with a good st. E mine to do some exploratory testing and it's like, okay, that's that's a service we can provide

182
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,620
Brent making a little face

183
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,680
But it's like in war wait wait in Will Robinson warning

184
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:49,120
My and look the testers that that half a dozen then they they don't work for me

185
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,420
They work for a vendor company, but the they're very good at exploratory testing and I work with them on it

186
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,440
And they're very good and I didn't get the very important part. Can they do exploratory testing for an hour or so?

187
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,040
Not warning. That's actually I think that's a reasonable request and commitment. I think

188
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
That is like they've done all the work except put the little candle on top of the cake

189
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,420
and what I can do is like it we have a little candle on top of the cake is

190
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:24,380
These testers find a lot of really good bugs. So if they're if yeah, anyway, I think it's an opportunity there

191
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,980
Like in terms of you know, why I I set off the warning alarm. I thought you had gas. No. Oh

192
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,860
no

193
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,920
Right here you're you're in

194
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,800
You're on a walking a tightrope. You're on a

195
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,180
balancing

196
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,740
You're doing a balancing act and several other

197
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,530
appropriate metaphors I

198
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:57,950
Know you're aware of this you've done this enough and I know you won't let it cross a certain boundary line

199
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:04,570
But this is definitely a place where this snug they're gonna be snuggling up close to that

200
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,410
Boundary line. There's also an opportunity here though to

201
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,250
Sure

202
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,890
Sure, dude. I'll have my guy do

203
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,880
ETA

204
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
Making the exploratory test analysis

205
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,980
Xt ET

206
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,780
for an hour

207
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,780
under under one condition

208
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:35,260
Your two pests your two best test centric developers are with him in that room at the same time

209
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,240
In other words, it's an opportunity to teach that team how to fish

210
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,240
Absolutely. And one thing even short cutting that is we had one of the dev managers come to me last week

211
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
And say hey, we should do a bug bash

212
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,940
And I said hey, let's not

213
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,540
So but but they're great at finding bugs. I said we're good at finding bugs already said

214
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,340
so I have a different and

215
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,980
The bug bash is you know, everybody sits down and tries to find bugs and I've done those John Bach

216
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,660
I think he's once already about session based testing

217
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,740
Which I've been doing for actually years before he wrote about I just didn't actually have a good name for it

218
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,060
Let's do a bug bash but with a small number of people or

219
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,380
Set a small not a whole team and with a specific theme or charter in mind

220
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,980
Like we're gonna look at just this area, but I want to bring up session based testing because I don't have to explain

221
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,440
I think it's a better approach to the bug bash so people can go look it up. Whatever

222
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,100
What I'm going to do it's already planned is the part of this conversation was let's do a bug bash

223
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
No, it's not why not because

224
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,410
Lots of reasons

225
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,730
But what I wanted you is the bug bash isn't for me just about finding bugs

226
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,450
It's a lot about learning about testing and learning about the product. So instead of doing a bug bash the whole team

227
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:47,070
I will do a bug bash with a feature team

228
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:52,130
I'll take a group of developers and we'll sit in a room like Brent and I are sitting in right now and

229
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:57,010
We'll use that big screen and put the product up there above some laptop so can have some interaction etc. And

230
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:03,570
We will walk through testing and we'll test out loud. I've done this before on many teams. It's always very successful and

231
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,490
We will simultaneously

232
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:12,610
Find really cool bugs and teach everyone in the room how to be a better tester

233
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:20,630
Yes, same outcome same approach slightly different implementation what you're talking about. I was trying to think through because

234
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,840
When you said no bug bash like

235
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,100
This early I felt the same way

236
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:33,020
I'm like no bug bash evil and then I was trying to think through why did I feel that way number one, right?

237
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,180
It's generally. Yeah, you find a crapple of bugs. It's generally inefficient percent

238
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,140
Are the ones that matter it's generally inefficient to have a large team

239
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:49,160
And caveat if you're a small software company of six or seven people by all means all get together another bug bash

240
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:56,180
Yeah, but that's kind of my limit a scrum size a scrum team size is about the lip out the max limit

241
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,540
I want to get involved in a focused completely a session based testing bug bash, etc. But the the

242
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,180
the other reason why?

243
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,500
bug bashes bothered me is

244
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,530
because it's it's also a

245
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,090
Precursor to a stabilization period in my

246
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:22,330
Bashes and stable let's make the bug back by the bug list go up and then we'll yeah, I get it

247
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:28,770
I get it. Yeah, and it it I will feel equivalent. I'm drawing bug lines in the air. Yeah, and I'm wondering

248
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,820
Is there a way to fix bug bashes by instead of it being?

249
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,060
the focus on the bug bash

250
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,610
But it's a focus on

251
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,940
It's sort of a process bash. I would never call it this but

252
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,610
Because the bugs aren't the problem

253
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:51,930
the problem is

254
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,410
Something's wrong with how we delivered software that allowed the bug to get in

255
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,250
That's the value and maybe do the RCA

256
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:03,490
but as I sit here and reflect on the times I've done this sort of thing the

257
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:07,370
the sort of the focused bug bash is what I've called it before is

258
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,490
I'm actually usually more happy about the learning of

259
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,010
The people in the room that I am about the output of the bugs and we always find like one or two

260
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,330
Really cool ones. I did some of these in link and we had and you talk about the 2%

261
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,410
We would find like 30 bugs in an hour on a product that was pretty well done and and over half of them are things

262
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:32,120
We'd fix before we shipped. So it was pretty pretty high yield for that sort of activity

263
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,920
But regardless of that I didn't care about that metric at all

264
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,800
I cared like people were having fun and learning which is way cooler to me. Yeah, but you can do fun and learning without

265
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,090
enabling an old-school

266
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:47,130
See I see why a

267
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,610
freaking

268
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:56,250
Bug process that's the whole thing with the stabilization periods the whole thing with the bug bash like the the thing

269
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,240
I think is critical is the learning and in addition to getting people exposure to

270
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,920
The product like if you do the feature team

271
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:16,530
one thing that I think would be an interesting experiment is a bug a bug bash with the feature team on their own code and

272
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,570
That feature team on someone else's feature team code. Yeah, we should

273
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:26,060
all look in yeah, I have plenty of room to experiment, but we put it that way of

274
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,160
Figuring out why we miss this bug and improving that

275
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:40,600
Yeah, there's a lot to go here. It's and again. I don't want to rehash on our team totally, but one of the fun things is

276
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,800
just being part of this transition of

277
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,120
Teaching developers they can test and we spent a lot of time talking about last time talking about whether

278
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,700
Developers could test and they certainly can they've just a lot at Microsoft

279
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,100
Especially a lot of the developers never had to but some of them are actually really good at it

280
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:01,300
They never had to and when they've been here a long time

281
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:07,820
They they they realize that the prevailing belief is that's a lesser job. Well, it's a safety net

282
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,300
It's which winds back to actually what started this topic what sort of this topic this nice lady

283
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:20,820
Talking about the phrase I can't well. I know that was my paragraph. She didn't say that she never said I can't so

284
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,780
Let's not put words in her mouth. Okay, but the message that came out was she talked

285
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,780
She didn't talk about the negative side. She talked about everything

286
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,180
she was able to do because she asked and and the value it gave her and in my mind I I

287
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,880
Heard the opposite that all the times I see testers whining complain about well. I'm not allowed to do that

288
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,880
I can't do that. We don't do that here. We're not you know, I don't get to see this

289
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,860
Oh, though. We don't do that here drives me

290
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,410
batshit crazy

291
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,070
The one of the teams I was on

292
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:54,870
I've talked about this before there was a team that I was on when I started it I found out that

293
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:56,870
That

294
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,790
BBTs hadn't passed in six years

295
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,950
BBTs they have they had shipped three different releases in the city

296
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:11,510
BBTs hadn't passed a hundred percent in six years now. That was a problem. I was very interested in because

297
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:19,940
That's extremely rare. You don't normally I that's the only time in my career ever encountered that situation

298
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,110
But there was an element of complacency

299
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,790
That's that's the the culture in the org is that they just accept that

300
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,770
That's how things are done. They the team had long since given up

301
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:43,210
I eventually fixed that by analyzing it and realizing what they had done wrong they had put

302
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,400
In essence all of their in the instant areas in the BVT suite

303
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,880
Right the the suite

304
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,720
number of possible failure points

305
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,720
Was what they had placed into their BVT. Well, that's just stupid. It was a brilliant I

306
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Thought I'm just they were like yeah

307
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,760
But if we can get them the pass and keep them stable then our quality will always be high and we'll move quality upstream

308
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,240
I'm like, yeah, but here's the deal you can't

309
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,260
I do want to move on a little bit, but it's interesting. I have one

310
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,580
Dev manager I work with is very much that side of the fence

311
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,540
He says why don't we just run all the tests as part of CI?

312
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,430
and I said well, that's

313
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,680
good

314
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,920
Well, you do them in phases and and do the simplest to debug first

315
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,920
Sure. Sure. I gave a talk a

316
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,000
Webinar as part of STP's does like these day-long

317
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,720
like series of

318
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,480
Webinar the webinar which is series of talks. I forgot I gave her like four or five years ago

319
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,000
I gave a talk on the simple powerful BVT

320
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,510
And the idea is the BVT the built the basic verification does build verification test is out

321
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,950
super short

322
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:05,140
But powerful set of tests just all this you know is is it worth investing any more time in this build? I

323
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,400
have I

324
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,880
Have that I've my principles on BVT's are twofold number one if it's

325
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,160
severely broken fail fast

326
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,400
Very similar to yours the second one though is there's there's a quality guarantee

327
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,110
And the thing I said is what I want in the BVT suite is that the BVT's give us an 80% confidence

328
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,740
That the next suite will pass

329
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,690
only 80% and not not

330
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,330
100% I don't that I don't want all of that crap in the BVT suite

331
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,640
But it's it's is it worthwhile running the next week?

332
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,920
Yeah, you can actually that's an easy one to just prove to yes did 80% of the time or more did we

333
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,280
Did the next set next round pass?

334
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,080
there's

335
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,680
To close off. I don't I have two more things

336
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:03,720
I want to say on our crap thing and then I'll close it I'll leave the room and come back when you're done

337
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,200
I'm gonna go quick first and foremost if you're ever

338
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,120
Feeling like you're a victim

339
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,250
This is this is something I tell all of my mentees when they come and go I can't or blah blah blah blah blah

340
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:25,290
Yeah, one of the things I think mentors responsibility is is to help the individual take back control of their own life

341
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,970
Okay, so the speech I use often you

342
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:35,770
You it is not a choice whether or not you're going to be victimized. That's the definition of victimization

343
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,280
But being a victim is a choice

344
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,760
Absolutely. So yeah, you got dealt a

345
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,340
bad hand

346
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,400
What you do with that hand is up to you now some people

347
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,440
They're happier

348
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:02,120
Having having the label victim they will of course if you confront them on this they won't agree with that

349
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:08,320
But if you look at their behavior, they go yes, this is now part of my identity. Okay fine

350
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,760
Nothing if that makes you happy, that's fine

351
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,600
Just stop talking to me about this topic because it's not something you want to change

352
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,960
the the second thing when it comes to

353
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,010
this this I can't stuff and in this dysfunctional circle of

354
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:30,450
Dev and test one of the things that I have always been very successful with

355
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:33,510
when I go to a new test team and some

356
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,690
some

357
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,550
Dev is trying to test me on this

358
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:45,020
Right the speech that I use very often and I make sure that my actions and my follow-up words line up with this

359
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,170
Dude

360
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:51,840
You're just writing code. It's not magic

361
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:56,170
Right. I turn it back. I'm like look dude

362
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:01,730
I'm actually the guy trying to figure out and make quality out of the system. You're just a freaking code monkey and

363
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,950
if you if you take

364
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:11,910
Maybe not as abrasive approach, but if you take that similar approach, you'll find that you converge towards something that's respectful

365
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,320
Very quickly

366
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,380
Sure, I'm done. All right, I'll cut that out of the boring part

367
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,020
so

368
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,240
One thing I wanted to cover I mean to bring us up for a while and we'll do it in about 10 minutes here at the

369
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,040
Most because well actually it's not we're not gonna fit it in because you're gonna go all rant crazy

370
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,480
So it's interesting that we brought up

371
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,000
CDT those folks are also very much against

372
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,410
certifications

373
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,410
not really get certifications in general I

374
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,560
Don't have a

375
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,440
Strong opinion because those don't really affect us here at Microsoft or even in the US that much

376
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:57,130
And there was a big thing about there's a I won't go into the hole the new testing standard

377
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:02,410
Which is just idiotic because it it just assumes that test endeavor completely separate completely separated

378
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,890
It says it starts there. It's like not going anywhere, but I I wanted to form my own opinion

379
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,410
So I went and grabbed a couple sample test questions from the Istq B

380
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,150
Okay, and the great thing is there multiple choice now

381
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,290
I thought I'd just give you a few Brent and see how you do and see how and I know you won't see this in

382
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,610
Podcasts lamp, but I want to see I will let you know how red

383
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:29,490
Brent's face turns and what kind of weird faces he makes as I asked the questions. So this is gonna anger me

384
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,370
I'm no these are legitimate questions. I grabbed these randomly. Oh, I got to do that one second. Okay

385
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:41,650
No, wait, I'm the context of this test is software testing. Yes. Software testing is the basic generic context

386
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,170
Yes is to get your base certification so you can get a job in a lot of places in Europe

387
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:53,770
Okay, the main focus of acceptance testing is a finding faults in the system be

388
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,990
Ensuring the system is acceptable to all users see

389
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,510
testing the system with other systems D

390
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:09,570
Testing for a business perspective or e testing by an independent test team. I'm gonna say B. Oh

391
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,170
so sorry

392
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:18,730
Apparently the main focus of acceptance testing is D testing for a business perspective

393
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,380
alright

394
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,860
We don't need to analyze because I

395
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,820
Let's go on to the next question. Oh, this is not gonna anger me

396
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,500
Greatly test managers should not a

397
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,410
report on deviations from the project plan B

398
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,810
Sign the system off for release

399
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,650
C

400
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:51,290
Reallocate resource to meet resources to meet original plans D raise incidents on faults

401
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,970
They have found or E provide information for risk analysis and quality improvement

402
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:03,250
I would say should not all of the above except e

403
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,930
No, apparently

404
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,010
Test managers should not reallocate resources to meet original plans

405
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,540
Friends making a constipated face

406
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Wait, wait, I got another one

407
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,080
Ready what a bizarre?

408
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,640
How bizarre

409
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,920
At least one more

410
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,380
unreachable code would best be found using a code reviews

411
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,920
B code inspections see a coverage tool

412
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,100
D a test management tool or e a static analysis tool

413
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:48,080
What's the best way to find unreachable code? What the hell's the difference between a code inspection tool?

414
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,920
Say code inspection so a code review or a code inspection. Yeah, what's the difference between all the code inspections a formal inspection

415
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,600
Faking title inspection where you have a bunch of people in a room and you have like pre-work to do and then there's one person

416
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:11,280
Just takes notes and it's very formal process. Okay, so I'm gonna guess base off of what I view is the stupidest answer in the list

417
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,680
Clearly a test management tool should in to do this

418
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Tell me that's right

419
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,720
Unfortunately code reviews apparently are

420
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,040
Although

421
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,040
They say the most effective

422
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,160
It's just all it says unreachable code would best be found using code reviews and I would say no that's wrong

423
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,840
Their answer is wrong. It's static analysis tools static. I'll stools are great

424
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,220
There's compiler some of the compiler warnings to find unreachable code

425
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,320
Yeah a code review like static analysis tool. I see I see unreachable so weight much better

426
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,600
To identify unreachable code code reviews I can I have

427
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,200
Seen unreachable code, you know that thing

428
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,760
I could you could find that in the code review certainly not guaranteed it depends on on I mean if the code is really friggin simple

429
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,800
Hey, dude, you have a method here that no one's calling

430
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,240
Okay, I have one more which is the punchline from this cut this should have come up last week

431
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,000
Ready? This is actually part of one other test question. And this is a certification. Yeah, you ready?

432
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,200
I'm finding a new thing that I agree with the CDT school

433
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,160
Decisions are stupid

434
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,160
Absolutely, right. What would by getting these right? I don't know what you'd prove that you were extremely lucky guessing stupid answers

435
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,890
No, let me put it this way would you hire someone that passed this?

436
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:43,110
All right one key reason why developers have difficulty testing their own work is a

437
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,110
The existence of a testing

438
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:56,150
What's the option of self-fulfilling be a self-duming prop prophecy once they realize that testers aren't I

439
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:02,750
Don't say aren't needed some little freak out, but aren't always needed but on you know, you know, I mean you listening

440
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,750
Maybe not Brent in the room does

441
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:11,430
Testers are not needed in the context that this thing's implying. It's like the guy the guy that wrote the article that we reefed on

442
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:17,730
Last time yeah ripped on last was reefed on mean anyway. He's runs a test consulting business. Of course is gonna say that anyway

443
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:24,790
What was the question one key reason why developers have difficulty testing their own work is a lack of technical documentation

444
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,280
B lack of test tools on the market for developers C lack of training or D

445
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:41,620
lack of objectivity, I know the answer that they want

446
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:47,940
You know the answer they want on this one is D, but the actual answer is C. You're absolutely right

447
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:57,570
Yeah, it's absolutely lack of training. It's this idea that oh you wrote the code you can't possibly test it is I said it last time

448
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:03,250
It's stupid. It's just really stupid testers. I'm gonna take a deep breath

449
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,770
It's funny it's on the test but you you gave the perfect answer so I want to fill in the blank

450
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,170
It's like I know you want the answer to be D, but it's C get over yourself

451
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:21,930
So going back to data science and and getting into that training right there is so much

452
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,580
literature on

453
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,780
Keeping yourself objective like because it is the there's a large series of biases that is

454
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,120
Very easy to get trapped in yeah, but only only testers know how to think learn biases

455
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,900
And hadn't thought about that that's that must be why I'm went into data science it's obvious next step

456
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,940
now it's

457
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:58,690
It's lack of training for sure and I would say there's probably even opportunity here like TDD

458
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,890
Very successful, but there's probably an opportunity here for someone in

459
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:10,390
graduates looking for their PhD in computer science and trying to think of what their thesis should be

460
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,770
how to formalize a listing of biases that devs go

461
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,550
that devs can get trapped in and the solutions and

462
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:27,270
The way to create discipline so that the devs can avoid those biases

463
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:30,910
Objectivity is a problem for sure

464
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,870
lots of

465
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,870
scientific

466
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:43,070
Disciplines have created means such that the individual can succeed and stay objective

467
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,420
Because they they acknowledge

468
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,060
That that can cause harm mm-hmm

469
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:56,180
But the issue here is sort of the industry years ago is taking the easy way out well the easiest way to be objective

470
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,500
Is to get someone else independent third party right the thing is

471
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,840
Test is never independent right it's a stupid mantle we put on our head

472
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,600
There's I can't tell you how many testers that I've seen

473
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,480
They get the same PM spec

474
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,600
That the devs get and that same PM spec

475
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,600
influences the

476
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:29,990
The same wrong assumption that dev implemented is the same wrong assumption that test is validating

477
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,460
Yep, right it

478
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,240
Anyway, I thought you'd like those. I'm so now I've now

479
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,720
Formed my own opinion

480
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:48,280
That last question isn't that that's that's the kicker you fail Brent. You cannot be a certified tester. Oh, uh

481
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
So it's funny that I

482
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,720
And to be fair I don't pay attention to all the rants against certifications. I

483
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,040
View them from afar. I see what's going on there

484
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,760
I haven't seen anybody list the absurdity of the questions before if you have I apologize if I've missed it

485
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,360
You know I'm sure somebody'll point me to something

486
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,360
But I've never actually looked at like sample test questions and pulled some out and and realize that oh my god

487
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,920
These really are really bad. I would actually if there's any of the three listeners

488
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,880
That's a hashtag one of the three right if if any of you guys

489
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:34,600
we we pretty much mocked every single one of these questions if you actually have a an

490
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,380
objective and logical reason why

491
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,600
We shouldn't have done that I'd love to hear it on

492
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:47,920
I think that I think the biggest reason for certifications is a lot of companies especially in Europe

493
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,680
I don't know of a ton in the US who require certifications as part of their for whatever reasons they

494
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,880
I wonder if companies that require certifications for employment actually know what's involved in certifications because like it like you're right

495
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,900
I don't think I want to hire someone who has one. I'm a little afraid of them

496
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,240
I'm actually thinking it would be interesting to sort of see the correlation of companies that

497
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:16,680
hire test teams that are primarily certified and companies that don't that are in similar industries and

498
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,440
to see if you can correlate

499
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,530
that certification either adding value or

500
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,900
detracting value

501
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,540
That would be interesting. I don't know if that exists in fact

502
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,100
That should be something that people that run is TQB and I've met Rex before he's a nice guy Rex black

503
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
who does a lot of this stuff and

504
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,780
but he's

505
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:41,060
He runs a lot of training programs to train people to pass the test and cetera

506
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:45,440
But I think really what I'd like to see him do is show that that data

507
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:53,580
Do you are these people people have certifications actually provide more value in the long run to the business to the yeah to the business?

508
00:38:54,060 --> 00:39:00,060
Right because my fear is that these companies that that do fundamentally do the certification

509
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:06,620
Number one, they're gonna be slower my hypothesis. They're gonna be slower than their competition and

510
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:11,630
It's gonna cost them more

511
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:18,090
Yeah, all right. You know what? I think we're about done. We are there was something else I was gonna say crud

512
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,320
I don't know what it was though. Do you remember?

513
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,120
Sorry, all right. My memory is worse than yours

514
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:30,040
Whoa, whoa. All right. I'm Alan. I'm Brent. Hey, we got our names, right and we'll see you next time. Yep
