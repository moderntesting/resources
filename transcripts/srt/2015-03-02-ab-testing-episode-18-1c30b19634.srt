1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,760
Hey everybody. Hello. I'm Alan and I'm not

2
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,840
Because how could you be what I'm Alan that's Brent Brent is looking as beautiful as ever

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:28,240
That's sitting next to me here in the room in studio a Microsoft main campus. We're in a different room today

4
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,740
We are cuz I it's it's only vaguely

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,540
Disturbing because we normally meet at 8 and 8 was too early for me today

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,860
So today today, we're meeting at 9, you know, we have an Audi and oh by the way

7
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,980
I'm gonna get back to that story. This is a B testing episode number 18

8
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:52,580
So if you're listening to the wrong podcast now is the time to pause this and and switch to the one you meant to listen to

9
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,900
No, no, no, this is a better podcast than the one you were planning

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,300
Okay, so

11
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,960
We have an Audi and

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,320
Audi apparently is in translated English means every repair is frickin expensive

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,920
Is that the acronym like I think so I have to figure it out. I'm sure all

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,770
Let me just give you an example

15
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,050
Just so happened both of our cars a Toyota and an Audi both needed service this week

16
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,730
Audi needed it. Sorry this the Prius needed its

17
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,330
95,000 mile

18
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,370
maintenance

19
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:35,130
Go in there. They check it all out do everything. I'm out of there for 40 bucks

20
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,810
Nice

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,130
The basic maintenance on the Audi starts around to something

22
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,440
Yeah, and that's just like to change a gasket right that that's like okay

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,600
It's gonna be a hundred to open the hood because need a specialist for that

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,120
It's a great car, but man man when it needs work done it

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,140
Hurts. So anyway, I'm a huge fan of so I had to leave it overnight because they had to clean the carbon out of something

26
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Fuel injector sure sure whatever

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Anyway, so I had to get a ride to work so I couldn't get here by 8 so I'm here now and that is a long intro

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,520
You know I had I've been experimenting with playing with a bunch of different podcast

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,120
Players, I finally found like one

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,840
I like I need like a really simple podcast player most ones I've looked at are like super complex with all kinds of features, etc

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,080
Too much too much. I'm sure if I listen to podcasts all day the kitchen sink podcast player would be great

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,180
But I wanted one that was simple, but there was one that I used for a while

33
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,230
until it pissed me off where it an option to

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,390
Skip like the first n number of seconds or minutes of any podcast

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:46,450
so if you know that a particular podcast doesn't get good tell say the

36
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,730
Third or minute or the lake or the 30th minute. You can just like set it up. See you skip all that

37
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Testing and software and quality stuff

38
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,000
I think yeah, I I have a feeling I have a hunch

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,040
I have an inkling of an idea that Brent has a bit of an announcement to make

40
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,540
What do you think about that?

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,680
Yeah, and and the fact that it's written up on the can bend board certainly helps a great deal

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,440
Look you are breaking the third wall of podcasting

43
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,770
Talk about your little now what happens in the podcast stays in the podcast apparently

44
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,450
No, so I'm very happy to announce

45
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,410
This is the the first place I'm doing in a public forum

46
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:42,330
I'll probably be writing the blog post the obligatory blog post on it over the weekend

47
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,380
But I have a new job

48
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,420
Today's will be cleaning

49
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,620
bathrooms in the studios

50
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,960
No, if I go on sorry if they're willing to pay my salary to do that

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,340
No, they would

52
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,540
They'd still have to pay me more

53
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,250
The

54
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,770
As an aside

55
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,700
The because we never do a side. Yes. Yeah, the the you know the

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,530
The in California that which is that that's my home state the guys who hold the signs

57
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,270
That say slow and stop. Do you know how much?

58
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,450
They got paid 20 years ago 20 years ago. Did you do that job 20 years ago?

59
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,710
No, how much do they get paid 20 years ago?

60
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,600
$50 an hour

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
Should just flip song. I have an announcement to make I will be resigned

62
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,830
Yeah, and then when I share that with people they go what the hell

63
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,850
They just sit there in twist signs all day for 50 an hour

64
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,550
But you know what their day goes by so slowly remind goes by go crap

65
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,790
I still have work to do and it's six o'clock. Yes, the that's that's back then

66
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:03,030
That's the rate they had the charge to solve the attrition problem because the job is so friggin boring. That is interesting

67
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,030
Yeah, I think there's a whole

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,660
My head is spinning because I read a lot of psychology of how the brain works kind of books and and what affects

69
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,220
You know motivation like the Dan pink stuff

70
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,780
I want to think maybe there's some way to change that job up and give them

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:24,120
I'm not gonna brainstorm the whole solution here, but I think I could come up given some time and some brainstorming a way to

72
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,180
Make that job interesting enough for people who didn't go

73
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Batship board doing it

74
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,570
Come back next podcast for that solution will solve we will take suggestions and we will solve that and many other

75
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,650
Construction union problems all the next podcast sir. All right, so

76
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:51,980
Job in your job is at Microsoft it is. Oh good. It is. I hear they're a pretty good company. I am

77
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,660
They hired you I

78
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,140
Will be going into a full-time

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,740
Data science job

80
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,660
My title shortly will be data scientist manager. They can't see the air quotes you put around that data science

81
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,080
What does that mean? What does a data science manager do?

82
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,260
Manage data science II people that's great. What do data science II people do?

83
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,800
So the they use the data to help

84
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,170
Create actionable decisions that that in essence is what every data scientist is doing

85
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:33,370
What's the difference between sort of business intelligence like we there's data

86
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,330
It's very obviously we do and data science or they related are they overlap how there there's an overlap

87
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,330
business intelligence is

88
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,090
There's an overlap in terms of the technology used data science team will often go

89
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,330
deeper in in sort of the

90
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,770
Technical aspects you can kind of view it sort of the difference between

91
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:03,050
This is a hyperbole but a difference between a PM and a and a dev in a in the software engineering world

92
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,090
They're both working on technology

93
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,130
but

94
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,130
one is focused on

95
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,010
You'll say executives and communication and

96
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,450
Visualization and the others more focused on processing the data

97
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:25,110
Turn it into something actionable now. I intend to sort of do both

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
Much like we've said here before

99
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,280
in the services world

100
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,720
Building the most reliant or reliable service that no one uses is kind of pointless

101
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,120
and it's the same thing a lot of lot of data science stuff you can spend months working on it and

102
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,790
Then discover it's a non-problem

103
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,520
Yeah, right and

104
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,960
Something you want to avoid so I was reminded and again because in this podcast we never go off on tangents

105
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,160
I came across a free ebook from Microsoft on data science in the cloud, which I haven't read yet

106
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,000
But and I'm too lazy to probably look up the link and put it in our our

107
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,720
Podcast but you should put it in the pocket

108
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,160
It's I will I will make an attempt now that brand has put pressure at minimum

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,600
You should send me the link but it's data science in the cloud with Microsoft Azure machine learning and are and I'm a big fan

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,960
Of our I don't know if you caught this announcement. Did you know Microsoft bought our we bought

111
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:26,620
Yeah, I don't know that we bought our we bought a company that was doing a bunch of stuff with our no

112
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:30,940
Let me look it up. Hold on. I'm but I do know a guy who's going to that team

113
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,360
You know a guy who knows a guy. Yep. So on the revolutionary analysis comm blog

114
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:45,000
The company revolution revolution analytics who make our were acquired by Microsoft on January 23rd was the announcement was made

115
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,040
Yes, that I was aware of that's pretty cool

116
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,920
Our is fun. I think I don't think you have to be data science II

117
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
I think I don't know that's such a that term

118
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,080
I think the term data science reason I asked you the questions about it

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,800
I think data science and data scientist are

120
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,480
Words and titles that are still evolving into something that can be commonly understood

121
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,360
We are likely to go through the typical Microsoft process on this

122
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,440
You mean where we swing the pendulum madly until it lands somewhere in the middle?

123
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
where we

124
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,000
So there was a slide I saw a couple years ago that compared

125
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,630
Data science to to sex in high school

126
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:42,480
Warning PG section of the podcast starting now. Yeah, you rent in essence

127
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,450
everybody

128
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,920
Wants it

129
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,800
Everyone claims they've already had it and no one actually has

130
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,940
In terms of the fun things that we've talked about here a couple times on on the podcast and and

131
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,620
We have not talked about high school sex before on the podcast. No, but in terms of the there's a there's a

132
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,340
Couple podcasts ago you were talking about unique things about Microsoft. Oh

133
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,920
Yeah, yeah, and one of the unique things I at least I think it's unique is

134
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Microsoft will

135
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,250
Will pick up a term that's commonly used out in the world and then

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,480
Once they find a term like data science that they're very fond of

137
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,540
Completely ignore what the definition that the rest of the world uses. Yeah. Oh

138
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,020
May I peeve for a moment? Go ahead. I don't know if we ever ever brought this up

139
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:49,340
I may have peeved about this before our podcast series ever started, but there's a team at Microsoft who makes a

140
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,900
Development environment and compiler

141
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,300
It won't actually name the product name. You can probably figure it out

142
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,460
They have so many of those compiler team. They were really excited about

143
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,900
Making some tools for exploratory testing. Yeah, they can exploratory test and they wanted to

144
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,300
Blog about this and write about it and get the industry all excited about what they're doing with exploratory testing

145
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,860
so I don't think you need to

146
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Have read every magazine in the world or paid attention too much to the world

147
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,500
But you've looked at all at testing outside of Microsoft at all

148
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:34,310
When people talk about exploratory testing and they want to abbreviate it Brent, what did they say ET?

149
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:39,830
They say ET not as an ET phone note home, but ET exploratory testing this team

150
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:45,150
It this is this by the way doing the Microsoft is a challenging algorithm

151
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,350
It's the wait what how should we really this?

152
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,630
How about the the third letter?

153
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,510
No, the second the first letter of each name of each word

154
00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:02,030
Anyway, this team was going off calling it all their other articles called XT and I looked at it

155
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,670
My jaw dropped and once I got a crane and pulled it like up to my face. I sent an email

156
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,830
Actually, I didn't send the email right away. I screamed and swore and laughed for a while and then I sent them email and said hey, um

157
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:15,910
So there's this term

158
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,250
That you're using

159
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,090
Everywhere in the industry I can find example example example example example

160
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,620
Exploratory testing is referred to as ET

161
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:34,770
Why don't you guys use ET also and fit in with the industry? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

162
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,440
reply Oh reply good

163
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,920
I

164
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,200
Looking forward to common sense. No all our documents already use XT and we have customers that we've said that too

165
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,130
So we're gonna stick with XT done done done

166
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,370
Yeah, you know sometimes I can't make this stuff up

167
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,770
I should write a book about stupid things people do but and people would think I was exaggerating. I

168
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,940
Really think that could go in Doug Copeland if you're listening you want to write microsurfs to I will give you ideas

169
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,980
All right. I'm just gonna leave it right there. I

170
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,660
As many as you want you want little side plot ideas great

171
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,860
I will fill you in with trivia Mary Jo Foley. I don't have nothing for you. But

172
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,780
Anyway, you want to write some good fiction about Microsoft to help you out

173
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:27,940
So an executive here at Microsoft, it'll all be okay. He won't disclose anything

174
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,580
you know what as long as I work hard and

175
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,250
You know really apply myself. Um karma will take care of me

176
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,520
Okay. All right. Hey, um, oh I remember we're doing a podcast we are

177
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,920
totally forgot

178
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,440
So congratulations on the new job sounds fun

179
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm sure we will hear much more about it in upcoming podcasts

180
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,320
You talk about what you do and I make fun of data science. I can't wait

181
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,680
So you wrapped up then on your old job?

182
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,840
The way we transition jobs at Microsoft. Oh, did you want to talk about how you went about getting that job?

183
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,930
Yeah, so this was my first

184
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,100
Time through the interview process you got to be kidding me. How long have you been at Microsoft? No

185
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,100
No, since we changed it. Oh

186
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:22,960
Did we change it we did tell me about what's changed because sometimes it's changed less or more than others but tell me about it. Oh

187
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,180
So have you experienced a thing called a feedback only?

188
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,750
interview, um

189
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't I've done a lot of interviews for internal candidates. We've I'm not sure how it's different than before so so so the team

190
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,880
that I went through it says I

191
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,910
Believe I haven't fully asked my manager of my new manager. Is this exactly what's happening?

192
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,760
but

193
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:59,440
I've now seen the interview process from from experiencing to myself versus are as well as

194
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,550
Seeing other people go through with my employees for example

195
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:08,090
Alan's team just picked up one of my employees

196
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,930
His last day is also today

197
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,210
That's right. I saw him in the hallway a couple times this week. I'm checking in

198
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,590
Yeah, hey, we're already talking about how how he can come and help fix your guys to stand up

199
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,030
Anyway

200
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:29,840
It's very hold on a second Brent put your face over here. Oh

201
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,400
All right, go on the it's very different

202
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,200
So a feedback only interview process as I understand it is you you

203
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,580
You go talked with a couple people

204
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,560
They don't give a higher no higher

205
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,700
They just write up their feedback in the decision still on the manager who can then no

206
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,800
I have not seen that before even for our internal loops. We're still making higher no higher decisions

207
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,700
So I can't wait to hear more about that. Yeah, I'm gonna get

208
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
more in-depth and on this

209
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:11,820
To understand what's going on because I have been harping for a long time. I'm sure in this podcast too that

210
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:19,020
One thing we really do stupidly at Microsoft was we'd interview internal candidates often the same way

211
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,300
We interview a brand new hire and it's just idiotic and I hate it

212
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,140
So this is a good trend if this is happening more across the company. Yeah, so

213
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,960
We like the process

214
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,720
But so far I'm really digging this process the other thing that I found out as going through this

215
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,280
HR

216
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
You know the no poaching rule

217
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:47,010
Thou shalt know is that an unwritten rule it is not you're kidding me as of now

218
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:53,250
I I think that's a very good thing. I think go to the HR portal and

219
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,990
There's

220
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:02,920
I'll send you the link later. There is a there is a readers. He's talking to me. Not you listen, right?

221
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,280
Yeah, no, sorry guys. This will not be going out to the podcast, but there is a there is a detail

222
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,210
Page on there that explicitly says

223
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,520
the no poaching rule

224
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:28,960
No longer exists if a person comes to your team and they wish to leave in one day

225
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,940
They may

226
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,820
Yeah, and there's a recommendation around staying like six months

227
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:39,340
But yeah, but you can like oh wow not what I expected that you can't get stuck with the bait and switch and

228
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,920
managers

229
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
They explicitly call this out

230
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,880
there is

231
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,370
There is no no poaching rule

232
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,140
It's basically it's it's very much around empowering employees. Well to be clear

233
00:17:54,540 --> 00:18:00,220
Maybe let's make sure our definition is approaching or the same poaching isn't just leaving your job within a day poaching is me

234
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,260
You know typically in the past a manager would have to you could drop hints maybe be

235
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
Someone have to come to you looking for a job

236
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,160
But the for poaching would mean I could you know, I'm not a hiring manager, but I do a lot of recruiting for our team

237
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,680
I could email

238
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,380
You know so and so and say hey, I think he'd be a great fit on our team

239
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,040
You want to come talk about it which used to be kind of frowned upon majorly frowned upon

240
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,720
But it was easiest get caught. It's the easiest thing on the planet, right?

241
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:38,520
But the thing is hey and then the rules you send email to a BCC list of people that may include only one person say hey

242
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,400
My team has some openings if you know of anyone who may be interested

243
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:51,580
We don't take it. Yeah teams managers totally cheated. There was all kinds of things. I don't know anyone besides me. Hey, thanks

244
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
all you had to do is

245
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:01,650
Let's say I wanted Alan on my team all I had to do is call Alan and say hey Alan

246
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,490
I want you on my team here's what we do and

247
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,050
Alan goes oh, that's fantastic

248
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:11,410
And I'll say great. Here's the career position

249
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:19,790
Can you send me an email saying you found this on career and you're interested in chatting with me and Alan would say why?

250
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,830
Yes, that will take five minutes of my life

251
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,310
Now I have evidence that Alan talked to me first

252
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,510
Done great

253
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,870
And then I have to go through a six-hour interview loop on your team where they asked me like how to reverse a string and and

254
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,550
And silly things like that. Yeah, so

255
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,550
As I was going back to so the interview process. Oh

256
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,270
And on the HR web

257
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,350
The at the very end of this paragraph it explicitly says

258
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
the only control

259
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,840
managers have

260
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,880
to

261
00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:01,470
Keep people on their team is make your team more attractive than everyone else. Yeah, you know, this is I love this big

262
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:08,030
And I'm gonna take full credit for this because at last year's we have talked about this before I give a soapbox talk on I

263
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,030
forget what it was actually the topic was but one of the things I mentioned in this talk this little five-minute talk was

264
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,270
That

265
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:21,470
People should be free to move around the company whenever they wanted. Mm-hmm that happened. Thank you and

266
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,630
The way you tell the good managers from the bad managers the bad managers don't have anyone reporting to them anymore

267
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:35,580
So does that although that's not actually as as as I've discovered from little pockets throughout the company

268
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,720
That's not entirely true. Yeah, I don't think I don't think we've all the way transitioned over because this at all. There is a I

269
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
know several managers

270
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,880
Who who can keep people on their team?

271
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,080
By scaring the crap out of them. Yeah, well, we'll find

272
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,640
No matter what systems in place

273
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,800
People are gonna game the system. So if people are gonna game the system, I'd much rather have a less restrictive

274
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
system that at least

275
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,040
encourages

276
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,480
Good behavior. Yeah

277
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,200
This awesome. I'm glad to hear examples of that. I know

278
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:16,640
For every example you give I and probably many of our Microsoft listeners can give counter examples

279
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
Well, that's not happening or managers are saying

280
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:27,620
No one no one can leave the team until you know, we ship I guarantee it's happening. It's happening and

281
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,240
the

282
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,160
like these are the easiest things on the planets to work through because

283
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:40,400
The problem is is that there's a lot of employees when their manager says this doesn't do their own research

284
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
This is again another one of those

285
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,200
Very similar to the XT phenomenon where where people internally don't research the truth

286
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,350
And in this particular case, right?

287
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,570
All you have to do if you have a manager just telling you this

288
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:05,410
All you have to do is go talk to your journalist and say hey my managers told me this is this actually true and

289
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:11,490
Most generalists will go your manager can't tell you that I know

290
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,930
But

291
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:20,050
Honestly, and since we're pretty frank and open and no one no execs have yelled at us yet about what we say about Microsoft in this podcast

292
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,150
My experience in my coming up on 20 years of Microsoft has been that

293
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,560
HR is much more concerned about

294
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,120
Not breaking rules that would cause lawsuits than actually in enforcing rules that would help employ growth or freedom or

295
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
Coming aligning with the handbook

296
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
It can depend on the generalist I know

297
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:51,120
But I feel like HR in my experience is there to make sure lawsuits don't happen. I

298
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:58,190
So I make it part of my business to get tight with with HR

299
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,350
And I will I used to do that

300
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,230
But every time I got tight with one they get fired or leave for another job

301
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,030
And I will tell you that there's a lot of turnover there

302
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,630
I will tell you that every single one of them that I've talking with is

303
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,740
Really is really focused on on

304
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,590
getting the right candidates and getting in making great teams and

305
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,830
and

306
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,790
They do have to obey constraints around legality

307
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,270
but

308
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,120
the

309
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:37,400
You can influence that good. Well, I hope then that that becomes more of the norm for those HR generalists

310
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:44,560
That would be great because I think we definitely need support of the whole company for some of these team and

311
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,840
Job movement things to work in a way that benefits Microsoft

312
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,760
Yeah, there's still so I ended up with a four-week transition

313
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,110
Still a little long. It seems like it right. Yeah

314
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,110
Although the guy you you took I think ended up with a two-week

315
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:09,840
So yeah, I would like to see this as a good way towards the journey. We're by no means at the destination

316
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,440
Yeah, and let's talk about that briefly. No, I have other stuff to talk about but I think

317
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,240
often two weeks isn't the the ramp down cost much as it's the

318
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,760
the price you pay to

319
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,380
Just through bureaucracy of getting like a finding an office for this person and etc. Etc

320
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,940
I would like to see transitions be two weeks, but

321
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:40,430
With a sort of graduated like I may spend two days or half of every day

322
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:46,450
At least that second week or maybe working through those weeks

323
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,150
working on both teams

324
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:57,030
So combining the ramp down with the ramp up. I always commit when I whatever I'm getting a new employee

325
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,390
That's always what I offer to the guy

326
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,310
Because what I want is the date and I'm like, hey, let's set it for two weeks and

327
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,680
If if you guys can't close

328
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,560
In terms of the transition by that two weeks

329
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,440
All right. I talked with I talked with the guy

330
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,270
They think they can get it 90% the way done in two weeks. Let's set that as the date and whatever remains

331
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,990
I'm happy to have them continue to do that

332
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,050
Yeah up to another I've had I've had I've seen that happen quite a bit where hey, you know

333
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,590
I'm starting work on x date, but I have this other project here to finish up. I guess fine. I have no problem with that

334
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:40,790
Yeah, the the one thing about the interview process that doesn't appear to have changed though is

335
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,450
the questions, ah

336
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,690
Right. So so

337
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,880
There there still appears to be

338
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,660
the the formula

339
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
right, oh you

340
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,580
You look at their resume and you you ask what's what do you do the passion question?

341
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,380
Then then you do the group fit question

342
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:03,580
Yeah

343
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:10,620
You do the coding question and the coding question is always a useless function that and then you do the puzzle question and and

344
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,140
Yeah, I push my team hard not to do that

345
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,700
especially for especially for internal candidates, it's almost all about fit and

346
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,330
And if for me

347
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,130
One of my unofficial titles on the team that I give myself is chief morale officer

348
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,250
I honestly believe that if people like their job, they will do better work at it and get more done

349
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,290
So I'd spend a lot of time making sure they're going to like

350
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:40,330
Trying to figure out if they're going to like working on the team working on what they're working on working with the people

351
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,210
We have I think that's for for an external candidate. I got to find out a lot more about them

352
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,870
So I'm gonna go a little bit different direction, but the internal people

353
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:54,260
Often even people external who are returning to Microsoft

354
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,420
I will spend at least my interview we do multiple interviews so we can aggregate things together

355
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:04,380
but my interview is a lot about figuring out are they gonna fit in and do well here and

356
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,540
And like working here. I know other people focus on other things, but I I

357
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:18,340
Yeah, I we need to the questions need to change to the way we interview an internal candidate needs to be

358
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,600
Quite different from the way we interview a brand new hire at Microsoft. I agree with that

359
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:29,580
Of course you do because I'm right you are right the one thing I'm seriously considering though is

360
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,420
What would actually happen if we as for internal candidates?

361
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:40,180
If we just simply banned coding questions, well

362
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,910
What like how much risk would that put us at? Yeah?

363
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,910
There's a one of the managers on our team

364
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,560
Is in love with the coding question and

365
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,520
They're gonna be an internal candidate who's written these really cool. I look at the portfolio the resume. Okay, he's done this. That's awesome

366
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,240
I use that okay, it's fine

367
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,880
And then we'll get through the loop and say did anyone ask a coding question?

368
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,120
I'll say do you have any reason to believe?

369
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,300
That this person can't code

370
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,540
No, but it's part, you know, I yeah, it's I push back. I I am still fun of the

371
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:25,660
Design questions because I find that that's yeah, I think that's good. How would you architecture design? Those are good discussion things

372
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,100
because

373
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:34,260
Honestly, because I think the way you design an architect in a our meeting because you do that in a brainstorming meeting as well are

374
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:38,620
Very similar the way you code at the whiteboard versus the way you code at your computer

375
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:45,820
Remarkably different hope wholly different wholly different and the reason we do that for new hires want to make sure that

376
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
You kind of want to make sure that they haven't

377
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,980
You know, they do have a clue about what's going on

378
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,780
They know how about how logic and program flow works and they have an idea

379
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,020
How programming languages work to make sure they have it? It's really just a resume checker

380
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,160
But for in an internal there's no reason to do it

381
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,860
I would much rather focus on design and architecture and and lot not logic puzzles

382
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,020
But sort of logical working through things and how well can we brainstorm together because that helps me figure out

383
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,860
Kind of how you think and that that gives me even more information even then

384
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:26,200
It's like I like what you were saying in terms of the fit, right? I'm gonna be working through. Okay

385
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,340
What are your?

386
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:35,380
Strengths as it comes to solving problems not problem solving in terms of like puzzles, but right every team

387
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,020
We have a bunch of crap. We got to get done, right?

388
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,780
What what strengths do you bring to bear to help me get crapped a done right, right and so much of our work especially

389
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,140
now versus

390
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,340
Years ago is collaborative. Yeah, I want someone that I can I

391
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:58,120
Feel if I can have a good conversation with someone about working through a problem and they're contributing a lot

392
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,880
That's it. I feel pretty good about that if I say if I give him a question ask him

393
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,960
So, how would you do blah? They go?

394
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,110
I don't

395
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,750
so

396
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,390
Maybe I would

397
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:19,820
Yeah, I'm not feeling less good about you for me

398
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,260
It's interesting

399
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,780
What I what I'm finding now is that there's really only two things at the interview process that I'm a highly allergic to

400
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,290
Right if if I'm interviewing for something because I have a gap on my team

401
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,090
For example in the new team. Mm-hmm

402
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:45,450
Then you can look for specific skills. I I am the first hire. I have a team of five opens and

403
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,740
Right now I gotta I gotta go

404
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:59,860
Reverse engineer this problem, but my management believes that I'm going to need deep machine

405
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,360
Learning skill set. Okay, and that's hard to find

406
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,320
Like there's a there's one team at this company that has a whole bunch of them and that team does a very good job making

407
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Sure that those people are happy

408
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,440
So they're they're hard to poach

409
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,870
The

410
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:28,260
So if I'm if I'm missing a skill gap, I want to I want to test on their ability to sort of fill that gap

411
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,980
The other thing is I'm finding that that I am highly allergic to heroes

412
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,090
If I get the sense, you're a hero, I'll spend a half a second going

413
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,770
Okay

414
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:48,730
Do I have a position or can I construct a position where I need a firefighter and offer this person a role where?

415
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:53,190
Heroism is your job not above and beyond right, right?

416
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,930
And more often that I think we've talked about that heroes are okay if heroes your job

417
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,490
right it that's exactly right now you're

418
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:08,980
You are the team firemen and just because you consistently put out fires

419
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,720
Doesn't mean you're any better than anyone else cuz that either way is your job

420
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,320
Yeah here being a hero is your job, right?

421
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,680
The the thing is is though if you're a hero on a on a situation where I don't need a hero

422
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,560
And I need a team to work together

423
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,910
That's a problem for me

424
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:31,630
It really is it and I would imagine as you fill these five positions on your team

425
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,830
What you're looking for in a candidate changes as you begin to fill these positions

426
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:44,170
Yes, because you're looking for I imagine specializing generalists with specializations and machine learning

427
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:51,470
But those other skills you're gonna need as well. Yep, and that fifth higher each higher is progressively a little bit more harder

428
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,590
Maybe to fill as you start putting the jigsaw puzzle together. I want it

429
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,310
I definitely want it. I want specializing generalists and I want a diversity of

430
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:07,270
Specializations in my team. Yeah, right and then once I kick start that

431
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,390
The the the execution process I I do

432
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,060
We'll begin blending those guys

433
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,740
So they'll begin getting read of the bottleneck that occurs because of the specialization. Perfect. All right

434
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:25,220
Hey looking at the Kanban board. What should we skip?

435
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,100
Because if we have about 15 minutes left

436
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,200
Let's skip item three. Okay, do I talk about?

437
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,700
For the last project you did on your last team. Is that item two? Yeah, okay, so

438
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:45,220
One of the things that I'm also very excited as as I think we may have talked about this here

439
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,220
No, we you did last time. I think

440
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,080
Whatever. I am certified and an agile you are certified. All right as

441
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,300
Thanks. I am certified in agile framework known as this scaled agile framework

442
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:04,340
I got certified in this about a year and a half ago and last Thursday

443
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:10,060
I kicked off a planning event for my current team

444
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,630
because

445
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,470
they want

446
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,270
They've done a reorg

447
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,950
Where we are now going to go back to?

448
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,320
Shipping on prem products, so we have some very

449
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:35,180
High I didn't realize people still made on-prem products. Wow. That's cool. Well servers still on I'm just giving you a bad time

450
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,900
And it's a it's hugely all defensive. I'm not

451
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,380
Hugely popular. We also have analysis server

452
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:49,060
And reporting server and as the team sort of built up the cloud

453
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,820
we kind of

454
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:56,980
Use the majority of our resources to build up the cloud services and

455
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
It's kind of put these other

456
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,500
hugely valuable

457
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,680
products

458
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,800
Valued products from from a customer base kind of on the backburner. Yeah

459
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:17,470
We're getting feedback from customers now. That's basically saying hey, we love this on-prem ecosystem

460
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:19,810
We still want to continue to use it

461
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,210
We're not quite comfortable with putting all of our data in the cloud

462
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,270
Can you guys help us out so that we did a reorg and said will you pay us money will help you and

463
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,070
That's exactly what we're going to do

464
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,350
But the whole organization has spent the majority of their time the last two years

465
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,670
To doing services and in service is much more of an agile framework

466
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,360
So when we when we started thinking through the planning we're like

467
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,440
All right, what did we learn from the cloud?

468
00:35:53,080 --> 00:36:00,130
Because no one wants to go back to waterfall. No one wants to go back to teams of test specialists

469
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:06,600
And so it was very exciting me being able to pull together

470
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:15,200
The scaled agile planning events set them up for an agile cadence even though it's on-prem and the

471
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:22,440
One really cool thing that they're going to to do is they're going to have an RTM mobile build every month

472
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,960
They're going to decouple

473
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,040
What engineering produces and its cadence from the release cadence, so they're going to produce a new build every month

474
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,200
They'll they'll let people know

475
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,880
What features are well and to be clear they're going to do builds daily or more often they are they're going to release one

476
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,960
Every month they will classify one is RTM able okay

477
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,560
And it'll be up to the business and marketing as to whether or not they are team

478
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,720
So the engineering team and this is one of the things that ends up being super powerful as I communicated the team the engineering

479
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,600
Team you guys you have no influence over the ship decision

480
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,650
Which kind of forces them to constantly have an RTM mobile product

481
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:16,030
Right now they're going to work towards doing this on a two-month cadence and then build it build it to a one-month cadence

482
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,590
and then one week

483
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,700
That's actually what they're talking about the puddle they probably won't go daily goals are great the

484
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,760
But the thing that's really exciting is that right now there is a team of 50

485
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,820
After I've walked them through the the planning event and walked them through the rationale

486
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:43,690
I would say 80% of them are like I see how this works

487
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:49,730
We can totally achieve those goals with this. It's very very cool cool

488
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:52,450
So then will you function as any are you done with them?

489
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:56,610
Will you consult with them as they move forward did you leave any leave any seeds there for them to?

490
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:59,270
When they run into a problem, what do they do without Brent?

491
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,850
That's actually the most common question is popping up this week again

492
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:09,290
Today's my last day on that team and I said let me what will we do without them?

493
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:13,890
He made it super clear because as Alan knows every time I leave a team

494
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:19,090
I usually set up a series of like lunch meetings with with people I've left behind

495
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:24,870
I stay in communication with with that team rent has a trail of bodies across Microsoft

496
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:29,810
He still communicates with and I I let them know look

497
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Please do not let me find out

498
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,760
Two months from now that there was a question that you knew you could have asked me a month and a half ago and

499
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,140
You didn't and you went into the weeds because you didn't like

500
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,150
Use me as a resource

501
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:55,030
Don't go. Oh, I don't want to bother Brent and it's okay. That's another thing about job movement. We need to

502
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:02,390
Remember one company one thing about encouraging movement around the company is your old team needs to be able to ask you questions

503
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,390
I think it should be common in every case

504
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:09,750
Especially when you're in sort of a leadership position or there's special knowledge you have about how something works

505
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:15,030
I remember when I left the CE team Windows CE 12 years ago 10 years ago, whenever it was

506
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:21,030
I got questions about some of the things I was working on there for years afterwards years

507
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,710
Yeah, it's and I was okay to answer him wouldn't bother me

508
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,030
I said, okay

509
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,670
just

510
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:31,110
Sometimes just referring them to someone I knew was the new owner of something but offers like the it was just as easy for me

511
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:37,310
To answer answering questions. I mean, it's it's stupid simple. I'm like, I don't understand why people

512
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:42,450
don't just do that. I think this team will because I

513
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,610
Spent the better part of the last year really emphasizing and and

514
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:49,970
The value of collaboration and knowledge sharing

515
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:56,130
So I think if they get stuck they instead of said them doing the typical process of going to the internet and spending

516
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,050
Three days trying to hunt and gather for themselves

517
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:09,170
Well, cool, so like they're set up that's something it occurs to me that's something that's also perhaps a another Microsoft thing

518
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,150
Like we're talking about Microsoft. We're like, no, we'll do it ourselves

519
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:16,390
Well, that's a fractal you often see I see

520
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,150
Like no, no, I'm not gonna ask Alan this question that you probably answer in two minutes

521
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:26,230
I'm gonna instead spend three days and research it myself. Yeah, I have a three quarters

522
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,710
We don't have think week anymore, but I have three quarters of a think week paper on the title is

523
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,030
And you've heard this phrase before I probably mentioned on the podcast

524
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:39,610
But if only Microsoft knew what Microsoft knew yeah, and we just don't share well we function

525
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:43,470
I believe Microsoft size could be a competitive advantage

526
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:49,030
Because that shared knowledge, but we don't leverage it. In fact our size right now

527
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:54,910
I would say is a disadvantage because of some of the practices people are in about not sharing between teams and not asking

528
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:57,430
someone on another team a question I

529
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,480
Think within the next five years we've talked about it here

530
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,160
one of my entry speeches when I go to a new team is

531
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,200
Guys we are here to solve problems not right tools

532
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,560
Yeah

533
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
Not invented here

534
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,680
accordingly

535
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,090
kicks ass

536
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,410
Right, and I do think

537
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:29,280
Within the next three to five years. I think the me needing to do that speech

538
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:36,920
Is probably gonna die. Well, I hope so. Let's find out. Oh, hold on a second. Do you what?

539
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,920
What is that?

540
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:48,470
Hey, we have a question from the mailbag Brent I

541
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:56,110
Was coming up I have a mailbag question. Yeah, no it was I was a completely smooth

542
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,130
Segway, I could not see where you're going

543
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:05,790
But so in the last three mailbags you you've done a done sound yeah

544
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:11,550
What is that supposed to be? I don't know. Oh, yeah, I just look it's an I know you're making it your own

545
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,550
I'm making it my own. It's

546
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,070
Blues clues meets

547
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:24,510
It kind of ends the reverb pretty well. I think it does. It's fantastic. It's kind of what I'm into I kind of envision

548
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:29,470
Like a mailbox door slamming. Yeah, I'm not sure what it is

549
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:35,010
And I'm sure it's gonna evolve over time and in fact, you know once we get up into you know

550
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:40,120
I don't know how many mailbags you've done and I'm actually probably too lazy to go look through for all of them

551
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
But maybe I make like a little mailbag

552
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
intro

553
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,020
Compilation, I don't know. You know, it's really sad about our podcast is I never

554
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:53,480
Save what I cut out because there's there's crap on here that

555
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:01,240
We have a bloopers reel that you that could sell millions. I think not well not or at least get us lots of trouble

556
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
paces, yeah

557
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,370
So what's the mailbag Alan I don't know a Brett Hinton on Twitter asked

558
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:16,760
He said it really asked he stated he said every time I listened to a B testing episodes

559
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,440
I wonder what do test specialists on Alan and Brent's team actually do

560
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,390
So I don't have test specialists on my team. So Alan what do test

561
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,330
Did you have any on your last team?

562
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:38,810
The answer is lots of different things because the specialists are specializing generalists in in most cases

563
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:44,050
So we have on our team for example, we have

564
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:51,560
Some testers who are specialists in performance and security for example

565
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:58,000
Let's this first scope team. Are you talking about?

566
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,590
Like your boss's team. So on my boss's team, so we have we are not

567
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,870
despite what I've I hope I didn't indirectly leading one to believe this we're not a

568
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:15,710
Straight up unified engineering team. We have a quality team which actually doesn't do a lot of testing. We have test specialists

569
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,890
We do some of the longer tests things around reliability

570
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,450
Investigation we do a lot of data sciencey stuff and analysis and reporting, etc

571
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:26,430
So that could leads pretty well into

572
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:33,390
What the test specialists on our team do so my manager's team is probably best described as a team of test

573
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,870
Specialists you could even say test and data specialists if you include

574
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,900
Some of the work there, okay

575
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,130
So the pieces fit together it's for that jigsaw puzzle Brent's making a face of me

576
00:44:47,330 --> 00:44:50,090
They do a lot of different things my specialty is in

577
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:57,570
You know, I'm sort of the big-picture guy. I'm my specialty is looking at everything that's going on and making sure the right things are happening

578
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,270
I also have a passion towards engineering efficiency

579
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,970
So I end up actually filling in a lot of work

580
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:07,770
I do as much work for our development team as I do for our team of test specialists

581
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,930
Let me ask

582
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,930
Going back to the scope question

583
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:15,570
Do you have any any recent visibility?

584
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,520
to a unified engineering team at the at the

585
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Scrum team level that actually has an in place test specialist because I know I haven't had one of those

586
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,280
I don't know they call themselves test specialists

587
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,860
I do know of teams at Microsoft that have people that do

588
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,940
Much more big-picture thinking doing some performance testing or or

589
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
looking at

590
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:48,830
Things around acceptance testing or integrations a integration how it pieces fit together

591
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:55,750
That probably describes the specialist role in general more if I were to join

592
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:02,700
Some random Scrum team at Microsoft some team had a Scrum team my role in that Scrum team would be

593
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,740
largely around making sure a lot of the big pieces fit together that the

594
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:16,220
Teas were getting crossed and the eyes were being dotted and I would probably do it was me

595
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:22,660
I would do as much work around like I do in this team around engineering efficiency as I did around making sure that the product

596
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,660
Was high quality that's just that's leveraging my specialties. I can imagine and

597
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,670
If I were a hiring manager building a team

598
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:36,210
I would if I had someone who was really good at a test specialist who was good at actually

599
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:40,650
The way you describe your team is we have described test teams for many years

600
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,490
I don't want people that just can write a bunch of test automation

601
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:49,570
I want people who are great problem solvers and when needed can use code to solve those problems. I

602
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,560
Would say so Alan and I have both

603
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,470
I

604
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:58,710
Got it. What was it three years ago? This used to be a topic

605
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:05,340
Alan and I talked about a lot we were in shared communities and those communities talked about it a lot

606
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,860
This was before the unified engineering change and we were trying to help

607
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,500
I wouldn't call it change as much as a shift because

608
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:20,180
Probably I don't know what percentage of Microsoft teams are sort of unified engineering, but it's I

609
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,770
Think a large portion of the thing they think it's a majority now

610
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,690
I do think keep in mind windows is not for the most part windows is not

611
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:31,090
our OSG

612
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:39,390
Mostly is mostly is so maybe maybe half. I don't know the OSG the operating systems group is just so dang large

613
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,390
I think it skews

614
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:47,190
Majorities, but Alan and I and I don't remember the whole list but back in those days two three years ago

615
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,340
We we had a list of like

616
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:57,900
Seven five to seven different things that we believed test would move into as a specialization

617
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,180
that that the world around

618
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:06,000
Everything that the engineering team doesn't want to pick up

619
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,930
Which would kind of begin to dissolve and I kind of see

620
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:16,070
That is what's actually occurring that we see individuals

621
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:21,190
Sort of gravitate towards certain specializations for example. I'm moving towards

622
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,090
I

623
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:30,370
Wouldn't call it a test specialist. I'll call it a quality specialist sure and the way I contribute to quality is via

624
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:34,630
specializing in data science I see other people

625
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,210
focusing on the system as a whole

626
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:44,810
Integration testing and scenario testing let me describe a little bit differently cuz we need to get towards I think I yeah

627
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:49,970
Centered in on it is I think core and I wrote up this in a blog post a while back

628
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:57,410
But the majority of engineers at Microsoft are sort of that core programmer meaning design implement

629
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:04,330
Unit test functional test make sure my crap works right the test specialists do the remainder

630
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:07,390
I hate yeah, I know the remainder stolen from Jim Jimmo, but

631
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,890
It's what else needs to happen. That's contextual for that product

632
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,910
It may be a little bit more for an on-prem product than a service product

633
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,610
The services is going to be leveraging a lot more data analysis

634
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:23,730
What I'm saying is is as I absolutely do despise the remainder, but

635
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,880
If there was a team of test specialists, I think the team absolutely would own the remainder

636
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:35,100
But when you when you

637
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,640
Drill down into details

638
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,280
I think you'll find that the world where there are individuals on in the remainder is

639
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,200
rapidly dissipating

640
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:49,720
Yeah, well my role is more of a specialization occurring where I really thought Microsoft rules

641
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:50,960
But I was gonna be on that scrum team

642
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,680
I would be as much as a

643
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,920
software engineer as I would be the very technical PM on that team because I'm I

644
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:04,270
Can't do the remainder by myself on that team, but I'm making sure it all gets done. So I'm so and

645
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:10,630
Whether it's just making sure there's work items or for some of those illities or extras that have to get done

646
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,270
because I look at software from a

647
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:20,110
Lart from a higher view than many of my peers. I see. Okay, we're gonna need to do this

648
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:23,790
I know about this we need to do that or you need to make sure we apply this tool here blah blah blah

649
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:28,070
Etc, etc. So what I've observed from from from Alan

650
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:31,380
And I haven't

651
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:35,260
God we've known each other forever, but I haven't spent a whole lot of time

652
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,260
Like shadowing Alan and and I mean publicly

653
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:44,270
Around

654
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,270
How he does this day-to-day

655
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:53,190
But my understanding of it is that Alan in a scrum parlance likely has an affinity towards

656
00:50:54,190 --> 00:51:00,150
The scrum master or the product owner type role. I believe that's more likely the the gap

657
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:04,550
You end up filling because these are more and I always evolved

658
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:10,270
So what you say today may be true. I may be different in three months or I was probably different three months on the specifics

659
00:51:10,270 --> 00:51:12,190
But you still generally

660
00:51:12,190 --> 00:51:16,470
Look at the system. I'm a hole filler and then you go repair the gaps

661
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:22,270
Yeah, I'm a hole filler and I use my breath to kind of figure out where holes need to be filled and prioritized

662
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:28,230
I've been very lucky at that. You know, I've I've talked about I haven't had a manager. Tell me what to do in a decade at least

663
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,350
They might give me some suggestions once in a while

664
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:34,990
But my job is to kind of figure out what needs to get done and then make sure it gets done

665
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:39,010
Yeah, and then one thing that you do that you don't really

666
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:45,290
Proselytize it well enough because I do think if others were to follow in your I love it when you use words like proselytize

667
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:51,370
That I have to go look up afterwards. You don't know why is it enough? No, I'm going proselytize fair enough the

668
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,130
Is

669
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:58,090
Alan is also talented at when he finds that gap are

670
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:05,210
Arguing the business value for it, right? I sees on the team if they were to just do Alan's algorithm

671
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:13,330
It would be just as likely to go. Well as it would bad for them, right? There's a focus on the business value

672
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:21,240
We are Brent full of great ideas. We are also out of time. Hey everybody

673
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,320
Thanks for listening this far in yet another episode of a be testing. I'm Alan. I'm Brent and we'll see you next time

674
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:30,380
Episode 19 next time. All right later. Bye
