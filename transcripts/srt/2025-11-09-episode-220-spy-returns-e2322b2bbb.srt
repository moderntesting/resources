00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,780
Welcome to A.B. testing podcast, your modern testing podcast.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:13,500
Your hosts, Alan and Brent, will be here to guide you through topics on testing,

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,780
leadership, agile, and anything else that comes to mind.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,580
Now on with the show.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:25,420
Hey, everyone. I'm Alan. No, I'm not. From now on, I will only be referred to as spy.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,420
I do not answer to my government name anymore. Please don't use me that name.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,780
I will correct you. Brent isn't here. There's no B.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,140
So we have Bani, Bani, Bani fought and Bondreas.

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,580
I have Andreas Varming and Danny thought are here to talk about stuff with me

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,380
because I felt like doing a podcast. Welcome. Say a quick little intro.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,300
Say hi, everybody. And something, something interesting.

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,780
Go Danny, you're up. Hi, I'm Danny.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,260
This is my second time appearing on this stream,

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,380
but the first time on the actual podcast. So that's very exciting for me.

15
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,500
Glad to have you here, Andreas.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,140
Yeah, Global Varming is a nickname on the slack.

17
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,580
And it's almost second time here. We have like a suite for three or something.

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,860
And I hope I don't embarrass myself like last time.

19
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,230
I embarrass myself every single day.

20
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,150
So if this is your first episode, this is weird because this is our first episode

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,230
in maybe close to six months. I can't count that high.

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,670
I was gone for four and a half months, took a long walk, had some fun,

23
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,390
met some cool people, saw a lot of animals. It's pretty much it.

24
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,470
Got back about a month ago. There's a map over your shoulder.

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,090
You know, intriguing.

26
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,610
Yeah, there's a map over my shoulder of the Pacific Crest Trail.

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,330
It's been there forever.

28
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,810
It was there for six months before I told my last company I was leaving.

29
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,200
They just never nobody ever asked.

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
And then I can say this now.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,380
So I think I might have been clear about this on the last.

32
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,780
I can't remember. It's the week to week is gone from the last podcast.

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,060
But because it was six months ago, a last job wasn't a good fit for me.

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:08,300
I am unemployed right now, so that's worse, I guess.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,980
But one of the things I figured out on the trail was that for my next role,

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,500
I want a job that I really like and I feel like I'm valued,

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
that I have fun at and do what I'm best at.

38
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,620
What I'm best at is building engaged teams

39
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,980
and people who like to grow the career, understanding how that works

40
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,700
and building good software.

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,300
And my last gig, they kind of didn't care about either. And my

42
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,500
when I left that job, my blood pressure was high like it was when I left Microsoft.

43
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,330
And now I went to get a physical a month ago after I got back.

44
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,610
And like my health is like the best it's ever been in my life.

45
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,130
My blood pressure is like ridiculously low and good.

46
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:54,250
So I'm going to keep this healthy living going,

47
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,210
even if I can't get up and walk 20 miles every day.

48
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,330
So you're looking really good right now, Alan.

49
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,770
Yeah, I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good.

50
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,250
I I will tell you, and this is probably is going to be a whole story about

51
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,890
trail stuff that we'll get some we'll get some leadership and software stuff in there, too.

52
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,480
But I've always known I've done a lot of hundred mile hikes before I did the 2600 mile hike.

53
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,790
And one thing I really figured out is that

54
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,070
that time like somebody told me this one, so I'll tell a story here.

55
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,190
Said the legs are for walking, the heart is for beating blood, the lungs are for air

56
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,990
and the brain is for thinking.

57
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,350
And when you're just walking and you let the brain wander and think,

58
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,710
you figure shit out and it's great.

59
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,910
And really got a chance.

60
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,710
I thought about the job stuff a lot, thought about myself a lot.

61
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,550
Yeah, I just the way I put it from the following my sub stack post,

62
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,150
plug here, anger, we will the sub stack dot com.

63
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,070
Go read my stuff, subscribe.

64
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,180
It's free.

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,740
And I just stripped away all the BS out of my out of my brain.

66
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,420
So it's like this this Zen.

67
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,220
Oh, I mentioned

68
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,060
spy is my trail name on the PCT.

69
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,140
I got so used to being called spy when people use my other name,

70
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,820
my government name, it sounds weird.

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,820
So I am spy.

72
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:20,140
And this is a normal occasion that people give themselves trail names.

73
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,780
They don't give yourself a trail name.

74
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,180
Somebody gives you a trail name

75
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,700
and you can reject it and they may stick or they may not stick.

76
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,980
So spy stuck a wonderful couple.

77
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,380
Yeti and Spout from Philadelphia gave me the trail name spy and it stuck.

78
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,820
And that's who I was.

79
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,420
But somewhere in Oregon, I kind of like the pieces fell into place.

80
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,340
And then I became Zen spy.

81
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,140
So now I'm like, I'm just like doing the Zen thing, doing the spy stuff.

82
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,580
And being called spy is cool because when you bust out of the woods

83
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,460
someplace after, you know, things you do in the woods off the trail,

84
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,820
somebody says, like, hey, where did you come from?

85
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,060
I said, doing spy stuff. I can't tell you.

86
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,900
So it's really great. So anyway, it is revealed.

87
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,420
That's what I've been up to.

88
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,540
I've been back.

89
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,820
I've been kind of looking for jobs.

90
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,140
I'm being selective because, like I said, I want to do something that

91
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,020
I want to do some work that matters.

92
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,180
Work that I care about.

93
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,820
I have enough savings.

94
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,500
I can take my time in doing that.

95
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,380
But I I feel like I do want to work some more someplace and make some things happen.

96
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,500
So I'm going to poke around and see what happens.

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,980
I will let it's of course, as you know, it's a weird time of the year

98
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,260
to looking for jobs, not a little people are hiring in Q4,

99
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,860
but I will keep my eyes open, my ears open, activate the network

100
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,380
and see what I can find.

101
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,580
So is it as difficult to get an interview

102
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,820
as for an executive level job as it is for management or programmer

103
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,460
and that sort of thing?

104
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,220
I I think so.

105
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,500
I don't know because I'm I'm looking for VP level jobs still and

106
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,500
I've had a recruiter screen so far.

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,620
I haven't really ever really applied for that many jobs.

108
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,060
And but it's it's definitely a different.

109
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,270
It's definitely a different

110
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,340
vibe than it was a couple of years ago.

111
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,140
I've never like here.

112
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,940
Here's this is I don't.

113
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,780
This is not a humble brag or anything, but I've never

114
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,740
I haven't applied for a job since I started at Microsoft many, many years ago.

115
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,140
It was the worst way to get it.

116
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,180
They talk to me.

117
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,460
They talk to me about a job that I was hired.

118
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,660
Oh, yeah, we need your resume.

119
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
So, OK.

120
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,340
And when I went to NBC, again, the recruiter contacted me.

121
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,300
I'm sort of used to having recruiters.

122
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,500
They're just not doing it anymore.

123
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,780
Like I would get a recruiter ping every week like, hey, I'll talk about this.

124
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,060
I say, oh, no, not right now.

125
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,340
Not not the best time.

126
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,100
But there's none of that.

127
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,660
I'm actually doing the legwork myself and actually

128
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,740
spending time tweaking my resume.

129
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,940
It's weird. It's good. It's fun.

130
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,620
What's not fun, but I'm also.

131
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,180
But also my general routine is I get up in the morning,

132
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,220
I feed the dog, have a little coffee, walk down to the gym, work out,

133
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,380
stop and play pickleball on the way home with the retirees,

134
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,620
come back home, look at a few jobs, apply.

135
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,580
Maybe usually I find like one a day ish, probably on average.

136
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,540
I want to apply to I poke around.

137
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,500
I think about like blog posts or newsletter articles I want to ride.

138
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,620
Right. Do some reading, take another walk with the dog.

139
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,780
It's kind of a good life, but I do.

140
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,140
I am starting to miss working as every day goes by.

141
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,820
So coming along.

142
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,040
So hang out with those.

143
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,300
So good.

144
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,940
But is your privilege in that way that you have like that?

145
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,020
You can take your time that you can like figure out the stuff

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,100
that can write stuff, get like there might be some some

147
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,540
the blocks and LinkedIn posts of that that get recruiters to you.

148
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,860
Maybe right. Yeah, maybe.

149
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,900
I hope so. I hope that, you know, my inner hope is that someone

150
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:59,740
and I put my sub stack in my resume and it's on LinkedIn.

151
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,490
I would love like I would love to get hired by a place that comes to me.

152
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,850
It's like, hey, I like what you wrote.

153
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:11,760
I want to see how you apply this to a team like my my H.R.

154
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,280
screen, my recruiter screen last week.

155
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,200
They really had no idea who I was.

156
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,760
It's like, are you still working someplace?

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,040
You all know, I was like, man, pay attention to your homework.

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,640
Like I did mine. You do yours.

159
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,780
That fair. Am I asking too much?

160
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,060
You're asking more than you're going to get.

161
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,420
Eh, that I don't care.

162
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,420
So I don't know the kind of the kind of stuff that you say that you're best

163
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,380
and that you want to do should be like the first thing on your CV.

164
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,660
Right. That everybody should be able to like this would be the headline.

165
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Right. I build and gauge teams.

166
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,590
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

167
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,550
So hanging out with those pickleball players,

168
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,590
are they trying to draw you into their ranks and join the retirees?

169
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,470
Oh, no, I'm in there. I'm in their group chat now.

170
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,380
And all they are.

171
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,660
They are. I'm hanging out with them. They are funny.

172
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
So they're ruthless.

173
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,460
I'm getting good enough now where the where some of the retirees will cheat a little

174
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,780
and I don't care. I'm just there to have fun and get some exercise.

175
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,620
But like it's, you know, it's it's not a bad life.

176
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,140
It's not a bad life.

177
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,340
I just think having some pickleball.

178
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,420
Oh, like something's obviously in the go out or just stuff like that.

179
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,590
Like or little things, little things.

180
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,080
I don't care. Or it doesn't matter. I don't care.

181
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,160
I just want to have fun. So I don't care.

182
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,390
So, yeah. So what's what's exciting going on in your world, Danny?

183
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,270
I actually did hear from a recruiter.

184
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,150
I'm seeing more of that the last several months.

185
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,670
I mean, so not much, but it's a thing that's starting to happen again.

186
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,350
So, yeah, I'm I'm still still on the lookout to fill up my schedule more.

187
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,550
I did a tiny bit of consulting with a startup, which was really cool.

188
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,550
And I'd like to do more of that.

189
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,870
I even put it on my LinkedIn because the recruiter said, well,

190
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,150
if you're doing that thing, why don't I see that thing?

191
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,950
Well, it wasn't much of a thing, but sure.

192
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,190
So, yeah, looking for love to get my consulting going again.

193
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,190
It would be a different kind of consulting than what I did before.

194
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,110
More, you know, developer development focus then then testing exclusively.

195
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:24,910
But, you know, if a fun full time thing comes along, then I'll consider that too.

196
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,810
Yeah, I must say one thing about that.

197
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,730
I don't hear it's anything of you, Andreas, but what I thought about going

198
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:34,970
and doing some consulting myself, I'm kind of tired of paying my own health insurance,

199
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,410
but I guess I can keep doing that.

200
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,810
But I mean, the problem is the people I could help

201
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,150
probably aren't listening to the podcast.

202
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,110
If you want me to go help your team learn how to deliver with fewer testers

203
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,710
or or or get rid of dedicated test teams or

204
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,750
I could I could I've done that so many times I can help you figure that out

205
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,070
and I could do it in a way that improves velocity and quality.

206
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:59,870
But those people are not the people listen to the podcast.

207
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,150
Those are the people that hate the podcast on principle.

208
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,390
So I got to work on how to find those people because I could do that.

209
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,620
I could do that.

210
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,260
And I could do that job while going to the gym

211
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,460
and playing pickleball with retirees and helping them out.

212
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,460
That'd be great. Yeah. So I'll figure that out.

213
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,020
You know, when I was consulting, I got at least half of my business

214
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,460
from like you were talking about from writing and people just would Google.

215
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,780
I want help.

216
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,060
I want to learn how to do this and this.

217
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,980
And Google would say, oh, here read this thing that Danny wrote.

218
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,340
And then I would get a consulting gig out of it.

219
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,620
But I guess they're they're not googling for podcasts

220
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,340
or they're not clicking on the podcast link.

221
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,500
So the maybe actually when they're googling,

222
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,220
they're getting an answer now. So I don't know.

223
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,140
Oh, and they're not saying transcripts are like index. Sure.

224
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,620
Why not? Like, sure.

225
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,020
It doesn't say I learned this from Alan and Brent.

226
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,620
So no, it does. And I'll figure it out because it isn't just that that I do.

227
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,340
That's just something I could do that's easy.

228
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,500
I I'm good at organizational change.

229
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,980
If you want to take your team from A to B,

230
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm really good at that.

231
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,900
One thing I struggle with my last job is they wanted to go from A to A.

232
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,740
A was fine. Like, that's fine. Whatever.

233
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,820
But that's not for me.

234
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,340
I don't want to take it from A to A.

235
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,500
Andres, what have you been up to lately? What are you doing?

236
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,740
Yeah, what just happened?

237
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,140
My boss a bit was like his his patent panic.

238
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,740
Online e-commerce startup thing.

239
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,940
Otherwise, like I've been working as freelancer before.

240
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,020
Basically, the freelance market is like quite dead here in Germany.

241
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,260
Like nothing is happening.

242
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,900
Like the the hourly rates are dropping very hard.

243
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,100
Everybody's scared.

244
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
Everybody's like looking for a permanent employment.

245
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,420
Now, I mean, everybody, but I'm maybe on the low key

246
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,460
looking for a permanent employment somewhere.

247
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,660
But nothing, nothing.

248
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,940
All these people and nobody's working.

249
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,100
Yeah, I don't know.

250
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,780
But at least like when on the full full time employment side of things.

251
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:07,140
At least my skills seem to be at least like still look for looked after.

252
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,100
So yeah, let's see.

253
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,180
Still crazy scary time.

254
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,340
It's a weird time. Yeah.

255
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,620
Off off. I'm not worried yet.

256
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,180
I don't think I'm worried.

257
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,500
I am because I'm not if I was out of money and

258
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,100
which I'm not yet, I am spending a little bit more than I'd like to of my savings.

259
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,480
I do. I just I really, really want to be selective

260
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,800
and find a place that I like.

261
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
I'm probably not going to work a lot longer.

262
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,760
I do not. I'm not going to work till I'm 65.

263
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,950
I'm not going to pickleball is calling pickleball is calling.

264
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,070
But I do I do want to work a little more because I think I'm good at what I do.

265
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,750
And I want to find some places to do it.

266
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,830
But I'm going to I'm not going to go someplace that wants to be a cog in a machine.

267
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,580
I'm better if I can go drive a culture change and take your team from good to

268
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,860
great or from great to awesome or from awesome to elite.

269
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,020
So that's what I'm going to do.

270
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,820
I'm going to go find that. I don't know where it is.

271
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,380
I'll figure it out.

272
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,700
So not too worried. That's for a matter.

273
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,780
Why why you have time?

274
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,340
Like maybe as a suggestion to try to get the transcripts

275
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
indexed somehow.

276
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,860
So if anybody's looking for a culture change and like how to

277
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,140
deal with that, they find me.

278
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,940
I'm going to see if I can figure out how to do that.

279
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,380
Because the transcripts, I think, should be since all the episodes

280
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,580
are in Spotify now, they do a little live transcript.

281
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,540
I might be able to figure this out.

282
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,980
Yeah, make it Google a little note.

283
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,140
It'd be interesting.

284
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,300
But I don't know if and here's I don't think I care.

285
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,100
I don't know if I'm a recruiter.

286
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,780
Am I going to Google to find candidates?

287
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,600
No, I have 10,000 people applying for every single job.

288
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,040
I don't know if I'm going to Google and look for candidates.

289
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,920
I don't know how people I need to think about this some more.

290
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
And listeners, all three of you, oh, shit, two are on the episode.

291
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,200
The other listener out there, if

292
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,920
you want to give me ideas on how to make myself more discoverable, like

293
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,370
there are I guarantee you, I guarantee you right now, there are half a dozen or more

294
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,250
companies who need someone exactly like me.

295
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,770
They don't know it yet, or maybe they do.

296
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,410
But if they did, how would they find me?

297
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:22,530
That's what I got to figure out.

298
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:25,210
So anyway, that's my plan.

299
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:29,970
If I can subject change, I want to and Danny, especially I want to tee this up for you.

300
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:36,920
Uh, the, the modern test, the modern testing principles, which is, we know are not about

301
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,240
testing and not really that modern.

302
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,600
They're just around software delivery in a world where, um, things are moving very,

303
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,200
very quickly.

304
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,320
These came about historically because Brent and I, Jesus, 10 years ago now,

305
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:56,980
we're seeing changes happening in delivery that we saw the writing on the wall about

306
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,140
what was going to happen with test rules.

307
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,020
They were going these at the time, Microsoft probably still had 10,000

308
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,060
testers when we started the podcast or close to it.

309
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:11,660
And we saw a world where testing could be owned by developers.

310
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:19,930
Uh, data from a customer telemetry could, uh, substitute for a lot of testing and

311
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:26,770
the ability to get feedback very rapidly daily or up to hundreds of times a day

312
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,810
meant that those large test teams probably weren't going to exist.

313
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:35,490
And we were right, uh, which is weird because Brent and I aren't that smart,

314
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,650
but we were right.

315
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,730
We saw the way software was delivered changing and there are people that are

316
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,610
good at testing who will always be gainfully employed because they can one

317
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,370
apply that critical thinking and do, and I'm going to come back to critical

318
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,970
thinking, they can help their teams.

319
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,410
They can either by helping developers do better testing or by, or helping

320
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,010
people see the big picture or by doing some of that work themselves.

321
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,450
That's always going to exist.

322
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:03,730
The days of test teams that equal the size of dev teams, focusing as a,

323
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,340
as a gate to release, they're gone.

324
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,540
I mean, I know they still exist at some companies, but they're basically gone.

325
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,860
Teams aren't delivering that way anymore.

326
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,780
So way back when, uh, I remember I read Ray Dalio's principles and it came up

327
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,540
to these modern testing principles that again, aren't modern, aren't about

328
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,260
testing and we've tweaked them a little bit over time, but they're pretty

329
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:25,740
much the same.

330
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,060
We're trying to make them apply to the whole team.

331
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,260
We wrote them originally, like here's how testers can think about

332
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,380
surviving in this new world.

333
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,860
I'm not going to read them all, but one just came up in a LinkedIn discussion

334
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,940
yesterday, not even a pick on the people that I'm going to tell you where

335
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,540
to find it, but it's one that's oddly controversial, oddly controversial.

336
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,180
So principle five, we believe that the customer is the only one capable

337
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,070
to judge and evaluate the quality of our product, which I probably, I, I

338
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,590
gotta, I'm not going to go edit this and get a beep out of here, but,

339
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,330
but this one freaks people that F out.

340
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,100
They go, Oh my God, you're making the customer test our software.

341
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,580
No, we're not.

342
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,740
So Danny, you are one of the experts in the world.

343
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,980
I know of on the writing of Jerry Weinberg.

344
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,910
What is Jerry Weinberg says quality is it's, um, let's see if I can get

345
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:14,470
the wording right.

346
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,710
Um, value to some person.

347
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:17,830
Did I remember that right?

348
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,950
You did.

349
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,430
You did.

350
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,990
And then some folks have even added value to some person that matters.

351
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,330
I'm going to ask you both this question.

352
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:29,730
It's rhetorical, but you could answer it anyway.

353
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:41,220
If I'm building software for a customer who matters the most, the customer.

354
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,500
How about that?

355
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,690
What I don't flip and understand is why people who the same people that

356
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,450
added the who matters to this.

357
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:56,700
And like, this is a, to me, and I, I just, it just blows my mind.

358
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,180
The people that tout themselves on critical thinking and blah, blah, blah.

359
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,660
And I, I hate to pick on them because I kind of don't care about their world very

360
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:10,900
much, but when they flip out over, they call this principle irresponsible.

361
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,100
Or whatever.

362
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,140
And then yet in the same breath, they can say quality is

363
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,580
value to some person that matters.

364
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,620
The tester doesn't matter.

365
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,660
I mean, I'm not saying testers don't matter in this case,

366
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,460
tester doesn't matter.

367
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,420
Testers do good work and, but it doesn't matter how well you've tested something.

368
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,620
I gave a talk 15 years ago at a conference and said, testers don't care about like

369
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,780
remember when software shipped in boxes?

370
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,300
It's maybe it was 20 years ago.

371
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:42,100
So you don't put it on the side, 90% code coverage, 87% of the

372
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,540
test passed, blah, blah, blah.

373
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,580
No, they don't care about that.

374
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,460
They care if it solves their problem.

375
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,920
It brings them value because it's offers for them.

376
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,360
They matter and it solved their problem.

377
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,160
The tester certainly can help with all that.

378
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,560
But to say that someone besides the customer is better able to evaluate

379
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,760
quality, eh, not really true.

380
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,160
So I did want to soapbox that because I saw it last night and I thought about,

381
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,920
I thought of replying and I do not engage in LinkedIn conversations.

382
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,420
It is not worth the effort because some people on LinkedIn just, I mean,

383
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:20,820
this is what I hate is when Twitter went away, X, basically Twitter went away.

384
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,250
And for me, it started bringing all of their BS conversations to LinkedIn.

385
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,450
And I'm not here for it.

386
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,380
It's gross.

387
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,260
Now I have to go to LinkedIn and see if there's any jobs available, but I'm

388
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,540
actually finding all the good jobs are on indeed and elsewhere.

389
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,020
So I kind of stay away from LinkedIn, but I went there last night.

390
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,700
I was bored.

391
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,000
I was weak and I fell into a trap thoughts.

392
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,580
I find good stuff on LinkedIn.

393
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,860
I avoid the nonsense.

394
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:45,940
I don't know about you.

395
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,620
How do you avoid the nonsense?

396
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,460
Is there a nonsense filter I'm missing?

397
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,980
Well, I mean you, you sense that it's nonsense.

398
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,860
And then you scroll.

399
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,740
Oh, the, um, as soon as you start scrolling, you're lost though.

400
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,140
Right.

401
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,480
Uh, you know, I do make a point of who posted this because I might have to come

402
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,120
back to their profile and find it again.

403
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,440
So yeah, there there's that.

404
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,930
Do I, do I mark where they work and mark it as a company I should never ever work at?

405
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,250
I mean, what do I, what do I do?

406
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,650
How do I like it is?

407
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,210
It's bad.

408
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,170
You just, I don't know.

409
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,330
I don't really have a good answer.

410
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,570
If it's one of your connections and you really don't like what they said,

411
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,450
then they need to not be a connection anymore.

412
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:27,930
I suppose.

413
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,130
Yeah.

414
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,970
I actually did that once a few weeks ago.

415
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,810
I went and un unconnected a whole bunch of people who were showing up in my feed

416
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,610
and just pissing me off.

417
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,650
I need to do more of that, but I'm going to ask you this.

418
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,970
If I do that, am I just creating an echo chamber?

419
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,430
Do I want to heal it?

420
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,430
Sending opinions.

421
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,350
So is an echo chamber bad?

422
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,830
Yes.

423
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,020
What do I do then?

424
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,140
Help me solve my problem.

425
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,680
I see, uh, learning is gesturing.

426
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,240
Uh, sounds like you need to unmute.

427
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,080
It depends, right?

428
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,600
Like an echo.

429
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,560
You want to set healthy boundaries, right?

430
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,680
Nobody is saying no to healthy boundaries.

431
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,880
Um, though, if that's just the bubble, you can't escape off.

432
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,960
It's a different question.

433
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,160
I don't know.

434
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:16,240
I, I'm really not that worried about it, but I, I feel like I should be on

435
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,000
LinkedIn to kind of keep my eye on jobs, but I'm also not finding very many good

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,560
jobs there.

437
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,120
I like it when it gives me, uh, this is the thing I love about LinkedIn.

438
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,440
Here's a job.

439
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,960
When I click on the job, it says you're not a good fit for this job.

440
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,560
So why'd you even show it to me?

441
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,320
God, you should see some of the ones that says I'm a great fit for no LinkedIn.

442
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,320
Oh yeah.

443
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,680
I've seen, I've seen those too.

444
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,320
They've been wrong.

445
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,240
They've been wrong.

446
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,640
All right.

447
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,880
Here's the thing to look for.

448
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,040
You want people with a different opinion than you have who is willing to have a

449
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,840
rational discussion about it.

450
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,720
That's the difference.

451
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,440
Yes.

452
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Yes.

453
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:55,000
How I, I wish I like on dating apps, they have like this match thing.

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,880
I need to know, even if I disagree, I want to know I can have a rational

455
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,520
discussion with you.

456
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,880
How do I, I guess I have to, I guess I have to filter that out.

457
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,280
I don't, it's, it's blah.

458
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,200
Yeah.

459
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,400
There's even someone that we all like to talk trash about that if you have a

460
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,080
private conversation with them, um, it's, it's a rational conversation.

461
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,120
Yes.

462
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,320
And I've, I've, I have experienced exactly that.

463
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,160
But I've, but I've told you that LinkedIn is just bait.

464
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,960
It is just, just picking principle five and dumping.

465
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,400
It didn't used to be that way.

466
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,440
I think it was.

467
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:30,960
Okay.

468
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,600
Maybe, maybe I just spent more time on LinkedIn because Twitter went away and I

469
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,720
used to spend time on Twitter.

470
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,520
I think my account still exists.

471
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,070
I haven't launched Twitter X, whatever it's called in definitely not shitter.

472
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,830
The X I haven't, I haven't been on that platform in forever.

473
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,910
Uh, I had to join Facebook last summer.

474
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,120
And I have no friends on Facebook because that's the trail angels who are, we'll

475
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,080
talk about them in a second here.

476
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,600
Uh, they, that's the way to communicate with him is on Facebook.

477
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,080
So I created a Facebook account.

478
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,080
They made me put a picture on there to prove I was real, but I have no friends.

479
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,840
I just, and I've left all the groups I was in.

480
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,240
I just needed to delete my account.

481
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,520
I deleted my original account for way back when years ago, but I

482
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,320
created a new one, no friends.

483
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,840
I know I obviously don't spend time there.

484
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,480
Uh, I posted on Instagram about my hike this summer.

485
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,320
So I scroll there sometimes, but I, I've kind of, it's weird.

486
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,720
And maybe it's just cause I was remote for, I was off the grid for so long.

487
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,170
Social media in general, including LinkedIn.

488
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:38,810
Like I can't scroll.

489
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,930
I can scroll like two screens.

490
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,470
I said, that's enough.

491
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:40,810
I'm done.

492
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,740
I am.

493
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,280
I've, it's weird though.

494
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,660
I used to love, I used to be able to watch tick tock for like a half hour

495
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,020
straight and now some people do longer half hours.

496
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,260
That's a long time for me.

497
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,780
I can't even binge stuff on Netflix.

498
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,260
I just can't sit that long and I couldn't before I especially can't now.

499
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,650
I just have no patience for it.

500
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,380
So instead I, I take long walks and I, uh, fell into a good, a good, uh, I'm

501
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,380
in a good pace.

502
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,460
I didn't think I'd be able to write every week when I got back.

503
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,860
Cause I couldn't write every week before I left.

504
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,300
I was fried, but I can now.

505
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,100
Nice.

506
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,580
Go, go read.

507
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,140
Anyway.

508
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,140
Yeah.

509
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,220
So enough, enough input to it, like write for a time.

510
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,340
Like the best thing about like having this kind of job is getting

511
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,500
more input to write about.

512
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,530
No, what's interesting is vast majority of my newsletters have been

513
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,850
related to something happening at work.

514
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,010
Something comes up.

515
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,930
You know what I'm going to write.

516
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,490
I could help one of the ways I process.

517
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,370
I process a lot just by talking through things, but if I can write about it,

518
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,130
I can figure out what it means to me.

519
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:54,640
And you'll notice a lot of my, uh, posts recently, I've just been about like

520
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,440
things from the trail that are kind of retrospecting into my life.

521
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,040
Like, oh, this made me think about this thing or this thing on trail.

522
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,160
I'm going to think about this thing or this thing.

523
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,400
I'm going to think about this thing on the trail.

524
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,110
So, um, eventually and probably not very quickly, I'll run out of some of

525
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,910
those ideas and by then I'll probably have a job.

526
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,190
So I guess I'll find some there.

527
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:19,420
Can I circle back to principle number five really quick because I don't like it.

528
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,860
This is the way this podcast goes.

529
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,660
Even with Brent, we just go in circles and circles and circles.

530
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,340
Tell me what you don't like.

531
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,860
Well, you're supposed to be a good listener, which means you lose your train

532
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,980
of thought, but then it comes back.

533
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,460
So I'm working on being a better listener.

534
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,380
Okay.

535
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:36,340
So I believe the customer is the best person to judge and evaluate

536
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,940
the quality of your product, but is often not the only one doing that.

537
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,580
And I think that's why so many people don't like that statement.

538
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,140
It's, it's a bit of a hyperbole.

539
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,620
And unless you're doing like, uh, production monitoring is your only testing.

540
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,620
There are other opinions that matter.

541
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:57,990
Aren't there?

542
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,030
And it seems, and it seems, and it seems easily to dispute, right?

543
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,630
The customer is the only one capable.

544
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,310
No, it isn't like multiple people capable really, but maybe it's the one.

545
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,070
How, how are they?

546
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:11,350
And, and some might not, but when you say like about security, how

547
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,470
as a customer do I know that the security aspects of the software are

548
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:20,030
really like as presented, I cannot really, but this doesn't mean the

549
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,150
whole thing is irresponsible.

550
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,070
It's the principle.

551
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,110
It's how you, how you deal with it.

552
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,430
Right.

553
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:23,870
It's

554
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,830
I'm going to let me push back on that.

555
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:30,190
I'm not against this and we can have, I'm glad people have a rational conversation,

556
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:37,860
but who else give me, give me another person, give me another persona that

557
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,020
can evaluate the quality of our product.

558
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,060
I guess as like, as like, maybe not a main expert, but expert

559
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,980
tester, I could find the things that the customer only glancing.

560
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,660
How do they know that the customer, how do they know that the customer

561
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,660
would care about that issue?

562
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,500
I, I don't know.

563
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,180
I'm going to have a soapbox for a second here because some of these folks will

564
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,710
find, I'm going to air quote bugs that no customer would ever care about.

565
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,990
They're very excited about those testers.

566
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,590
Lots of testers get really excited about, Oh, I found this thing.

567
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:07,110
And, and something Brent said a long time ago is what's, what

568
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,750
is higher quality software?

569
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:15,110
A software where software where there are no known bugs, but has a hundred users

570
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,910
or software that has dozens of bugs, but used by tens of thousands of users.

571
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,190
Which one brings more value?

572
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,110
It's the second one.

573
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,190
So how do we know that the expert tester is finding bugs

574
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,510
that matter to the customer?

575
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,620
Some of them are obvious.

576
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,900
It crashes every time you started up in every environment.

577
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,740
You don't need to ask the customer, is that bad?

578
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,540
Should we fix it?

579
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,650
I got the sense customer wouldn't see that right.

580
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,010
And, and, and if he wrote the customer would definitely say, yeah, this is shit.

581
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:49,730
I don't want that.

582
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,070
Yeah.

583
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,990
Well to me and Eric Reese, Eric Reese, Lian startup.

584
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,830
You don't get any value from your engineering effort until

585
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,830
it's in the hands of customers.

586
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,790
You don't know if you've built the right thing to solve their problem.

587
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,940
Obviously.

588
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,000
And, and we can separate testing from quality.

589
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,680
I don't really give a shit about testing anymore.

590
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,400
I care about quality.

591
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,630
Testing has to happen, but it's on the pursuit of quality, which is value

592
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:17,510
to some person who matters, which I think is the customer.

593
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:24,140
So if we put it that way, uh, yeah, we're, we're going, if we just are careless.

594
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:27,900
And I'm going to refer once again to Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance.

595
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,500
Uh, I'll tell a story about that in a second.

596
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:34,900
Uh, Robert Piercig basically says quality and care are two sides of the same coin.

597
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,620
So we're going to put care as a developed development team into our

598
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,730
software. Uh, so it doesn't mean we're, we're evaluating quality.

599
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,850
We're going to put care into what we make and craftsmanship into what we make,

600
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,290
but we don't know if it's quality, meaning value to some person

601
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,410
until the customer use it.

602
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,050
Right.

603
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,450
All you know is that it solves some problem you think.

604
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:58,840
Yeah.

605
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,980
You have a hypothesis that it solves the problem.

606
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,340
So then you can put metrics in telemetry in place to see, are we solving

607
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,740
the problem we're intending to solve with this software, with this

608
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,100
release with this API, whatever.

609
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,870
But the customer, we don't know if it solves that problem until the customer

610
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:16,310
uses it.

611
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:19,870
And when you say the quality of our product in that principle,

612
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,870
people aren't thinking the quality product is the one that solves the actual

613
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,230
problem instead of a different problem.

614
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,270
I think they're not even thinking about that at all.

615
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,390
The way that's written.

616
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:34,190
How would you, well, I've been pushing back on the, the only one,

617
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,870
because I do believe the customer, I still believe the customer.

618
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,950
Ultimately, the, I mean, there's other quality things that can happen,

619
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,430
but I'm, I'm bending a little bit, but I'm not bending.

620
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,750
Cause it doesn't matter if it doesn't solve the problem for the customer.

621
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,520
But how would you, how would you, other than saying the best,

622
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,520
which I don't think I like, I'm going to think about it though.

623
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,360
How would you write that principle?

624
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,580
It's the most important one to judge and evaluate.

625
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:03,790
I don't know.

626
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,180
I'm going to think about it.

627
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,860
And I would make maybe, maybe at a yes.

628
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:14,980
And, um, like as we like enable, make our teams more capable.

629
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:21,620
Our goal could be to make the customers more capable of like, actually deciding if

630
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,460
this is like solving the problem in a good way or not, or like helping them

631
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,260
understand the quality of the product for their needs or whatever.

632
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,700
Um, so it's not irresponsible because we don't just push it to the customer

633
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,020
without any, like without any care, without any quality and without any

634
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:35,980
feedback, right?

635
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,060
We just, we usually it's good for quality.

636
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,620
If we work close to the customer, get an interaction feedback loop and they,

637
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,980
they judge what we deliver.

638
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,460
I get that.

639
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:45,740
Yeah.

640
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:46,740
Yeah.

641
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,420
The feedback loops become critical there.

642
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,500
If you can have a super fast feedback loop.

643
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,900
Um, I think what pushes people's buttons here, and this is probably

644
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,410
partially on purpose is that people read this principle and think, Oh, you're

645
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:05,410
making the customers test our software, which is true, but not true in the

646
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,090
sense of like, here's your test cases, go enter these bug reports, blah, blah,

647
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:09,450
blah.

648
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,130
We have telemetry in place to help us understand how it's being used, what

649
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,810
problems are being solved, what errors running into, we're looking into

650
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:16,970
HTTP error logs.

651
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,450
We have a lot of stuff we monitor to see if it's working as designed

652
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:23,170
functional correctness and to see if it's solving that problem.

653
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,690
Uh, Brent and I have talked quite a bit about, um, having a hypothesis

654
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,010
for every feature, like we expect that adding this feature will increase,

655
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,890
uh, user acquisition by 20%.

656
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,040
And before even releasing it, talking about the experiment, everyone

657
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,640
think about what are we going to do?

658
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,880
If it does, what are we going to do?

659
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,400
If it doesn't do we double down?

660
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,480
Do we try something different?

661
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,160
Making every feature hypothesis on what's going to change for the customer.

662
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,960
So you can measure that.

663
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,240
You can tell if you're solving a new problem, if it's getting better

664
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,560
for the customer or something is changing, it's a lot of extra work.

665
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,960
Uh, developers, development teams often fall into, wouldn't it be cool

666
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,520
if we did this thing and they, and Microsoft is especially horrible at this.

667
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,720
And I can tell you many stories from my time there.

668
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,880
And, uh, I can, I cannot stand Microsoft products anymore, but it was, it was

669
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,000
just as bad when I was there.

670
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,200
Uh, so how do we make sure we're solving a real customer problem and not

671
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,080
something that we think is cool or something we think will solve a customer

672
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,880
problem, how do you do that about the customer?

673
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm seeing faces.

674
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,220
Yeah.

675
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,740
Dog fooding.

676
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,660
I'm going to first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first,

677
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,620
dog fooding, but then you are your own customer.

678
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,500
Basically that doesn't help really.

679
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,400
Yeah.

680
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,560
And where you can dog food, if you can use your software to

681
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,840
help make your software always awesome.

682
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,720
I, you know, I've done that a ton at Microsoft, but working

683
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,960
on operating systems, especially.

684
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:49,960
It's a great way.

685
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:58,240
Cause it's a, uh, it's a proxy, but we're not the customer.

686
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,200
I think it'd be an example from office way back.

687
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,440
It's like office 97, I think a lot.

688
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,980
And this is back in the years of three year ship cycles and lots

689
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:12,830
and lots of beta testers, lots of feedback, fixed the bugs, better

690
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,030
testers, all super happy.

691
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:15,450
They ship it.

692
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,950
A bunch of customers are pissed off because I think it was, um, I

693
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,270
think it was, I don't remember exactly.

694
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,910
I think it was lawyers, lawyers use, they didn't have enough

695
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:28,910
lawyers in the beta testing lawyers use word differently than way.

696
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,950
Everybody else uses word and they were pissed off because

697
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:31,870
bunches that didn't work right.

698
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,710
So it, and it's the same thing if you do your own testing.

699
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,800
Because your dog fooding is great.

700
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,680
You're finding a lot of the stuff.

701
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,560
It's how I use it.

702
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,960
You don't use it like the customer because the customer will

703
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,080
use your software differently.

704
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,600
You need to think about all the different aspects.

705
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,920
And when you're dealing with a million customers, data telemetry.

706
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,360
So the way you can really do that rather than wait, rather than ship it,

707
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,080
wait for bug reports to come in and then ship patches.

708
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,840
Gross.

709
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:57,530
Thank thank goodness.

710
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,130
We can, we can ship multiple times a day now and detect these things

711
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,170
and fix these things and, and figure this stuff out.

712
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,660
Last product I worked on was installed at the customer controlled

713
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,020
environments and that was, that was weird.

714
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,780
We didn't ship multiple times a day and it, it, it definitely

715
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,980
felt like a step back, but that, that still happens out there.

716
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,020
Yeah, it does.

717
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,540
It does.

718
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,340
And, and again, I think some of the folks who get angry over any of

719
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,740
these principles, especially five, which we did not expect expect to

720
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,140
be the most controversial, but I think it is.

721
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,500
All of our years consistency.

722
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,220
It's amazing.

723
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,150
Yeah.

724
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:44,830
Um, I think there is a lot of software that is still shipping yearly.

725
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,660
I don't, I don't ever want to work on that stuff.

726
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,540
I like, it is so much fun ship working on stuff that ships multiple times a day.

727
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,100
I love detecting and fixing errors automatically within minutes.

728
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,390
Uh, I, it's, it's more exciting for me.

729
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:04,870
Yeah.

730
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,510
So as you do that, we had the podcast reading my posts recruiters.

731
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:08,870
Yeah.

732
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,310
Yeah.

733
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,670
And then when, when Brian Finster was on, we talked about, and he said this a lot

734
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,230
and he's very active on LinkedIn as well.

735
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,310
I like reading his posts because he's not afraid to engage with people on LinkedIn.

736
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:23,630
Uh, but Brian said, like the best way to find problems in your team is to

737
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,710
try and do continuous deployment.

738
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,000
Like if I go to, oh, we can't do that because that, okay, we'll fix that.

739
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,060
We still couldn't do it because of, of B we'll go fix B it's, uh, whether

740
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,980
you do continuous deployment or not.

741
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,380
Does it matter?

742
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,060
You don't have to, but if you talk about what it would take to do it, you're

743
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:43,340
going to find all the bottlenecks and problems in your system.

744
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:45,600
Yeah.

745
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,150
Cool.

746
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:49,580
All right.

747
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,460
What else we talk about?

748
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,020
Do I want to talk about that some more?

749
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,620
I can talk all day, as you can tell.

750
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,780
Well, there was just a recent Dora report was coming out, right?

751
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,020
Saying like fewer than once per six months, deployment frequency is at 3.6%

752
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,780
they say here, so based on the,

753
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,180
if you're a recruiter, one of those companies, please do not contact me.

754
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,220
That's the folks that need you most.

755
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,390
I thought maybe I got to think about this.

756
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,990
I kind of, so bringing a team from every six months to, well, there's

757
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:27,030
stories about this, like, I think Flickr was the one that went from like a very

758
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,070
slow release from multiple times a day.

759
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:34,190
First, I guess I could, I don't know if that was their desire, if the

760
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,630
desire, there's the difference.

761
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,270
I figured it out.

762
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,670
If it is, I don't want to go from A to A.

763
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:41,870
If shipping every six months or less is, that's the plan.

764
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,350
That's the forever plan.

765
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:44,630
Hard pass.

766
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,750
But yeah, if you want to get, if you're shipping once every six months

767
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:50,110
and you want to ship 10 times a day, hell yeah.

768
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,190
Let's go do that.

769
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:58,100
I mean, I'm still, I'm trying to figure out my testing past is calling me and

770
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:03,420
I've kind of stepped away from it completely, but every time I, I talk to

771
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:08,860
somebody about that topic, like my Spidey senses say, Oh yeah, this is, this is

772
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,780
cool, get into this.

773
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,500
Uh huh.

774
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,700
You know, I'm not going to go do a testing specialist job again, but I really

775
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,260
should tap into that experience.

776
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,540
So, uh, yeah, if I could get, uh, your, your leftovers, Alan, for

777
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,100
transforming an organization or something, I don't know, but I really need to

778
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,460
embrace that and, and help, uh, help companies bridge that gap.

779
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,700
Well, wherever they are in that journey.

780
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,060
Yeah.

781
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,140
But if they're not on a journey, if they're going A to A, yeah.

782
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,620
Yeah.

783
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,820
Uh, I'm not going to be a cog in the wheel.

784
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,880
Exactly.

785
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,600
Same exact boat.

786
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,080
I can't, I can't do that again.

787
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,520
I'm, you know, as I think my LinkedIn profile says this, but

788
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,120
Brent calls me a change agent.

789
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,560
And I, I like, I'm good at helping organizations make changes and figure

790
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,000
out and finding all the things blocking them from doing it.

791
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,800
I, I don't want to go from A to A.

792
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,720
I don't want to hold the status quo.

793
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,200
I don't want to be, you know, you get it.

794
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,360
So, um, the good news is, is I will find a job eventually.

795
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:13,320
And I know where all the really talented yet unemployed people are.

796
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,120
So I, and I will have open headcount.

797
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,320
So I'll just, I'll just bring y'all along for the ride.

798
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,520
Awesome.

799
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,280
So the jobs you're looking for, Alan, they don't have a

800
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,880
thousand people applying for them.

801
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:24,280
Do they?

802
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,380
No, they don't, but a couple, a hundred, 200 sometimes.

803
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,820
No, they don't have a hundred people applying for them.

804
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,380
Not the job that you really need.

805
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,980
Um, and it's probably not posted on LinkedIn either.

806
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,980
And I can almost guarantee the job I find won't be on a job board.

807
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,420
It'll come from a network somewhere.

808
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,500
Exactly.

809
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:44,860
Yeah.

810
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,100
That's, that's really most likely how it's going to happen.

811
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:47,940
Yeah.

812
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,340
I knew that I see where you're going now, but yeah, I'm, I'm going to

813
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,200
apply because I need to shake the rest off and I'm on an advisory, um, advisory

814
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,100
board for a couple of different tech companies that kind of, that's fun.

815
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,820
It's free consulting.

816
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,460
I have the people reach out for more free consulting.

817
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,260
Um, I'm happy to do that because it kind of tickles my tech

818
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,860
brain and gets my brain working again.

819
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,500
Uh, I became pretty dumb on the trail.

820
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,060
I forgot everything.

821
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,930
It's coming back.

822
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,970
So then back, it's cause all you do is you get up and you walk and you eat

823
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,850
and you shit in the woods and, and

824
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:27,970
now you get to build that knowledge back up with a better structure than before.

825
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,840
It is an a clear brain.

826
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,640
Uh, I'm super excited because I'm, I know what I'm good at.

827
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:43,310
I know I can do all the things I do, but, uh, what Zen spy is, is, uh, there's

828
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,950
all this, it kind of kind of built a lot of the therapy I've been on,

829
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,670
been in for years and years, but there's a buzz that happens.

830
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:54,070
Like just things you're worried about stressors, anxiety, little things.

831
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,470
They're all gone.

832
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,700
They went away.

833
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,300
I mean, they went, they still come back once in a while, but when they're gone,

834
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:04,620
you can tell it's like, if you're in a room and you think it's silent, then

835
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,100
you turn the lights off and this buzz you didn't even notice goes away.

836
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,500
That's what happened in my head.

837
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,300
And now I can hear when it comes back.

838
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,180
Oh, that's wrong.

839
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,500
Whereas I gotta make that go away and I can make it go away usually pretty

840
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:18,820
quickly.

841
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,910
So I'm trying to stay in this world where, uh, I'm happy.

842
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,830
I'm confident.

843
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,390
I'm clear on what I want to do.

844
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:32,030
And I'm not going to do things that take me away from that, which would be

845
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,990
a company that wants to go from a and stay at a forever.

846
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:41,790
Uh, I am at my most effective when I can be me and push things forward and do

847
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:45,910
all the wild, crazy things I do while creating engaged teams at kick ass.

848
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,270
So that's, that's my plan.

849
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,150
Um, uh, Zen spy incorporated, maybe, I don't know, Zen spy LLC.

850
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,470
I'm not sure what it's going to look like.

851
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,710
But we'll figure it out.

852
00:41:55,950 --> 00:42:00,910
One little networking tip that I'm finding is, um, it's not necessarily your

853
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,390
really deep connections.

854
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,870
Uh, it's very frequently someone that you you've met maybe twice virtually.

855
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:11,470
Um, those are the ones that are usually getting me interviews.

856
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,950
So it's those fresh connections, oddly enough are really valuable.

857
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,040
I'm going to keep an eye on that.

858
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,800
I haven't really leveraged my network enough yet on this job search.

859
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,480
And again, cause it's a weird time.

860
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,840
I'll, I'll, I'll reach out to him.

861
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:32,450
I was, uh, one point I was planning to head down to San Francisco for a bit later

862
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:35,330
this year, I thought I would network a bunch of my old unity colleagues, uh,

863
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,330
who are both there and not there anymore.

864
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:40,770
Uh, not just been pushed out a little bit, but I can still contact them virtually.

865
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:46,690
I have one good thing about unity's massive layoffs is I have former team

866
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,210
members who like me a lot who are spread all over the tech industry.

867
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:56,410
So, uh, I will, I will begin reaching out to them and see what to have them

868
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,450
keep an ear out for me.

869
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,940
Uh, I've done that a little bit already.

870
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:05,390
I'll do some more of that, but, uh, yeah, we'll see what I'm not again, not

871
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:06,430
super worried about it yet.

872
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:08,790
Um, I can even probably leave the yet off there.

873
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,790
I'm not super worried about it.

874
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:14,310
Cause I know that I will find a job eventually and I'm not going to settle

875
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,990
for something like, Oh, here's a job.

876
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,990
I'm not going to go work for.

877
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,890
Oh, meta, for example.

878
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:21,090
Never going to happen.

879
00:43:22,190 --> 00:43:22,870
Never going to happen.

880
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,030
Not a fan.

881
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,520
Uh, I kind of don't want to work at a super big company again.

882
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,000
I think for me, I would love it.

883
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,880
If I could own engineering in a company had like between 200 and 800 or a thousand

884
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,540
engineers, um, I guess my sweet spot for, for culture change and pushing things

885
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,140
along and not being in a cognitive machine, but having the ability to

886
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,420
change culture and drive things.

887
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:52,740
But we'll again, we're going to see what happens.

888
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,820
I'm repeating myself, but I think it sounds exactly like the thing that

889
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,660
everybody's telling like freelancers to do, please put it online, put it on

890
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,980
your service page, what kind of packages do we offer?

891
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,180
What kind of shops do you seek?

892
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,540
Um, just get it, get it online.

893
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,820
Somehow that will probably help maybe of like random people stumbling upon

894
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,260
that, right?

895
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,340
Just by you say the organizations that might need you hate you or whatever.

896
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,620
Um, maybe not the person who are like, who wants to take care and

897
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,420
wants to make quality matter might be looking, might stumble just by

898
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,500
Googling upon sub-stack course or whatever.

899
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:27,780
Right.

900
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:31,780
We need to start a Slack channel called help Alan help spy find a job.

901
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,300
Spy job.

902
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:40,320
You can all give me your tips on cause I'm, uh, you know, the newsletters are

903
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,080
on angry weasel.substack.com.

904
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,280
I still have angry weasel.com, uh, five for Friday, which I did for

905
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,600
like three years straight, maybe four.

906
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,880
Uh, uh, I'm, I think I'm going to be done with those.

907
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,160
Oh, wow.

908
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:56,500
So I don't think so.

909
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,580
I've, I've, I've sort of lost momentum towards the end.

910
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,020
I got, I did him every week, but I got to say it was a highlight of my week

911
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,100
when I showed up in one of them.

912
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,260
Like, oh, now maybe I have to do them again.

913
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,500
I, I am not on the internet that much.

914
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,140
Maybe when I get back to reading, uh, I'm reading, maybe I'm reading

915
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:17,780
books instead of internet things.

916
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:20,100
Maybe when I get back into the swing of things a little more, that,

917
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,940
that'll come back.

918
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,060
But then where the question I was getting to is where do I put this

919
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,220
information on angry weasel.com?

920
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,660
It's not on a separate page.

921
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,220
I put it on the sub stack somewhere.

922
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:35,620
I got to figure, I got to figure out what information I want to share where I

923
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,900
put it and how I get people to find it.

924
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:41,500
So my, my network, and again, this, this is a fresh contact introduced me to one

925
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,260
person who introduced me to somebody they knew who gave me an opportunity

926
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:50,540
with her network to be listed as a service provider among startups.

927
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,740
And I'm looking at this form that I fill out to get on this, this list.

928
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,060
And it asks, what do you do?

929
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,700
And I, well, I do a lot of things.

930
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,340
I don't know what to put there because it's got to sound organized and focused,

931
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,260
but it's tough being a generalist.

932
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:06,780
Damn it.

933
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,980
I think so.

934
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,980
Um, I think I can get pretty specific at what I do.

935
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,220
Uh, and again, maybe starting off at a consultant role or a fractional CTO

936
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,620
fractional VPE is a better path for me.

937
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,500
I haven't, I'm kind of six to one half of those together right now.

938
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,340
I'm my post.

939
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,120
I've always thought I do consulting at some point in my career, whether it's

940
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:38,190
now and then into full time, whether they do full time and do some, I, even

941
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,230
when I stopped working, um, I can't just go to the gym, play pick a ball

942
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,270
every day, I'll get a little bored.

943
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,510
I need to exercise my brain.

944
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:45,630
So let's say I get a job I love.

945
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:46,790
I do it for a couple of years.

946
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,750
Um, and I tend to not just quit jobs.

947
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,110
I can, I, I quit when I'm not needed anymore.

948
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,910
I've worked myself out of almost every job I've been in, except for the last

949
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,630
one where I hiked myself out of it.

950
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,990
And I will probably do that again.

951
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:04,430
I will find myself, um, in a position where I don't need to be there at

952
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:05,790
that point, I'll probably go into consulting.

953
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,910
I'm not, I'm not going to do full time work for a lot longer.

954
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:15,820
Uh, I like it, but I also like traveling and hiking and, uh, playing pick

955
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:17,460
a ball with the, with the retirees.

956
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,180
And, and I guess technically I'd be a retiree, but I don't know.

957
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,860
I'm I'm I'm a, I'll just say I'm a lot younger than the folks I'm

958
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,700
playing pick a ball with.

959
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,620
Yeah.

960
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,820
I look back over this period.

961
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,540
I've been unemployed and thought, man, if I had known out all of that,

962
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,940
all those efforts to find a job wouldn't have succeeded.

963
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,700
I would have traveled and I thought, wait, traveling costs money.

964
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:36,100
Dang it.

965
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,100
It does.

966
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,900
Well, it, it, yeah, it does.

967
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,180
It, it, it, it's not free for sure, but there are cheaper places to travel

968
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,140
and, um, you can, you can make it work.

969
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,500
So yeah, then I'll, I don't know.

970
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:51,900
I'll figure it out.

971
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,220
That was good talking about that though.

972
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,820
And you guys, you know, we'll start some, uh, some slack conversations.

973
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,300
You go to modern testing.org and get a link to our slack group.

974
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,060
One of the three.

975
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:04,260
And if you want to help me, I'll create a channel, help, you know, spy

976
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,340
jobs and you can all give me tips on how to find the job I'm looking for.

977
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,920
But really, I need, I haven't tried that hard yet, so I'm not terribly

978
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,480
worried about it.

979
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,840
I'd hire you as a consultant in an instant.

980
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,240
So, well, I guess that's what I need somebody who actually has, um,

981
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,320
pocketbooks to tell me.

982
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:22,240
Yeah.

983
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,120
You can't leave us today without getting a story.

984
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,360
How much can you afford?

985
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,960
I'll let you know when I get the job and the budget.

986
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,120
So help me get a job too.

987
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,760
Yeah.

988
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,160
But yeah, it's fun though.

989
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:41,800
Alan, you have to tell us, you have to tell us a trail story before you go.

990
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,960
You're, I know you're trying to wrap up.

991
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,160
We have to hear a juicy trail story.

992
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:50,660
Well, which I there's, there's like 10,000.

993
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,860
It's like when people ask, how was the hike?

994
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,620
It was four and a half months and I walked 2,655 miles, not including side trips.

995
00:48:57,620 --> 00:48:58,660
We'll call it 3000.

996
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,460
How was it?

997
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:01,900
Uh, that's not what I'm asking.

998
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,220
How was like 10 minutes of that hike?

999
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,900
That was really exciting.

1000
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:13,470
Um, let me, it's all exciting in its own way.

1001
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,270
So let me just kind of, I'll give you the overview and then listeners.

1002
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,550
If you want to ask, if you want me to dive into any of this, let me know.

1003
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:20,350
This might take a while.

1004
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:26,270
Uh, the Pacific rest trails is, uh, in five sections.

1005
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:27,430
So I'll go one by one.

1006
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:33,420
The desert starts at the Mexican border goes up to, uh, roughly where

1007
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,300
the Sierra began in California.

1008
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,220
So South of just South of the Bay area.

1009
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,740
Uh, blew my mind how beautiful the sunsets were.

1010
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,780
I had never seen a desert sunset before.

1011
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,100
I never say I don't think I've seen a cactus bloom before.

1012
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:49,260
So I spent, you know, a solid month and a half walking through the desert.

1013
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:51,750
Just, I thought I would hate it.

1014
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:52,430
It was beautiful.

1015
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:53,230
It was incredible.

1016
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,710
A great way to not, not huge Hill thought it was great.

1017
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,530
Uh, hit the Sierra on may 31st.

1018
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,970
Um, and still a lot of snow, a lot of snow.

1019
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,920
Uh, I did probably some, some of my dumbest hiking.

1020
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,560
I was hiking by myself through the, there's people around.

1021
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,220
I didn't hike with people and probably the dumbest thing I did.

1022
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:21,740
And this is, I wrote about this in one of my recent newsletters is I decided

1023
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,620
I was going to go say down this Hill, which ended up being solid ice.

1024
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,900
It was a dumb, dumb choice.

1025
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:28,340
Um, somebody broke their leg there the day before.

1026
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:31,420
I didn't know that, uh, I managed to, I know what I'm doing.

1027
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:32,340
Instincts took over.

1028
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:33,060
I bailed out.

1029
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,060
I was fine.

1030
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,980
Uh, but I spent the rest of the day thinking about how

1031
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:38,420
stupid I was to even try that.

1032
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:44,140
So, you know, a week later I am walking across this waste, deep rapids

1033
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:46,540
by myself also, also stupid.

1034
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,900
But, um, I had one choice.

1035
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:53,340
One is to either keep going and make it across, which was choice

1036
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:56,060
a or choice B, which was die.

1037
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:01,700
So I chose a, which was good, but you know, probably having a spotter there to call.

1038
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,460
I'm not sure what the spotter would have done because I'd

1039
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,820
have been washed down the river.

1040
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,660
They could have called the SOS and got me dragged out downstream.

1041
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:09,980
I don't know.

1042
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:17,820
Um, but overall fun, a lot of, uh, I mean, incredible beauty, but walking in snow

1043
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:22,740
every day, almost all day for a month was a little, little tiring after a while.

1044
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:26,060
You get, you get to the Sierra and you go, Oh my God, the waterfalls are so

1045
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:26,460
beautiful.

1046
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,660
The mountain lakes are so great.

1047
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,300
Three weeks later you go, Oh great.

1048
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:31,180
Another lake, another waterfall, more snow.

1049
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:38,510
Uh, Northern California starts around, um, Tahoe up to the Oregon border.

1050
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:44,060
Uh, the worst maintained part of trailer hiking over, it was hot.

1051
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:47,740
It was ashy from, from major forest fires there in the past.

1052
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:55,140
And, uh, that's where I, that's where Zen Spy was born because I got so deep

1053
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,580
into my head, did not think about how miserable the trail was that like,

1054
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,900
all I solved every single problem.

1055
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,460
I didn't even know I had yet in my head.

1056
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:07,820
Um, and then I got to Oregon, took a bunch of days off in Ashland to see some plays.

1057
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:12,020
Uh, and then started trekking through Oregon.

1058
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,860
I smashed my ankle on my first day out of Ashland.

1059
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:20,300
So about 15 miles into Oregon, a long story, a rock flipped up and bashed

1060
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,860
my ankle, it's still not right yet.

1061
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:24,700
Uh, I woke up the next morning, ankle was swollen.

1062
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,100
So I did what any through Hiker does.

1063
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,780
I only walked 15 miles that day.

1064
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:30,630
Elevated my leg.

1065
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,430
I woke up next morning, it was a little better.

1066
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:35,070
So I only walked 15 miles again.

1067
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,470
And then, uh, it kept on getting a little bit.

1068
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:39,510
I did 22 the next day.

1069
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:44,350
I ended up doing my biggest day at all in Oregon hike 33 miles, uh, one day, but

1070
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:48,870
basically went across Oregon in about 20 days, Oregon's a little flatter,

1071
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,070
cruised across my ankle healed as I walked on it.

1072
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,430
Uh, it's still not healed.

1073
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,590
I had it looked at once said, come back.

1074
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,430
It doesn't get better if you're not walking on it so much.

1075
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,310
I had to go back because even today, just, I went for a little run.

1076
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:01,150
It's like, it's tweaked.

1077
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,390
It's screwed up, but Oregon was a blast.

1078
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:12,050
Um, uh, met, um, ended up, uh, met another Hiker and Crater Lake who ended up, we

1079
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,690
ended up hiking in the last whole last 800 miles of the trail together.

1080
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:16,770
Incredible persons, still good friends today.

1081
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:22,630
Uh, hit Washington and it's like, Oh my God, I'm home, but it's so far.

1082
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,590
Washington is so much harder than Oregon.

1083
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,470
The ups and downs are so much.

1084
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:34,540
Uh, but cruise along, uh, my son who we called spike it, uh, is 21 years old,

1085
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:38,940
hiked from so quality past to Stevens, past with us, just 70 miles stretch,

1086
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:42,060
but more up and down per miles than anywhere else on the trail.

1087
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:45,220
I think he was a little beat up, uh, a little, a little complaining towards

1088
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,020
the end, but he made it through, pushed him pretty hard and then, uh,

1089
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,280
pushed all the way to the border.

1090
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,920
And it was a little, that was a little surreal getting to the finishing.

1091
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:00,020
Cause you're just walking every day and all of a sudden you're done, but you're

1092
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,820
not totally done because you have to turn around and walk 30 miles backward to get

1093
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:07,020
home because you can't walk into Canada anymore because stuff.

1094
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:11,850
And then it didn't really sit in that I was done.

1095
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,610
Um, it's hard to handle.

1096
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:15,650
It is.

1097
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:19,730
And I'll tell you coming back was there is a real thing called post trail

1098
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:24,570
depression, which, um, still comes and goes, but the first week back was

1099
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:25,210
overwhelming.

1100
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:28,170
I went four and a half months where everything I needed to live fit in a

1101
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:33,020
backpack, a small backpack, even if I stayed in a hotel for the night, all my

1102
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,540
stuff still fit into a backpack.

1103
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:39,190
And then I come home and there's just all this stuff everywhere.

1104
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:43,520
And I didn't know what to do with it.

1105
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,640
I get, I purged a lot of it.

1106
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,120
I have more to get rid of.

1107
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:50,920
I can't handle having stuff.

1108
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,290
Like even I have like lots of books on testing and leadership and

1109
00:54:56,290 --> 00:54:58,970
software development, most of them on leadership.

1110
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:01,010
I don't want them anymore.

1111
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:08,810
Um, I'm like, I, I going to, I, if I knew someone locally who wanted the books,

1112
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,450
I just like, if anybody's in the Seattle area, you want a bunch of books on

1113
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,970
leadership, let me know.

1114
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:14,050
I'll give them all to you.

1115
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:15,530
I'm a sucker for books.

1116
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,210
That's the hardest thing for me to get rid of.

1117
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,010
As you can see, I don't want them.

1118
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,410
I don't want things.

1119
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,210
I don't want my things anymore.

1120
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:24,970
I got a lot of my clothes don't fit anymore because I lost about

1121
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,130
25 pounds on the trail.

1122
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,810
It's like, but I didn't like him anymore.

1123
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,170
I got rid of a bunch of my clothes.

1124
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:32,410
I got rid of a bunch of, um, just stuff.

1125
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:36,530
I continue to purge every day, either throwing stuff away or like I have

1126
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,450
no desire at all to have collection.

1127
00:55:38,490 --> 00:55:41,210
I don't have any big collections, but I just don't want things.

1128
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:46,740
So that's, that's a little, uh, one thing that really hit home.

1129
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:50,380
And, um, even some, you hear this a lot of times in self-help or

1130
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:54,630
retirement books is you want to have experiences, not things.

1131
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:57,750
And that's become like super true for me since I've been back.

1132
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:00,190
I don't, I don't give a crap about things.

1133
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:02,510
I want to have experiences.

1134
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:08,150
Like I got a note from the, uh, or a friend of mine from trail sent me a note

1135
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:12,150
saying I can get a completion certificate for the PCT and I made a digital one.

1136
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:12,870
I'm printed as a thing.

1137
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,470
You guys can see it looks like that.

1138
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,270
So, but I'll probably just put this in a look at this, put it in the recycle

1139
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,030
bin, cause I don't want it.

1140
00:56:19,070 --> 00:56:20,710
I had the experience of hacking the PCT.

1141
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,570
My internet's a little freaky.

1142
00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:25,290
It'll work out fine.

1143
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:27,090
I had the experience of liking the PCT.

1144
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:29,450
I don't need a thing about it.

1145
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:38,940
Uh, I want to spend my money on travel and, uh, classes or things I can learn and do.

1146
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:45,480
I really don't want to buy cars or books or, I mean, I'll read books on my Kindle.

1147
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,200
Um, they're small, but I don't, yeah, I think it's probably pretty common, but

1148
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:54,040
it's, it's weird, it's weird being back, but I'm back now and, um, I will

1149
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:03,510
probably do some, uh, more hiking, um, this summer and I'm going to assume

1150
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:08,630
the recording will work fine here, but my guests are frozen because my network

1151
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,190
has puked for some reason.

1152
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,590
I hear you, but your video's not moving.

1153
00:57:12,590 --> 00:57:13,990
So I will keep talking.

1154
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:14,390
Yeah.

1155
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,310
And cause I like to say goodbye to them before we end up here.

1156
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:18,350
You don't hear me.

1157
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:19,110
What's going on?

1158
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:21,060
Danny Andreas.

1159
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,700
If you can ever hear me, please say something.

1160
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,220
Do you know how to sing the closing riff or maybe he recorded it on his

1161
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,020
no, I don't, but, uh, yeah,

1162
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:34,180
you can still hear me.

1163
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,700
They're telling me they can still hear me.

1164
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:36,540
Yes.

1165
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,540
So, uh, I don't know what's going on and why they're broken.

1166
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,340
I'm afraid to refresh my page.

1167
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,020
So, oh, that's weird.

1168
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,980
Danny can hear things.

1169
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:46,620
Oh, you know what?

1170
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,220
Um, off I've actually do a little bit of editing.

1171
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:53,140
If you can hear yourselves, that means you will, your recordings will upload.

1172
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:57,700
So pretend that I can hear you and we can wrap up here.

1173
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,340
So, uh, Dan, I, I, I can't ask an open ended question.

1174
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,500
So I won't know when you're done.

1175
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,420
So I would like to thank both Danny and, uh, Andreas, uh, global, global

1176
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:10,620
warming, um, global verming global warming.

1177
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,980
Well, it depends on the German accent.

1178
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,140
I want to thank you both for, for being here.

1179
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,580
Um, so, uh, let me start with you, Andreas.

1180
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:20,940
Uh, any, any final words?

1181
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,770
It was much fun seeing you and, and having a chance to get another episode out.

1182
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:27,250
Love that.

1183
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:31,520
All right.

1184
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,320
And how about you, Danny?

1185
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,040
Thank you for that.

1186
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,510
Oh, this was a thrill.

1187
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,710
I've been trying to get on the podcast for a long time.

1188
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,590
Not very hard, but finally I tried.

1189
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:43,910
And, um, uh, one thing I'll leave you with, if you go to my blog,

1190
00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,990
swalchemist.blog, you will actually find, if you scroll long enough,

1191
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,030
a picture of a cactus bloom.

1192
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,670
So, um, there's that, but you have to do a lot of scrolling to find it.

1193
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:55,830
So thanks everybody really enjoyed it.

1194
00:58:56,730 --> 00:58:57,130
All right.

1195
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:01,130
This has been episode two 20 of the AB testing show.

1196
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:06,130
Uh, I am going to chef, seven, the outro post-prob because

1197
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:07,770
career sides still screwing up on my side.

1198
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:08,610
Darn it.

1199
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,090
I'll have to do some more editing, but thank you both.

1200
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:13,050
Uh, we'll see you next time on AB testing.
