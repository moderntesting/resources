00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,910
The Modern Testing Podcast. Join your hosts, Alan and Brent.

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,900
I am Mindless Agile Robot. I must iterate.

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,740
As we talk about software engineering, software quality, leadership, and whatever else comes

4
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,010
to mind. Now, on with the show.

5
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,010
Hello everyone.

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:34,010
Howdy.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,250
We're back for another episode of AB Testing.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,250
We are.

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,630
I guess if you're listening, you probably figured that out already. I never thought

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,100
about that.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,300
I think Lisa Crispin namedrop even mentioned in one of her tweets, like, the stuff at the

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,620
beginning can be kind of interesting, but you can just skip past that.

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,980
Oh, yeah.

14
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:07,810
Yeah, it's generally a good idea. This is where we catch up. So, how you been, Brent?

15
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:17,190
Great. You know, one of the first sort of informal reviews of the podcast was the podcast

16
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:21,510
is different. It's like two guys babbling about crap over beers.

17
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:22,510
Yeah.

18
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,550
I still think that's part of the charm.

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:31,500
It well, you can call it charm. You can call it charm. I have been...

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Mystique?

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,820
Yeah, I don't know. Mystique? The X-Men Mystique?

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,910
Yeah, it's not part of the X-Men.

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,630
All right, cool.

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:46,550
So I got back from PNSQC last week, went down for a couple of days, had a really

25
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:53,310
good time, gave a talk on... Oh, I didn't tell you this. I didn't tell you this. I

26
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,550
gave my talk on modern testing.

27
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,190
You didn't tell me that.

28
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:05,180
I'm getting to the part I haven't told you. Just shut the up. It was a 90-minute talk.

29
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,260
I timed it very well, went deeper into the principles, and ended with about 10 or 15

30
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,140
minutes early, took a bunch of questions, had a pretty good-sized crowd. I was an

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,300
invited speaker, not a keynote speaker, so I didn't have the captive audience of

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:26,480
everyone there, which was actually kind of good because I wasn't able to alienate

33
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
people who might have been in a different world. So anyway, I'm giving this talk,

34
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,680
and I was really excited. After my talk, there was lunch, and during lunch, Ward

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:41,080
Cunningham, who was local to Portland, was there just telling stories about

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,480
stuff he did. It was really cool. So I finished my talk. I'm wrapping up. There's,

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,000
of course, the people hanging out afterwards. I sit down in the auditorium.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,160
There's a little break there. I do about five minutes of work. I pack up my stuff,

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,680
and I walk out. A little bit of rockstar, I walk out, and I see,

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,880
oh, there's Ward Cunningham talking to some people. Cool. I can't wait to hear

41
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,620
what he has to say. Then I walk him by, and he goes, hey, hey, good talk.

42
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,220
You didn't tell me that.

43
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,100
I didn't tell you that?

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,140
You did.

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,780
Wait.

46
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,820
It was on Slack.

47
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,220
Did I?

48
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,620
Yeah.

49
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,220
But still cool. That's awesome.

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,780
Whatever. Whatever. My little fanboy moment.

51
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,700
So anyway, I got back. I'm heading off to Copenhagen and Helsinki next week for

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,900
work. I haven't been on a work trip in a while, so I'm going to do those when I

53
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,620
travel now instead of going to conferences. That's my thing.

54
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,740
It's fun.

55
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:40,410
Going to do my job, and that's about it. I think. Anything big going on with

56
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,930
you? We may be able to dive in and freak people out and dive into the actual

57
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,850
podcast before too long.

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,970
Oh, I think we should. No, the thing I think is interesting.

59
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:49,690
Or not.

60
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:58,140
The thing I think is interesting. So before the conference, Alan up on the Slack channel

61
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:07,030
expressed something I hadn't seen from him before on any, like you've gone,

62
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:14,260
since we started MT, I think you've done five, six different sort of public events.

63
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,060
No. Well, probably. But they haven't all been about modern testing.

64
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:25,910
No, but this is the only one where I saw before your talk you expressed huge nervousness.

65
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:33,430
So it wasn't nervousness about the presentation. I was definitely skeptical about the audience.

66
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,630
And that'll actually bleed over into our topics for today. There was very much a.

67
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,630
See how I did the clever segue there.

68
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,150
I don't know if it was clever, but sure.

69
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,070
Yeah, sure. I'm calling clever.

70
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,830
All right. You call it whatever you want. I was a little worried about the audience.

71
00:04:51,350 --> 00:05:00,760
One, there was a vibe of hardcore testing, test automation, test design and techniques.

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,390
And we're modern testing isn't so much about testing as it is about quality and building

73
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,510
quality in and doing the right thing for the customer.

74
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:11,830
Yeah.

75
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:20,710
So it's a different take. And I wasn't sure. One, I wasn't sure how receptive the audience would be.

76
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,390
And then two, given the topic and what people have heard about it,

77
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,030
I wasn't sure anyone should would show up.

78
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,810
What people showed up.

79
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,610
I was actually worried they wouldn't. And one of the things that I do when I talk is I play the

80
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,650
room pretty well. I crack some jokes, find some people. It's as we mentioned last time,

81
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:46,250
giving a presentation, it's entertainment. I need to be entertained. I need to be entertaining.

82
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,650
It's hard to be entertaining for a small group. It's a different kind of thing.

83
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:57,130
I can do it if it's very interactive. But when you're on the big stage in the auditorium and

84
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,890
there's bright light shining on you, it's difficult to be interactive. So I was worried

85
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:07,290
mostly that no one would show up. And if I did, I would get people just saying,

86
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,160
what the hell? Or giving me what the hell faces all the way through.

87
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,020
Fortunately, I didn't get that.

88
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,420
Yeah, it's interesting. I have not been in that situation that you're referring to.

89
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,940
Generally, when I'm presenting and the room is smaller than expected,

90
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,340
I just convert it to an interaction. Damn, the rules. I don't care.

91
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,620
Yeah. Well, I had a pretty good sized crowd, so it was okay. And everything went well. I had a good

92
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,300
time. I got lots of good feedback. I haven't seen like any scores. I never really look at those

93
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:49,080
anyway, because one, any feedback on the content, I'm not going to give that presentation probably

94
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,280
ever again. I may do it for an online conference sometimes. I guess maybe I would look at the

95
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,400
feedback. And I know what my flaws are as a presenter, so I'll continue to work on those.

96
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:09,510
Yeah. No, the feedback for me is always interesting because I can often get a glimpse into a key

97
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:19,110
unaddressed point. People just have a hard time seeing their own faults. It's a lot easier to

98
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,670
sort of see the faults than others. And so that sort of feedback, so you can get myopic into your

99
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,790
presentation. Think that you've told a complete story, but a lot of times the feedback will tell

100
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:36,630
you, oh crap. Yeah, I totally don't talk about that. And one of the things just before we go

101
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:43,510
on here, we thought we were going to go right to the topics, the content. I do think a lot about

102
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:49,080
the story when I give presentations. Like what is the story I'm telling you? What's the journey

103
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,200
I want to take you on? What are the subplots? It's very much storytelling.

104
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,200
So anyway, that aside, I'm going to take a break from presentations for a while, although I am

105
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,420
doing sort of a little mini workshop with my team. And this may be worth it in the modern

106
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:12,060
testing context to go into because this will come out Monday for the masses over the weekend

107
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:17,100
for the people on the Slack channel, but well before anyone on my team will listen to it. And

108
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,740
they know this, but we're going to talk deeply about it. I'm meeting with my air quote leads

109
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,980
next week, but actually only one of them still works for me because in my quest of moving the

110
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:36,200
organization towards modern testing, I'm moving more and more people away from my org. I still

111
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,300
work with these people. I advise them. I coach them. Some are in different roles, but still

112
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:49,100
part of my quality community. And we're going to have some pretty in depth discussions about what,

113
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,240
what is our community, our community of former people that used to work for me.

114
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,840
How do we continue to interact? How do we continue that support and help with each

115
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,880
and helping each of each other that we had when we were part of a team

116
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,880
when we're now part of six different teams. Hey, as a, as a complete,

117
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,640
completely irrelevant non sequitur. Wait, those never happen on AB testing.

118
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,720
Completely entirely non sequitur. You need a theme music for that. Go ahead.

119
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,720
When is your 18 month point at unity? Already gone.

120
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,500
Thank you. We can carry on. Brent's still convinced I changed jobs every 18 months.

121
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:36,500
All is well. There is no, no exit plan on the horizon. But my role, one thing is, you know,

122
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,420
Microsoft, the reason I last lasted there so long was I could change roles all the time.

123
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,710
You can already tell from my previous conversation, my role is changing.

124
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:52,230
Yep. My role is moving from a director of quality to something else. Well, actually,

125
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,910
we figured out it was, it was a community leader early on, but it'll probably be something else

126
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,410
fairly soon. Are you going to change your title?

127
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,170
I don't care. I don't even know what my title is. I guess it's director of something, but

128
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,820
I don't know. That part doesn't matter. One of the things I need to do is my role needs

129
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,690
to change and not because I need to do something else is because I actually enjoy

130
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:21,460
constantly working myself out of a role. I like building self-sustaining teams

131
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,620
and self-sustaining communities. You know, there's a theme that we've been talking about

132
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:35,270
and it's, and it's, it's hit me a lot this week. Hitting a lot of, so one of the,

133
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,830
one of the big problems a lot, particularly at Microsoft, you have a lot of people who've

134
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:49,350
been here a long time and have, particularly with sort of the, the, the, the test change

135
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:59,060
and the move towards unified engineering. You end up seeing a new sort of power culture

136
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:07,560
and you'll, you'll often see things like you go to a particular org and you can tell right away

137
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:15,660
it's PM driven, right? It's PM driven orgs are almost singularly focused on the customer.

138
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:22,540
They're all about features. You can never get any sort of architectural, aren't necessarily the same.

139
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,420
No, but you can never in this particular thing, you can never get an architectural improvement or

140
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,220
a hardening sort of task on the backlog until it becomes a crisis.

141
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:42,380
Yes. Right. Yes. Yes. Yes. And then, but the other one is more of a dev org. When stereotype I'll say

142
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:50,140
is, is a lot of times you see the dev driven orgs focused on technical solutions to problems

143
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:57,290
and then struggle with it. Then they go back and say, they try another technical and another one

144
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:02,490
and another one and another one. And, um, um, lately I've been doing a lot of face palming

145
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:09,030
because I'm like, this is a human problem. Oh, it's always a people problem. This is

146
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:17,110
absolutely a human problem. Now I'm thinking I firmly believe that's true, but a lot of the

147
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:26,470
times I go back and they think through, is that, is it because of my training now where I'm focused

148
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:36,060
on things like behavioral economics, which is all about, um, how do you move? How do you

149
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:45,540
create win-win situations and move people towards a situation that benefits them and your business?

150
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:53,530
Anyway, it, it is fascinating to me. Uh, one day when I have free time, which is probably not

151
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,850
going to be any time in the near future. I want to do some research on that one.

152
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,330
One thing I'm realizing farther into my tenure at unity is how much,

153
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,620
how easy it is to ignore the fact that most problems are people problems. I'm actually

154
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:17,260
looking part of my, the, the evolvement of my role. I'm exploring. I've always been pretty good

155
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,460
about figuring out what work I need to do, but part of that is, uh, some leadership coaching and

156
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,900
just, and training and management coaching and I shouldn't say training management, coaching and

157
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,820
mentoring and helping people get through, uh, some of these people problems to find better ways

158
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:44,170
to make software. Sliding back just a little bit to my fear at PNSQC of the people focus on testing.

159
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:52,250
And the weird thing is that modern testing principles are neither particularly modern nor

160
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,170
are they about testing contextually. It's important to remember, and I have to describe

161
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:04,170
this as they're getting more widely shared is that they grew out of the, I call them the antidote

162
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,820
for traditional testing, tradition test, last test quality and testers at the last line of defense.

163
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:19,640
Originally, uh, I think the original edition of Caner's books said the role of testing is to find

164
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:25,400
bugs. He later redacted that and changed that to provide information, uh, which is sort of passive

165
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,960
and finding bugs. Isn't right either. Whitaker wrote the how to break software.

166
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,320
And then others after that, I'm not sure where they started said, we don't break software. We

167
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,200
just remove the illusions and, and it's already broken when we get it. And we've heard all those

168
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,520
lines before, but that is not at all where I want to focus. And it's not at all what modern

169
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:54,920
testing is about. Modern testing is about how do we make software in a way different, maybe

170
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,240
completely, not completely different, but much differently than the way you and I made it 15,

171
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:06,200
20 years ago in a way that gets quality software to our customers quicker. And that's what modern

172
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,320
testing principles are about. And someone on Twitter suggested, maybe call them modern quality

173
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,920
culture principles and no, keep the name as it is. And if it doesn't make sense to you,

174
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,160
and there was a user group that I think we mentioned a podcast or two ago who recognized

175
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,320
the exact same thing. Well, these are neither modern nor testing. They don't mention risk.

176
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,280
Or principles. That was another one that we were, we were accused of.

177
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:34,680
No, they're absolutely principles. But I will, I will stand by that because I,

178
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,520
one of the reasons, one of the impetus for me creating these was one studying a lot of

179
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,600
thinking, one just thinking we should have principles. But I also happen to be rereading

180
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,070
Ray Dalio's principles at the same time and studying definition of principle, because

181
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,030
sometimes people screw up principles with beliefs and needs and things,

182
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,790
but they're absolutely principles. So screw that.

183
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,590
So one of the things, but I will say that neither modern nor testing,

184
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,510
I agree with that completely, but that's not the point.

185
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:08,950
It actually, it's not the point. And multiple times people have suggested that we rename them.

186
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:15,110
We will not. The primary reason in my mind why we should not rename them,

187
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,830
as you call out, the antidote to traditional testing.

188
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:27,380
But there's a reason why we call it modern testing. And then essentially, if you,

189
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,380
if you follow the principles, you realize very little testing is involvement. Matter of fact,

190
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,940
one of the things, if you follow the principles correctly, we're saying there is this long-term

191
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,130
battle that test has been fighting around how to move quality upstream. They call it,

192
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:51,690
it's really how to move testing upstream and modern testing is essentially saying,

193
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:58,550
no, that is no longer sort of a nor star do it. Testing belongs to dev. Make that happen.

194
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,970
But why do we call it modern testing? Why is it not modern development? Because number one,

195
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:11,370
it's called modern because we want it to distinguish itself from the old methods.

196
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:18,420
Maybe there'll be one day a post-modern testing principles. I don't know that I'll be part of

197
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:24,150
developing that, but it could happen. Why is it called testing? Because that's the audience we're

198
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:30,790
trying to reach. We're trying to, we're not trying to influence the dev teams and say, hey,

199
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,560
you should be doing this. The people we're trying to reach are the ones who we think are

200
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:49,080
going to be impacted by this cultural change going globally. We want them to realize that

201
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:58,700
there are more options than just panic and show up at the unemployment line. And we want them to

202
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,100
start thinking through how to do that shift. You can't do this shift overnight.

203
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,500
Absolutely. That's, in my view, why the name is right and why the name will stick.

204
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:17,860
Agreed. We've gone through the principles before. And of course, there's people question them,

205
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:23,210
often out of context and often, I don't know if that's even fair, but recently,

206
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,730
a Twitter discussion around principle number five. And if you haven't memorized the numbers,

207
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:36,140
I'm getting used to this one though. This is the one, the first one where people go,

208
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,620
uh-huh, what? I want to talk about what it means a little bit again, not the deep dive.

209
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,860
We did a few episodes ago. Drill down.

210
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,940
The drill down. Sorry. Whatever. God,

211
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,300
give me your Microsoft terms. Anyway, number five is, we believe that the customer is the only one

212
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:56,780
capable to judge and evaluate the quality of our product. And this is pretty much not quite word

213
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,950
for word, but this is out of the lean startup. You don't get value from your engineering effort

214
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,990
until it's in the hands of your customers. That is a quote from the lean startup.

215
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,370
Yes. That's a direct quote, but I don't think it's just out of lean startup, right?

216
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,770
I'm just pointing out the fact that we are not-

217
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,740
Jerry Weinberg says the same thing. Actually, Whitaker said the same thing. All that testing

218
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,820
is getting, one of his most popular, but all that testing is getting in the way of quality.

219
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,580
So let me talk about the way this is misinterpreted and the way it's been misinterpreted

220
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,860
for at least 10 years. I think it's been 10 years since Whitaker gave that talk,

221
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:43,900
but at least 10 years. Some testers, and this is okay, you'll grow, still feel like the gatekeeper,

222
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,900
the salvation for customer, the ones that are there to find all the bugs for the customer does,

223
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,220
regardless of the fact whether those bugs are important or not to the customer.

224
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,570
There's been a fear ever since someone 15 years ago, at least 10 years ago,

225
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,010
because it's mentioned in the book, it's now 10 years old, this fear of testing in production.

226
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:13,540
Oh, you don't give a shit about your customers. Why do you want the customers to find all of your bugs?

227
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:23,510
And it's like, not quite the point. And one, bugs do not equal quality.

228
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:31,450
Absence of bugs does not mean high quality. Prevalence of bugs doesn't necessarily mean

229
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,970
low quality. Quality is value to the customer.

230
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:41,210
Oh, Popendike, that was the other one. My favorite quote was from Tom Popendike.

231
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:50,220
Software developers need to remember no customer ever wanted software. They want their problem solved.

232
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,860
Right. So the way we... I don't want to get into the data principle, so let's leave the data

233
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:04,010
principle out of this. If you build software and you test the crap out of it, in fact,

234
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:06,810
I can't remember who did this quote, I'll just throw out random paraphrase quotes.

235
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,210
Someone said, maybe I think it was Eric Ries actually, said,

236
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,050
show me software that ship with no bugs and I'll show you software that ship too late.

237
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:24,310
Yes. Because the point, anyway, the point is of this principle is not that you're expecting

238
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:30,060
the customers to find all your bugs, but you can use techniques to let them find some of the bugs,

239
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,620
but in most cases, they may not even know. It's not like you're not doing any testing.

240
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,340
There's plenty of testing happening earlier, but the point of this principle is you have to get

241
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:45,340
that software into customers' hands so they can get feedback on the actual value of the software.

242
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,260
In fact, if you're following the rest of the principles, you're at high quality enough

243
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:55,500
every day, every hour, you can ship to them as often as is feasible for their tolerance

244
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,820
of taking new software, which is for a service 50 times a day, for a mobile app, maybe a couple

245
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,860
times a week, for a desktop app, maybe a little less. But you need to get that feedback from them.

246
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,940
It's not that you want to give them your buggy software to find the bugs. And I find that

247
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:18,040
interpretation of this principle, that this principle is about giving customers buggy software

248
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:26,900
they can find your bugs, irresponsible, ludicrous, it's completely without context or critical

249
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,420
thinking. It doesn't make any sense to me how this principle is interpreted that way.

250
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:41,990
Are you really thinking I'm going to do that? No, so I'm going to go a different way.

251
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:48,680
There's two things I want to make on this. Number one, I got called out in that Twitter feed as well.

252
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,190
And as you will have noticed, I did not contribute to the feed.

253
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,560
As you will have noticed, I saved my rant for this podcast.

254
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:09,110
But no, I'm not judging you. I want to explain why I didn't. Because I've realized,

255
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:16,310
I realize actually in between our last two, between the last podcast and now, this is a

256
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:26,490
recent realization. Those who bit flip MT because of an interpretation of one principle,

257
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:36,790
are not our audience. No, and it because I'm fine with that. So to me, it's I looked at that feed

258
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:44,250
and I'm like, okay, this is not a person who's ready to hear this content. But then I sat back

259
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:51,610
and I realized one of the things that we we talk about is the necessity of systems thinking.

260
00:23:52,460 --> 00:24:05,350
And this to me was a sign of a person standing on a soapbox on a principle that quite honestly,

261
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:13,670
15 years ago, I defended as well. I went maybe even longer ago. But like, I remember when when

262
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:20,470
agile first came out and started running through Microsoft, and I'm like, you want to do what now?

263
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:32,540
What the hell? So I get that. But it took me time to figure out the wholeness of all the

264
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:38,060
changes being proposed. You can't just take one thing on. Because when you look at actually one

265
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,660
number one principle and lean, or not the number one, but one of the key principle and lean,

266
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:52,070
is you optimize the whole, not sub optimized because sub optimization creates dysfunction.

267
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:57,670
How many times have you been on a been on a team where where Dev celebrated? Hey,

268
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:04,550
we brought in Dev or code complete by two weeks and everyone passed themselves on the back and

269
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:10,710
it's all awesome. And then they wonder why the test schedule shipped slipped three months.

270
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:19,210
It's because it was a sub optimization. So the next story, this actually goes back to,

271
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:27,140
I think I may have told this on the podcast before, but one of the things that I first observed from

272
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:36,630
Google and then implemented myself. Right? So number one, principle does number five doesn't

273
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:50,330
actually say anything about testing. It says nothing about testing. What it says is testers,

274
00:25:51,050 --> 00:26:01,100
you are not the champion of customer quality. The customer is, and your path forward is going to be

275
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:10,860
far better and far more accurate. The second you take that facade off and start trying to figure

276
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:17,340
out what actually is the customer's definition of quality for whatever context you're working on.

277
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:22,870
Mm-hmm. One of the things I observed with Google, like back in the day when it came out,

278
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:30,600
it was shipping bugs all of the time. And at the same time, stealing market share from all

279
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:36,620
of its competitors. Okay. If bugs were that important, someone explain that to me.

280
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,520
I can't explain that to you. Okay. In a narrow view of quality where quality is bugs,

281
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,070
then, but that's, I can't, I can no longer fathom that.

282
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:59,860
Okay. I will tell you what actually is happening. You can sort of think of a benefit to pain ratio.

283
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:07,700
Okay. So bugs have, some, every bug you ship has some percent of pain it's going to cause the

284
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:13,540
customer, but some percent of benefit it calls the customer. Yes. Right? Because you're shipping

285
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:21,940
some new value. Sure it has bugs, but if that value exceeds the price of the pain, ship it.

286
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:29,740
Yes. Because our goal is to solve problems for the customers. Now, why do we put in,

287
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,780
I don't know what principle it is. Why did we put in the, essentially the continuous,

288
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,060
Improvement principle. Yeah. The continuous improvement principle.

289
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:46,250
Because that ratio changes or how preventative you need to be

290
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:58,260
changes based on your ability to react to indication of pain. Meaning if I can ship small

291
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:06,310
things continuously and I have the right monitors in place, when I see that I ship something small

292
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:14,180
and it's causing a lot of pain, typically I can revert it near real time. The old days,

293
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:22,780
you couldn't do that. This is where this, the strong, we must validate everything beforehand.

294
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:28,780
Why? Because it was extremely costly, not only in dollars, but in time to get it right.

295
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:39,240
What, one of the important lessons that Google taught me is no, if you have the right monitors in place,

296
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:48,360
you see an indication of pain, you can ship a new release. And actually that ends up being a

297
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,120
better experience, a better quality experience. Because the customer, every time they come back,

298
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,620
they get this overall impression. Every time I use it, it's getting better.

299
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:13,750
Good point. I'm going to move on because we did a drill down slash recap anyway. So yeah. So all the

300
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:20,470
principles are open for interpretation, but it's also with the lack of the whole picture,

301
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:25,510
easy to forget what we're going after. So the short thing for me, like if I,

302
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:31,190
I'm not going to contribute to, to these threads where it's somebody who's taking me to task on

303
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:39,820
one single principle. My experience has shown is that they're far from ready to have the discussion

304
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:45,180
of how the principles all fit together. And in your particular feed, actually the individual

305
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:52,710
that you were talking to specifically called out that they refuse to, to dive in deeper to

306
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:58,390
understand. And I'm like, okay. I quote craft all over the verification aspect of software

307
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:06,340
quality by writing nonsense in number five. Yeah. So I want to move on. I didn't mean to deep dive

308
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,500
there, but I think it's important because that one has come up before in it's a, it's a shift

309
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,340
from the old school of testing and speaking of shifts on the old school of testing.

310
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:23,220
I watched a webinar from James Bach. Actually, before we do that, one, I'm going to,

311
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:27,620
we'll come back to that very shortly, but it's interesting talking about people who aren't ready

312
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:32,180
or may not be the right audience. And also that modern testing principles going back to our first

313
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:38,180
topic are neither particularly modern nor testing, but it is aptly named given the car context.

314
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:42,740
Yes. Someone very new to Twitter. I looked up, they had like 10 tweets or something popped up on

315
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:47,700
Twitter just to loop in Michael Bolton and James Bach and say, Hey, what do you think of the

316
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:54,660
AB testing principles? Just trying to cite a debate that did not need to happen. Luckily,

317
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,380
I immediately replied and said, they're neither modern nor testing. So see what you will.

318
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,300
It stopped there, which is good. Cause I didn't really, they live in a different world. And I,

319
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,030
as an example of that, can we talk about that briefly? Like, yeah, I'm not at all certain

320
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:17,110
what a point of a debate would be. No, cause cause it is context sensitive. It is, it is.

321
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:22,940
I think that cause they like to watch Bach and Bolton shit all over people.

322
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:33,210
It is entertaining, but on the debate side, like a debate implies that there's a winner.

323
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,670
No, it doesn't. No, I don't think so. To me, that's how I interpreted it. No, I don't,

324
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:43,350
I don't think so. I don't think so. When we see a political debate,

325
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:47,750
both sides may see their candidate as the winner. They gotta make their points.

326
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,660
But anyway, it's not, it's not worth the effort. So anyway, moving on. Finally,

327
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,960
I watched a webinar from Bach talking about his, he does not like the test automation pyramid as

328
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:05,960
described by cone. Again, I have a lot of respect for Bach. I don't always agree with him,

329
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,720
but he can usually make a pretty good argument. I didn't think his arguments were that good. So

330
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,480
I'll go over the main points and I'm not doing this to mock him at all. First of all,

331
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,980
it's not a test automation pyramid. It's a test automation triangle. Okay. I'm good with that.

332
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:26,550
All models are wrong. Some are useful. It's not pyramids, three dimensional.

333
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:33,110
So it's not 3d. Yeah. So anyway, the way I, we got that important point out of the way.

334
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,950
So there's a, let me finish here. I said I wouldn't mock. I guess they didn't mean you wouldn't.

335
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:44,710
Uh, the point of the, the, the, there's a couple of really good points that cone calls out.

336
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,340
Well, one, he doesn't call out any number of tests. He said, she should have more unit tests,

337
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,380
moderate number of integration tests. And, and as almost exactly quote cone for the UI test,

338
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,660
for the end end test, write as few of these as possible. And I think that's really critical.

339
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,820
That's, that's one of the biggest takeaways there. And also one of the biggest ignored things.

340
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:14,260
He argued against the triangle slash pyramid. Uh, he got in his test test case counting

341
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,020
thing again, says that more down here, how many more, how do you count them?

342
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:23,220
Why are we counting test cases? And to me it's like, I, I feel like you're missing the point. And,

343
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,700
the way is this not in cones article, but no assessment.

344
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:33,220
He wrote this and nailed it. You want to write as many unit tests as you can so that every

345
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,340
bug that can be caught by a unit test is caught there. You only write integration tests for bugs

346
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,820
that can only be caught at the integration layer. You write end to end tests for only

347
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,580
bugs that can be caught at the end to end. There's no counting of that.

348
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:52,820
It's a reflection of your architecture. He showed the, uh, software testing ice cream cone

349
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:55,860
anti-pattern where you have the small number unit test, it looks like a cone at the bottom

350
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:01,700
upside down pyramid. And then at the top they have, uh, obviously a drawing of the ice cream

351
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,150
that says, you know, manual exploratory testing, you know, to cover, to cover everything, not cover

352
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:10,710
my automation. And then he dove into that one. His argument against the, the anti-pattern was

353
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:16,390
the, the part that was the drawing of the ice cream cone looked like a cloud. So it was like

354
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:22,310
testing that testing was ethereal, like a cloud and didn't matter, which was an odd interpretation.

355
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,990
And also he didn't like it cause it was an anti-pattern. It shouldn't be an ice cream

356
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:32,200
cone because ice cream cones are delightful and anti-pattern should be not. I get, you know,

357
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:43,750
the thing I'm wondering Alan is, is maybe you miss box point because to me, if, if you look at it,

358
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:52,420
if you look at it as feedback from Bach on the testing pyramid concept, this all seems like

359
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:59,620
nitpicky semantic crap, but what you didn't see it. So I should probably just, no, I, I,

360
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:06,020
actually saw it, but I didn't go deep. But what you, you started off with the premise is that

361
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:11,860
he didn't like the testing pyramid. Maybe what he was saying is he didn't like how that concept

362
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:20,250
is being expressed. Well, right. Cause I've given feedback similar to that. The point is that I was

363
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:26,170
trying to get to is somewhere in the middle without much transition. So the cone wrote about

364
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:32,230
the test automation pyramid test automation, how you'd write your automated tests. Didn't talk about

365
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:40,310
manual slash exploratory slash critical thinking, intuitive testing. That's where Bach lives. And

366
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:48,230
he's very, very good at it. So he turned it into a justification for that deep thinking exploratory

367
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:54,150
testing that has to happen to some, not all products. So he ended up calling it the round

368
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,630
earth theory where sure you want some, you know, you want some good tests at the core,

369
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:05,780
but these are much the representation of size is no longer a count or number or ratio of tests.

370
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:12,580
It was about the depth and, and, and, uh, skill and intelligence required to conduct those,

371
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:17,860
you know, testing is very easy. The stuff at the top is very, very difficult and hard,

372
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:24,100
but the whole thing was transitioned from cones test automation pyramid, saying don't write

373
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:31,860
so damn many UI automation tests to a talk saying these in my context, in my world, these in depth

374
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:37,220
exploratory testing activities are very important and critical and difficult.

375
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:45,210
I found that transition. I found his conclusion absolutely correct. Was it based on the initial

376
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:51,400
premise? Not as far as I could tell. And of course, like all models, people interpret them

377
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,220
incorrectly. Just like we talked about principle number five being a model. People, of course,

378
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,020
can interpret the test automation pyramid incorrectly. They can, they look, people call

379
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,100
it the test pyramid and they go, well, where are the manual tests on the manual tester?

380
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,180
And things evolve from there, but that wasn't the point of the original model.

381
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:15,140
The original point of the original model was not to demean or discredit exploratory testing,

382
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:21,820
which is watching box presentation the exact way he took it. So that's where I thought he

383
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:28,300
went off the rails. There is a history that I've observed in the last couple of decades with,

384
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:35,980
I don't know if it was Bock or Caner or Bolton or whoever, but in the beginning phases,

385
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:42,220
they were anti, these people, the ones I can't fully remember,

386
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,660
were very much anti automation in the first place.

387
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,460
Right. It's just not their, it's not anti, it's not in their, they don't get it. They're not,

388
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,980
I don't know if they're against it. They don't understand it at all.

389
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,500
One thing I think that, so I think they actually came to a similar conclusion that you and I have

390
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:07,500
on multiple occasions and they went a different direction. I don't think I'd necessarily support

391
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,500
that direction, but the direction I think they went is they said, okay, doing testing right.

392
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:22,360
It's knowledge work and it requires thinking. And as you and I have actually also called out

393
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:32,120
on multiple occasions, test zombies are prevalent and test automation zombies are prevalent.

394
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,920
Oh, absolutely.

395
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:38,680
Where, oh, I just, my job is to take manual test case and automate it. That's it.

396
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:39,880
Yeah.

397
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,520
And you don't think about how, how, you know, six months down the road, you can't write any new

398
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,640
automation because all your time is being spent maintaining it.

399
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,600
Selenium Conf is going on right now. Maybe it ended yesterday. I can't remember,

400
00:38:52,600 --> 00:39:00,680
but it caters towards an audience of testers who in general who write

401
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:06,540
and, and web test UI automation as the bulk of their work for teams writing massive amounts of

402
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,940
end to end UI automation. That's all it's, I'm not arguing that world doesn't exist.

403
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,020
I argue whether it should exist.

404
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,700
Selenium, I have no fault with Selenium doing that, right? It, they're,

405
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:26,360
they're playing to what their customer base wants. What if we want the customer base to

406
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,200
want something else, we have to influence that. Because unfortunately that cussed,

407
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,440
that's not what that customer needs in my humble opinion.

408
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,520
Yeah. But in the end, I watched it and I, like I said, I have respect for Bach.

409
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,760
I just could not follow his argument. And in the end, I realized this is all about testing.

410
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:54,710
I really don't care that much about testing anymore. I really, really, really care about quality.

411
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:59,860
The testing part, I mean, I know it needs to happen and I can help people and coach them,

412
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,260
but it's not, I shouldn't say I'm not excited about it. It is not at all the focus of what

413
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,660
I think about or what I do. I think, and you're going to agree with this. So I personally disagree.

414
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:18,380
I personally am with you on that, but the testing topic is important. And in my humble

415
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:25,580
opinion, it's important because it has not culturally moved to where it belongs.

416
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:33,980
And that is back in the hands of the people writing the code. You cannot test. Someone

417
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:40,620
smart recently tweeted, it's 2019 and you still can't test quality into the product.

418
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,660
Someone very smart.

419
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:53,910
Iffy, how does this go with smart? And that's absolutely true. Test cannot win this quality

420
00:40:53,910 --> 00:41:01,030
upstream battle by taking defense and still holding on to test and saying the idea that test,

421
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:08,100
the idea that you're trying to ship bugs to a customer, in my view, just

422
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:19,880
just exposes a defensive argument and it doesn't allow the system to move forward.

423
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,460
If you enable that one, then things like cone stuff, in my view, begins to fall down.

424
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:33,700
If you have a test community, if you have these champions of quality,

425
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:39,460
then that broadcasts, right? The champions of quality, one of the big problems is the

426
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:45,700
codependency loop that we've talked about. If you think you're the champion of quality,

427
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:51,380
then hey, Dev will too. And then Dev can blame you when they ship a bug.

428
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:59,210
One last point to bring up related to something you said a minute ago is people will naturally

429
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,450
be defensive against these principles if it threatens their core of who they are and what

430
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:13,210
they think they are. Remember, there are people whose role in this world is to write test

431
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:20,200
automation and do testing. And if we say, as you did, and as we believe, that testing

432
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,800
can be done well and easily and more efficiently by the author of that code,

433
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,790
what do those people now do? But we're not threatening them.

434
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:36,420
No, I know we're not. The thing I'm trying to do, they feel threatened.

435
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:47,480
The thing I'm trying to do to reach them is to state that there is another way, right? We're not

436
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,200
saying your thing's going to disappear. We're saying you need to think about where your

437
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,160
skills are going to be valuable now. Absolutely. Okay, we got to go. Bye. See ya.
