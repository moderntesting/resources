1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,310
Hey everybody! Howdy! I'm Brent and we're here for episode 54.

2
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,750
Just like I say every time.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,990
This is the first 54 though.

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,190
Yeah, you haven't said 54 previously.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,860
I never would have thought when we first started this thing that I'd be saying 54.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,860
54.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,300
Alright, this is my first episode as a non-Microsoft employee.

8
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,900
And the post-Microsoft world for Alan.

9
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,760
It's... I have no regrets.

10
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,920
Oh, you're still in the honeymoon phase, of course.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,280
But tell us more about that.

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:53,300
Well, they shower gifts on me every day before the masseuse comes to my desk.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,780
It's fun. It's refreshing. It's small.

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,700
Like the internal tools.

15
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,460
Like the travel site is a pain in the butt.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,420
The expense reporting site, more of a pain in the butt.

17
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,220
I can't submit one of my expense reports

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,820
because for the last day or two, I can't find my boss.

19
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,670
But it can find you.

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,350
It can find us. It's hilarious.

21
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:25,150
So I have several friends that have gone the route you have.

22
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:31,980
I mean, and one of the common things that they say is...

23
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:36,990
First thing they notice is in comparison to Microsoft,

24
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,870
some of these sort of common processes,

25
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,260
just the severe lack of automation on them.

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,780
That...

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,140
Yeah, these typical things that you're used to,

28
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,540
that Microsoft has greased the engine on.

29
00:01:51,540 --> 00:02:02,860
Yeah, you realize pretty quickly that it's not as automated as you're used to.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,460
Eh, it's fine.

31
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,940
Yeah, and they say the same thing.

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:13,860
And the other thing is, if for some reason you have the interest,

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,820
right, you know what to do.

34
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,540
You've already seen a lot of these processes function in a way

35
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,100
where people just move on and live with it and don't complain.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,860
So let me give you some examples.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,900
I have so many examples, not sure where to start.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,460
When people ask me about it,

39
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:37,500
the adjective that comes to mind most often is just refreshing.

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,660
It's refreshing.

41
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,340
There's a complete lack of bureaucracy.

42
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,940
Just do what you need to do and don't piss people off.

43
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,780
Don't even piss people off. Don't be a dick.

44
00:02:51,780 --> 00:03:00,370
So what I'm hearing is you have not yet encountered

45
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:06,480
any sort of critical version of,

46
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,810
sorry, Alan, that's not how we do things here.

47
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,650
No, no.

48
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,170
If I were to come in and instigate a,

49
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,370
institute a huge amount of process and overhead and regime,

50
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,300
then I would probably hear that.

51
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,140
But that's not my style anyway.

52
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,740
So what I'm finding is, is sure, honeymoon phase,

53
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,780
but my style, my philosophies fit very well.

54
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,900
For example.

55
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,260
So you're not going to go anytime soon and say,

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,420
what this business needs is more command and control.

57
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,860
So, but let's talk about that specifically.

58
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,200
My philosophy, which I've had for a while,

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,480
but I've now, I read a book by Steve Denning called

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
The Leader's Guide to Radical Management.

61
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,680
Steve Denning writes for Forbes a lot.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,480
He's a straight business guy who sort of found Agile

63
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
and says, well, Agile is, this is the way the work is done,

64
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,600
regardless of whether it's software or anything else.

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
But one of his principles is,

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
give people a framework they can work in

67
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,760
and then get out of their way.

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,440
Which is sort of the opposite of command and control

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,000
in a very sort of Agile way of doing things.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,320
But tell me how you would implement

71
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,800
a command and control structure,

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,520
or at least from a micromanagement,

73
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,280
when, let me give you the context of my team.

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,280
My team is just shy of 30 people in seven countries.

75
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,150
I have direct reports in Seattle, Austin, Texas,

76
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,010
Copenhagen, Helsinki, Montreal.

77
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,010
How am I going to micromanage that team?

78
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,770
How am I gonna command and control that team?

79
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,370
Brent's making a funny little constipated face.

80
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,970
So first and foremost, I've seen how you operate.

81
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,890
If you wanted to command and control that team,

82
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,210
you would find a way.

83
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,370
I would never ever want to.

84
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,810
No, I mean, just by general,

85
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,920
like even if you were,

86
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,940
even if all of that team was here locally,

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,920
you wouldn't want to do that.

88
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,120
We're wired that way.

89
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,000
No, you lay down principles,

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
you make it very clear how they're gonna be measured.

91
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,280
And then, I mean, this is too hand-wavy.

92
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,640
Then you say, okay, now tell me how I can help.

93
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
What resources do you need from me?

94
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,000
Right, and I totally forgot San Francisco as well.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Yeah, I wasn't counting.

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,880
I do think it was, you said,

97
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Seattle, now San Francisco, Texas, Copenhagen, and.

98
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,640
Finland, Helsinki.

99
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,210
Finland, that's five.

100
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,230
And you said seven countries.

101
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,070
Well, is there somebody?

102
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,550
San Francisco is not yet a new country.

103
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,470
Those were, well, maybe it's also.

104
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,150
I might've been exaggerating a little bit there,

105
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,910
but I do have skipped levels.

106
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,750
And so I have, I like the combination.

107
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,310
I have three leads reporting to me,

108
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,030
as well as six ICs if I count,

109
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,830
right, one, two, three, four, five, six, yeah.

110
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,290
Okay.

111
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,870
So it's good to get a little hands-on,

112
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,510
get a little, and it's basically all of Unity services.

113
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:15,510
Everything from ads and analytics, big services,

114
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,790
down to like crash reporting and multiplayer

115
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,610
and the launcher, just technically a service,

116
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,450
has a back end.

117
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,290
So you're in it.

118
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,170
Anything that has a back end, basically.

119
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,090
Your Unity engineering services is what you're saying.

120
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,100
Sure.

121
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,940
Cool.

122
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,060
It's a ton of fun.

123
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,260
And what I'm finding out is, as I expected going in,

124
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:46,360
is there's a lot of different ways of doing things.

125
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,920
Different tools used, different approaches.

126
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,480
Some teams are very much,

127
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
are more along the agile spectrum

128
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,560
and they don't, they track bugs

129
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,480
just like they're just pure work items.

130
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,400
There's no real tracking a bug database

131
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
or backlog they're found and they're fixed.

132
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,600
As I was saying. I like those teams.

133
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,440
Yeah.

134
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah.

135
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,560
So as you can imagine,

136
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,520
my job is at first is to assess

137
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,120
and kind of get a story, assess the current state.

138
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,440
You don't have a going forward battle plan

139
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,240
that you want to announce for the first time today

140
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,200
on the podcast?

141
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,040
No, I'm still assessing the current state.

142
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,720
Getting to know people.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,680
I've now had one-on-ones with almost all

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,320
of my direct reports, at least one.

145
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,200
So slowly getting to know people.

146
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,400
I did spend two days in San Francisco

147
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,640
getting to know the team down there.

148
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,080
Both on the test side, the QA side

149
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,120
and the engineering side.

150
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,400
I've met with recruiting quite a bit

151
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,280
because I have open headcount in San Francisco a lot

152
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,920
and then in Montreal, I have a open headcount there too.

153
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,960
So two different recruiters working with them.

154
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,080
So slowly working my way around the company.

155
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,920
Huge Slack usage, which is awesome.

156
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,080
One thing, and again, no regrets, no digs on Microsoft

157
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,160
but my last team, Microsoft Teams, a Slack competitor,

158
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,160
I think is a great solution for Office 365 organizations

159
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,000
who have never used Slack before.

160
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,040
But having used Slack for the last three weeks,

161
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,360
I don't think they're ever gonna get a Slack user

162
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,640
away from Microsoft.

163
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm sorry, a Slack user to go to Teams.

164
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,240
It's just too much farther along.

165
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,680
It's so much faster, so much easier to use.

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,960
But anyway, we have basically all conversations from Slack.

167
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,960
It seems like their strategy is to go after the enterprise

168
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,840
which is a common strategy here.

169
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,040
And to be clear, I think that's a good strategy.

170
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,280
When you have a new product, you can go right after

171
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,480
the competitor and try and steal their customers,

172
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,160
very difficult, or go after the market

173
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,990
that hasn't been claimed yet.

174
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,750
And I think it's still a smart plan

175
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,750
but I'm loving using Slack.

176
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,590
I get...

177
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,510
I would say in general, Microsoft's gonna default

178
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:01,550
for the enterprise, because for a lot of cases,

179
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,030
most of our markets, we own the enterprise.

180
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,550
Yeah, and that's Microsoft's customer.

181
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,870
We're software developers for the enterprise

182
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,510
with a few exceptions.

183
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,990
So I get...

184
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,110
This is including anything from systems

185
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,510
like to approve an expense report or to approve leave

186
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,150
or including all those sorts of mails.

187
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,510
Maybe on a crazy, crazy day,

188
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,230
I may get five or six emails.

189
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,590
I think I just killed Brent.

190
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,650
Everything else is inside.

191
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,970
I think the last time I had a day like that

192
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,570
was when I was an intern at Microsoft and...

193
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,570
I hadn't been hooked up to the DLs yet.

194
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,890
Yeah, I get more than...

195
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,910
At Microsoft, I would get 50 mails on Christmas.

196
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,750
Yeah.

197
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,320
It's fun.

198
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,360
I mentioned I went to San Francisco.

199
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,160
There was a hack week for services in San Diego

200
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,160
where there were about 125 or so Unity developers

201
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,120
and testers there.

202
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,440
I went down there, not the hack,

203
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,510
but for two days just to meet some people,

204
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,910
accelerate some ramp up there,

205
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,740
and so that was cool.

206
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,620
So actually, I do have a question for you.

207
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:31,480
Do you have a sense yet of what your job

208
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,080
is going to be to add value to the business?

209
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah.

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,840
You do?

211
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,520
Because what I've heard so far

212
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,550
is the way you're thinking of driving your team,

213
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,630
and it's so fuzzy.

214
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,070
Battle plans haven't been laid out,

215
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,990
but you're gonna be very principle driven.

216
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,670
I think the mission is clear.

217
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,270
It's the implementation that's not,

218
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,590
or the execution and tactics.

219
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:55,830
Okay, what's your mission?

220
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,790
The mission is to...

221
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,290
I haven't put it into words yet.

222
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,370
It's a bit in my head, but it's to...

223
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,890
Do awesome shit.

224
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,090
No, no, no, it's about, and let me talk about it.

225
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,650
We can figure out what the name is later.

226
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,970
But the mission is definitely build Unity service

227
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,930
testing culture or establish...

228
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,090
Let me talk about it backwards.

229
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,890
Something quality culture?

230
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,730
No, no, no.

231
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,290
What we have in the services at Unity

232
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,450
is a bunch of different disparate approaches

233
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,810
to service testing.

234
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,610
Different tools, different approaches,

235
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,170
and they're different services, so it's okay.

236
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,770
Also what's happened is because they've never,

237
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,090
they've been under two or three different directors before.

238
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,850
This is the first time with me coming in,

239
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,370
they've actually combined all services QA

240
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,850
and under one manager.

241
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,690
Okay.

242
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,530
So by...

243
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,290
Ooh, functional organization.

244
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,410
No, just put a cork in it.

245
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,930
Oops.

246
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,930
Be quiet, Brent.

247
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,390
Gee whiz, Brent.

248
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,830
You're interrupting my flow.

249
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,870
What I'm doing in establishing the current state

250
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,630
of learning what everybody's doing,

251
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,270
learning how each of the services is tested

252
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,910
is from that I'll be able to build a plan on

253
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,270
what are the areas where it makes sense to consolidate,

254
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,830
what are the areas where I think it's fine

255
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,830
and I need to defend.

256
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,430
For example, if someone's,

257
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,410
there may be an old school,

258
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,250
someone old school says,

259
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,250
you have to have a bug database and track these things.

260
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,770
I say, well actually,

261
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,410
I can point out how it's actually okay to not have it

262
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,530
if you're fixing all the bugs as you find them.

263
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,490
So choosing where to defend,

264
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,810
where to consolidate

265
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:47,010
and kind of establishing that shared vision for that team

266
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:47,850
does two things.

267
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,810
One, it gets some consistency and efficiency

268
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,050
and how Unity tests services,

269
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,130
which is great.

270
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,890
That's sort of the tactical goal,

271
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:00,170
but it helps build the services QA team,

272
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,490
which they haven't felt like it

273
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,140
and they felt like there's no camaraderie team

274
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,500
and again, they're spread across seven different locations,

275
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,300
but at the same time, I'm building that team.

276
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,740
Sort of the culture of Allen,

277
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,580
the culture of not-

278
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,060
You're trying to build a team culture.

279
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,900
You have a bunch of people organized underneath you,

280
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,340
but that's far different from a team.

281
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,900
And because I believe that one thing that isn't happening,

282
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,460
I'm huge on talking about ideas and learning

283
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,060
and great ideas come from other ideas merging together.

284
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,900
They don't have that sharing culture on like,

285
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,940
oh, here, I found like there's,

286
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,860
for example, three different products.

287
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:48,180
You have seven teams and there's 18 test harnesses.

288
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,300
No, it's not test harnesses as much as,

289
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,740
oh, we use this because this

290
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,940
and we use this because this

291
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,820
and they're not really like,

292
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,860
oh, how about if we mix that chocolate

293
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,700
and that peanut butter

294
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,900
and make a damn good little Reese's Peanut Butter Cup

295
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,620
over here, I think because they're not connected

296
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,180
and talking with each other, that sharing isn't happening.

297
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,700
They're focused a lot on need to solve the problem

298
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,980
for my team.

299
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,740
So the world that you're talking about

300
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,660
sounds like a bunch of very silo specific,

301
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,820
probably organically built tooling that has proven itself.

302
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,180
And no, because they're a modern company

303
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,700
who's aren't so stupid, they build all their own tools.

304
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,940
They use, everything is,

305
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,820
they use open source tools, common tools,

306
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,700
but they don't know that each other,

307
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,540
oh, hey, you're using that?

308
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,360
I'm using that too.

309
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,820
I had no idea.

310
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,620
I'm making those connections.

311
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,540
It isn't like Microsoft 10 years ago

312
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,830
when everyone's building a test harness

313
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,190
or it isn't like Microsoft today

314
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,910
when everyone's building a data pipeline.

315
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,750
No, it's a knowledge management problem is what you're-

316
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,070
It is, absolutely.

317
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,650
So I'll figure out how to phrase that,

318
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,370
but that's the initial mission.

319
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,930
Sharing is caring.

320
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,770
Shut up.

321
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,370
And one thing that's,

322
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,650
I wanna tie that into one other thing

323
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,190
is that's a Unity review process.

324
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,230
Interesting.

325
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,270
Is, we may be talking about it more later

326
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,870
when I've been there longer,

327
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,750
but it's three questions, three times a year.

328
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,590
And the first question,

329
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,130
I'll get into the other ones in another podcast,

330
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,490
but it's just, what is your mission at Unity?

331
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,850
So it's having that in my head

332
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,530
as I sort of figure things out,

333
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,050
it's like, oh, it's becoming more and more clear to me

334
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,010
what my mission is.

335
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,010
At least that will change over time.

336
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,570
That's why you do it three times a year.

337
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,790
But here's the great thing.

338
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,190
Now compare this to your history at Microsoft.

339
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,850
I know Microsoft is a lot lighter weight.

340
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,370
But the three questions, three times a year-

341
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,730
Microsoft is lighter weight?

342
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,690
Has gotten lighter weight

343
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,370
since we used to have to write these books once a year.

344
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,170
The review process is literally

345
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,690
managers, three questions, three times a year,

346
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,090
you have a conversation about those things.

347
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,570
I think we have six.

348
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,540
Backup, there isn't HR doesn't require a check

349
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,480
to make sure you've done it.

350
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,080
It's you're asked to do it and you're expected to do it,

351
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,040
but nobody's following up and making sure.

352
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,800
There's nothing written down.

353
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,760
Okay.

354
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,720
This is just a conversation you have to have.

355
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,120
It's great.

356
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,600
The companies at the stage where,

357
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,840
and I think most small companies go through this,

358
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,260
I hope they can stay there as long as they can

359
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,500
where they want to avoid doing anything

360
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,510
that makes them feel like a big company.

361
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,280
So it's kind of fun.

362
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,120
See, you have your Microsoft goggles on.

363
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,260
No, no, no, that's great.

364
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,060
But I've also done some lightweight research here

365
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,700
and that's, so that's how a lot of small companies start up.

366
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,860
It does limit growth

367
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,840
because at some point in time you can't really scale.

368
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,600
And so they go, okay, they had to make a decision.

369
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,920
Are we happy with the growth level that we're at right now

370
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,900
or do we want to take some of these pains?

371
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,420
Unity's not public, right?

372
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,260
No.

373
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,580
Okay, yeah.

374
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,140
So that probably won't shift over until it's become public.

375
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,340
At some point it may shift,

376
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:14,060
but one thing I've learned talking to my team

377
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,980
is everybody just loves working there

378
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,900
and loves what they're doing.

379
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,340
Again, we'll go back to my word from five minutes ago.

380
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,900
Refreshing.

381
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Let's go into the next topic

382
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,300
and we can talk about my team there a little bit as well.

383
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,020
I think actually it's quite relevant.

384
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,420
Perhaps.

385
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,800
So it's actually been a while since we released 53,

386
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,820
I think it was about a month ago.

387
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,660
What's the date today?

388
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,760
Three weeks ago?

389
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,400
Maybe, actually almost a month, yeah.

390
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,840
Yeah, and then during that time

391
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,640
there was a lot of activity on the slide channel

392
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,820
where what was being discussed

393
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,020
is a problem that was quite common back in the day for me.

394
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,500
I'm pretty, I don't know how.

395
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,640
Maybe it's super relevant to you now.

396
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,180
But the question is,

397
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,800
if you are a leader of a pure QA team,

398
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,870
what are the goals of your team?

399
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,070
And there were several things talked about.

400
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,780
A lot of the discussion was,

401
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,620
I mean, this was common back in the day for me

402
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:46,580
where people would propose KPI and testers.

403
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,980
One of the things that testers are really good at

404
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,580
is knocking holes in everything.

405
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,380
So that's one of the things I observed

406
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,340
on the Slack channel was essentially,

407
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,460
hey, code coverage, that's a goal, right?

408
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,180
No, it's not a goal.

409
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,800
Code coverage is a wonderful tool and a horrible metric.

410
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,640
Yeah.

411
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,100
That's my standard line there.

412
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,980
Great for finding where you may have missed testing,

413
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,180
but shooting for a target

414
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:18,160
will always generate the wrong behavior.

415
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,200
Hindsight 2020 for me,

416
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,400
so before I sort of start monologuing on my opinion on here,

417
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,680
like what do you think of this topic

418
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,560
as it perhaps relates to you?

419
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,520
You've spoken about it very abstractly.

420
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,360
Yeah.

421
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,520
So the question is, what's the role of QA?

422
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,210
What are the goals of a QA team?

423
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,520
And to make it tighter.

424
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,160
So assume that it's a pure QA team

425
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,440
that's perhaps partnering with a dev team.

426
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,540
What are the goals of that QA team

427
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,200
that might be independent from the goals of the dev team?

428
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,020
Well, I am not a,

429
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:14,180
and listen before you jump in here.

430
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:19,180
I am still remain not a fan of a dedicated QA team.

431
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,430
So one thing I didn't mention about Unity,

432
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,370
I think it's a very, very common industry.

433
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,870
So Microsoft has done their, Microsoft has not.

434
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,430
Microsoft has another combined engineering thing where.

435
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,510
Unified.

436
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,750
Unified engineering thing.

437
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,590
I call it, yeah,

438
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,110
because there's, you and I call it unified,

439
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,390
they call it combined.

440
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:37,230
But,

441
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,750
But if we do it last enough,

442
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,950
we can fix this.

443
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,830
Get rid of the testers and the developer.

444
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,390
We've talked about it a bunch of times.

445
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,870
I'll slam some tequila later in honor of this.

446
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,230
We talked, I also talked a lot about my role

447
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,270
on the teams team.

448
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,350
My last team at Microsoft,

449
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:51,930
where I was the quality guy to kind of

450
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,350
make sure that developers were doing

451
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,270
what they were supposed to be doing.

452
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,190
And that included making sure the tools were in place,

453
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,190
coaching, whatever was needed to make sure they were,

454
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,070
we were getting enough testing activity to happen.

455
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,990
Plus some vendors doing some manual testing.

456
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,910
The idea of the dedicated QA team,

457
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,650
that I'm thinking of the team that gets software

458
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,950
at the end like we used to,

459
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:16,830
or even we were on the team from the beginning,

460
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,550
but we got something here, test this before,

461
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,070
way too late.

462
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,950
Even if it was one month into the product cycle,

463
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,470
the thing we got was way too late.

464
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,990
We should have been involved earlier.

465
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,230
So that sort of.

466
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,540
And I spent, you did as well,

467
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,570
but spent almost half of my,

468
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:39,570
maybe longer of my QA career fighting that.

469
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,610
Yeah.

470
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,690
So because it's a constant fight getting those,

471
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,410
getting those dev or getting those PM to involve QA

472
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,730
at the beginning.

473
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,160
So that model sort of worked and it worked.

474
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,200
And remember I had some of my vendors

475
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,000
working involved in stand up

476
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,200
with some of the key feature areas

477
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
to make sure they were involved early.

478
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,380
The way Unity are structured,

479
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,380
which is very similar to how many organizations

480
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,600
doing agile software development function

481
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,720
is every one of my,

482
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,560
across to a person,

483
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,440
across my 28, 29 person org

484
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,560
is embedded in a development team.

485
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,440
So they work for me and I get that consolidation.

486
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,080
But as far as the day to day work,

487
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,240
and they maybe have a lead that works for me

488
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,360
who kind of make sure that they're coordinated,

489
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:32,000
but their day to day work,

490
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
they're embedded in as the test expert in a feature team.

491
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,320
The test expert or the test bitch?

492
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,400
Expert.

493
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,040
Okay, that's fantastic.

494
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,400
I have great conversations with product owners already,

495
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,880
our POs about,

496
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,720
like I had one,

497
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,280
this guy Andy came to me this week and said,

498
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,520
so you're not Monday.

499
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,160
Oh, you're not supposed to mention names.

500
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,000
It's fine.

501
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm not throwing them under the bus.

502
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,080
I can talk about them when they're awesome.

503
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,920
All right, fair enough.

504
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,360
If I don't mention a name,

505
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,160
doesn't mean you're not awesome.

506
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,000
But anyway, he said,

507
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
so how do I work with you?

508
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,640
And I said,

509
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,330
and he said,

510
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,810
so what do I do about,

511
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:13,090
should I come to you when I have work,

512
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,210
I think that those,

513
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,450
your guys need to do?

514
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,970
I said, well, that seems stupid, doesn't it?

515
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,770
My job is to offer,

516
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,250
is to look for consolidation,

517
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,330
everything in my mission we talked about.

518
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:26,570
I'm looking for how to consolidate testing.

519
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,610
I'm gonna coach them on how,

520
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,850
maybe how to get things done

521
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,090
and what tools to use and learn from them.

522
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,170
But as far as prioritizing their work,

523
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,850
that's not my job.

524
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,210
You know, the PO could take care of that.

525
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,970
They know what testing or what quality work needs

526
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,010
to get done.

527
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,610
And they're empowered to do that.

528
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,210
Unity is huge on empowerment.

529
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,130
And you do what needs to get done.

530
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,170
So these guys are definitely not the test bitches

531
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,170
or the test experts.

532
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,010
I like the idea from-

533
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,650
But they're not the ones doing all of the testing.

534
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,210
Absolutely not.

535
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,650
They're the ones looking for,

536
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,370
they're the ones testing the things that,

537
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,570
testing for the things

538
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,730
that probably no one else could find.

539
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,900
I have both people,

540
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,140
everybody's air quote technical,

541
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,980
but they do have the concept of the SDET and the STE,

542
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,140
the test developer and the tester.

543
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:15,820
I have some of both across my organization,

544
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,140
which is fine.

545
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,220
But they, everybody does kind of everything.

546
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,540
It's a, they're bought,

547
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,060
whether they use it by name or not,

548
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,900
they're bought into the specialized in general

549
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,340
and by the time I get through with my little,

550
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,180
part a little bit of Allen culture across my org,

551
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,620
everyone will know what a specialized in generalist is.

552
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,460
I've already talked to them about

553
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,580
the five orders of ignorance.

554
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:39,820
So there's some bits of my tool bag

555
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:41,460
that came out naturally.

556
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,860
So anyway, they're embedded in these teams across the org.

557
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,100
That by the way is one of my favorite parts

558
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,540
of joining the new team.

559
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,460
It's starting all over on your series of,

560
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,420
these are the speeches I use every time.

561
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,780
So anyway, I mentioned embedded in the teams.

562
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:05,180
I like the idea from Google of experts,

563
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,420
not just in testing,

564
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,500
but in improving developer productivity.

565
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,660
So I kind of expect them,

566
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,420
again, everyone's different getting used to the team,

567
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,780
but for the most part,

568
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,780
they sort of get the necessity for efficiency.

569
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,900
Are there better ways to do this?

570
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,260
So when I poke and think,

571
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,140
oh, here's something you could do,

572
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,030
in most cases they've already done it.

573
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,300
So there's a backend service for CodBuild.

574
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,260
Can you build the Unity app?

575
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,420
Oh, by the way, and I've built the Unity,

576
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,260
I'm working on a game.

577
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,540
I have a little shooter I'm building in Unity.

578
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,300
It's interesting writing a game.

579
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,900
I don't know if you've ever written a game before, but-

580
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,140
Long time ago.

581
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,860
I spend more time in the editor working with physics

582
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,540
and lighting than I do actually writing the code,

583
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:56,780
just to try and make it look right.

584
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,900
So it's an interesting little shift for me

585
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,260
in my software development.

586
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,780
What kind of shooter are you building?

587
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,860
Is this like a FPS?

588
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,900
No, like a Galaga type game.

589
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,460
It's based on one of the demos.

590
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,300
Oh, good.

591
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,620
But anyway, but I'm using all of the services I can

592
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,820
with this thing to get used to how they integrate.

593
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,880
So each of these services has a entry point in the editor.

594
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,040
I was going somewhere with this.

595
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,600
Oh, and then there's this cloud build thing.

596
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,600
So I can choose to build my project in the cloud,

597
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,620
which is pretty cool.

598
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,620
And I can target any one of Unity's zillion 30-ish targets.

599
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:40,860
I can't build for Xbox or for Samsung TV or for Windows

600
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,860
or for Android or whatever.

601
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,660
And then there's all these different versions of Unity's

602
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,580
and things that I thought,

603
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,220
well, how do you handle the combination exploration of this?

604
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,020
And they already, they know about combinatorial testing

605
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,100
and they have some stuff to go directly on the back end,

606
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,420
beat out, make sure all these things

607
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,660
continue to work all the time.

608
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,260
So it's, and sure enough, the builds have,

609
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,900
again, my project's pretty simple now,

610
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,910
but they've worked out great.

611
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,990
Little bit of a tangent there.

612
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:11,990
Let's reel it back in.

613
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,750
Neat story, Alan.

614
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,910
Hey, what are the goals of a QA team?

615
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,790
I think they're buried in that story.

616
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,950
I think the goals are to,

617
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,270
and I don't want to fall back on Jim Morris, the remainder,

618
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,590
but it's not entirely it.

619
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,790
It's not being the test pitch.

620
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,630
It's finding-

621
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,870
I will kick you in the shins on the podcast.

622
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,710
And you'll miss my-

623
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,550
I hear that.

624
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,350
And you'll miss my shin and hit something more important.

625
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,350
Goals of the QA team are to increase developer productivity,

626
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:47,680
identify risk.

627
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,120
Let me just stop there.

628
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,680
I like the idea of the chicken little,

629
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,470
part chicken little, part Eeyore.

630
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,310
Okay.

631
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,230
It'll never work.

632
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,070
This guy is tall.

633
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,980
I'm just, I like-

634
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,510
I don't, I don't.

635
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
I do like the thinking behind the people with that,

636
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,080
but I find it's great to think that way.

637
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,340
Don't communicate that way.

638
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,500
Oh, I agree.

639
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,260
So it's one of the things that I heard

640
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,140
based on what you're discussing.

641
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:26,010
Like, so right now, I absolutely adore your model.

642
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:26,930
The-

643
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,930
Aww.

644
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,290
But the one thing I think that is an opportunity here

645
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,210
is for you to also put in

646
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,420
some form of sticky obligation

647
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,180
for your guys to proactively communicate

648
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,040
and share.

649
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,130
Because I think the, you do run the,

650
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:59,180
so empowered local teams is fantastic.

651
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,700
But if without any sort of thing to balance it, right,

652
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,900
they're going to become siloed

653
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,900
and this knowledge management problem

654
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,900
that you're going to have is just continue or get worse.

655
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,560
One of the things I think you should consider is,

656
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,060
and it's fuzzy in my head,

657
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,580
so I don't have something concrete for you,

658
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:22,920
but what are actually the useful things

659
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,870
that aren't going to start a bureaucracy engine

660
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,110
that you could tell these guys,

661
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:35,910
hey, useful solutions that can be shared across,

662
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:39,300
I want you to feel morally obligated

663
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:44,690
to think about those generalized patterns

664
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,010
and contributing to a solution.

665
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,130
Because I think one of the things,

666
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,570
as every team is focused on that,

667
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,530
you're going to be the guy that goes,

668
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,130
oh, you have that problem?

669
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:00,130
Hey, my team that's 1200 miles away from you

670
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:02,320
will actually just solve that.

671
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,850
So, again-

672
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,330
So then you become a knowledge command and control bottleneck.

673
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,890
I think we've talked, just a minute ago,

674
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,090
talked about learning from each other as part of that,

675
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,250
but let me take a moment back and talk about,

676
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:18,010
not my mission, but Unity's mission.

677
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,490
Three principles.

678
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,970
Now, let's see if I can remember them.

679
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:23,270
Democratize development.

680
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,380
Okay.

681
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,280
Solve hard problems.

682
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,120
Okay.

683
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,440
Enable developer success.

684
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,060
Everyone at the company lives those principles.

685
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,900
Okay.

686
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,580
It's about sharing and enabling others,

687
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,420
picking, not just solving the hard problems,

688
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,940
but picking the right hard problems to solve,

689
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,860
which is very much reflective

690
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
of what you were talking about.

691
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,980
It's like, yes, people are expected to identify

692
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,260
and solve and share the hard problems.

693
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,350
And then I think one that if it's QA more than,

694
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,670
again, I'm getting used to calling it QA,

695
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,310
they call it QA Unity, but we call it,

696
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:03,030
oh, I called the test and there's, I don't care.

697
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:03,870
I don't either.

698
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,710
I don't either.

699
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,550
Okay.

700
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,150
Actually, I do care.

701
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,990
We talk about-

702
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,830
Engineer.

703
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,190
When we talk about enabling developer success,

704
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,630
it's enabling our end users or developers.

705
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,310
We want-

706
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,150
Oh, okay.

707
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,990
So, you know, from working on Xbox is

708
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,830
primary customer is not the end user,

709
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,150
it's actually those developer making those games.

710
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,390
The easier we make it for developers

711
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,950
to make games that make them money,

712
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,030
money, money, so-

713
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,990
Money and Unity.

714
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,630
What do you call money at Unity?

715
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,470
Money.

716
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,950
But the easier you make it for them

717
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,790
to be successful developing games,

718
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,080
the more successful we are.

719
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,420
Right.

720
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,260
That the-

721
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,740
So, anyways, but going rewinding again, backing up.

722
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,260
Yes, absolutely agree with you.

723
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,540
That is definitely a goal.

724
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,080
I want the team to solve hard problems

725
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,960
that are hard problems that maybe other parts of the team

726
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,030
haven't recognized yet and be able to benefit from that.

727
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:07,590
Yeah, it reminds me, there is an Agile model,

728
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,310
I'm forgetting the name of the company

729
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,070
that published this.

730
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,590
So, not only do they

731
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,430
have,

732
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,250
I don't know if you guys are calling them

733
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,450
Scrum teams or whatever,

734
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,290
but we'll call them the little Agile teams

735
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:25,690
that are working together towards a common goal.

736
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:31,930
But they've also created a secondary series

737
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:35,810
of these teams where

738
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,440
we talk about specializing generalists,

739
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,200
generalizing specialists,

740
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,560
but this is specifically targeted around

741
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,720
getting specializations in a community on a weekly basis

742
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,120
and getting them to work towards a common secondary goal.

743
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,880
Whatever they invent, right?

744
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,520
But I actually thought that was a,

745
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,880
when I first read it, I'm like,

746
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,880
really, this is gonna be massive overhead.

747
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,200
But I think once that rolls and you make it very clear,

748
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,270
no, you're really on,

749
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,870
and strike the balance of the fact

750
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,470
that you're telling them to be on two active teams,

751
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,130
which is generally frowned on.

752
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:28,230
But one is depth and one is breadth.

753
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:31,830
And this breadth one is,

754
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,430
if you do it right,

755
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:39,010
then knowledge correctly and naturally starts bubbling out.

756
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:42,810
Yeah, that's a good idea.

757
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,530
I forget, I'm even forgetting.

758
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,010
They don't call it squads or just wacky.

759
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,490
No, it doesn't need a name.

760
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,770
And I think that's important also.

761
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,050
This is part of building,

762
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,010
I think we'll have to do things like that

763
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,450
to build sort of the services team,

764
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,450
even though everyone's embedded elsewhere.

765
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,590
Already, based on a conversation I've had

766
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:09,050
with one of my leads, they are going to put together,

767
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:12,620
they're gonna take their team offline for,

768
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,640
not offline, but take a couple days with them

769
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,200
and sort of go through a little workshop

770
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,200
on just among themselves trying to identify

771
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,420
the current state and where they wanna go,

772
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,680
which is great, helps me out.

773
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,360
And they've sort of taken it on themselves

774
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,920
to do that, which is great.

775
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,600
I think there's going to be many opportunities

776
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,720
to do things like that.

777
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,320
It's honeymoon phase, but so far,

778
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,000
it's just, I haven't met a person that,

779
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,200
like everyone from super,

780
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,360
I don't call them senior,

781
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,940
the organizationally, it feels very flat,

782
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,780
which is good.

783
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,620
I've-

784
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,940
And where there's hierarchy,

785
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,140
with what you describe on the,

786
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,900
how empowerment actually,

787
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,780
that empowerment is an action,

788
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,180
not a management buzzword.

789
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,500
It's gonna feel even flatter.

790
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,980
Because part of the thing that you're essentially saying,

791
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,300
unlike, let's say, your former company,

792
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,580
where-

793
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:20,060
Oh my God, yeah, I have thought about-

794
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,420
One of the expectations would be,

795
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,070
so your role here,

796
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:30,890
if you were to go into a role like this,

797
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,810
you're gonna be expected to, every week,

798
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:38,810
join, I don't know, 567 status meetings,

799
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,790
where you have to represent the progress

800
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,210
of your whole entire organization.

801
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,240
And I don't get the sense

802
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,200
that you're gonna have that requirement.

803
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,000
No, no, it's about sharing and learning this.

804
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,560
Yeah, no.

805
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,640
But I think, you know, hierarchy,

806
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,880
I didn't realize it till I left how,

807
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,160
at Microsoft, how huge it was.

808
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,280
It's like, you,

809
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,530
sometimes you couldn't even email someone

810
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,140
based on their title.

811
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,460
Like, oh, I'm too junior to talk,

812
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,380
did you go directly to them?

813
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,460
Yeah.

814
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,300
That just doesn't exist.

815
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,860
And again, part of a small company too.

816
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,960
If you're a company of 1,400 people,

817
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,520
with 500, 400 engineers.

818
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,600
Yeah, but-

819
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,080
We both have been in teams that,

820
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,120
like I've been in teams that are smaller than that.

821
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,280
And so did that, the rule that you're talking about,

822
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,080
persists.

823
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,720
Oh no, don't waste his time.

824
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,920
Yeah, oh, I worked,

825
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,360
and I had someone who worked for me

826
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,320
who talked to my skip level directly,

827
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,930
and I got shit for it.

828
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,770
You did?

829
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,970
Yeah, because my manager came to me and said-

830
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,610
Why is this guy coming to me?

831
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,810
Hey, he went and talked to Tom directly.

832
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,950
That, if he has stuff he needs to talk about,

833
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,350
you or to me,

834
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,750
you can't go up that many levels of hierarchy directly.

835
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:19,730
You know what?

836
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,580
Yeah, I know you made up the name,

837
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,620
so maybe I'll talk to you after the podcast.

838
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,140
But stuff like that just ticks me off,

839
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,140
because that is a dude who is trying to do PR control.

840
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,500
All right.

841
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,220
Did I answer your question eventually?

842
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,820
We don't have direct yes or no answers here.

843
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,100
Well, no.

844
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,200
So in terms of what are the goals of a QA team?

845
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,690
My belief, again, is a QA team,

846
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,490
and I think you described it,

847
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,210
even in your organization,

848
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,250
you described it differently,

849
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:11,250
but a QA team's responsibility is to accelerate quality.

850
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,190
Yeah.

851
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:15,670
But quality from a customer point of view.

852
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,990
I actually remember you had that definition

853
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,350
for many, many years.

854
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,190
Yes.

855
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:26,830
And you see I successfully didn't use the forbidden words.

856
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,230
I don't think you've talked about it on the podcast.

857
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,750
It's been a long time if we have.

858
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,590
No.

859
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:37,230
So my view, if you have a dedicated QA team,

860
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,590
first and foremost,

861
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,590
it's not a goal per se,

862
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,070
because usually when people ask goals,

863
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:48,480
they want something that has a KPI in it.

864
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,800
But if you start off with the idea

865
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,000
that a QA team's role is to accelerate

866
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,500
the achievement of shippable product quality,

867
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,860
framed very tightly with that,

868
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,860
my definition of quality has the square root

869
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,020
of nothing to do with bugs.

870
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,500
It has to do with customer satisfaction.

871
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,180
Then you can take the context of your current team

872
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,620
and break it down.

873
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:31,840
The, it is very context sensitive in my experience.

874
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,370
I do not like goals of, I will automate all things.

875
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,300
The problem with that,

876
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,140
when you are in a leadership of a QA team,

877
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,140
the best thing for you to do is number one,

878
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,900
realize that the sort of the definition,

879
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,260
the vision or whatever you want to call it

880
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,700
that I just mentioned,

881
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,180
then take the business KPIs

882
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,020
that your executives care about.

883
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,460
What are the needles they're trying to move?

884
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:07,010
And then convert your goals,

885
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:10,090
something that leverages the skill set of your team,

886
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:12,130
but says, hey, you know what?

887
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:17,210
I'm gonna take ownership of knocking down 3%

888
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:21,430
of whatever this business KPI you're caring about

889
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:23,990
by using my team's assets.

890
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:28,890
Sure, right, in my view, there's three general things.

891
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,700
Business value.

892
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,260
Now, if you're in a QA team,

893
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,980
business value is going to be

894
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:39,300
whatever you're doing to measure customer satisfaction

895
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,540
around your product.

896
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,090
That's QA secret sauce.

897
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,370
We're good at customer satisfaction,

898
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,610
but drive it, not from theory.

899
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:55,840
Second, calendar time.

900
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,880
Calendar time, once you've lost it,

901
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,360
you can't get it back.

902
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:04,420
You can't hire more months in the year to scale up.

903
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,350
Calendar time is a critical resource,

904
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,510
particularly in this services agile world.

905
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,190
And then probably the easiest one,

906
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,030
but also, well, depending on the organization,

907
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,870
it might not be as valuable as the prior two.

908
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,790
And that's engineering time.

909
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,660
Much like what you're talking about,

910
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,420
you want to improve developer productivity.

911
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,100
Which is actually quite close to accelerating quality.

912
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,740
Well, actually, I'd take that back.

913
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,900
Because when you were telling the story,

914
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,340
the word developers overload it.

915
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:40,980
Because the developer is not only your Unity's customer,

916
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,420
that's the class of people, their game developers.

917
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,700
But they're actually a title within Unity.

918
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,540
So when I first heard,

919
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,780
when you, you know, half hour ago,

920
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,500
when you were talking about developer productivity,

921
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,100
I was assuming it was the in-house developer

922
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,660
is not your customer side.

923
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,660
Maybe I interpreted entirely.

924
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,540
No, actually, when I was talking about developer productivity,

925
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,540
in that case, I was talking about in-house developers.

926
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,380
Right.

927
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,980
To be clear.

928
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,820
Yeah.

929
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,180
So that's sort of the engineering time.

930
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:19,500
If QA is, can eliminate waste on that front,

931
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:25,850
I'm not a big fan of that.

932
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,650
I'm not a big fan of that.

933
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:33,320
I'm not a big fan of targeting efficiency first.

934
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,240
I'd rather target productivity.

935
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,800
But as part of that, if QA can eliminate waste,

936
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,280
and that results in a shorter calendar time,

937
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,520
which results in a happier customer.

938
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,880
Efficiency will result in shorter calendar time.

939
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:57,180
Efficiency will, productivity will.

940
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,380
Efficiency is about reducing,

941
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,780
well, generally, my definition of efficiency

942
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,500
is about reducing time wasted.

943
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,040
Right, time.

944
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,600
But there is another pivot, and I agree,

945
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,720
there is another pivot on efficiency

946
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,480
that I find is actually used most often,

947
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,400
and that's the elimination of idle time.

948
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,250
And I don't wanna go into it today.

949
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,630
We don't have enough time, but the studies have shown

950
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:37,910
that if you wanna move fast,

951
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,500
you need to make sure that there is actually idle time

952
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:51,250
in your people's daily calendars.

953
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,800
A metaphor.

954
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,960
A fully utilized freeway is known as a parking lot.

955
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:04,550
So if you fully utilize all the resources on your team,

956
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,850
you're gonna go slow.

957
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,130
And if you don't believe me, Alan's looking at me like,

958
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,450
I don't know if I should make fun of you.

959
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:19,010
You can look it up in Rene Anderson's book.

960
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:22,320
If you don't believe me, you'll believe him.

961
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,360
I believe him way more than I believe you.

962
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,480
Fair enough.

963
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,880
That's Flow.

964
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,840
What's that book, Engineering Flow?

965
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,920
The Flow of Software Development.

966
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,000
I forget the exact title.

967
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,320
Principles of the software development flow

968
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,920
or maybe just development flow.

969
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:38,760
Yeah.

970
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,980
Yeah.

971
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,800
All right.

972
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,100
Is there anything else to talk about?

973
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,370
Are we done?

974
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:44,210
I think we're done.

975
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:45,050
Where we at?

976
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:50,050
Hey, more stories of unity coming up?

977
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:51,410
Yep.

978
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:52,450
But not today.

979
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:53,290
Nope.

980
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:54,330
All right.

981
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:55,790
I guess we're done.

982
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,650
I'm Alan.

983
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:57,770
I'm Brent.

984
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,610
And we will see you next time for 55.

985
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,450
Double naked.

986
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,290
It's not.
