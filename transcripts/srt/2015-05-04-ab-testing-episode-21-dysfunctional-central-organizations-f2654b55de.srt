1
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,200
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,160
I'm Alan.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:17,900
I'm Brent.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,000
And we're back for another episode of AB testing.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,800
Whoo.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,980
Uh, episode 21, right?

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,340
Episode 21.

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,780
What podcast can drink in the United States?

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,160
It's interesting.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,260
21 second year episode one.

12
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,780
I don't think that'll work next year, but this time it does.

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,500
We'll see what happens.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,260
Remember I took a couple of months off last summer, so, um, we'll,

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,460
we'll just see what happens.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,740
We also have, uh, other strange stuff going on.

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,900
Traditionally we've recorded at eight o'clock in the morning.

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,980
And eventually after a year, I bailed on that and said, this is getting harder and

19
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:55,900
harder as I get older and older and I drink more and more.

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,340
So now we're here at 5 PM and he can't stop getting older.

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,420
I know.

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,340
And who wants to give up drinking more and more?

23
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,920
Right.

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,020
So, uh, anyway, thanks for listening and we're excited to have all of our

25
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,020
listeners last year, we talked a lot about our two or three listeners, but now

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,540
I think we have eight, maybe even nine, at least nine.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:19,940
All right.

28
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,660
We'll go for there.

29
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,580
Number one on our list, but it's the three.

30
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,260
Those are the ones that we especially appreciate it because they've

31
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,620
been with us the whole time.

32
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:29,740
Yeah.

33
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,220
I appreciate every single one of our listeners, especially the ones who

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,540
send, uh, questions for our mail bag.

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,500
So we don't have to try and think of things to talk about on our own.

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,340
Yes.

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,920
It's okay.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,360
We haven't, we have enough crazy things happening in the world of

39
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,640
Microsoft that, uh, we can find stuff to talk about.

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,600
Yeah.

41
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,060
Although, although we should ask for feedback because, uh, we haven't really

42
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,040
had a really good mail bag and a good while.

43
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,440
I know.

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,560
What is up?

45
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,980
No, I could, I could like yell at our listeners right now for not sending us

46
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,680
questions, but then they stopped listening and that would be the wrong thing.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Right.

48
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,560
But so, so they're getting what they paid for, for sure.

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,200
Well, we should start the subscription model.

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,180
But then if, no, we shouldn't, then we'll lose our three.

51
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,200
Yeah.

52
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,640
But you can send us gifts of, uh, food or,

53
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,200
I'm happy with gifts of tweets.

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:20,900
All right.

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,560
We'll go with that.

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:21,680
Yeah.

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,380
Even if you guys are saying you like, you guys bore the crap out of me,

58
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,580
please stop talking.

59
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,080
Well, that would be fine too.

60
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,820
Let's just, you know what I'm going to do?

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,960
I'm going to take half of this show on the road.

62
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,410
Are you?

63
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,990
I am.

64
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,470
I am.

65
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,430
As we've mentioned before, I'm going to be at star Canada in June, uh, in

66
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,690
Vancouver, uh, I'm excited there and I will talk to you there.

67
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,470
If there's enough, if there's interest in anybody, I will record some stuff

68
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,670
and we'll put it on the podcast.

69
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,050
Um, and then I am going to the Netherlands in, oh God,

70
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,270
November, I had to think when, uh, the Eurostar conference is there.

71
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,390
I'm going to attend Eurostar and then I'm giving a keynote at the deep dive

72
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,630
on mobile, which is, uh, the last day of the conference.

73
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,270
Okay.

74
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,470
So I remember, uh, I don't know, three episodes ago that you told

75
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,470
everybody about Canada and you said, this is probably going to be the only conference.

76
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,550
So, but I like, I like Europe and, and I thought it'd be fun to do.

77
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,270
And also because the build conference, Microsoft's, uh, developer conference

78
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,950
was this week and I won't go into a lot of details, but the product I've

79
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,030
been working on that I can't talk about was discussed at build.

80
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,590
Isn't build public build this public.

81
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,110
So you can't talk about the thing that was talked about publicly.

82
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,630
I can, but you know, I want to be very careful.

83
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,270
Did you ever watch Star Trek?

84
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,310
Yes.

85
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:46,750
Yeah.

86
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,430
Which one TNG?

87
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,430
Yes.

88
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,930
So data was what sort of was he human?

89
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:54,890
He was an Android.

90
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:55,930
Oh, he was.

91
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,490
Yes.

92
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,730
Interesting.

93
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:03,210
And wouldn't it be cool if data or his ilk would work on windows.

94
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,360
Anyway, just hints there for the crowd.

95
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,990
You could have like, Hey, and what if data notice that the, that he

96
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,510
couldn't see what might he go fix?

97
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,910
He wouldn't work when he was on the Klingon.

98
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,010
So yeah.

99
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,090
So, uh, where was I?

100
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,210
So I'm going to be talking a little bit about what, um, our product does at,

101
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:33,170
uh, and sort of the challenges and how we've addressed them at Eurostar.

102
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,170
I'm excited about that.

103
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,490
And I think that's it.

104
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:42,080
Did I tell you I was invited to give a talk in Portugal and I had to cancel.

105
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,840
I had to say no, no, you did talk about that last time.

106
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,240
Did we talk about it on the show or afterwards?

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,760
I can't remember.

108
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:46,920
Yeah.

109
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,200
It, uh, I actually don't remember.

110
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,040
I don't remember either.

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,360
Anyway, uh, I hope they invite, but I do know that it was soul crushing.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,240
It was, but I'm coaching soccer.

113
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,560
This, yes.

114
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:58,920
Yeah.

115
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,120
Yeah.

116
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,920
And it's the last game of the season I'd have to miss.

117
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,760
And, uh, so I'm going to coach soccer instead of going to Portugal.

118
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,000
Well, you could just fly the whole, the both teams to Portugal.

119
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,680
Do both.

120
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:09,880
Yeah.

121
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,240
I know.

122
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,480
Wait.

123
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:10,800
Yeah.

124
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,560
Uh, no, no.

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,600
And it wouldn't even, well, way to be a dad in the coat.

126
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,280
The cost is one thing, but who wants to go on a trip that long with a bunch of

127
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,360
10 and 11 year olds?

128
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,110
Put them on a different plane.

129
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,840
Like houses are problem.

130
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,880
We'll put them on a boat.

131
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,080
Yeah.

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,320
I mean, if you can, if you can afford the cost and afford a temporary, uh,

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,560
nanny to watch them on the other plane.

134
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,400
Yeah.

135
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,240
Hey, uh, before we go into the real agenda, can we have a another brief

136
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,280
episode of things that piss Alan off about Microsoft?

137
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,160
Alan soapbox.

138
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,120
Dun dun dun.

139
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:55,120
We'll be taking user requests for the theme song slash sound effect for the soap

140
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,440
box for now, we'll just leave it as nothing exciting.

141
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,610
So early in my Microsoft career, very early, there was a famous event called bed.

142
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:13,800
Um, and bedlam happened because someone created a test distribution list.

143
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,560
I was in exchange when bedlam.

144
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,280
Oh, do you want to tell bedlam from your side?

145
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,240
No, you tell your side first bedlam was somebody noticed they're on this bedlam

146
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,870
alias and it's not the end of the world to be on an alias.

147
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,350
You don't know about, but they were curious.

148
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,830
So they did, but I will say it wasn't like, it wasn't the exchange

149
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,230
team that created this DLL.

150
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,550
It was someone in it.

151
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,230
Okay.

152
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,790
I'm just saying someone emailed the entire alias and said, Hey,

153
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,630
why am I on this alias?

154
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:43,470
And the, how large was the alias?

155
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,830
5,000.

156
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:51,390
No, it was closer to like 20, 30,000 people pretty much contained at that

157
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,350
time, the majority of Microsoft.

158
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, it would have to have been well, Microsoft full-time was only, was

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,320
right around 25,000, I think it's 15,000 when I first started anyway.

160
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,000
Uh, a lot of replies me too.

161
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,240
And anybody that's worked at Microsoft for a second knows that you don't get

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,000
yourself taken off a DL by emailing the entire DL and saying, please remove me.

163
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
You go to the darn tool and remove yourself.

164
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:23,800
These reply all fired back so quickly around the whole company that it

165
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
pretty much brought exchange down.

166
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:25,920
Is that right?

167
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,120
It didn't pretty much.

168
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,600
Okay.

169
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,560
I was being nice cause Brent worked on exchange.

170
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,320
Yeah, it brought it down the, the, the, the everybody connecting.

171
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,560
So first it started off with, as Alan pointed out, someone trying to go

172
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,920
and clean up their, their own membership list.

173
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,720
And back in those days, so today we have a bunch of other tooling, but back in

174
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,540
those days, you had to administer it through exchange and the only person

175
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,580
who could administer the DLL was, or the DL was the owner of the DL.

176
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,050
I do remember that now.

177
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:04,210
Yeah.

178
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,250
So, so this person was going in.

179
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,090
You couldn't remove yourself.

180
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,850
You had to go beg someone to get you off the DL.

181
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,550
So this person went through, looked at, uh, their distribution lists.

182
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,350
They're, uh, I, I never actually found out who started it, but, um, I presume

183
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:25,550
they were like, I get all this crap email.

184
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,790
I want to stop getting crappy email.

185
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,160
And notice that he was on this deal called bedlam.

186
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,960
So it started off that mail.

187
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,090
Uh, then a bunch of other people came in and said, Hey, remove me, remove me too.

188
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,530
Me too.

189
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:40,930
Me too.

190
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,410
Me too.

191
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:49,000
And then what made it worse is suddenly everybody's mailbox, pretty much

192
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,390
everybody's mailbox at Microsoft was buried by me twos and then the next

193
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:02,780
phenomenon started happening, which I don't think you addressed, which is as

194
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,550
the me tooth train kept on going, a new train started up where everyone

195
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,670
was replying all to the thread saying, don't reply off.

196
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:13,470
Yeah.

197
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:21,230
So, um, and that one was amusing because how do you get people to stop

198
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:30,840
replying all without replying all, um, the, with all of this happening and

199
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,400
people coming into work and realizing that their inboxes were filling up.

200
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,280
So everybody, a large portion of people found that their, their inbox quota

201
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,480
gone within an hour.

202
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,910
Uh, the, the, the network at that point in time couldn't handle the load.

203
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,030
So people's emails were being queued up.

204
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,710
Um, so it created bedlam.

205
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,230
Yes, it did.

206
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,830
So fast forward almost 20 years later.

207
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,230
Yep.

208
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,070
And I got some mail this morning.

209
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:11,590
I'll, I'll read the title for you because it's called, uh, the title

210
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:18,480
of the mail was testing only please ignore group and blah, blah, blah.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,080
And then the, the context of the message said, you are now a member of the

212
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,760
testing only please ignore group testing only please ignore because I

213
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,200
fancy myself as having an intelligence slightly above a rock.

214
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,880
I thought, Oh, this is a testing thing.

215
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,040
Someone's working something out.

216
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,240
They say to ignore it.

217
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,880
I'm going to do that by deleting it.

218
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,560
And perhaps I should ignore it.

219
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,000
I w I did that.

220
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,280
I thought it was very clear testing only please ignore.

221
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,870
It seems pretty straightforward.

222
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,930
But the next hour with my jaw dropped, watching the reply, all of people

223
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,090
sending mail to this alias asking why am I on this alias?

224
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:00,810
What is this?

225
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,730
What should I do?

226
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,010
And I'm thinking, I think you should please ignore it.

227
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,610
And luckily outlook has this, uh, feature where you can right click and

228
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,960
you just choose to ignore a thread, which I did, but I'm blown away.

229
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
Uh, and I think I was, whenever I see a problem like this, I think about,

230
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,240
you know, I do a little bit of five why I think about why does this happen?

231
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,920
Not why did someone create an alias?

232
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,280
This is a, is a legitimate business reason for doing this testing thing.

233
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,190
But why, why are we seeing this behavior based off of response stimuli?

234
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,390
So I don't know entirely.

235
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,050
Honestly, I think a chunk of it comes back to our heavily email culture.

236
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,010
I think people spend their time.

237
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,850
I mean, look, I was expecting from you and we wrote this up.

238
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,970
I was expecting a high quality rant and now you're going to go like serious.

239
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,650
Look, why isn't it?

240
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,370
Why isn't it just simply because you work with stupid people?

241
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,290
Would you put your pants back on and wait for the answer?

242
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:05,730
All right.

243
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,970
Wait for me to get there.

244
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,370
All right.

245
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:07,690
Come on.

246
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,890
I like to take it slow.

247
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,850
Daddy wants it.

248
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:10,610
All right.

249
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:11,610
He's ready.

250
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,130
Let's go.

251
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,860
Anyway, people spend their, their, I was watching these people reply all and make

252
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,620
cute little comments to about 5,000 people.

253
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,260
Wasn't the 20,000 watching my mailbox fill up.

254
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,740
Just idiotic, idiotic.

255
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,900
And some people thought they'd be clever or apply all with the special little DRM

256
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:38,900
tag that says don't reply all, which means that our client cashes ahead on

257
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:42,300
when it's going to look the moment you get near that male, it tries to load all

258
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,180
the DRM stuff and things slow down.

259
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,300
And I just drives me nuts.

260
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,300
And I'm watching people reply to this thing multiple times.

261
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,020
There's 5,000 people on this group.

262
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm thinking a couple of things.

263
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,780
I'm thinking one, every person on there, I'm thinking, are you really that dumb?

264
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,280
Seriously.

265
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,720
And then I started thinking, I think there's probably a direct correlation

266
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,440
between your productivity in general and your involvement in this thread.

267
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,520
And that's what got me thinking, you know what?

268
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,800
Some people are so happy and feel like they're productive when they spend their

269
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,360
whole day with their face buried in email rather than actually getting work done.

270
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,320
You know what I actually get work done when I close my fricking email client

271
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,960
and get my face in the computer and do the work.

272
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,280
Get your head out of the email, you fricking idiots.

273
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,760
Well done.

274
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,040
That was a good rant.

275
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,720
Alan, as you've already heard from here, has a face for radio.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,640
But he just got bright purple.

277
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,240
He feels it.

278
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,650
I'm the best looking guy.

279
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,010
I will freely admit that between the two of us, he is the A is not only

280
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,650
Alan, but the attractive one.

281
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,450
Absolutely right.

282
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,770
Well, in comparison.

283
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,160
Yeah.

284
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,960
All right.

285
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,960
So anyway, people are still, you know, I'm gonna have to actually empty my deleted

286
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,200
items because it's filling up with all the, all the ignored threads.

287
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,520
So let's go back to the, the, the, the, the, the serious Alan.

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,960
Well, the one that's really trying to decompose why.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,240
Well, I think the decompose why is it, I really feel like people think email is

290
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,720
the most important, I shouldn't, I shouldn't generalize.

291
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,160
There are some people at every company.

292
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,760
I believe email is fantastic for information dissemination.

293
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,640
Unfortunately, and, and not so grateful out of other things.

294
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,520
Unfortunately, our culture is very much around doing everything over email.

295
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,630
And I think this is another symptom of that same cultural inefficiency.

296
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,080
I'm done with the subject.

297
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,800
Do you want to move on?

298
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,680
Do you want to say something else?

299
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,520
Uh, Dylan, I want to say something else, but it just, just lined up that what I've

300
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,120
written on the board lines up very much with what you're saying.

301
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,800
All right.

302
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,600
I don't see it.

303
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
So let's go on and you can tell me how to make this perfectly perfecto.

304
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,640
Here's the thing though, right?

305
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,070
This, this particular situation is absolutely the snowball effect.

306
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:14,640
Yep.

307
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,040
Right.

308
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,040
It, it, it, it progresses exponentially and everybody has their own little

309
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,400
personal tipping point, but once this gets to a tipping point, you have no

310
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,840
choice but to act because now some idiot someplace else is actually having

311
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,360
a negative impact on you.

312
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:32,560
Right.

313
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,440
You now have to spend a half hour unless you've created a rule or something like that.

314
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
It was five minutes.

315
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,240
And when I got the mail, I now have to do extra effort.

316
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,080
I didn't want to do because of a bunch of idiots.

317
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,880
I don't know.

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,950
Well, it really is distracting because I, I saw the first mail come in.

319
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,550
I had to Nord it.

320
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,710
Then when I saw the first reply, all I thought, Oh crap, here it comes.

321
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,150
And sure enough, I'm just staring at my screen, shaking my head.

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,480
Oh, people, people, people.

323
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,160
There should be a feature in, in, in Outlook.

324
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,290
There should be, there should be a lot of features in our, instead of

325
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:15,850
replying, there should be a feature where if things like this are happening, you

326
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:22,080
can click a button and say, everyone should ignore this and it gets aggregated.

327
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
It sounds like an exchange feature.

328
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,130
But it should be well, instead of replying all because they're trying to,

329
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,770
they're trying to shut down the noise.

330
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,210
So it should be just a button that says shut down the noise.

331
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,680
And if enough people do it, it just stops.

332
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:40,880
So when you do right click, ignore thread, if it's like that, but if, but, but

333
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,680
with crowdsourcing enough people say ignore it, everyone ignores it.

334
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,560
It gets ignored.

335
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,640
There, there is a, there is a, um, there's a feature in exchange that

336
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,960
we called the, the message torpedo.

337
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,610
So if you message recall is the official feature, right?

338
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,890
Oh, I love message recall that if I see one of those

339
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,570
in my, my inbox, I make sure I go to the mail before to see what was

340
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,730
recalled cause maybe something good.

341
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:12,490
Well, what I, so if you, if you, um, if you use rules, I don't know if they've

342
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,370
changed it, but it used to be the case message torpedo only worked against

343
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,850
messages that were in the inbox.

344
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:24,160
Oh, so one of the things I used to do is, is, uh, the way I cracked at my

345
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,800
rules is I moved the messages I cared about out of the inbox.

346
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,280
That is good.

347
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,440
That's where most of like junk mail stuff.

348
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,000
So inbox essentially eventually became just nothing but junk mail.

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,520
And I can just say control all delete an important box that comes like, yeah,

350
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,080
I get it.

351
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,280
Yeah.

352
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,630
Once you move it over, you're like, Oh yeah, I'll let you recall it.

353
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,190
Just as soon as I finished reading it.

354
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,130
Um, yeah.

355
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,330
So Conway's law is what I wanted to talk about, right?

356
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:01,120
The, the Conway's law was, it was written by a guy named Conway,

357
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
Martin Conway.

358
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,360
Uh, thankfully I looked him up, uh, on Wikipedia just before I violated a key

359
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,280
principle of AB testing and that is principles.

360
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, we do.

361
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,040
We've talked about this before where I actually did some prep time.

362
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:25,780
We now here, it was only like a minute, but, um, he crafted this, this, uh, law.

363
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,490
And it's, it's a law where he noticed a cause and effect between system

364
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,030
architecture and the communication style.

365
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:40,870
And notice that these were systems and that he noticed that how an organization

366
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:48,810
communicated with people is how it's also how the architectures built by

367
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,930
those people communicate with each other.

368
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:52,770
All right.

369
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,130
Uh, is this kind of like, don't ship your architecture or is this different

370
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,970
than the structure?

371
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,810
I don't know that one.

372
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,130
I don't know who meant that one.

373
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,130
So talk more about this.

374
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,810
Give me an example.

375
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,410
So I get it.

376
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,890
Uh, it's essentially, have you ever noticed that, that at times it's back in the old

377
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:11,890
days, it is huge improvement sense, but back in the old days that it didn't

378
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,250
seem like outlook and exchange worked well together.

379
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,730
I may have noticed that.

380
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,090
Yeah.

381
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,260
Well, it was because outlook and exchange didn't work well together.

382
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,380
The team.

383
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,520
Got it.

384
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,640
So it's, it's essentially what it's basically saying is that the designs of

385
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,440
the, the code that's being built is going to follow a similar communication paradigm.

386
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:40,800
Okay.

387
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,840
I believe that as the people anecdotally, I believe that to be true.

388
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,280
Cause I've seen, uh, whether it's products that need to work together, or if you

389
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,070
have a panoramic operating system where the teams don't, uh, another word for

390
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,190
panorama, maybe a Vista.

391
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,390
Where the, uh, no, I understand.

392
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,630
Okay.

393
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,350
You gave me a word.

394
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:04,590
I was looking at me like, Oh, I used a big word again.

395
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:05,470
No, I got that one.

396
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,910
All right.

397
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:11,070
So, um, I know anecdotally, there were some, there were communication

398
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,950
problems on that team that could cause some of this.

399
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:18,870
Well, you've heard of, um, projects that, uh, you've heard the term

400
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,150
make the product seamless.

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,280
I've heard the term.

402
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,120
Okay.

403
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,520
Um, sounds like a marketing term, but go on.

404
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,040
No, no.

405
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:31,960
So several of our products and we still get feedback on this, particularly

406
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,160
with the windows asset, right?

407
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:40,000
Those who are, who are software junkies or spending a lot of time with this,

408
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:49,660
like what's the number one question that, Hey, SharePoint and, uh, I don't know.

409
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,020
Zune, these are both Microsoft products.

410
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,460
How come they don't work well together?

411
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:01,640
Or SharePoint and Excel or, or Excel and notepad or whatever.

412
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:02,520
Right.

413
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,960
These folks have a user scenario that they require uses of multiple products

414
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,080
in a row and the, and they do this day in and day out and they notice.

415
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,280
That they'd not integrated together well.

416
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:23,530
Um, and not only that, if you, if you spend enough time, you can actually

417
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,130
almost physically tell that it was an entirely different team that designed

418
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,210
this, particularly for, um, some of the scenarios.

419
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:34,090
I can't think of an example, but we have a bunch of them in this company.

420
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:41,290
Where in order for it to do it, you have to sort of navigate, um, your data

421
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:46,450
through, uh, multiple teams to accomplish your goal or multiple teams code.

422
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,410
But it feels awkward, particularly on APIs.

423
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:50,580
Okay.

424
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,180
I get conceptually, you brought this up for a reason.

425
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,260
Yeah.

426
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,900
So the thing I wanted to talk about today, that's sort of the theme Conway's law.

427
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,340
I will log that in the theme part of my data.

428
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,820
We have themes and principles and I think you sound so upclass, but we know we're not.

429
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,420
We're not.

430
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,380
Although I love the white shirt.

431
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,260
I mean, you look all like summary.

432
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,100
Yeah.

433
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:13,540
Dink.

434
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,140
So it is nice out.

435
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,060
Anyway, I thought I lost it.

436
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,900
I'm still the same low class guy, but you definitely upclass today.

437
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,260
Just, just keep in mind that is, this is the reason it's the podcast, not a video cast.

438
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,060
All right.

439
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:35,560
So today with the theme of Conway's law, like I want to talk about central

440
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,850
organizations, like what do you mean?

441
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,120
Um, are you familiar with the hub and spoke model?

442
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,360
Oh yeah.

443
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,080
Yeah.

444
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,520
What's your experience with the hub and spoke model works

445
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,640
fantastically every time, doesn't it?

446
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,950
Um, no.

447
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,910
Do you want to describe to our three listeners?

448
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,590
Yeah.

449
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,510
Um, I don't, I don't like spending too much of our podcasts talking about stuff

450
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,150
like, like just Microsoft stuff.

451
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,670
Hub and spoke is worldwide.

452
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,750
It's it's a known thing.

453
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:11,200
So in my experience, so the hub and spoke is you have a central org that works

454
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,880
with, um, smaller orgs on each team.

455
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,040
So the central org is the hub and you have this spoke swimming out to these,

456
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,240
these smaller teams do the same thing and they communicate back to the central

457
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,480
org, which does a lot of the heavy lifting and maybe the spoke team within

458
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,600
the team is supposed to do sort of the implementation and adaptation for their

459
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,200
specific product, uh, specialization for their product around the same

460
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,400
ideas coming out of the central team.

461
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,080
Right.

462
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,480
So the hub is, is, uh, they generally have a broad scope.

463
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:41,800
Yes.

464
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,240
Right.

465
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,990
Um, for example, the things I'm hearing all the time lately is, Oh, we're

466
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,750
doing this for the whole company.

467
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,310
Okay.

468
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:59,690
A very broad stroke and their mission is to provide some key resources and dependency

469
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:05,730
that the spoke team that enhances leveraging their specific business.

470
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,170
Oh, yep.

471
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:06,570
Okay.

472
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,910
And you said, and so you agree that these work fantastically.

473
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,670
Um, no, I did not agree that.

474
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:14,510
Okay.

475
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,950
I worked in engineering excellence, which was in a way, a central

476
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,390
organization for Microsoft.

477
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:18,990
Yes.

478
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,060
Uh, even it had its which no longer exists at this company.

479
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,840
And it's because they were so fantastic.

480
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,080
It worked perfectly.

481
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,160
And they said, just like I, I have all kinds of soap boxes lined up here to

482
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,560
jump on, but I kind of want to see where you're going first.

483
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:37,920
Okay.

484
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,560
One of the things that I'm seeing as a, as a problem with central

485
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,520
orgs, and I'm seeing this pop up a lot.

486
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:54,200
Um, and it is a potential problem where I'm at right now.

487
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,570
Uh, but although I know a solution towards it and I'm intending to improve it.

488
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,990
Uh, but a lot of the times the biggest thing about these central orgs,

489
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:10,960
because they have such a broad scope, they have, they approach their problem

490
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,210
solving as if they have a mission from God, meaning

491
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,170
just like Jake and Elwood.

492
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,200
No.

493
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,700
Oh, but they were on a mission from God.

494
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:29,310
They were, but theirs had dancing, singing and band cool like car chases.

495
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,470
Yeah.

496
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,750
But none of that happens here.

497
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:31,910
Oh, and beer.

498
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,790
Yeah.

499
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:33,870
What else needs life?

500
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,590
Um, go on.

501
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,270
Uh, money.

502
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,070
Uh, no.

503
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:38,510
Okay.

504
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:51,040
Um, so the central teams, they get this feeling of validation that they

505
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:58,640
exist because their version of God wants them to exist and therefore everyone

506
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,640
just needs to snap to how they intend to solve the problem.

507
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:03,840
Right.

508
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,360
Right.

509
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,540
That's I'm going to, I'm going to hold off till you're done, but yeah, I've

510
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,020
seen that, that viewpoint often.

511
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
I'm, I'm waiting for a rant.

512
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,820
Oh, it's coming.

513
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,340
Okay.

514
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:13,900
Building up.

515
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,220
All right.

516
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:14,820
Turn to purple.

517
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,250
All right.

518
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,170
So here's the situation that I'm seeing.

519
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,260
Um, we have a central organization.

520
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,140
Okay.

521
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,220
And I'm thinking of several, not necessarily any of them that I'm working directly with,

522
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,660
but this has always happened.

523
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,540
They get this mission from God.

524
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,020
They have a very broad stroke.

525
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:45,700
Now, because they have a broad mission, um, their mission is almost always not only

526
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,020
larger, but significantly larger than what they're resourced for.

527
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,500
Mm-hmm.

528
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:49,860
Okay.

529
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:57,500
And the way they tried to scale this down so that they can scale and sustain is by

530
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,940
limiting what the spoke teams can do.

531
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
How do they do this?

532
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,640
Because they often, depending on the size of how many spoke teams, they will

533
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,640
do this by saying, no, no, no, you don't know what you need to do for your team.

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,240
We do because that's the capability we're lighting up.

535
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,040
So they reduce those capabilities.

536
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,240
They don't ever actually come and ask the teams what they need.

537
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:25,420
Yeah.

538
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,860
So, and so then we end up having a hub team that's taking forever to

539
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,780
produce something nobody wants.

540
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,020
And we have the spoke teams who are getting pressure to, to actually

541
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:40,300
provide business value in a time window that's useful.

542
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,940
And so then they start duplicating it.

543
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,110
The hub team doesn't know what the spoke team's doing.

544
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,470
The spoke team doesn't know what the hub team is doing.

545
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,910
And then we end up in this crap-tastic world.

546
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,350
And it's because these guys aren't talking.

547
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,660
It's more than that.

548
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,900
It's more that it's communication as part of it.

549
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,260
Actually, communication is a big part of it.

550
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,620
It's the major part.

551
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,940
I'll argue that later once you're done.

552
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,140
Right.

553
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,380
I don't even know where to start, but this is exactly what I've seen in.

554
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,720
I can't think of a central org at Microsoft, at least for this

555
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,920
hasn't been the case to some extent.

556
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
The central orgs, they, you're right.

557
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,520
They feel like they're going to solve everybody's problem for everyone.

558
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,520
And the big problem I see is they get on a, they develop a charter for themselves.

559
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:26,760
They're good.

560
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,160
We're going to do this and then everybody else is going to snap to it.

561
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,000
Because we're doing this for everyone.

562
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:32,720
Yep.

563
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,040
And that is the exact wrong way to do a central team.

564
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,040
This brings me back to, um, there are, what I think of central teams and I

565
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,880
think of how they work, uh, I think about consulting and they should be

566
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,440
like a consultant for this area.

567
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,200
They are, I want them to help the other teams do this and they're going to do

568
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,800
a chunk of that work themselves, help them implement, but they're, that

569
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,560
viewpoint should be a consultant's viewpoint.

570
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,560
And when I think of consultant, I think of, there are two very good books

571
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,440
on consulting that talk about this.

572
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,880
One is the Weinberg book, uh, secrets of consulting Jerry, Jerry

573
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,320
Remberg, I might get the title wrong, but another one is great.

574
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,720
As I've mentioned before, I'm a huge fan of the, uh, uh, Pat

575
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,000
Lanchione business fables and his latest fable, which is a couple of years old.

576
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,640
Now he did a, um, this is standard business book in between, but his latest fable,

577
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,600
I forgotten the name, but it is about his consulting business.

578
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,960
Uh, and it's a story talking about how a guy was in a consulting

579
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,280
firm and told me that sounds familiar.

580
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,000
They started off, they did all kinds of prep work and they came into the client

581
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,120
and told them what they should do.

582
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,080
And they felt like they had to come in and be the expert because they

583
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,720
were the consultant or the central org, the, the, the, they really wanted

584
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,040
to be the expert where central orgs are.

585
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,880
And this other company was taking all of their business.

586
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,160
And then, uh, there was some weird thing where the guy had to got transferred

587
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,680
or acquired, he had to go work with these guys and learn how they worked.

588
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,680
And their idea was he couldn't believe they weren't doing prep because they

589
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,960
would take their first consultation meeting and they would go and ask

590
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,920
questions and learn and not try and be the expert, they would ask humble

591
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,600
questions about, well, how would you, what do you actually want to do here

592
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,960
and learn how they could help them?

593
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,260
And this is exactly how to, this is how, if you're a, whether you're a

594
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:22,060
consultant in a central org or just in sort of some sort of leadership position,

595
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,500
this is by far the most effective way to have influence and be effective.

596
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,580
And it probably ties down to communication as well.

597
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,100
I think too often our central orgs want to come in and be the expert and

598
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,820
solve the problem for everyone and go, we have figured this out for all of

599
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,100
the division or all of Microsoft or all the world.

600
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,300
But what you really want to do in a central org is figure out how you can

601
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:51,180
help everyone because I am honestly, I should probably not say never, but I

602
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,900
will for now, I've never seen that sort of push of like, we have the right

603
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,740
answer, we're going to tell you what to do work.

604
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,420
What I have seen work is when someone comes in or some org comes in and says,

605
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,380
let's figure out what you're, what you're doing and how we can help you.

606
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,740
We'll take requirements for everybody else.

607
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,740
We'll kind of figure out what everybody's doing.

608
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,940
Then we'll figure out a charter from that, what everybody needs and what

609
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,420
their problems are versus building something and doing the field of

610
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,900
dreams, build it and they will come crap.

611
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:15,380
Yep.

612
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,440
What is important.

613
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,160
So you talked about a couple of things and I, I don't see the expertise

614
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,240
things so often, cause a lot of times I find that people on the smoke teams

615
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,600
are on the smoke teams are actually better experts, but the thing is these

616
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,920
guys are in a role where there's, so I agree with that.

617
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,100
They're in a role where it's supposed to be, but when they, when under

618
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,980
conversation, what you find out is that failing that it doesn't matter if

619
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,820
I am or not, because again, I have a mission validated by God.

620
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:52,660
In other words, my executive says it's I win.

621
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:56,050
I like your consultancy.

622
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,730
Like there's an, there's an implied fix in there.

623
00:31:59,480 --> 00:31:59,800
Right.

624
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:00,950
Fine.

625
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:01,990
Go ahead.

626
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:09,000
Have your mission from God, but the VP, he changed the funding structure.

627
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,880
No, the VP doesn't fund that team directly.

628
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,760
That team he's going to fund the spoke teams extra money and the spoke

629
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,080
teams fund that central team.

630
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,600
It's always weird in a, um, I wish there was a good system.

631
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,520
Maybe I was a better business person.

632
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:30,280
I figured that out a way to, uh, make those checks and balances work

633
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,120
by funding from within the org.

634
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,040
I think it's a cool idea.

635
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:33,600
Yeah.

636
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,400
I was talking to a friend of mine in a different group at Microsoft and

637
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:41,840
they're doing a big reorg and, um, they're moving to a unified engineering.

638
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,360
Um, and he was talking about, well, what do you do in that situation?

639
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,400
I want to go too deep into this.

640
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,960
We've talked about, but what do you do about some of the non-functional

641
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,880
things like performance and reliability and some end to end things?

642
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,800
And, and I, and I gave him a bunch of, you know, ideas.

643
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,920
Here's how you can, you know, incorporate this people use specializing

644
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,400
generalists and, you know, blah, blah, blah.

645
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,440
And he was really adamant about, I really think we need a central

646
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,640
org to run all this stuff.

647
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,890
And all of it.

648
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:10,000
No, some of it.

649
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,600
I think it makes sense.

650
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:11,920
Yeah.

651
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,280
And I, and the, there's sort of a hybrid and we're a little off the track of where

652
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,280
you were, but we can come back in a second, but I see how you got there.

653
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,200
I pushed him toward is, uh, he really wants that.

654
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,880
And I think there's, there is advantage in that shared expertise.

655
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,480
Being able to have those, like if there's four guys in an org of like

656
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,480
500 that really know perf being having them like we've done with tag in the

657
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,520
past, having those guys be able to share what's going on like consultants

658
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,840
would, consultants go out for their jobs to come back and they, they can

659
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,200
figure out what's going on or learn from each other.

660
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,510
So there's advantage in that, but you can, but, and you also want

661
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,630
to rotate those people around.

662
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,030
There is a big push in his org, for example, that, well, we don't need that

663
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,880
because every single feature team should have a perfect expert is, is

664
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,120
what one of the, one of the leaders was saying, and that's a nice idea

665
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,880
in concept, but you also need a, a reliability expert and an end to end

666
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,200
expert and a security and privacy.

667
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,080
And pretty soon there's nobody left to actually write the features.

668
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:10,800
Right.

669
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,240
And, um,

670
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,070
but the one feature that gets written will be great at per

671
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:19,710
flyability and, um, and security and privacy.

672
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,830
And compliant, et cetera, et cetera.

673
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:22,230
Right.

674
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:27,800
It's there, there is a, the decentralization is as

675
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
attractive as centralization.

676
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,720
Or it's unattractive.

677
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,300
No, no, no.

678
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,540
So people get seduced into, oh, we should decentralize, we should

679
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,380
centralize and, and there was a, well, it's, well, I read years ago

680
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:44,220
that it's, it actually is an infinite loop.

681
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,860
If you, if you pay attention to the system, if you pay attention to the system,

682
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,940
it's an infinite loop.

683
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,980
Well, it's interesting and I'm just going to bring us up briefly, but

684
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,020
it's interesting how many of these problems fall back into something

685
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,860
we've talked about probably in every single episode, which is idea

686
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,780
of specializing generalists, generalizing specialists and systems and systems.

687
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,220
Yes.

688
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,180
So it really comes back to that.

689
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:10,340
So rewind a little bit, uh, but now we were, I have some people.

690
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,300
So we're talking about centralized orgs and how we've seen them fail.

691
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,140
Yeah.

692
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,890
The, the, the, I like what you were saying in terms of, or I piggybacked

693
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:24,570
off of you in terms of, Hey, let's change the funding structure.

694
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,930
Because the, really the problem is, is that what the central orgs,

695
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,530
particularly again, the ones with the mission from God, who they're

696
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,200
trying to make happy is whoever's funding them.

697
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,440
Yeah.

698
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,160
And something I just thought of is this goes back to the, uh, shipping

699
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:47,880
your org structure part of this, which is say I have 30 people on my central team.

700
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:53,490
And somehow I get like, like some more head cat.

701
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,530
Now I have 40 people on my central team.

702
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:58,850
I'm going to be cranking out a lot of stuff for the whole org.

703
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:04,370
And maybe even so much that the spoke teams can't adapt to what I'm doing

704
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,770
or consume what I'm doing because I have, because they have like three or

705
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:11,770
four people doing something, uh, in a consultancy type model, you could.

706
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:18,480
That's almost never a problem because again, the hub team has such a broad stroke.

707
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,480
The spoke team always goes faster.

708
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,640
You know what?

709
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,480
We've seen that you're right.

710
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,430
The, the only place, the only place where I've seen the spoke team go slower

711
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,590
is when God comes down and says, no, you will take a dependency.

712
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:35,230
Yeah.

713
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,990
And then, and then the same God tries to figure out why we slip four months late.

714
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,270
While you're talking, I think in more and more about the concept of actually,

715
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:45,630
we talked about the model of consultancy and what I've learned about

716
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,150
leadership from consultant from studying consulting, but actually doing it,

717
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,750
actually having the hub team, uh, rotate people onto the spoke teams to actually

718
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,910
work there and help really understand those problems and implement and adapt.

719
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,590
And that would take care of the communication piece.

720
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,550
Cause they would have to,

721
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,790
it would certainly take care of the empathy piece.

722
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,390
The, but if you don't, it's much like what we've said in systems and, and

723
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:14,150
change every time we've talked about systems and need to change behavior,

724
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:15,030
right?

725
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,790
They're incentivized to do the wrong thing.

726
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,160
The other thing too, that's, that's, that's particularly in my new world where

727
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,960
there is a lot of hub and spokes teams in the data science world.

728
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:32,280
One of the common things that's also very frustrating for, from the central team.

729
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,640
Let's say you were on the central team and, and the team I was on before

730
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,040
my current one was a central organization.

731
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,160
They're doing all this great work, but no one's using it.

732
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,460
Okay.

733
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:49,020
And the reason why, of course, is by the time they completed that work,

734
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,220
the spoke teams already solved their problem.

735
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:51,620
Right.

736
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,260
Okay.

737
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,500
We've all seen that.

738
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,100
It was sighted, seen it over and over and over again.

739
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:06,410
Now the thing, so I had a conversation with a member of my central team today.

740
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,370
And it was a fantastic one.

741
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,650
And I'm on a spoke team.

742
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,050
They're on a hub team.

743
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,210
We have a similar thing.

744
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,450
I record, I told them, here's, here's how I see the system.

745
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:23,320
You guys have a broad stroke that requires you to go slow in order to get all of this

746
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,200
stuff in so that can be consumable at your scope.

747
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:26,680
Right.

748
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,960
It takes a lot of work to do that.

749
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,400
That's going to make you guys go slower.

750
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,240
I need to go faster, but I don't want to reinvent the wheel.

751
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,120
I want to use your data and help to converge on your system.

752
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:46,090
Primarily because they're doing data warehouse solution or data engineering.

753
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,410
I don't want to go into that space.

754
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,650
I could do it.

755
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:53,450
That's what I did to my last team, but somebody else is already doing it.

756
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,210
Someone is starting to do it.

757
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,450
I know the maintenance costs over the longterm.

758
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,370
This is their mission.

759
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,530
I'd rather help them.

760
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:05,270
So I had a conversation with them and I said, look, I don't want

761
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:06,710
you to view me as your customer.

762
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,710
I want you to view me as your partner and what I want to do.

763
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,840
And I completely understand that there's a very high chance that my priority on

764
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:22,980
a spoke team is going to be very low on your backlog, but I need you

765
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,500
to understand that I can't wait.

766
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:30,730
So what I would like to be able to do is when I encounter these situations,

767
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:39,030
I give you my developer, he works on my scenario and enrich your asset

768
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,510
so that I get what I want.

769
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,110
You get convergence.

770
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:43,430
What do you say?

771
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,840
And I've done this now three times in this last week and every one of them

772
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,960
was like, wow, what a magical solution.

773
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,920
Where did this come from?

774
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,720
The real world.

775
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:58,000
It's essentially open source except with a little bit of command

776
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,360
and control bureaucracy overhead.

777
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,900
But what do you think now applied Conway's law, once me and that team

778
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,210
are executing in that style, how well do you think my system's going

779
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,330
to integrate with theirs?

780
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,570
Cause they are actually two distinct systems, but I want to

781
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,690
take a dependency on theirs.

782
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:17,870
Well, it should improve.

783
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,070
It's going to integrate fantastically.

784
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,830
I'm sending one of my developers over to their team.

785
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,350
Maybe he's a horrible communicator.

786
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,090
Maybe he's a dick.

787
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,240
Uh, he can be a dick, but he's a great, he's a great communicator.

788
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,560
I'm just saying it's not foolproof, but it's definitely going to improve.

789
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,200
He doesn't listen to his podcast, but one of his better friends does.

790
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,160
It'd be interesting to see if this bubbles back.

791
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,320
Eventually someone who gives a crap is going to listen and then

792
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,920
we're going to get an email saying, Hey, it's, it's funny.

793
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,840
Like we've spent a lot of time, uh, picking on my kids on the podcast.

794
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,680
This is the first time I started picking on my employees, but you

795
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,880
know, one of the things he was giving me crap just an hour ago.

796
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,240
So screw him.

797
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,600
Yeah.

798
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:07,680
All right.

799
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,480
Did you have more on that?

800
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,200
No, I'm good.

801
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:11,920
All right.

802
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,040
Anything else you want to talk about?

803
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:14,710
No.

804
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,510
And we're out of time.

805
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,950
I guess we are.

806
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:19,750
So thanks for listening again.

807
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:20,990
Thanks all.

808
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:21,670
All right.

809
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,910
We will talk to you soon.

810
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,430
I'm Alan.

811
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:25,870
I'm Brent and we'll see you next time on AB testing.
