1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,390
Hello again.

2
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,390
Howdy, I'm Alan.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,390
I'm Brent.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,430
Another episode of AB testing.

5
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:20,990
Another principle being knocked off, episode number 84, principle number 83.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,710
No, no.

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:29,970
Yeah, we greatly expanded the principles between last time and this time.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,590
There are now 83 principles.

9
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:37,670
No, principle number three, as those of you who are just catching up, maybe it's your

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,630
first episode, AB testing is a podcast.

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:46,510
If it is your first episode, please stop and go back to episode number 60.

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,010
You've missed a lot.

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,710
But if it is your first, thank you.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,510
The context of previous episodes will help.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:03,430
But we are a podcast about software testing, software quality, agile, process improvement,

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:09,350
leadership, random topics including squirrels with hats and things like that.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:15,390
And most recently, over the past over a year now, maybe longer, I don't know when we first

18
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,950
started talking about modern testing.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,950
We've mentioned the word for a while, but we've been talking in depth about something

20
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:24,270
we've been calling modern testing for quite a while now.

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,030
Yeah, we've been talking about it for a long time.

22
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,110
I think it is about a year where we capitalized the letters.

23
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:37,910
We were talking about it for a while when I submitted a talk on modern testing to Test

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,910
Bash Brighton.

25
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,040
Anyway.

26
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,480
Yeah, I think in terms of the numbers.

27
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm so prepared with my facts.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
As usual, I'm sure.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,820
I could be a speechwriter for Donald Trump, where facts don't matter.

30
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,820
So back on track, we've been talking recently about modern testing principles.

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,300
We wrote seven of them.

32
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:05,980
They're still a work in progress, but they've actually remained static for the last several

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
months.

34
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,460
It's a pretty good sign.

35
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,330
You can read them on moderntesting.org.

36
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,490
And today we're going to talk about the third modern testing principle.

37
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:22,010
But before that, let's take a moment to see what's going on in the world of Alan and

38
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,290
Brent.

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,490
It's part of our pitter patter fast forward like five minutes if you don't like this

40
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,490
part.

41
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,490
What's new, Brent?

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,400
Are you surviving review season at Microsoft?

43
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,300
It's almost over.

44
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,860
But yeah, I'm surviving.

45
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,420
I will probably be sacrificing another weekend to close it out.

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,940
So at Unity, of course, we don't have that heavyweight blood pressure inducing ego driven

47
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,660
review process.

48
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,060
Three times a year, we have a discussion where we have we asked three questions.

49
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,700
Why is your mission at Unity important?

50
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,380
What are you doing to accomplish that mission?

51
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,380
And how are you doing?

52
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,410
And you told me.

53
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,530
About a quarter of the way through.

54
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:14,260
It is such good conversations and little prep involved, a little prep, but just a little

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,860
prep and nobody on either side has their blood pressure go up.

56
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,860
It's great.

57
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,860
I love it.

58
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,380
You've mentioned this before, but the one thing that you shared with me off air was that there's

59
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,780
no written component to this.

60
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
Yeah, we don't.

61
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Yeah.

62
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,940
Oh, so literally when you say conversation, it literally is a conversation.

63
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,940
It's a focused reflective conversation.

64
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,190
I love it.

65
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,270
Yeah, it's pretty great.

66
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,590
But I take notes.

67
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,790
So I mean, they're just for me.

68
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,510
Because my job as a manager, of course, is to help them be successful.

69
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,190
In fact, after those three questions, the question I always ask is, what can I do as

70
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,030
a manager to help you be successful in your mission?

71
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,950
What can I start doing, stop doing, continue doing those sorts of things.

72
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,190
And I'll take lots of notes there.

73
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,260
And that helps me throughout the year.

74
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,780
Until we have that conversation again.

75
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,340
And things change direction, mission can change, but it helps me do a better job.

76
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,500
I really like that aspect.

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,700
So there's a language that rolls around with my team.

78
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,540
I'm not, I'm pretty sure I've shared this before.

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,380
I am not their manager.

80
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,460
I am their MSP.

81
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,460
I am their management service provider.

82
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,060
Which means they are my customer more than they are my employees.

83
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,220
And so, yeah, I'm really interested.

84
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
How can I help you succeed?

85
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,020
How do I support that?

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,460
So are you aware of the concept of servant leadership?

87
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,460
Yep.

88
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,460
So tell us very much like that.

89
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,900
I'm a big fan of that.

90
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,260
And Simon Sinek for a plug has a great book called Leaders Eat Last, which talks a lot

91
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,260
about that.

92
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,620
That's very much my view.

93
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
Yeah.

94
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,700
Yesterday, as an example, we had a, my team had a morale event.

95
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,420
It's one of those escape room things.

96
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,660
Have you ever done that?

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
Oh yeah.

98
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,660
I've done a couple of them.

99
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
Yep.

100
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:18,090
I still have not because there was a logistic error and we thought we had three rooms scheduled

101
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,650
we only had two.

102
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,090
And I'm like, yeah, I want the ICs to go.

103
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:28,810
My manager was like, but I'm like, no, there's only eight people.

104
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:29,810
They go.

105
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,890
Did you go to the one right down here?

106
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:31,890
In Redmond.

107
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,890
Okay.

108
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,450
There's one, there's literally one walking distance from here.

109
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,690
No, we didn't go to that one.

110
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,690
I've been to that one.

111
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,180
Of course, people listening going walking distance.

112
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,180
What?

113
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,180
Shut up.

114
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
Tell me the damn principle.

115
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
Yeah.

116
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,180
I did one in San Francisco.

117
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,340
The one in San Francisco was elaborate.

118
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,260
We did it as almost my whole ads quality team.

119
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,660
So it was, it's made for a big group.

120
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,420
There were a lot of puzzles that could be solved independently and they, and they require

121
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,900
like people solving two different puzzles to share information.

122
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,340
It was, it was like two, two plus hours with 12 or maybe 12 or more of us.

123
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,940
It was pretty, it was, it was a ton of fun.

124
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,020
They, we didn't, they gave us a little extra time, but we got it done.

125
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,020
Yeah.

126
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,020
No.

127
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,020
So I was actually really looking forward to it.

128
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,660
I mean, I knew it was going to be something that I would have to wait for a more relevant

129
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,460
to be able to go to it.

130
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,780
And now it seems like I'm probably going to have to change teams if I ever wanted.

131
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,950
Well, you and I can go.

132
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,950
Sure.

133
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,950
If you're going to do something with unity in your team, invite me along.

134
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,390
I'll be happy to join.

135
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,390
Okay.

136
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,830
And so the other thing, uh, what about you?

137
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,830
What's new?

138
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,430
I'm a little tired.

139
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,190
I woke up at two 45 this morning.

140
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,190
Okay.

141
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:53,310
To take my kid to the airport, uh, for like a five 30 flight.

142
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,990
He is going with his eighth grade class, just finished two days ago to DC in New York for

143
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,990
a week.

144
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,990
Nice.

145
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,230
And then I came home, slept a little bit, went to the gym, came home, showered, came

146
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,230
here.

147
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,150
So I'm, I'm a little bit of fumes here, but, uh, everything else is going great.

148
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,150
What's the occasion?

149
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,720
Um, eighth grade trip.

150
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Is there no point to it?

151
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,360
Just, Hey, eighth grade, let's go to DC.

152
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
No, no, no.

153
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,040
It's a massively educational trip.

154
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,320
They are packed from morning to night with, uh, all over DC for two days, then all over

155
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,560
New York for three days.

156
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,240
And then, uh, New York city, New York city.

157
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Cool.

158
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,800
So they're going to have a good time.

159
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,280
He's looking forward to the view from the top of the empire state building, which I've

160
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
done before.

161
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,630
It's a long way down.

162
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,630
It's pretty cool.

163
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,630
Yeah.

164
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,150
I've done the view from the bottom of it.

165
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,150
Oh, great.

166
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,700
That's a long way up.

167
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Yeah.

168
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
All right.

169
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,460
Well, uh, anything else before we get started?

170
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,820
Where in the world is the weasel?

171
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,860
Like we both, we both did the, uh, Oh yeah.

172
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,780
I am doing a virtual weasel now.

173
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,380
I'm as I've mentioned many times before, I'm trying to cut way down on the, at least

174
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,980
the travel I do for conferences.

175
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,170
I'm still doing star.

176
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,530
I have some gripes about that.

177
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,930
I'll share offline, but I'm doing star and at very beginning of October and then PNSQC,

178
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:15,090
which I'm really looking forward to, uh, doing an invited talk there on modern testing.

179
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,090
Nice.

180
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,490
It'll be a definite huge evolution or a large evolution from what I gave it.

181
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:24,650
Test Bash Brighton, but something along those lines.

182
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,410
And then I'm doing virtual world.

183
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,810
I did two, uh, webinars Wednesday, one for the online test conference, one for the test

184
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,810
automation guild.

185
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,530
I'll be doing another webinar with perfecto mobile on Monday, which you'll probably

186
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:42,480
hear about, which probably over by the time this episode comes out, uh, on continuous testing,

187
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,120
which overlaps with our pro with our, our discussion today.

188
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,440
And then I just, uh, got booked this week.

189
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,720
I'm way, way, way excited, especially relevant to AB testing listeners.

190
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,520
Uh, administrative test has invited me to give an AMA and ask me anything about modern

191
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,920
testing eight o'clock UK time.

192
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,400
That's noon here on the, uh, on the West coast.

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:11,720
So at a time when most of our listeners can probably check it out live and ask questions

194
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,550
and it is on July 10th, just like I said, I'll put a link to it in the show notes.

195
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,350
There'll be a link to it on my blog.

196
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,630
You can find that on Twitter, all kinds of ways to discover it should be a ton of fun.

197
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,070
Here's what we should do.

198
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:31,430
I will do the AMA and what happens on these things is a ton of questions come in that

199
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,000
you can't get to.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,280
We could probably shove a couple of mail bag episodes full of those overflow questions.

201
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Uh, yeah.

202
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,760
Why don't you just, Hey, we can continue the conversation, blah, blah, blah.

203
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,400
Join the slack channel mail bag channel.

204
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah.

205
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Right.

206
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,480
Or I'll just, yeah, just, or listen to the podcast and I will, and I will just take

207
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,280
all of those, anything we don't get to, I will take as a mail bag fodder.

208
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,280
We have right now we have a queue on the mail bag.

209
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,830
I think we're like 10, 15 questions behind.

210
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,980
We are not, we are not that many behind.

211
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,300
We have a question around ethics.

212
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,740
We have like, well, I thought we'll have like one other question.

213
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
No, I don't know.

214
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,070
Well, then there's one in my email inbox that I haven't bothered to bring out yet.

215
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,350
So maybe, maybe next episode, we should, we should catch up on the, yeah, at some

216
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,710
point we should do a mail bag episode and then we can continue trucking on the principles.

217
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,710
Oh, and I've recorded a new mail bag sound.

218
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,910
One of the things people didn't realize is when I do the mail bag thing, it's

219
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:43,150
live every time that I go add some reverb while I'm editing and I got tired of doing

220
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,150
that.

221
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,430
So I just made one mail bag sound, a little bit of harmony, just a tiny bit of

222
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,150
reverb, not as obnoxious, but I will never have to sing that in front of Brent

223
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,150
again.

224
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,030
So that's the good part.

225
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,990
And that's, we should probably get going.

226
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,990
It's caught up on the news.

227
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,310
I'm sorry if you fast forward to five minutes and I'm still talking about BSC don't

228
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,690
care about, but let's dive into modern test

229
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,090
testing principle number three.

230
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,050
If that's okay, Brent says not yet.

231
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,050
Not yet.

232
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,130
So there's one thing.

233
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,130
So earlier this week, earlier this week, Alan and I were on a panel for the online

234
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,130
test conference.

235
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,130
Right.

236
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,130
I mentioned that a minute ago.

237
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,130
Yeah.

238
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:20,630
And so the one thing that I found fascinating.

239
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,170
So Joel gave me the data beforehand and there's one.

240
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,890
That's Joel from practice test, the host of the online test conference.

241
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,690
There's one thing that I actually found interesting.

242
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,490
Where, so I did some, some very lightweight data science.

243
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,050
I looked at the, one of the questions were, are you concerned about your job

244
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,050
stability?

245
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:50,690
And one of the things that I found very fascinating was essentially there's

246
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:58,310
evidence in the data that, that those folks that are sort of snapping to, I

247
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,290
won't say necessarily modern testing.

248
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,450
We don't actually care if you follow modern testing.

249
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,650
If you, if you pick up the same principle and you think you're following lean,

250
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,850
great. That's fine.

251
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,290
But those POVs or those point of views that were more aligned with modern

252
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,290
testing, they weren't concerned about the job security.

253
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,330
Those that were more traditionalist were very concerned about the job

254
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:30,090
security. So one thing I take away from that is our work here that we're

255
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:36,800
trying to do, the more that we can get people to see that there is this other

256
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,520
way forward, the less anxious potentially they become.

257
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,400
I think so. And one of the reasons I'll continue our tangent here, maybe it's not

258
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,170
a tangent. I am really enjoying talking about modern testing at these

259
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,450
conferences and bringing it up because there are people who are scared.

260
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,610
We can't, I don't want to do that.

261
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,850
And there are people that go, I want to do that.

262
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,490
And a surprising number of people who are saying, yeah, I'm doing that.

263
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,290
And it's like, whoa, this is really cool.

264
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,410
I wanted to share something, a private conversation that I had on Slack on our

265
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,930
one of the three dot slack dot com channel.

266
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:19,450
If you go to anger weasel dot com, whack AB testing, you can find a link to

267
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:23,370
join yourself, but I'm going to abbreviate and Michael, I apologize.

268
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,050
I didn't ask for permission, but I'm probably violating all of GDPR.

269
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,730
I will paraphrase here.

270
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,530
It says their engineering team is adapting to work in a way that is aligned

271
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:34,010
with the modern testing principles.

272
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,050
We're doing some of it already, just kind of naturally, but the head of

273
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,450
engineering has told the department to get on with it now as testers.

274
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,970
We've been pushing it since your talk at test bash this year and a few

275
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,410
minutes I'm showing your talk to the whole department.

276
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,230
So that I, wow, it's pretty cool.

277
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,070
I said exactly that font.

278
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,310
It says the video went down pretty well.

279
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,870
One of the leaders just said, this just sounds like common sense.

280
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,510
It should just be engineering principles, which we should probably address.

281
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,030
But I think that's great.

282
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,030
You know what?

283
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,030
It should be.

284
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,270
They're going to monitor the uptake of things, do some more pairing and

285
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,910
told them to stay in touch and we'll, uh, and we'll see what happens.

286
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,910
But that's, that's so exciting to hear.

287
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,510
Yeah.

288
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:25,190
No, uh, uh, hey, if, if, if we're somehow being the last spark of

289
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:30,630
credibility, that it's getting leaders to, you know, flip the switch.

290
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,190
Fantastic.

291
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,420
That yeah.

292
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,340
Anyway, yeah, let's go.

293
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,380
Shall we go modern testing principle number three, if you haven't

294
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,860
memorized it already, it says this.

295
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,690
We are a force for continuous improvement, helping the team adapt and

296
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:55,210
optimize in order to succeed rather than providing a safety net to catch failures.

297
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,970
There's a lot in there.

298
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:57,810
There is.

299
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,770
Where do you want to start brand?

300
00:14:58,770 --> 00:14:59,730
What does that mean?

301
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,090
So we're going to talk about not the what, but also the why and the

302
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,690
how, if we are, if we're lucky.

303
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,130
If we do, if we do it.

304
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:07,690
All right.

305
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,370
All right.

306
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,330
So I am going to take it on from the reverse of the principles.

307
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:25,110
Well, so what this says is to me, we are going to favor continuously, uh,

308
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:31,790
improving and adapting above a safety net prevention model.

309
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,770
And, and actually I realized I said that very agile manifestly.

310
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,890
I don't actually think it's even a favor.

311
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,130
Like my preference would be thou shalt kill thine safety net.

312
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,570
Right.

313
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,930
That that's how I simplify it.

314
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,850
The way I put it, we talked a little bit about this, uh, before we, uh,

315
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,090
press the record button, but this ties to the last principle.

316
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,970
A safety net is a great example of a bottleneck.

317
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,530
For sure.

318
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,800
Uh, and it also doesn't allow it's, it talks, it builds that co-dependency.

319
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,600
We've talked about where like, please, here's my code.

320
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,720
Please find my bugs.

321
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,640
Oh, here's, here are some bugs.

322
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,040
So thank you for finding my bugs.

323
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,480
Everybody feels validated.

324
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,560
But in the meantime, the customer is going, where's my damn software?

325
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,220
There was something I was reading.

326
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,360
It was a comment chain around something we've done in modern testing.

327
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,440
I don't remember what it was.

328
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,840
Maybe it was Twitter, maybe it was Slack, but the comment that I'm just sick of is.

329
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,310
Well, you know, Dev doesn't want to do test.

330
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,310
Yeah.

331
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,590
Oh yeah.

332
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:45,150
And I'm just like, and, and right.

333
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,550
It's it's, um, Oh, I remember, I remember where it was now.

334
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,230
And one of the things I found, I, I did like one thing that's unique about

335
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,830
tests, like, and we shouldn't go too far into this, the safety net here.

336
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:06,320
But one of the things that's unique about tests is, is, uh, how many other

337
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,960
software engineering roles are you aware of where leaders in the discipline

338
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,280
stand up and say, Oh, we're validated because another discipline doesn't

339
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,520
want to do this job.

340
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,800
What the hell is that?

341
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,480
Right.

342
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,680
That's that's, that's, that's not a declaration of value.

343
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,240
It's not a declaration of, uh, return.

344
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:39,930
It's it's, um, I, again, I think of your, your, uh, elephant slides or the parade

345
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,810
slides, it's not a good way to go.

346
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,530
It doesn't define the discipline in a positive way.

347
00:17:48,130 --> 00:18:01,330
The safety net aspect, um, in the, the dysfunctional enablement loop, um, is

348
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,740
bad for multiple reasons.

349
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,740
Uh, as, as Alan called out, it's, it creates a bottleneck.

350
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,500
We want to be against bottlenecks.

351
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,620
The second thing is there's, there's a lot of new techniques out.

352
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,520
And if we're trying to finally move quality upstream, right?

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,720
We're not in the coaching principle, but you know, um, like all good set of

354
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,840
principles, they build off of each other.

355
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:35,520
Um, if we're going to get quality upstream, we have to retrain our developers to

356
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,360
succeed without the safety net.

357
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,200
And that is in essence, what I view this principle.

358
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,140
It's, it's not about getting it right the first time.

359
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,380
It's about getting the learnings right on the first mistake.

360
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,340
Yes.

361
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,380
Yes.

362
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,340
Don't be so afraid of making mistakes.

363
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,500
Don't yeah, I get that.

364
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,540
Um, I've been thinking about this principle and then overall, something

365
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,020
I shared with you, I've been thinking a lot about what it means to improve

366
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,540
a quality culture, which we'll get to in a, in a later, uh, principle, but

367
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,420
something that aligns here, I was thinking about that.

368
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,980
And then I, I, I tweeted this, this week, which was sadly too many people

369
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,780
in teams think quality is limited to testing.

370
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:26,140
And that ties in here, I think pretty well, because we need to train and help

371
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,820
our developers do better testing.

372
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:32,380
That doesn't eliminate our job because there's a lot more to quality, uh,

373
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,020
then simple functional verification.

374
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:46,060
Uh, internally, uh, one of the things that I have found very helpful is,

375
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,420
um, is the language around code correctness versus quality.

376
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:59,200
And so when I, when I talk to devs, I mean, it it's look dude, code correctness.

377
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,260
Uh, I'm, I'm here to help coach you through it, but you own code correctness.

378
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,990
You own it a hundred percent, right?

379
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,870
I'll, I'll, I'll help you brainstorm.

380
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:11,910
I'll help you think through it.

381
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:12,350
I'll help.

382
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,670
I'll introduce you to tools.

383
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,670
I may even bootstrap you in a certain direction, but

384
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,950
code correctness is what you own.

385
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,290
And, um, we all own quality.

386
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:30,250
And so I try to weave a conversation in a way that makes it very clear that in

387
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,090
this man's humble opinion, code correctness and quality are entirely different things.

388
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,890
And that generally works well.

389
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,330
And it feeds into the conversation.

390
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,970
Well, wait a minute.

391
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,450
What's quality then?

392
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,170
Subject to point of view of the customer rate.

393
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:43,810
We've had this.

394
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:52,080
I have found that taking, taking that belief and taking it on and decom, uh, what

395
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,380
would be the de-overloading, the overloading the term helps the conversation move forward.

396
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,780
Let me do a one last comment on that.

397
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,500
I want to dig into a few more details on continuous improvement.

398
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,160
We're a little bit in by design, the principles compliment and overlap each other.

399
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,640
For sure.

400
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,080
Uh, this one's a little bit more in how we coach the team, but I want to share a

401
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,040
conversation I had just recently around training developers or helping developers

402
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,000
become better testers.

403
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,680
I was talking to a dev lead who is very much new to unity, new to, uh, new to, new

404
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,600
to Alan is subtle, modern testing pushes, uh, subtle.

405
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Uh, I can be subtle.

406
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,470
Uh, he was very much in the camp that developers can't test their own code.

407
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,080
Oh my God.

408
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,040
So they're, they're, they're too biased.

409
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,880
And my, my answer was my initial answer was, eh, yeah, probably initially goes, well,

410
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,040
they can only make sure it works.

411
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:55,240
I can.

412
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:59,320
Yeah, initially, but you know, I've probably taught 50 developers, probably

413
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,440
closer to a hundred, uh, who started off that way.

414
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,520
I asked him a few questions I paired with them or, or whatever, and they could

415
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,080
learn that pretty quickly.

416
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,560
They could learn to think about the ways the code doesn't work.

417
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,880
They could learn to think about edge cases.

418
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,950
It's not that hard to train as typically happens.

419
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:25,950
I won, uh, because I think developers can do a very good job testing the, you need

420
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,150
to give them, this is going to tie back to what you're saying.

421
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,390
Let them, they have to try it and learn from their mistakes.

422
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:32,750
Yeah.

423
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,760
And continuous improvement is about not being afraid to make mistakes, but

424
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,120
embracing mistakes as a learning opportunity.

425
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:41,570
Yes.

426
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,010
Um,

427
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,130
and we don't do that enough.

428
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,170
Uh, and that's getting over that hump is so huge and going, yeah, let's,

429
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,490
let's get better at this.

430
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,650
So we talk about the safety net, right?

431
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:00,950
And, and literally when I, when I bring this up, um, right there, that here,

432
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,630
there's definitely a fear.

433
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:07,710
And this is where I think, uh, tests plays a good role.

434
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,870
They are the knowledge experts on testing generally in these type of teams.

435
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,510
Right.

436
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:20,380
What, what you just shared is that your, your dev expert, uh, your dev lead

437
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:27,540
or whatever this guy was, um, he expressed a belief that, you know, devs

438
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,700
can't test their own code.

439
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,140
They're not objective, blah, blah, blah.

440
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:30,940
Right.

441
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,540
That, um, that to me says first and foremost, this is the guy who

442
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,020
doesn't know TDD BDD.

443
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,900
And that would be the first place where I would start.

444
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,340
So safety net, right?

445
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,900
Where else do you see safety nets?

446
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,640
Circus and the circus and the tight, uh, the, uh, for example, the tight

447
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,960
rope walkers, okay.

448
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,040
Now, and so when I talk about a metaphor, you got to think about devs.

449
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Uh, when you're going through this transition, devs are used to having a safety

450
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,960
net, you know, they're up on the tight rope walker, they're doing cart wheels

451
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,920
and they're falling down all the time.

452
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:05,920
Right.

453
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:11,400
And what test has been doing is, is just building and building and building,

454
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,520
uh, even better, uh, safety net.

455
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,960
Um, and in, you know, every now and again, a tight rope walker falls, falls off,

456
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,680
injures themselves and it's not the tight rope walker, but it's blamed.

457
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,600
It's generally the, Hey, we had the safety net.

458
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,320
Why wasn't the safety net good enough?

459
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:32,840
Okay.

460
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,600
Now, what we're proposing is get rid of the safety net because really what's

461
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,640
happening is they're not gathering the skills.

462
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:48,030
So I have a patent for a, um, a test harness.

463
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:51,150
I did, uh, I built back in 1998.

464
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:53,590
I also have a useless patent.

465
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:56,350
My thing is actually still an operation.

466
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:00,470
Mine has probably been infringed upon a thousand times, but nobody cares.

467
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,030
Yeah, but I think mine too, but it doesn't matter.

468
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:11,460
But the, this, this automation framework, the way we designed it really made it

469
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:15,850
easy for automation to run and execute.

470
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,570
One of the key things about it is it's a harness that can execute any test case.

471
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:24,930
So if you are a dev team and you had, or back then it was a test team.

472
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,050
If you had a particular way you did your automation and another team did it a

473
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,010
particular way that they did their automation, this one could run them all

474
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,690
together as a singular suite.

475
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,000
It was also very componentized.

476
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,120
So it made it very friction free to do automation fast forward about, uh, 10

477
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,920
years.

478
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,880
And what we find is dev stopped using design patterns.

479
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,680
Dev stopped even doing code reviews.

480
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:56,000
What dev would do because the automation suite was so robust, they would

481
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,200
actually just check it in, let the automation suite run.

482
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,040
They would get a result back in like 30 minutes and then they would go and

483
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,880
figure out what they're trying to do.

484
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,360
Sounds like you built a safety net.

485
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,840
I built an automated safety net.

486
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,120
Yeah.

487
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,600
Right.

488
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:15,880
And so I didn't actually succeed in moving quality upstream and, and

489
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,680
making stronger code.

490
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:25,440
What I did is I made a system that allowed them to do whatever stupid

491
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,720
behaviors in your architecture that they wanted.

492
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,720
Now this is bad, uh, because sloppy architectures can't scale.

493
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,920
You can't add new features to code like this with an efficient timeline.

494
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,600
So what I'm suggesting when we get rid of the safety net, what keeping

495
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,000
the metaphor alive, if you get rid of the safety net, realize that part of

496
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,320
your job is to help influence and motivate folks to get better at

497
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,840
walking the tight rope.

498
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,480
Now they're going to be anxious.

499
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,360
So we're going to have to do the equivalent of, well, we're going to

500
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,400
have to retrain them how to walk this thing.

501
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,090
So to make sure that they have a minimal risk of getting harm, let's

502
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:19,010
lower the tight rope such that when they fall off, because eventually

503
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,130
they're going to, there's less consequence.

504
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:27,170
This is where the continuous improvement, stepping out of the metaphor,

505
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:32,410
this is where continuous improvement and adaptation, uh, come into play.

506
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,140
Right.

507
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:34,620
Yep.

508
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:35,740
A little bit.

509
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,220
I want to talk a little bit more about the safety net.

510
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,180
I do want to dive into just really dive deeply into what continuous

511
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,700
improvement is and why it's important.

512
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,620
Uh, and, and how we drive that, how we're a force, but your talk reminded

513
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,700
me of the headline that came out when Yahoo got rid of all their testers.

514
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,400
Uh, we talked about ways to move to unified engineering, both Brent and I

515
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,280
believe that a unified engineering team is by far the most optimal way to ship

516
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,520
almost all software made today, maybe all software made today.

517
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,880
Uh, but you can make that transition in a way that does not enable

518
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,920
your team for success.

519
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,240
Uh, this is a classic example of be careful ripping off the band-aid

520
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,640
because it may be a turn again, but the headline from that came out.

521
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,440
I, I've saved it and I use it in presentations once in a while is Yahoo's

522
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,360
engineers move to coding without a net subtitle.

523
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,080
What happens when you eliminate test and QA fewer errors and faster

524
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,000
developments, say Yahoo's tech leaders.

525
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,940
There's devil in the details, of course.

526
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,380
Right.

527
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,700
Uh, so what you're saying is they ripped the band-aid on that one.

528
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
They ripped the tourniquet.

529
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,840
They ripped the tourniquet.

530
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,100
Um, yeah.

531
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,620
The article goes on to say by, um, by just getting rid of the safety net

532
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,580
completely devs automatically decided how to be more careful.

533
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,980
Uh, they need some shocking.

534
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,100
Right.

535
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,540
And this is again, again, much like the safety net and the type rope, right.

536
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:10,850
If, if they know that they've been goofing off on the type rope and

537
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:14,050
so you take away the safety net, they go, whoa, whoa, whoa.

538
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,320
Right.

539
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,360
Now when I do a cartwheel, you know, nine times out of 10, I fall this time

540
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,640
on the, I'm going to severely injure myself.

541
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,920
And the challenge is continuing the metaphor is maybe they've either

542
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,480
forgotten or never learned the proper technique that would enable them not to

543
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,080
fall, they're going to need a tightrope walking coach, probably some extra

544
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,120
training just to help them at first to make sure that they can succeed

545
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,760
and not splat on the floor.

546
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:41,810
Right.

547
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,850
And then, um, on the continuous improvement, right.

548
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,090
It's, it's, it's not around.

549
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:53,790
We got to escape out of the metaphor, but this, this will be the last one I try.

550
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,950
Right.

551
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,750
How do we lower the rope?

552
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:06,840
Then how do we, how, so that the risk is lower and get them improving one step at

553
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,800
a time, like the way you get across the wire is one step at a time.

554
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:13,930
Right.

555
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:17,290
And that in my view is kind of how this continuous improvement is.

556
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,210
We're, we're down there.

557
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,290
The net's gone.

558
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:26,090
They take a step and we're like, Hey, your foot's not quite the right place.

559
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,210
Adjust that before you take your next step.

560
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:35,650
And as this, as this gets accustomed, as they are used to this becomes a new

561
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,200
muscle memory, they're not going to need you to do this right.

562
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,840
And now escaping out of the metaphor, continuous improvement.

563
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:47,750
To me, I think of, of, of Kaizen here.

564
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,430
Yeah.

565
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,110
And we're going to get into that in a minute.

566
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:51,430
All right.

567
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,870
But I just had a thought like I'm so sick of the word that the phrase shift left.

568
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,190
I think it's stupid.

569
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:56,710
I hate it.

570
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,350
Yeah.

571
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,950
Why left?

572
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,550
Why not right?

573
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,190
Why not up or down?

574
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,830
Could you quit fondling the microphone stand please?

575
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,030
Probably not.

576
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:03,470
Okay.

577
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,230
That's going to be great.

578
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,030
Sorry for that.

579
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:05,870
Good junk, good junk junk.

580
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,350
I'm waiting for the new, like, I see articles a year from now.

581
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,910
Help your dev team lower the rope.

582
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
Hashtag lower the rope.

583
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,480
Yeah.

584
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:15,760
Okay.

585
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,280
I will do, I'll talk about Kaizen.

586
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,360
Self-fulfilling hashtag there.

587
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,960
I think Kaizen is a topic we need to discuss today.

588
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,200
Yep.

589
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:30,120
But in the context of this question, sir, Brent, what is continuous improvement?

590
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,840
Um, I'll read you a definition.

591
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,760
No, it's like, it's improving continuously.

592
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:42,720
Yeah.

593
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,640
Read the definition.

594
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,720
I think you'll like it.

595
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,520
This is from the Institute of Quality Assurance news flash.

596
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:53,240
There's a thing called the Institute of Quality Insurance, which is probably like

597
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,000
two guys in a garage somewhere, but whatever.

598
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,660
Uh, they define continuous improvement as a gradual, never ending change, which is

599
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,860
focused on increasing the effectiveness and or efficiency of an organization to

600
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,980
fulfill its policy and objectives.

601
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:12,060
It is not limited to quality initiatives, improvement in business strategy, business

602
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,700
results, customer, employee, and supplier relationships can be subject to continual

603
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,260
improvement.

604
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,740
Then the, my favorite part is the last part.

605
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,900
I should just skip this right away.

606
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,140
Put simply, it means getting better all the time.

607
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,590
Yeah.

608
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,440
It's not a bad definition.

609
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,790
No, but all of the time, right?

610
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:36,750
This, this, this, this is, this is not every six months when we do the

611
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,470
two day post-mortem offsite.

612
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:38,670
Yeah.

613
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:41,790
Let's do a post-mortem and we'll make a big list of things that we're

614
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,710
probably not going to do.

615
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,550
That is not continuous improvement.

616
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,110
That's not even improvement.

617
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,660
Uh, there's some argument that there's an element of, uh, catharsis.

618
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:58,260
What I found in the old days, when we do those half day, full day, two day, uh,

619
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,740
post-mortems after a product, it was really just a nice venting session.

620
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:04,340
Yes.

621
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,540
And it was a nice venting.

622
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,060
People feel better, not get better.

623
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:09,700
Right.

624
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,340
Did we already talk about actionable versus vanity?

625
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,340
Uh, I'm sure we hit that last time.

626
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:15,940
Yeah.

627
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,660
Or, or in the deep dive on Brent talks to Alan about data.

628
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,540
Right.

629
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,220
That actually, that is when we did it.

630
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,780
So a continuous improvement.

631
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,440
Um, I'll tell a story here.

632
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,080
So when I first shifted to dev, I was a unified engineer.

633
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:35,720
Okay.

634
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,480
We started with scrum.

635
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:44,860
Um, this was at a time where I was not actually very familiar with, with agile.

636
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:51,570
Um, but we started with scrum and we made a tactical error.

637
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:58,940
We had come up with a scenario, um, that actually required us to pretty much

638
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,980
change pieces in our entire architecture stack.

639
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:07,930
And, uh, of course, just like with any scrum team, all the bugs got

640
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:13,270
introduced in the 11th hour and we came in the next day and found out.

641
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:20,090
Nothing integrated because we had person a working on one piece of the

642
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:23,010
refactor person B working on another piece of refactor.

643
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:29,240
So we had done this in a two week sprint and it literally took us two

644
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,780
months to unscrew ourselves.

645
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,760
And after we successfully did that, um, my team was like, Hey, uh, can we do

646
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,400
this Kanban thing you keep saying that we're going to do?

647
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,440
Cause I introduced scrum to them, uh, because I didn't think that they

648
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,480
were quite ready to go the Kanban.

649
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,800
But after that, they were like, all right, let's do Kanban.

650
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,560
This is stupid.

651
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,280
And most teams have a much larger transition to get there.

652
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,720
That's great.

653
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,460
Yeah.

654
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,940
So maybe that's it, you know, just completely abjectly fail, you know,

655
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,900
your first two sprints and scrum.

656
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:08,100
But isn't that improvement?

657
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,360
Uh, it was, uh, I kinda, you know, hindsight, 2020, I kind of wish it

658
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,920
hadn't cost me that two months of unscrewing myself.

659
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,160
That's a, that was a high price to pay.

660
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,340
But one of the things that we did once we started doing continuous flow,

661
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:34,460
got rid of, got, got rid of, um, the scrum model, one thing ended up happening.

662
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:41,900
So I had a team of seven at that time, uh, with enough, um, tickets on the board.

663
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,940
What I found is that every day someone on my team was releasing something.

664
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:48,360
Okay.

665
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Cause here it's not, it's not major releases once every two weeks.

666
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,080
It's no minor release, uh, every single day.

667
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:06,990
And guess what happened when we found that the whole, we came in the next day

668
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,670
and it happened, came in the next day and we found our whole system was on the floor.

669
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,910
Guess what happened?

670
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,990
You had to undo one change.

671
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,160
Yeah.

672
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,300
Took like 15 minutes.

673
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,900
We, we knew exactly the cause cause there was only one thing that went in yesterday,

674
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,060
which we could just readily revert.

675
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,460
Whereas the big integration story, we couldn't readily revert that.

676
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,950
Right.

677
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,810
Um, it was too many different changes all at once.

678
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,360
Um, it would be harder.

679
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:39,760
Yeah.

680
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,120
Yeah.

681
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,920
I think that that's clear to everyone.

682
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,040
And one of the things that I realized is our role as testers.

683
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,580
So remember this is, this was like the first few months of me being in a dev

684
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,560
role, having left test.

685
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,740
So I was still very focused on, on, um, my heart was still in test.

686
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,660
Um, and I'm like, Oh my God, check that out.

687
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:17,720
I way more efficiently reduce the risk by just moving to a continuous, uh,

688
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,490
integration model, right?

689
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,810
I didn't have to spend old school ways.

690
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:30,410
I wouldn't, I would have done, um, like in the scrum example here, I did, I

691
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,410
released it and everything was on the floor and it took me two months to fix it.

692
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,210
Okay.

693
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,050
The old school model, I would have still spent that two months,

694
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,970
perhaps even longer before the release.

695
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:40,980
Okay.

696
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:45,760
So even then the scrum model in my view was better because I knew exactly what

697
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,420
I needed to fix instantly.

698
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,980
I didn't have to deal with uncertainty, but then moving to a continuous

699
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:58,420
deployment model, I could do one small change at a time, make sure that

700
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,880
the system handles it.

701
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,620
And if it doesn't, the, I can revert it very rapidly from a test point of view.

702
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,430
Again, if our job is to reduce risks of the business, getting this

703
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,710
continuous improvement thing, uh, rolling is a key one.

704
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:15,150
Yep.

705
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:15,350
Yep.

706
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,430
You already went into a little bit of why, which is good.

707
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,230
I want to dive more of that in a minute, but I do want to talk about Kaizen

708
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,010
while we're on the subject.

709
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:27,070
I think you, I think as, uh, Embracers of the modern testing principles,

710
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,190
Embracers of continuous improvement, I think it's important to be at least

711
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,690
aware of the Japanese concept of Kaizen, which is one of the things

712
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,530
that comes out of lean, which is literally, I guess literally like make

713
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,690
better, but it, it, it's the Japanese word for improvement.

714
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,350
One of the things I like about Kaizen, which is probably important to mention

715
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:49,770
is it is not just about how do we improve the pipelines?

716
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,990
How do we improve everything?

717
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,350
It could be the way the, everything from the way people are treated to

718
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:58,350
the processes that go through, just looking for those every day, all the

719
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,150
time, looking for those small things that can be improved.

720
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,990
And because it's from lean, it's a big focus on reducing waste.

721
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:10,710
Waste can be, waste can be resources, waste could be time, waste can be, um,

722
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,230
actually overlaps a little bit with bottlenecks.

723
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,470
The continuous improvement has a lot to do with reducing bottlenecks.

724
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,350
Yeah.

725
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:23,590
But, um, so whenever I get in a conversation, when I'm, when I'm

726
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,290
onboarding a new set of people to an agile process and we start talking

727
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,750
about Kaizen, we start talking about waste.

728
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,910
Right.

729
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,670
Um, it's inevitable that I'll have a efficiency versus productivity conversation.

730
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:41,950
So for example, when, when, uh, one of the key principles in Kanban is limit whip.

731
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:42,550
Mm-hmm.

732
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,680
And that seems like you're encouraging waste.

733
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,000
Right.

734
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,760
If I say, Hey, you know what, there can only be one ticket out on a board.

735
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,080
That means Alan, you're idle.

736
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:55,590
Right.

737
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:59,070
There's this belief that, wait, I'm not being efficiently utilized.

738
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,450
Therefore there is waste.

739
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,610
And so when you sit, continuous improvement, right?

740
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:07,850
The other thing to keep in mind is that there's a goal.

741
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,460
And then the goal is going to be different based on the context.

742
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,420
Right.

743
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:18,460
But in order to improve, you have to have something that you measure and you're

744
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,500
going, did that work better or not?

745
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,880
In this particular case, it's, uh, it's probably going to be for most of our

746
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,000
listeners, it's going to be an element of productivity, uh, because it is our

747
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,800
job to accelerate and, you know, productivity is a better measure of that

748
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,420
than efficiency, and it's going to be about quality, right?

749
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,640
Not co-correctness, but quality.

750
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,560
Uh, are, are we helping to attract and hit the customers that we're going after?

751
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:47,840
Yeah.

752
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,400
This ties directly back to accelerate the achievement of shippable quality.

753
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,840
Amen.

754
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,320
Amen, brother.

755
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,980
We spent a lot of time trying to figure out what, where do we improve next?

756
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,020
What's the next thing we improve?

757
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,780
How much do we improve it?

758
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,190
How much, you know, what boy really ties back into that bottleneck one from last

759
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:14,570
time, but before we go any farther, this is very DevOpsy, leanish agile.

760
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:19,010
Why is this, why is it important to call this out as a modern testing principle and

761
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,710
not just common sense engineering principle or agile principle?

762
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,110
What, why is it part of the modern testing principles?

763
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,740
There are several agile principles.

764
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,380
Um, I think this is important.

765
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,540
There's several agile principles that just make sense.

766
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,740
Like, um, what you were saying earlier, they, this is just a common

767
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,940
sense engineering principle.

768
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:50,250
This one, I would say we call out because, uh, it's a critical process

769
00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:57,890
change in, in, in our opinion, that's directly related to the goal of testing.

770
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,280
The goal of quality.

771
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,360
They, right.

772
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:06,950
There, there are this principle while it sounds like an engineering principle.

773
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,280
Uh, and it's because it is.

774
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:17,680
Um, if, if you, if you are helping to lead and push and drive towards, uh,

775
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,080
a modern testing environment in your workplace, this one's important.

776
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:31,040
Getting this lit up improves quality and reduces risk for almost no cost.

777
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,370
I have a, yes, I agree with everything, but I have a slightly different take

778
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:38,290
on why this is a modern testing.

779
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,690
I think it ties back to it.

780
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:44,370
Although we've said before worth mentioning again, that, uh, there

781
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,170
isn't really a modern tester role.

782
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:53,340
Uh, there can be a, uh, someone driving these modern testing principles on the

783
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:57,940
team, because probably most of the people listening to this podcast are in or

784
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,260
have been in test roles.

785
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,620
Uh, you can relate.

786
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:09,240
But I, I, uh, I think this one's important and it's been so, it's been so long.

787
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,560
I think if I remember right, I drafted these and then we iterated the crap out of

788
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,200
it, or this was part of the original or not.

789
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:22,640
But anyway, getting to my point testers, I think are not uniquely, but well

790
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,480
suited, very well suited to drive continuous improvement for a couple of reasons.

791
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,000
Uh, two main reasons.

792
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,560
One here, you mean from a leadership standpoint.

793
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,640
So one is that our job is to see the system as a whole.

794
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,120
Yes.

795
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,520
That system thinking that because we do that, we can often find where

796
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,880
improvement needs to happen faster than anyone else on the team.

797
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,600
I think we're, because of our background, because of what we've done,

798
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,200
we're very good at doing that.

799
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:54,360
One of the things I ask my team to do, it's worth mentioning, uh, is that I

800
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,560
have not like plastered my team with the modern testing principles and said,

801
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,960
we're going to do these.

802
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:05,520
Uh, some of my, some of my team listens to this podcast and they, you know,

803
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,660
they follow along, uh, but I mainly just try and drive improvement.

804
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,620
And of course, uh, I follow modern testing principles as part of what I

805
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,060
do, so some of these things come out.

806
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,110
Uh, so rewinding the stack.

807
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,510
So I Brent's distracted me with his hyper legs.

808
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:24,510
Um, maybe he has to go to the bathroom.

809
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:25,390
I'm not sure.

810
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:27,790
Uh, one.

811
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,550
So we see, we're very good at seeing the big picture of the

812
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,110
things, how things fit together.

813
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:37,430
We're also very good at asking questions and often implying critical thinking.

814
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:42,230
So we can often figure out what it is we need to do to improve or what the

815
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:47,110
root cause is that we need to improve in order to make things happen.

816
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,430
So I think those things drive it very well.

817
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:53,310
And then you might want to add to that, but that's going to tie into the

818
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,710
how I want to get into, uh, how do we drive continuous improvement?

819
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,350
And I've found my experiences and I'm curious to hear yours as well, Brent,

820
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:08,510
that testers are very well suited often, even above a product or program or a

821
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,510
project manager role to drive things like the retrospective that I think are

822
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,150
one of the key things that drive continuous improvement.

823
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:22,890
My experience on this front is again, from, um, a unified engineering model.

824
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:31,240
Um, uh, since becoming a believer in this, I have not actually been

825
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,960
a part of separate disciplines.

826
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:42,340
I will say that, uh, when I did unified engineering, right again, uh,

827
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:43,740
I've mentioned this before.

828
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:49,580
I had a good split people who came from dev people who came from test.

829
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:56,860
Um, and over time, uh, it was my, my former testers that ended up being

830
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:07,740
the better developers because they, they had the training to think about how

831
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:08,940
do I write the code?

832
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,260
How do I validate it?

833
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:15,340
And most importantly, how do I make sure I'm not wasting my time?

834
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,100
This is where the customer validation part comes into play.

835
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,640
No one, no one wants to spend their time.

836
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,960
We've talked about the pink principles.

837
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,680
Um, no one wants to spend their time doing activity.

838
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,000
They want their effort, their time to contribute to something larger.

839
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,060
Right.

840
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:40,740
So one of the biggest things that continuous improvement as an example,

841
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:46,980
a retrospective going with a Kanban board, um, it creates visibility where

842
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,340
visibility wasn't there before.

843
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:55,180
And visibility is coming in and small enough chunks where it makes everyone

844
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:02,260
have a non theoretical, um, concrete conversation about, Hey, this is

845
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,940
something that's actually hurting us.

846
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,140
God, does anyone disagree?

847
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,500
Now, how do we go about fixing it?

848
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,770
Um, to address your prior question.

849
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:19,660
Um, yeah, I would say from my experience, people in the test

850
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:27,290
world do pick up, you know, answering the end end questions better, uh, at, at

851
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:31,170
retrospectives and really retrospectives about asking the right questions.

852
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:34,570
And that's something that's very well suited for, for someone in this role.

853
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:37,930
Um, but even then it's ephemeral, right?

854
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:43,450
Because eventually, so when I did the unified engineering, yeah, I got a

855
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,930
lot from my ex, oh, I'm a specialist.

856
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,850
Oh, I can't test my own stuff.

857
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,690
I'm like, well, here's the deal.

858
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:57,160
Um, you're welcome to not test your stuff, I guess, and let's, let's see what happens.

859
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,800
But I'm, you know, no one's going to test it for you.

860
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:02,570
And you know what?

861
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:07,330
Just takes a couple of mistakes and they realize, you know what?

862
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:08,210
I need to learn this.

863
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:12,170
It didn't, it actually didn't take very long to get those other guys

864
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:18,970
aboard and realizing, so test has this problem of, you know, uh, we have this

865
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,850
fanciful, we're the defenders of the customer.

866
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:24,410
Dev has their own thing, right?

867
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,090
I'm a specialist.

868
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:32,010
Who is, um, and it doesn't take long where, where things are so visible that

869
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:35,370
that's just like, you can't hold onto that belief anymore.

870
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:40,280
And one thing, uh, worth bringing up here, it's got about five minutes left,

871
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:47,440
but, uh, as a force for continuous improvement, I've seen people fall into

872
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,880
the trap of trying to build a large, like test harness weeks of effort, maybe

873
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,440
months of effort to try and be a stopgap solution for something or to try and, you

874
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,760
know, really things to try and build a safety net versus help the team adapt

875
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:10,000
and optimize, uh, to me, adaptation, uh, works better when it's a shit ton of

876
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,320
tiny changes versus one big ass change.

877
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,720
You can get a boiled frogs.

878
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,120
There's lots of metaphors about this.

879
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:23,050
And also in a culture of experimentation, applying that to improvement where, uh,

880
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:27,850
do frequent retrospectives try and, and actually I'll talk about retrospectives

881
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,610
for just a minute.

882
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:34,170
I think, uh, many teams do retrospectives and they're, and they're a event session.

883
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,290
Some teams do them and make a big list of things they want to improve.

884
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:39,610
And none of them ever happened.

885
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:47,600
Uh, what I prefer and what I drive teams to do is do retrospectives as frequently

886
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:53,360
as you can handle, uh, minimum of once a week is what I, yeah, I, some of them

887
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,920
do too, I prefer once a week.

888
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:55,160
Yeah.

889
00:49:56,090 --> 00:50:00,730
Prioritize the top one, maybe two, three at the most things you want to

890
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:07,560
improve and assign an owner, assign someone to be responsible for, for figuring out

891
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,280
what the micro improvement is and implementing it and coming back to

892
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,360
report to see what happens.

893
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,400
Well, that didn't work.

894
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,600
We can, we can learn from that.

895
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,400
Try something else.

896
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,080
Um, I do something similar.

897
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,840
So every retrospective we do.

898
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,120
So I do two styles of retrospective.

899
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,080
One is, um, sort of a weekly retrospective.

900
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,160
And we have another one known as the starfish model that we do once a quarter.

901
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,800
The starfish model allows you to see sort of the long-term patterns, whereas

902
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,880
the weekly retrospective generally is very tactical.

903
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,240
Right.

904
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:49,260
But every retrospective ends with four bullets at minimum under two categories.

905
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,400
What are two things that we're going to celebrate?

906
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,970
Hey, this really worked well.

907
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,440
We very happy about this.

908
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:04,320
And what are two things we're going to change and change starting tomorrow?

909
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:06,260
Yeah, I like that.

910
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:10,540
And one thing I do, but didn't mention is you do celebrate, do you think about

911
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:14,380
the things you do well in addition to the improvements?

912
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,540
Well, it's important because you want to think about the whole system, right?

913
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,940
You don't want to change something because you see a negative impact and then,

914
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,140
and then neglect to think about it.

915
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,260
You don't want something to go away because you've neglected it.

916
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,660
You want to recognize that it's a good thing and keep it happening.

917
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,420
Right.

918
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:32,980
Besides retrospectives, what are some things, uh, we can do to some activities?

919
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,940
How else can we drive continuous improvement?

920
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:39,620
So you mentioned one thing that I'll, that I'll state, uh, continuous and

921
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,860
adaptive improvement is we haven't hit adaptation, I think enough in this

922
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:49,580
conversation, but, um, as you were talking about doing these small minor

923
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:56,140
changes, I actually even further recommend that you do it as vertical slices

924
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:57,340
through the whole architecture.

925
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,500
Right.

926
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:04,580
So a small vertical change through the whole architecture is better than, oh,

927
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,660
we're going to do one small release of this bit of the architecture.

928
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,660
One small piece of this bit of the architecture, because it's as essentially

929
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:20,050
whatever is the experiential component of your system, that often is where the

930
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:23,330
money is in terms of understanding, are you delivering quality?

931
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:24,690
Do you need to adapt?

932
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:30,610
So the, so there is this tendency a lot of the times to overspend on

933
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:31,290
architecture.

934
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:36,250
When I go through planning, I do planning in two month milestones and I

935
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:44,250
very specifically limit, I will spend no more than 30% of my funding on

936
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:50,660
architecture on just pure, we're going to, we're going to make the database faster.

937
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,420
We're going to refactor this thing.

938
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,380
Cause that doesn't help you adapt.

939
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:55,720
Right.

940
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,000
Sure.

941
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,760
You can argue, Oh, well, you know, two milliseconds is better than 10 milliseconds.

942
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,640
Sure.

943
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:02,120
Right.

944
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,320
But right.

945
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,600
But you know what?

946
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:08,520
Humans can't perceive less than a hundred milliseconds.

947
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,120
So why do I care?

948
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,120
Well, maybe mere mortals like you.

949
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,280
Sure.

950
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,880
So I think chunking in vertical slices is also a good way of

951
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,040
doing, uh, continuous, uh, integration.

952
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:22,640
Right.

953
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,040
We probably could do half an episode just diving into applying

954
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,240
vertical slices in different ways, but we're not, yeah, we're not even

955
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,440
talking about like how you set up your, your, your GitHub instance.

956
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,600
Cause there's another, you know, how you set up your project pipelines

957
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,160
also helps a great deal.

958
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:40,600
Yeah.

959
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,320
For sure.

960
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:41,800
For sure.

961
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,880
Oh, oh, here's one of my favorite ones on, on that particular one.

962
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,240
You create a, your master tree.

963
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:56,270
You let the business team, Hey, business team from here on out.

964
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:58,070
Do you have PMs at unity?

965
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:58,790
Yeah.

966
00:53:59,230 --> 00:53:59,510
Yeah.

967
00:53:59,590 --> 00:53:59,870
Okay.

968
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:07,400
So the PMs own telling the business team, what's the latest thing in master.

969
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,420
Okay.

970
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,840
And engineering has no say in when any build from master releases.

971
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,440
It's it's a pure business decision.

972
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:27,520
So what that means is if engineering pushes to master, it better be good

973
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,760
because business can release it whenever they want.

974
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,400
What that, and what that does is it, is it kind of forces on engineering.

975
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,000
Hey, I don't know when they're going to release this thing.

976
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:40,800
They can do anytime they want to.

977
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,640
I better make sure master is always clean.

978
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,160
Master is always RTM.

979
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,760
That sounds like the example of taking away a safety net.

980
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,770
It's taking away a safety net.

981
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:52,690
It's continuous improvement.

982
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,690
It's adaptation, but mostly taking away the safety net.

983
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:57,210
Yeah.

984
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:59,370
And the thing we're not going to be able to get into all the examples that

985
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,970
we're going to wrap up here, but there are literally hundreds, probably

986
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,570
thousands of ways they're all going to depend on context of ways to improve

987
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,770
the business as small, small, moving to smaller batch changes versus big

988
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,010
integration points, moving to trunk based development, moving, which is

989
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,450
similar to a model you're talking about.

990
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:23,420
Those are all changes that will optimize your, your team.

991
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,460
And like I said before, you can't just go, okay, we're, we've been

992
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:27,660
doing big branches tomorrow.

993
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,860
We're doing trunk based development.

994
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,580
One of the things we need to be able to do is figure out where we're going.

995
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,540
I want to go here.

996
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:38,340
What's what are the series of small steps I need to take to get there?

997
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,880
And that's super important and something probably worth elaborating on in the

998
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,680
future, but we're running close on time.

999
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,520
Do you have any final words for the day, Brent?

1000
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,640
None for the day.

1001
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:52,200
None for today.

1002
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,880
We'll catch the rest tomorrow or in two weeks when the next

1003
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,360
episode of AB testing comes out.

1004
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,800
Uh, one sec.

1005
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,080
Thank you for listening this far.

1006
00:55:59,080 --> 00:55:59,880
We appreciate it.

1007
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,360
I hope we, uh, were able to answer some questions and not answer more

1008
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,960
questions than we created regarding principle number three.

1009
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,800
That's always the goal of ours, but I don't know.

1010
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,720
I like the bag.

1011
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:11,720
I like to think it is.

1012
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,880
